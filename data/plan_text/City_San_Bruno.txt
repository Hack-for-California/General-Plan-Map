Francisco Peninsula. El Camino Real developed parallel
to the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks that linked the
“railroad suburbs” of San Mateo County to San Fran-
cisco, and continues to serve as an important north-
south route along the eastern side of the Peninsula. Traf-
fic volumes and speeds are high compared to surround-
ing roads. Current development consists of auto-related
uses, restaurants, mostly one-story commercial establish-
ments, and the Civic Center buildings.
With the construction of U.S. Highway 101, El Camino
Real lost much of its prominence. However, many of
the uses along the San Bruno stretch of El Camino
Real still serve regional and local shopping needs. The
scale and character of regional versus local uses along
El Camino Real is striking. The Shops at Tanforan and
Towne Center occupy enormous super-blocks, and are
set back from the street with peripheral surface park-
ing lots. Smaller-scale commercial uses line El Camino
Real south of San Bruno Avenue. These freestanding
buildings are typically one- or two-stories in height,
located along the street frontage, with small surface
parking lots to the side or rear of the lot. Freestanding
signs face traffic.

throughout the city and serve as geographical land-
marks along the northern San Francisco Peninsula. Par-
tial views of San Francisco Bay, the Oakland hills, and
Mount Diablo (in central Contra Costa County) can be
seen from high points along the western hills.
Due to its location along the ridge of the coastal range,
Skyline College features a truly magnificent vista point
offering views of the coast. The vista point looks west,
where rocky shoreline, sandy beaches, and the City of
Pacifica’s pier can be seen. Rolling green hills and rocky General Plan policies are intended to minimize impacts

Development opportunities are limited in the hilly
western portion of San Bruno. Thus, views of the hills
from the lowlands are less likely to change. However,
new development in the lowlands’ opportunity sites
will change the appearance of the urban fabric. Due to
the voter approval requirement on buildings of 50 feet
or three stories in height, the city will not appear much
taller, even though it may become slightly more dense.

 Table 4-8:  Intersection Improvements
       Intersection             Condition - Peak Hour Intersection Improvement
 A     San Mateo Ave/           GP Buildout - PM      Within the existing right-of-way, restripe the southbound Huntington Avenue approach from one left/through/right lane
       Huntington Ave                                 to one left turn lane and one through/right lane. This recommended intersection improvement would result in a delay of
                                                      9.3 seconds and a LOS D for the General Plan Buildout Condition PM peak hour. No right-of-way acquisition or utility
                                                      relocation would be anticipated.
 B     El Camino Real/Noor Ave  No Project - PM       The southbound El Camino Real left turn onto Noor Avenue is the critical movement at this intersection. Converting the
                                GP Buildout - PM      intersection from a one-way stop controlled to a signalized intersection would result in a V/C ratio of 0.56 and a LOS
                                                      A for both the No Project and General Plan Buildout Condition PM peak hour. The peak hour signal warrant is satisfied
                                                      under both Conditions. No right-of-way acquisition would be anticipated. A new signal may require movement of
                                                      utilities and street furniture, and would require restriping the intersection.
 C     Skyline Blvd and San     No Project - AM/PM    With restriping and minor right-of-way additions, the northbound Skyline Boulevard approach could be converted from
       Bruno Ave                GP Buildout - AM      one through lane and one right turn lane to one through lane and one through/right lane. The southbound Skyline
                                                      Boulevard approach could be converted from one through lane and one left turn lane to two through lanes and one left
                                                      turn lane. This intersection improvement would result in a maximum V/C ratio of 0.79 and a LOS C. The northbound
                                                      reconfiguration would require additional right-of-way to accommodate two receiving lanes, which could taper to
                                                      one lane downstream of the intersection. The southbound reconfiguration would require additional right of way to
                                                      accommodate the additional through lane and for two receiving lanes downstream. The two southbound receiving
                                                      lanes could taper to one lane downstream.
 D     Skyline Blvd and College GP Buildout - AM      With additional right-of-way and restriping, add one left turn lane to the northbound Skyline Boulevard approach
       Drive/Berkshire Dr                             for a total of two, and add one through lane to the southbound Skyline Boulevard approach, for a total of three.
                                                      This intersection improvement would result in a V/C ratio of 0.76 and a LOS C. Additional right-of-way, utility
                                                      relocation, and movement of traffic signals and other street furniture would be required to implement this intersection
                                                      improvements.
 E     Skyline Blvd and         No Project - AM       With additional right-of-way and restriping, add one through lane to the southbound Skyline Boulevard approach for
       Westborough Blvd/Sharp   GP Buildout - AM      a total of three. This intersection improvement would result in a maximum V/C ratio of 0.86 and a LOS D. Additional
       Park Rd                                        right-of-way and traffic signal relocation would be required to accommodate the extra through lane and extra
                                                      receiving lane downstream.
 F     Skyline Blvd and Sneath  No Project - AM/PM    Convert the eastbound and westbound approaches from split phasing to permitted control. This intersection
       Lane                     GP Buildout - AM/PM   improvement would result in a maximum V/C ratio of 0.84 and a LOS D. No additional right-of-way or utility relocation
                                                      would be required.
 G     Sneath and Sequoia Ave   GP Buildout - AM/PM   Convert the intersection from a three-way stop control to a permitted or protected signalized control. This intersection
                                                      improvement would result in a maximum V/C ratio of 0.76 and a LOS C. Restriping and installation of traffic signal
                                                      hardware would be required to implement this intersection improvement. No additional right-of-way would be required.
 H     El Camino Real/                                Permit southbound San Mateo Avenue traffic to turn south on El Camino Real and add pedestrian crossing at north leg
       San Mateo Ave.                                 of El Camino Real to create a pedestrian connection to Memory Lane.

Greenhouse Gases
Gases that that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere are
called greenhouse gases (GHGs). These gases play a criti-
cal role in determining the Earth’s surface temperature.
Part of the solar radiation that enters Earth’s atmo-
sphere from space is absorbed by the Earth’s surface.
The Earth reflects this radiation back toward space, but
GHGs absorb some of the radiation. As a result, radia-
tion that otherwise would have escaped back into space
is retained, resulting in a warming of the atmosphere.
Without natural GHGs, the Earth’s surface would be
about 61°F cooler (CCAT, 2006). This phenomenon is
known as the greenhouse effect. However, many scien-

Silt and debris in the storm drain system can sometimes
cause water to back up and flood surrounding areas.
Leaves, branches, household trash, and other debris

and repairs the municipal stormwater drainage system.
Much of the City’s storm drain infrastructure is aging
and needs to be replaced. Although adequate under aver-

Interpretation
          Normally          Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation
          Acceptable        requirements.
          Conditionally     New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation
          Acceptable        features included in the design.
          Normally          New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction
          Unacceptable      requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
          Clearly
          Unacceptable      New construction or development should not be undertaken.

1        Introduction
1.1       PURPOSE
In accordance with California Government Code (Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 3, Article 10.6), this
Housing Element, a component of San Bruno’s General Plan, presents a comprehensive set of
housing policies and actions to address identified housing needs. The State has required an up-
date of a jurisdiction’s housing element every five years. However, new State law has changed
the update requirement to an eight-year cycle for future housing elements if the current housing
element is adopted and certified by the January 31, 2015 deadline. Therefore, this Housing Ele-
ment spans eight years, from January 31, 2015, to January 31, 2023.
The Housing Element builds on an assessment of San Bruno’s housing needs (including the
City’s regional housing needs allocation) and an evaluation of existing housing programs, avail-
able land, and constraints on housing production. Initiatives proposed to facilitate ongoing provi-
sion of affordable and market-rate housing in the city include conservation of residential neigh-
borhoods, reuse of former school sites, redevelopment of transit corridors into mixed-use areas
with residential components, and reduction of parking standards for housing units along transit
corridors. All of these major initiatives are consistent with the adopted San Bruno 2025 General
Plan and recently adopted (2013) Transit Corridors Specific Plan (TCP).
1.2       ORGANIZATION
This Housing Element addresses all of the topics required by State law (Government Code sec-
tions 65583 through 65589.7). Specifically, the Element describes:
        population and employment trends (Chapter 2),
        households characteristics and housing stock characteristics (Chapter 2),
        existing assisted housing and potential risk of conversion to market rates (Chapter 2),
        special housing needs (Chapter 2),
        opportunities for energy conservation (Chapter 2),
        governmental and non-governmental constraints (Chapter 3),
        a detailed site inventory addressing availability and suitability for affordable housing de-
         velopment (Chapter 4),
        quantified objectives that estimate the maximum number of units, by income level, to be
         constructed, rehabilitated or conserved over the planning period (Chapter 4),
        detailed accomplishments during the last Housing Element cycle (Chapter 4 and Appen-
         dix A), and
        a new eight-year housing program with goals, programs, and implementation actions
         (Chapter 5).
                                                                                              1-1

1.3       SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE LAST CYCLE
Meeting the 2007-2014 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
During the last Housing Element cycle San Bruno made adequate sites available in order to
meet its RHNA, and a portion of the affordable housing need was also permitted and in many
cases constructed. The total production and permitting that occurred during the last cycle ex-
ceeded the RHNA for the moderate-income affordability level. Most of the affordable housing
production occurred in line with the opportunity identified for the former U.S. Navy Western Divi-
sion Site and Pacific Bay Vistas, as described in the last Housing Element. The affordable hous-
ing development on that site included:
        Acappella Apartments at the Crossing (SNK-1), approved in 2008, completed in 2011,
         and resulting in a total of 163 units with 83 low income rental units, 54 moderate-income
         rental units, and 26 above moderate income units;
        Grand Luxe Apartments at the Crossing (SNK-2), also approved in 2008, completed in
         2011, and resulting in a total of 187 units with 62 low income rental units, 73 moderate-
         income rental units, and 52 above moderate income units; and
        Pacific Bay Vistas apartments, approved in 2011, completed in 2014, and resulting in
         200 moderate-income rental units and 108 above moderate-income rental units.
It should be noted that none of these affordable units are deed-restricted affordable units. Chap-
ter 4: Sites Inventory and Analysis provides a more detailed summary of the housing production
accomplished under the last RHNA.
Removing Constraints
During the last Housing Element cycle San Bruno also made important progress in removing
identified governmental constraints to the production of affordable housing. Examples include:
        Amended the Zoning Ordinance to create a reasonable accommodation procedure to
         provide exceptions in zoning and land use for persons with disabilities.
        Amended the Zoning Ordinance to classify transitional and supportive housing as resi-
         dential care facilities, which are allowed by right in residential zones, in accordance with
         SB-2.
        Amended the Zoning Ordinance to implement state density bonus regulations in accord-
         ance with SB-1818.
        In addition, the Planning Commission and City Council held public meetings to review
         and receive public input on the proposed emergency shelter zoning. In response to resi-
         dent’s concerns, the City Council held a study session in February 2015 to consider al-
         ternative locations for emergency shelters. The City Council supported an alternative lo-
         cation in the M-1, Industrial Zone, in the northeast portion of the City. The City Council
         will consider adoption of an emergency shelter ordinance later in 2015.
        The City adopted the Transit Corridors Specific Plan (TCP) in 2013, which provides a
         framework for new mixed-use land use designations in the main transit corridors of the
1-2

                             City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                                         Chapter 1: Introduction
         city in order to promote a mix of residential and non-residential uses near transit and
         near one another.
        The City Council placed Measure N, the Economic Enhancement Initiative, on the No-
         vember 4, 2014 ballot to implement the Transit Corridors Plan by amending the Zoning
         Code to allow increased building heights, above-ground multi-story parking structures
         and increased residential density in the TCP area. Measure N passed by a two thirds
         majority. Measure N will facilitate development of multi-family housing along major com-
         mercial streets within about ½ mile of the new San Bruno Caltrain station.
Appendix A contains a program-by-program account of accomplishments of the last Housing El-
ement, as well as recommendations for keeping, modifying, or removing programs based on City
staff experience with implementation over the last 5 years. The evaluation was used as the basis
for the housing programs contained in this Element.
1.4       RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
A number of local and regional plans and programs relate to the Housing Element. Brief descrip-
tions of these plans and programs follow.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The San Bruno 2025 General Plan was adopted on March 24, 2009. This updated Housing Ele-
ment for 2015-2023 is fully consistent with the other elements in the San Bruno 2025 General
Plan, and in fact is designed as an integral step in the implementation of General Plan goals and
policies.
For instance, Chapter 3: Constraints on Housing describes the General Plan Land Use Designa-
tions, provides maps of both the General Plan land uses and existing zoning, and explains how
the designations work hand-in-hand with Housing Element programs such as Program 2-A (Up-
date the Zoning Ordinance to be consistent with the General Plan and Transit Corridors Plan) to
encourage new residential development that is close to services and transit. In another example,
Program 2-D (Reuse former school sites) contains a specific action to remind City staff to re-
quire the redevelopment of the Crestmoor school site to cluster housing in order to preserve the
open space on that site in accordance with General Plan policy OSR-8. In yet another example,
Program 2-J requires annual performance evaluations of the Housing Element programs in con-
junction with annual review of the General and describes how City staff will handle inconsisten-
cies identified in the future.
As these examples highlight, this Housing Element is carefully tuned to the policy priorities of the
General Plan, and whenever possible the programs provided herein refer to the General Plan
and other important guidance documents such as the Residential Design Guidelines and the
Transit Corridors Plan, when describing implementation. These examples and more in the com-
ing pages are the means by which General Plan consistency will be achieved and maintained
(Government Code Section 65583(c)(6)(B)).

Related Plans and Programs
Transit Corridors Specific Plan (TCP)
The San Bruno Transit Corridors Plan (TCP) was adopted on February 12, 2013 following exten-
sive public engagement, including the work of a 17-member Steering Committee and community
workshops. The TCP builds on the General Plan vision for mixed-use transit oriented develop-
ment in proximity to the new San Bruno Caltrain station and a revitalized downtown. The TCP
seeks to promote economic development and private investment while implementing measures
to transition new projects into the existing City. The majority of new residential development in
San Bruno will likely occur in the TCP area during the housing element cycle, with plans for up to
1,610 new units.
The approximately 155-acre TCP area includes San Bruno’s principal streets of El Camino Real,
San Bruno Avenue, Huntington Avenue, and San Mateo Avenue within about one half mile of the
new San Bruno Avenue Caltrain station. The TCP vision and development framework were
crafted during two community workshops. The TCP development standards and design guide-
lines were refined in response public comments about the impacts of new projects on existing
low-density residential uses. To minimize these potential impacts, “Mixed-use to Residential
Transition Measures” were included in the adopted plan.
Urban Water Management Plan
San Bruno adopted the 2011 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) in accordance with the
requirements of the California Urban Water Management Act. San Bruno receives water from
three supply sources: wholesale surface water from SFPUC, retail surface water purchased from
the North Coast County Water District, and local groundwater from the South Westside Ground-
water Basin. San Bruno owns and operates a water utility that supplies approximately 50% of
water needs annually to the homes and businesses in San Bruno. The primary infrastructure
constraint for new housing in San Bruno is related to the availability of water.
The UWMP estimated future water demand using population and employment projections from
the General Plan including growth attributable to the Transit Corridors Plan. The UWMP quanti-
fies projected water demands to the year 2035, and the existing and planned sources of water
available to the city to meet those demands. San Bruno has a contracted water allotment with
the SFPUC, but has the ability to purchase additional required supply as a result of other cus-
tomers not using their full contractual supply. In recent years, San Bruno has purchased less
than the contractually allowed amount of water from SFPUC, largely due to successful water
conservation efforts and the implementation of the City’s recycled water project. Based on
SFPUC and City projections of future potable water demands, San Bruno is not expected to ex-
ceed its available water supply by 2035.
Planned Development Area (PDA)
The City’s TCP Area is designated as a Priority Development Area (PDA) under the ABAG
FOCUS program. The types of development envisioned in the TCP will contribute to the regional
strategy to promote development near transit stations and enhancements to existing neighbor-
hoods.

Plan Bay Area
Plan Bay Area (2013) is a long-range integrated transportation and land-use/housing strategy
through 2040 for the San Francisco Bay Area. The Plan Bay Area has implications for land use
planning throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The Plan includes the region’s Sustainable
Communities Strategy and the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan. The Plan is designed to meet
the requirements of California’s landmark 2008 Senate Bill 375 (SB-375), which calls for devel-
oping a Sustainable Communities Strategy to accommodate future population growth and re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks.
Grand Boulevard Initiative
The Grand Boulevard Initiative (GBI) is a coordinated effort of 19 cities (including San Bruno),
San Mateo county and Santa Clara county, as well as local and regional agencies united to im-
prove the performance, safety, and aesthetics of El Camino Real. Starting at the northern Daly
City boundary (where it is named Mission Street) and ending near the Diridon Caltrain Station in
central San Jose (where it is named The Alameda), the initiative brings together for the first time
all of the agencies having responsibility for the condition, use, and performance of the street.
The Grand Boulevard Initiative looks to transform El Camino Real from a suburban, low-density
strip commercial highway to vibrant, mixed-use pedestrian-friendly boulevard and destination
that links regional transportation improvements and local economic development efforts. San
Bruno has been an active participant in the GBI task force and working committee, and is one of
four case study cities for the preliminary design of complete streets improvements along a seg-
ment of El Camino Real. San Bruno has also incorporated the GBI Guiding Principles in its Gen-
eral Plan. The GBI is relevant to the Housing Element because it seeks to target housing and job
growth in strategic areas along the corridor.
21 Elements
21 Elements is a collaboration of San Mateo County jurisdictions to share resources and work
together to update local housing elements. 21 Elements is co-sponsored and coordinated by the
San Mateo County Department of Housing and City/County Association of Governments. 21 El-
ements provides opportunities for municipalities to share resources, successful strategies, and
best practices, and has resulted in stronger local partnerships as well as higher-quality certified
Housing Elements. 21 Elements has hired the planning firm of Baird & Driscoll to provide assis-
tance to jurisdictions in preparing the Housing Element and coordination with HCD. In addition,
this group is working together to complete a County-Wide Housing Nexus Study to inform future
policies as they relate to the City’s housing needs and requirements.
HOPE Plan to End Homelessness
HOPE (Housing Our People Effectively) is a ten-year action plan initiated by San Mateo County
that brings together the business, nonprofit, and public sector communities to address the chal-
lenging issue of homelessness. This plan reflects the Board of Supervisors' goal that housing
should exist in our community for people at all income levels and all generations of families, in-
cluding those who are extremely low income or who are homeless. The HOPE Plan is built
around two key strategies: housing and prevention. To end homelessness, San Mateo County
must follow the housing strategy successfully documented in other communities around the
country: increasing the supply of permanent affordable and supportive housing for people who
are homeless and developing strategies to help them move into housing as rapidly as possible.
The second key strategy is to prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless in the
                                                                                             1-5

Bruno Housing Element.
1.5        DATA SOURCES
The housing and demographic data reported in this Housing Element has been collected from a
variety of sources, including:
        United States Census and American Community Surveys (ACS)
        Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
        State of California, Departments of Finance, Employment Development, Social Services,
         and Developmental Services
        United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Comprehensive
         Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)
        2013 San Mateo HOPE Report on Homelessness
        Specific data sources used are identified in each table or figure.
1.6        PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND OUTREACH
Another important source of guidance in the development of this Housing Element was the wider
San Bruno community. As outlined in the description of public outreach that follows, the Housing
Element has incorporated input from the residents at public meetings, the Planning Commission
and City Council, as well as from affordable housing providers, advocates and developers such
as recommendations received at 21 Elements Outreach Panels. Public outreach conducted as
part of this Housing Element update included:
Housing Program Implementation (2007-2014)
The City Council reviewed the Housing Element Annual Progress Report (APR) regularly
throughout the 2009 to 2014 Housing Element planning period. The City Council and Planning
Commission have held a number of meetings to complete implementation of programs in the
current Housing Element.
On March 4, 2014, the Planning Commission held a workshop and received public comment on
the Housing Element update process, including the requirement that the City implement four
Housing Element programs related to SB-2 and SB-1818 to comply with state law and to be eli-
gible for the State’s streamlined process for the 2015-2023 Housing Element Update, summa-
rized below:
        Establish a Reasonable Accommodation process for housing for persons with disabili-
         ties;
        Establish a Density Bonus Program to address requirements of SB-1818;
        Allow Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing as permitted uses within residential
         zones; and
        Establish a zone in the City where emergency shelter would be allowed by right.

                            City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                                          Chapter 1: Introduction
On March 18, 2014, City staff reported and the Planning Commission discussed the four pro-
grams that the City must implement in order to close out the current Housing Element cycle. On
April 8, 2014, the City Council reviewed the four proposed housing program implementation
measures.
On May 6, 2014, City staff presented four draft ordinances amending the San Bruno Municipal
Code to implement the four Housing Element programs to the Planning Commission. The Plan-
ning Commission unanimously recommended that the City Council adopt three of the four ordi-
nances, but determined that more study was necessary before supporting the emergency shelter
ordinance. Residents voiced concerns about potential concentration of homeless persons and
impacts on the quality of life of the surrounding residential neighborhood. Several residents
urged the City to explore alternative locations for emergency shelters. Staff also received phone
calls and letters from residents expressing similar concerns prior to the Planning Commission
meeting. The Planning Commission directed staff to study alternative locations for emergency
shelter zoning and provide additional information about the characteristics of the local homeless
population and their needs as well as performance standards for shelters. While fully supportive
of the emergency shelter zoning, the Planning Commission seeks to ensure that an emergency
shelter ordinance is sensitive to residents, while meeting the need for emergency shelter in com-
pliance with State law.
On July 8, 2014, the City Council held a Study Session to review and hear public comment on
the three Housing Element implementation actions as recommended by the Planning Commis-
sion. The City Council expressed concerns that proposed density bonus concessions and incen-
tives may conflict with standards and design guidelines in the adopted Transit Corridors Plan and
other community development objectives for architectural and land use quality. The Council was
also concerned that certain types of transitional and supportive housing may require community
care licensing by the state, which was not addressed in the ordinance. The City Council directed
staff to do additional research and report back.
On August 26, 2014, the City Council adopted the three ordinances amending the Municipal
Code regarding Reasonable Accommodation process, Density Bonuses and Transitional Hous-
ing and allowing Supportive Housing as permitted uses within the definition of “Special Residen-
tial Care Facility”. The Council will further study the location for emergency shelter zoning with an
objective to adopt an emergency shelter ordinance before January 31, 2015.
Housing Element Update (2015-2023)
The City Council and Planning Commission have held a number of meetings and workshops to
consider the update of San Bruno’s Housing Element for the 2015 to 2023 planning period.
These meetings were also an opportunity for the City Council and the public to learn about ef-
forts to update the Housing Element for the next planning period.
On October 14, 2014, the City Council reviewed the draft Sites Inventory and Programs and Im-
plementation Actions for the Housing Element update and directed staff to submit the draft Hous-
ing Element to HCD. The City Council expressed concern that the RHNA affordable housing tar-
gets were not met during the last Housing Element cycle, and desired to implement programs
and strategies that would improve performance in the next cycle. The discussion on available
housing sites focused on housing opportunities that will be created in the TCP area with comple-
tion of the zoning code update and passage of Measure N, the San Bruno Economic Enhance-
ment Initiative, described below. The discussion on housing programs focused on two new pro-
                                                                                               1-7

grams and proposed changes to existing programs. The City Council approved forwarding the
draft Housing Element to HCD for initial review.
Transit Corridors Plan
The public process for the Transit Corridors Plan (TCP), including the work of a 17-member
Steering Committee and community workshops, has also addressed housing issues in the transit
oriented development and downtown districts. Input from these outreach activities is incorpo-
rated as appropriate into this Housing Element.
On February 12, 2013, the City Council adopted the TCP, thus implementing Housing Element
Program 2-B to increase residential options in the downtown and transit corridors area in the vi-
cinity of the new Caltrain Station. Preparation of the plan involved extensive public engagement,
including the work of a 17-member Steering Committee and community workshops.
On May 29, 2014, the City Council held a special public meeting to inform residents and receive
public comment on a proposed ballot measure to implement the TCP by amending City Ordi-
nance 1284 which placed constraints to certain types of development. Over 100 residents at-
tended the meeting and commented on a variety of issues related to housing development within
the TCP area.
On July 22, 2014, the City Council placed the Economic Enhancement Initiative (Measure N) on
the November 4, 2014 ballot to allow increased building heights, increased residential density,
and above-ground multi-story parking structures. Passage of Measure N would allow increased
building heights, above-ground multi-story parking structures and increased residential density in
the TCP area. Passage of Measure N will facilitate development of up to 1,610 residential units
along major commercial streets within about ½ mile of the new San Bruno Caltrain station. This
will present the greatest opportunity for new housing in the City over the next 20 years.
The City conducted outreach to San Bruno voters regarding Measure N in a number of ways,
including: public meetings, staff presentations to service organizations and other groups, City
website, a fact sheet and FAQ distributed at City Hall and public Library, posters at City Hall and
other strategic locations, such as the Shops at Tanforan, and a short informational video aired
regularly on San Bruno’s cable TV station. The also City held Town Hall Forum public meeting
on October 21, 2014, to allow the proponent and opponent to present the arguments in favor
and against Measure N, and to give San Bruno voters the opportunity to ask questions. About 50
residents participated in the forum.
On November 4, 2014, Measure N passed with support of 67 percent of San Bruno voters. This
represents a major step towards implementing the vision of the TCP to promote mixed use trans-
it oriented with housing close to San Bruno’s new Caltrain station.
21 Elements Outreach Panels
The 21 Elements team facilitated a series of panel discussions to solicit input from stakeholders
throughout the county on housing issues. Three meetings were held, with focused stakeholder
participants, including housing developers, housing advocates and funding providers, and spe-
cial needs service providers.

Developer Panel
On December 5, 2013, the 21 Elements project team convened a panel of local developers to
discuss housing development issues in San Mateo County. The panel consisted of representa-
tives from Mercy Housing, MidPen Housing Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, Van Meter Wil-
liams Pollack (architects), and Bridge Housing. The panel addressed present and future con-
cerns in housing development, such as community politics, the growing senior population, and
the pressing need for more workforce housing. Key recommendations from the panel included:
        Utilize program-level CEQA review to add certainty and speed to development approval,
         as feasible;
        Examine local density and FAR requirements, and consider a variable density system
         where small units or senior units only count as a fraction of a unit;
        Facilitate lot consolidations;
        Consider increasing density beyond 30 units/acre to allow for better design; and
        Reduce parking requirements, or create separate parking requirements for affordable
         housing.
Advocates and Funders Panel
On February 6, 2014, the 21 Elements project team convened a panel of local housing advo-
cates and funding providers to discuss housing needs in San Mateo County, and solutions to
address this need. The panel consisted of representatives from Silicon Valley Community Foun-
dation, Enterprise Community Partners, Housing Leadership Council – San Mateo, Peninsula
Interfaith Action, Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, and Building Industry Association. Additional
advocates in attendance included the Housing Leadership Council/HEART and the Sierra Club.
The panel discussed the extreme lack of affordable housing in San Mateo County, and the high
cost of all housing in general. The panel presented solutions to address this problem, including
allocating more resources through housing trust funds and affordable housing impact fees, en-
courage the development of more housing in the context of great places, anti-displacement
measures such as strengthened condo conversion requirements and considering community
benefits, and continuing to educate and outreach to the community to dispel myths about afford-
able housing.
Special Needs Service Providers Panel
On April 10, 2014, the 21 Elements project team convened a panel to discuss housing issues for
special needs groups. Representatives from HIP Housing, San Mateo Mental Health, local shel-
ters, and attorneys for disability rights attended the meeting. The group discussed potential legis-
lative actions to address shared housing within the context of the Housing Element, including
counting this type of housing toward regional housing need allocations, the high level of need to
increase the number of housing units available for extremely low-income households, and the
need for a variety of types of transitional housing (including small 4-6 bed arrangements that can
be most successful). The San Carlos Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan update was also dis-
cussed, and the potential constraints on new housing that could be imposed by revising land use
compatibility boundaries.
All of these sources of public input were used to identify Housing Element priorities and new
programs, as well as to tailor programs and background information to better serve the commu-
                                                                                              1-9

2         Housing Needs Assessment
This chapter provides demographic and housing market information to evaluate existing and future
housing needs. The main purposes of this assessment are to identify population groups with the
greatest housing needs and to provide a general direction and focus for future housing initiatives.
2.1       INCOME CATEGORIES
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) use household income categories to help standardize
analysis of housing needs. The income categories are summarized below and are based on a house-
hold’s percentage of San Mateo County’s Area Median Income (AMI).
                    Table 2.1-1: Income Category Definitions
                     Extremely Low                        Below 30% of area median income
                     Very Low                              30%-50% of area median income
                     Low                                   50%-80% of area median income
                     Moderate                             80%-120% of area median income
                     Above Moderate                      Above 120% of area median income
HCD uses these categories, sometimes with minor adjustments, to establish the annual income limits
for San Mateo County, as shown in the table below.

2.2       GENERAL DEMOGRAPHICS AND PROJECTIONS
Much of San Bruno’s population growth occurred between 1940 and 1970. Post-World War II con-
struction resulted in a population boom from 6,500 in the 1940s to 35,000 in the mid-1960s. Since that
time, the population has increased only moderately due to land constraints.
According to California Department of Finance (DOF) estimates, San Bruno had a January 2013 pop-
ulation of 42,828 residents. The most recent census estimates are from July 2012, and show a popu-
lation for San Bruno of 42,165 residents. According to census data, San Bruno grew by two percent
from 2000 to 2010, on par with the county as a whole. The Association of Bay Area Governments
                                                                                                      2-1

                                        Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
(ABAG) predicts that San Bruno’s growth will pick up over the next two decades, bringing the popula-
tion to 53,400 by 2030. Population projections provide a snapshot of future trends based on assump-
tions about development capacity, demographic changes and economic conditions. Population
counts, estimates and projections are shown in the table below.

According to the American Community Survey, San Bruno is relatively diverse; approximately half
the residents are white, and this number has been declining over the past decades. The percent-
age of Asian residents, on the other hand, has grown to a quarter. Almost 30 percent of the pop-
ulation in San Bruno identifies as Hispanic, and this population has been growing as well. Latino
or Hispanic is not a separate racial category on the American Community Survey, and so all indi-
viduals who identify as Latino or Hispanic also belong to another racial category as well (ie- black,
white, other etc.). Race and ethnicity are shown in the table below for San Bruno, San Mateo
County and the State of California.

According to the American Community Survey, the median age in San Bruno was 39, an increase
from 36 in 2000. Approximately 23 percent of the residents are children under 19, and 20 percent
are over the age of 60. San Bruno, like other cities in San Mateo County, can expect to see a
dramatic increase in the number of seniors as the baby boomer generation ages. Looking out to
the year 2030, the California Department of Finance (2013) projects that the number of people
over the age of 75 in San Mateo County will increase from 6 percent of the population to 10 percent
of the population, comprising 79,949 of the projected 803,288 people in San Mateo County in
2030. The table below shows the current distribution of the population in San Mateo County by
age cohort.

OCCUPANCY CHARACTERISTICS
Similar the rest of San Mateo County and the Bay Area as a whole, the demand for both rental
and ownership housing in San Bruno is strong. According to 2011 data from the American
Community Survey, the vacancy rate for owner-occupied homes was just under one percent, and
the vacancy rate for rentals was 4.4 percent. According to information from the California DOF,
the overall vacancy rate in San Bruno was 4.3 percent as of January 2013, although this figure
includes all housing, including vacant housing unavailable for rent or sale. A housing market with
a vacancy rate under five percent is considered to be tight and contributes to concerns about
overcrowding, housing availability and choice, and housing affordability. The recent increases in
rents and construction of new rental housing in San Mateo County are indicative of the high
demand for rental housing relative to the supply of available rental units.

Most of the households in San Bruno are family households, (69 percent) 30 percent with children
and 39 percent without children. Just under a quarter of the households are comprised of a single
person living alone. According to a United State Census Bureau report, nationwide over the last
60 years the number of single person households has increased dramatically — from 10 percent
of all households in the United States in 1950 to 17 percent in 1970, and by 2012, the proportion
of single-person households increased to 27.4 percent of all households. The share of households
that were married couples with children has halved since 1970, from 40 percent to 20 percent in
2012, according to the report. Households by type in 2011 are shown in the table below.

INCOME CHARACTERISTICS
The median household income in San Bruno is $82,000 a bit lower than the countywide median
of $92,000. The graph below shows the distribution of households by income in San Bruno in
2011. Almost half San Bruno’s households are lower income: 12 percent are extremely low
income, 11 percent are very low income, and 23 percent are low income. These residents are
particularly at risk for overpaying for housing. Fourteen percent of San Bruno’s residents are
moderate income.

Generally, renters are as likely as owners to be lower income. However, lower income renters are
more likely to be impacted when rents increase due to their income and the limited availability of
choices in the rental housing market.

2.4        HOUSING SAN MATEO COUNTY’S WORKFORCE
Though San Mateo County has a robust economy, much of its workforce cannot afford to live
within the county. Job growth has been strong, although cyclical, over the past 10 years, and is
projected to continue. However, housing development has not kept up the pace with the growth in
local jobs. According to the Department of Housing (Housing Needs Study, 2007), by 2025, San
Mateo County’s supply of housing will only meet one third to one half of the demand. Additionally,
40 percent of new jobs in the county will pay lower income wages.
A home meets the standard definition of affordability if it does not cost more than 30 percent of a
household’s income. A household that spends more than 30 percent of its gross income on
housing is considered to be overpaying for housing. Housing that costs more than 30 percent of
                                                                                                                        2-13

                                          Chapter 2: Needs Assessment
household income is a more acute problem for lower income households, since there is less
discretionary money for other necessities.
While individual household income conditions vary, an example can be useful to illustrate
affordability conditions for a low income family in San Mateo County. A four-person family with
one parent working fulltime as a cook and the other parent working in retail can afford a monthly
rent of about $1,400 and a home sales price of $222,000. A single parent family with the adult
working as a police officer would be considered moderate income, and can afford a monthly rent
of about $2,400 and a home costing $374,000. Neither of these example households can afford
San Mateo County’s median condominium, costing $579,418, or single-family home, which costs
$1,246,121 (SAMCAR), although the example single-parent family can afford the median county
rent of $2,234.

below.

San Bruno is largely a residential city, with approximately 11,400 jobs, or one job for every four
residents. Just under half the jobs in San Bruno pay more than $3,333 a month. According to
census data, 94 percent of San Bruno residents leave the city to work, and workers from other
jurisdictions fill 91 percent of the jobs in the city.
According to ABAG projections, San Bruno can expect to see its workforce increase by 18 percent
by 2025, with much of that job growth coming from the financial and professional services sector
and the health, educational and recreational service sector. The table below shows the distribution
of the workforce in San Bruno and San Mateo County by age, salary and education.

2.5      HOME PRICES AND SALES HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
According to data from Zillow (www.zillow.com), in October 2013 the median sales price for a
single-family home in San Bruno was $635,600 and this median sale price for a multi-family home
is close to $276,600. According to Zillow, home prices in San Bruno have decreased by eight
percent over the past year. During the same time period, many other cities in San Mateo County
have seen a large increase in housing prices.
Home sale prices in San Bruno took a serious hit during the housing crisis, and have not yet wholly
recovered. As a result, San Bruno has some of the most affordable homes in San Mateo County.
While single-family homes are unaffordable to households earning less than a moderate income,
multi-family homes are significantly more affordable. A single person earning a low income and a
four-person family making a very low income can both afford to own a home in San Bruno.
The tables below are from the San Mateo County Association of Realtors (SAMCAR) and show
median single family and condominium home price trends between 2005 and the third quarter of
2013. The average price of a single family home in San Mateo County increased between 2005
and 2013 by about $150,000 (from $1,095,951 in 2005 to $1,246,121 in 2013). The average priced
condominium decreased in price during that same time period by $6,616 (from $586,034 in 2005
to $579,418 in 2013).

        2.6       RENTS AND RENTAL HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
        Renting in San Bruno is more expensive than owning a home, according to data from 2013.
        According to RealFacts LLC, a firm that conducts monthly surveys of rents for complexes over 50
        units in size, a studio in San Bruno cost $1,400, a 1-bedroom $2,200, a two-bedroom $1,900 and
        a three bedroom $3,000. (Please note that RealFacts indicates that rent for a two-bedroom unit
        rent is less than for a one-bedroom. Staff is researching this anomaly in the data)
        Rents in San Mateo County have been generally rising since 2010, after seeing a dip during the
        recent housing and economic downturn. RealFacts’ most recent report, prepared in October 16,
        2013, concludes “Bay Area apartment rents slowed their march upward in the third quarter in a
        sign that the worst may be over in a region that has been slammed by two years of increases.”
        In San Bruno, a single person earning up to a moderate income cannot afford a one-bedroom
        apartment. A family of four earning a moderate income can just barely afford a three-bedroom
        apartment. Given the high number of households earning a low income in San Bruno, affordable
        rental housing could be a concern.

2.7       ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION
The tables below adjust sales prices and rents for inflation over the 2005 to 2013 time period
(inflation rate of 19 percent over the eight year period). In 2013 dollars, average household income
in San Bruno decreased slightly from $83,809 in 2000 to $82,246 in 2011, or a 1.9 percent
decrease in purchasing power over that time period. In real purchasing power (constant 2013
dollars), home sales prices have gone down significantly in San Bruno since 2005. However, over
the 2005 to 2013 period rents, in constant 2013 dollars, rents have increased 40 percent for one-
bedroom units and 24.2 percent for two-bedroom units.
The conclusions of this analysis are that: (1) Sales housing prices are significantly lower than
seven years ago and as a result are more affordable to lower-income households (2) incomes
have remained relatively consistent, and so household purchasing power has remained the
same, (3) rents have significantly increased relative to purchasing power, with rents increasing by
about 33 percent in real dollars while incomes have remained flat over the same time period. This
analysis underscores some of the challenges of availability and affordability of market rate rental
and sales housing in San Mateo County.

   2.8       OVERPAYMENT FOR HOUSING
   Households are considered to be overpaying for housing if they spend more that 30 percent of
   their income on rent or mortgage payments. More than half the San Bruno residents making under
   $75,000 annually are overpaying for housing. Almost all of the lowest income renters, those
                                                                                                                              2-21

 making under $35,000, are overpaying on rent. Renters are more likely to be overpaying for
 housing than homeowners. Without choices and the availability of affordable housing in San
 Bruno, lower-income people may choose to live elsewhere and commute into the city to work. Or,
 those households who live in San Bruno may live in overcrowded homes, and have limited money
 to dedicate towards other necessities such as food, transportation, and medical care.

2.9       HOUSING OVERCROWDING
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a unit is considered overcrowded if it the unit is occupied
by more than 1.01 persons per room (excluding bathrooms and kitchens). Homes with more than
1.5 persons per room are considered severely overcrowded. Overcrowding increases health and
safety concerns and stresses the condition of the housing stock and infrastructure. Overcrowding
correlates strongly with household size, particularly for large households.
San Bruno has a slightly larger number of overcrowded rental homes than elsewhere in the county.
Nine percent of rental homes are overcrowded and approximately three percent are extremely
overcrowded. Just fewer than three percent of owner-occupied homes are overcrowded or
extremely overcrowded.

2.10      OTHER HOUSING ISSUES
In addition to issues with affordability and overcrowding, housing can have physical problems such
as lack of facilities or deterioration due to age. One of the best ways to assess the condition of the
housing stock is through a windshield survey. The American Community Survey also provides
useful information as to the conditions of the housing stock.
More than half of San Bruno’s housing stock was built in the 1950s or earlier. 85 percent of all
homes in the city were built before 1980. Only seven percent of the homes have been built in the
last decade. Older housing can be more expensive to maintain and renovate.
The American Community Survey tracks other housing problems, including a lack of plumbing and
kitchen facilities. Homes in San Bruno have a very small number of other housing problems.
Approximately 40 homes are lacking either complete plumbing facilities or complete kitchen
facilities. The tables below show the age of housing and the number of housing units with housing
problems. The US Census Bureau uses the definition of a complete kitchen as including a sink
with piped water, range or cook stove and a refrigerator.

2.11      REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION (RHNA)
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process addresses housing needs across
income levels for each jurisdiction in California. All of the Bay Area’s 101 cities and nine counties
are given a share of the Bay Area’s total regional housing need. The Bay Area's regional housing
need is allocated by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD),
and finalized though negotiations with the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). San
Mateo County jurisdictions, through a unique process different from other Bay Area counties,
collaboratively developed a formula to divide up San Mateo County’s overall housing allocation
among the 21 jurisdictions in the county.
San Bruno’s RHNA requires the city to ensure there is land available for a total of 1,155 new
housing units between 2014 and 2022. Approximately 37 percent of those units will be for
households making more than moderate income, 18 percent will be for households making
moderate income, 14 percent for low-income, and 15 percent for very low income and extremely
low income households each. The total number of housing units and the distribution by income
category requires the city to make sure there are adequate housing sites and programs to address
a variety of housing choices, types and densities.

       2.12     SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
       Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to their special
       circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to employment and income, family
       characteristics, disability, and household characteristics.
       In addition to overall housing needs, cities and counties must plan for the special housing needs
       of certain groups. State law (65583(a)(6)) requires that several populations with special needs be
       addressed — homeless people, seniors, people living with a disability, large families,
       female-headed households and farmworkers. This section provides a discussion of the housing
       needs facing each group.

  SENIORS
  Seniors face many housing challenges as they age, including the likelihood of a fixed budget,
  higher medical costs and greater likelihood of disabilities. According to American Community
  Survey, there are currently approximately 5,634 seniors living in San Bruno.
  Seniors’ income tends to decline as they age. Young seniors often have some retirement savings
  or employment income that can supplement social security. More than 42 percent of seniors in the
  65-74 year age bracket worked in the past year, while only 10 percent of seniors age 75 or more
  worked. Older seniors are more likely to use up their savings and therefore are more likely to live
  in poverty.
  Younger seniors tend to need less support. Most prefer to stay in their home for as long as they
  can. They may benefit from programs to help them rehabilitate their homes to make them better
  for people to age in place. Older seniors often are unable to maintain a single family home and
  look to move to a smaller home or some type of senior living development. Senior renters are
  particularly at risk for displacement because their incomes are decreasing while their housing
  expenses are increasing.
   The graph below shows the significant increase in the senior population in the United States, with
  a significant increase between 2011 and 2014 as baby boomers reach 65 years of age.

  Seniors in San Bruno have lower-incomes than seniors elsewhere in the county. More than a third
  of seniors earn less than $30,000 annually, and half make under $50,000 annually. The poverty
  rate among seniors in San Bruno is slightly higher than the poverty rate for seniors in the county

as a whole affordable housing options for these seniors are crucial. Seniors in San Bruno, like
seniors in San Mateo County as a whole, are significantly more likely to be homeowners than
renters. Thus, housing concerns for seniors in San Bruno might include retrofits to allow seniors
to age in place (stay in their current home as they get older) or stay in the community but in a
smaller unit or with services available. Often, homeownership means greater housing security.
According to the 2013 report, Key Housing Trends in San Mateo, 52 percent of seniors who rent
in San Mateo County are economically insecure while only 27 percent of seniors who own their
own home without a mortgage are economically insecure.
As the large baby boomer generation ages, San Bruno, like the rest of San Mateo County, is
expected to see a growing senior population. According to Key Housing Trends in San Mateo
County, the county can expect to see a 76 percent increase in the number of seniors. A key
challenge in the coming years will be how to accommodate the needs of aging residents. For more
information about senior trends and preferences, see the 2013 Key Housing Trends in San Mateo
report. The tables below show a comparison of income and home ownership for seniors living in
San Bruno and San Mateo County compared to the State of California.

PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES
The Census Bureau defines disability as, “A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition.
This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs,
dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being
able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.” Not surprisingly, people over
65 are much more likely to have a disability.
People with disabilities face many challenges when looking for housing. There is a limited supply
of handicap accessible, affordable housing generally, and the supply is especially tight near transit.
Being near transit is important because many people with disabilities cannot drive. People with
disabilities are also often extremely low income due to the challenge of securing long-term
employment, and to higher medical bills. Additionally, because some people with disabilities,
particularly developmental disabilities, have lived with their parents they often do not have rental
or credit history. This makes it harder to compete for the limited housing that is available.
People with disabilities may have unique housing needs. Fair housing laws and subsequent
federal and state legislation require all cities and counties to further housing opportunities by
identifying and removing constraints to the development of housing for individuals with disabilities,
including local land use and zoning barriers, and to also provide reasonable accommodation as
one method of advancing equal access to housing.
The Fair Housing laws require that cities and counties provide flexibility or even waive certain
requirements when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities for people with
disabilities. An example of such a request might be to place a ramp in a front yard to provide
access from the street to the front door. The State Attorney General, in a letter to the City of Los
Angeles in May 2001, stated that local governments have an affirmative duty under fair housing

                                 City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023

laws to provide reasonable accommodation and “It is becoming increasingly important that a
process be made available for handling such requests that operates promptly and efficiently.” He
advised jurisdictions not to use existing variance or conditional use permit processes because they
do not provide the correct standard for making fair housing determinations and because the public
process used in making entitlement determinations fosters opposition to much needed housing for
individuals with disabilities.
A fundamental characteristic of a fair housing reasonable accommodation procedure is the
establishment of appropriate findings that reflect the intent and specific language of both the
federal and state fair housing statutes. In this regard, it is somewhat different than traditional or
typical zoning cases because here the focus of review is the need of the individual with disabilities
to overcome barriers to housing, not on the topography of the site or the unique character of the
lot. The focus here is solely on the special need of the individual to utilize his or her home or
dwelling unit, which is directly related to the individual’s disability. It is this reasoning that underlies
the Attorney General’s warning not to utilize variance criteria for such determinations.
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
SB 812, signed into law in 2010, requires Housing Elements to include an analysis of the special
housing needs of people with developmental disabilities. Additionally, SB 812 requires that
individuals with disabilities receive public services in the least restrictive, most integrated setting
appropriate to their needs
California defines developmentally disabled as a “severe and chronic disability that is attributable
to a mental or physical impairment. The disability must begin before the person’s 18th birthday,
be expected to continue indefinitely, and present a substantial disability.” Some development
disabilities cause mental retardation and some do not. Common developmental disabilities include
Down’s syndrome, autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy.
People with developmental disabilities in San Mateo County have various diagnoses. The common
ones are summarized below. Because people can have multiple diagnoses, the numbers total
more than 100 percent. The information below has been provided by the Golden Gate Regional
Center (GGRC), which covers the San Francisco Bay Area.

People with developmental disabilities tend to be younger than the general population. There are
several reasons for this: for some diagnoses there is a shorter life expectancy; more importantly,
starting in the 1990s there was an “autism wave” with many more young people being diagnosed

 Many people with developmental disabilities are unable to secure long-term employment. This
 results in many people relying on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and many earn 10-20

 People with developmental disabilities have various housing needs and housing situations. Most
 San Bruno residents with disabilities (61 percent) live with a parent or legal guardian. The
 remaining San Bruno residents with developmental disabilities live independently or with some
 supportive services.

 According to the Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC), trends that are affecting people with
 developmental disabilities include California’s moves to reduce institutionalization, ageing family
 caregivers not being able to continue providing in-house care and the growing wave of people with
 autism.
 Deinstitutionalization – In 1977, California passed the Lanterman Developmentally Disabled
 Services Act, to minimize the institutionalization of developmentally disabled people, help them
 remain in their communities, and to allow them to live their lives as similar to non-disabled people
 as possible. To accomplish this end the State has been closing large institutional care facilities,

resulting in more people with disabilities being integrated into the community. However, this has
increased the demand for community-based independent living options to serve the needs of the
developmentally disabled.
Aging Baby Boomers Unable to Care for their Children with Developmental Disabilities –
As displayed in the table below, almost three quarters of people with developmental disabilities
live with a parent or caregiver, and many of these caregivers are baby boomers. As these care-
givers age their ability to continue to care for their developmentally disabled children will decrease
to the point where it is no longer possible. This trend is also going to be a factor in the increased
need for community-based independent living options for the developmentally disabled. Many ser-
vice delivery systems and communities are not prepared to meet the increasing need.
Increasing Numbers of People with Autism - A large number of people with developmental
disabilities have autism. They have been brought up as independent members of the community
and want to remain independent and involved in the community. There is a coming need to supply
community-based independent living options for these individuals.

     DISABILITY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
     The three major needs for people with disabilities are low cost (subsidized) rents, handicapped
     accessible homes, and buildings near public transportation. These needs are very similar to the
     desires of other segments of the population. Policies that promote affordable housing generally
     are also good for the disabled community. Specific recommendations from the Golden Gate
     Regional Center include:
             Jurisdictions assisting with site identification for low income developments;
             Policies to promote accessible homes;
             Inclusionary zoning;
             Second units; and
             Mixed use zoning
     Additionally, some people with development disabilities need supportive housing that is affordable
     and located near public transit. In supportive housing, additional services are provided at the
     home.
     FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
     Households headed by a single parent can have special needs due to the economic limitation of
     earning only one income, and the challenges of childcare without a partner. Although gender
     equality has made strides over the past 50 years, women continue to earn lower incomes than
     men. Therefore, female-headed households in particular have specific housing needs that must
     be addressed. The special needs of female-headed households can include low cost housing,
     2-32

suitable for children and located near schools and childcare facilities. Innovative, shared living
arrangements, including congregate cooking and childcare, could also be appropriate
Female-headed households make up over a quarter of the total households in San Bruno. The
most vulnerable female-headed households can be those where women are living with children
without a partner. San Bruno has 750 such households. An additional, approximately 3,400
households are headed by women living alone or with other family members. Female-headed
households in San Bruno have similar rates of poverty as the general population.

LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households are defined as households with five or more members living in the same home.
Large households are a special needs group because of the difficulty in finding adequate and
affordable housing. Many jurisdictions have few large homes, and often these larger homes are
significantly more expensive than smaller ones. Large households throughout San Mateo County
are much more likely than smaller households to live in a home with some type of housing problem,
such as high rent or cost, or problems with the physical condition of the home.
San Bruno has approximately 1,500 households with five or more members. These households
are significantly more likely than smaller households to have housing problems: a majority of large
households in San Bruno have some kind of housing problem.

EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
Extremely Low Income (ELI) households earn 30 percent of the area median income or less. In
San Mateo County this amounts to an annual income of $33,950 or below for a family of four.
Many ELI households live in rental housing and most likely facing overpayment, overcrowding or
substandard housing conditions. Some ELI households are recipients of public assistance such
as social security insurance or disability insurance. Housing types available and suitable for ELI
households include affordable rentals, secondary dwelling units, emergency shelters, supportive
housing and transitional housing.
There are 1,790 ELI households in San Bruno according to 2010 CHAS data. More than half of
these households live in rental units, representing a higher percentage of renters than in San
Bruno’s general population. Most of San Bruno’s ELI households face some kind of housing
problem: 85 percent of all ELI renter households, and 75 percent of ELI owner households face
overcrowding, overpayment, and/or lack complete kitchen or plumbing facilities.

HOMELESS NEEDS
All 21 jurisdictions within San Mateo County have adopted the ten-year HOPE Plan (Housing Our
People Effectively: Ending Homelessness in San Mateo County), designed to end homelessness
within ten years. The HOPE Plan adopts a Housing First policy, which seeks to move homeless
people into permanent housing instead of shelters by increasing the stock of affordable and
subsidized housing. Although the HOPE planners recognized that there is a lack of needed
resources throughout the housing continuum, including emergency and transitional housing, the
greatest need and the most effective use of new and/or redirected resources is the creation and
protection of quality affordable and supportive housing.
According to the January 2013 countywide homeless survey, there are 2,281 homeless people
living in San Mateo County. Close to 90 percent of the homeless population was living in San
Mateo County when they became homeless.
The homeless in San Mateo County are both sheltered, meaning they live in emergency shelters,
transitional housing, treatment centers or other similar institutions; and unsheltered, meaning they
live on the street, in encampments or in a vehicle.

2007, while the number living in an RV, car or encampment, has risen dramatically to just over 40
percent of the total homeless population. The remaining 43 percent are considered sheltered
homeless.
The vast majority of homeless people are single adults (who may be living with another adult, but
no children). However, one-fifth of the sheltered homeless are families. Most homeless people are
white (60%) and male (a range between 60-71 percent depending on sheltered and unsheltered).
Notably, 72 percent of the unsheltered homeless population has an alcohol or drug problem, while
only eight percent of the sheltered population has a similar problem.
HOMELESSNESS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY AND THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO
As of the 2013 San Mateo Homeless Census, 99 unsheltered homeless people and seven
sheltered homeless people lived in San Bruno. This is the largest number of homeless people in
the city since 2007. The tables below provide additional information on the homeless and are from
the San Mateo County January 2013 homeless count.

FARM WORKERS
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural labor. Most jurisdictions in San Mateo County have no farms or farmworkers,
however there are 334 farms and 1,722 farmworkers in the county, primarily located in coastal
communities. Of these 1,722 farmworkers, 88 are migrant workers and 329 work less than 150
days annually (and are therefore considered to be “seasonal labor”). Farm workers who are
migrant or seasonal workers have special housing needs because of their relatively low income
and the unstable nature of their job (i.e. having to move throughout the year from one harvest to
the next). These workers generally face higher rates of overcrowding and other substandard
housing conditions. Continued efforts to provide affordable housing, especially affordable housing
suitable for families, will help meet the needs of these farm workers.

2.13     ASSISTED HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a requirement that localities
identify and develop a program in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted,
affordable multi-family units. Section 65583(a)(8) requires an analysis of existing housing units
that are eligible to change from low-income housing uses during “the next 10 years” due to
termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use. In the
context of this Housing Element update, assisted units are considered “at-risk” of conversion to
market rate if the expiration date of their financing program falls before 2023 (i.e. 10 years from
the beginning of the housing element planning period—2013).
Assisted housing units are those that offer financial aid or provide extra services for people in need
of financial or basic living assistance. San Bruno has three assisted housing developments, all of
which were built during the 2000s: Archstone I (Meridian), completed in 2005; Archstone II
(Paragon), completed in 2007; and Village at the Crossing, also completed in 2007. All three
projects are rental apartments; the two Archstone developments are for all household types and
the Village at the Crossing is for senior households only. The three projects received funding
through a variety of sources including State bond tax-exempt financing, San Bruno
Redevelopment Agency subsidies, and 4 percent tax credits (for more specifics by project, please
see Chapter 4, Table 4.1-1). Because the projects were built within the last decade, and the deed
restrictions apply for several decades, none of these developments is considered to be at-risk of
conversion within the next 10 years. 60 units at Archstone I will be affordable through 2060 and
37 units at Archstone II will be affordable through 2062. All units at the Village at the Crossing
                                                                                                   2-37

   The California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC) assists nonprofit and government
   housing agencies to create, acquire, and preserve housing affordable to lower income households.
   CHPC maintains a database of units throughout California that use federal funding programs to
   maintain their affordability. According to CHPC, there are no at-risk affordable housing units in
   San Bruno listed in their database.
   However, San Bruno had one housing development with deed-restricted affordable units that
   converted to market rate during the prior Housing Element period, Treetops Apartments, now
   called Pacific Bay Vistas. Treetops vacated in 2005 due to severe mold problems, and remained
   closed for almost eight years. Treetops had 62 affordable units when it closed in 2005 (20 percent
   of the original 308 units) with restrictions set to expire in 2015. The City approved a new building
   plan in 2005 with an extension of the affordability restrictions until 2017 because of an assumed
   two-year delay in completion of the project. The new project (Pacific Bay Vistas) was approved for
   510 units, and 15 percent of the additional 202 units (30 units) would have new 30-year low-income
   affordability restrictions. As a result of the economic downturn in 2008, the developer submitted a
   new proposal to renovate the existing vacant complex with same number units (308), which was
   approved in 2010. Unfortunately, the developer paid off the original loan, which terminated the
   affordable housing covenants, and the project was reopened in 2014 without any affordable units.
   QUALIFIED ENTITIES
   Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65863.11, owners of government-assisted
   projects cannot terminate subsidy contracts, prepay a federally-assisted mortgage, or discontinue
   use restrictions without first providing an exclusive Notice of Opportunity to Submit an Offer to
   Purchase. This Notice is required to be sent to Qualified Entities at least 12 months prior to sale
   or termination of use restrictions. Qualified Entities are nonprofit or for profit organizations or

2.14       ENERGY CONSERVATION
Conservation of energy is an important issue in housing development today not only due to the
cost of energy, which can be a substantial portion of monthly housing costs for both owners and
renters, but also due to an emerging interest in sustainable development, energy independence,
and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in line with new legislation such as AB 32 and SB
375. There are three main strategies a jurisdiction can employ to promote energy conservation:
integrated land use and transportation planning; the adoption of green building standards and
practices; and the promotion of energy conservation programs and choices. The following section
describes opportunities for energy conservation in accordance with Government Code Section
65583(b)(8).
INTEGRATED LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION
Energy conservation can be a priority in the overall planning of a City’s land uses and
transportation systems. Planning to provide a range of housing types and affordability near jobs,
services, and transit can reduce commutes, traffic congestion, and thus the number of vehicle
miles traveled and vehicle hours traveled. Promoting infill development at higher densities will also
help reach these goals.
The San Bruno 2025 General Plan and the recently adopted Transit Corridors Specific Plan
contain many new policies aimed to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas
emissions, by reducing vehicle miles traveled and trips through infill and transit- and pedestrian-
oriented residential and non-residential development (LUD-7, LUD-10, LUD-28, LUD-29, LUD-48);
through encouraging alternatives modes of transportation (T-1, T-3, T-4, T-5) including an
emphasis on improving options and infrastructure for bicycle use (T-69 through T-74); and through
                                                                                                                   2-39

                                       Chapter 2: Needs Assessment
policies to increase energy conservation specifically through green design, retrofitting, and other
incentives (PFS-62 through PFS-71). Most of these initiatives that support energy conservation
also support the provision of affordable and accessible housing by locating residents near transit
and other services, by increasing housing unit densities and varieties which can lower the cost of
renting or owning, and by creating a complete transportation system that can accommodate
households that cannot afford cars.
BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS AND PRACTICES
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. Construction of
energy efficient buildings does not lower the purchase price of housing. However, housing with
energy conservation features should result in reduced monthly occupancy costs as consumption
of water and energy is decreased. Similarly, retrofitting existing structures with energy-conserving
features can result in a reduction in utility costs.
State Building Code Standards
The California Energy Commission was created in 1974 by the Warren-Alquist State Energy
Resources Conservation and Development Act (Public Resources Code 25000 et seq.). Among
the requirements of the law was a directive for the Commission to adopt energy conservation
standards for new construction. The first residential energy conservation standards were
developed in the late 1970s (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations) and have been
periodically revised and refined since that time. In 2011, California added the California Green
Building Standards Code (CALGreen) to the state’s official building code. CALGreen is a new set
of building codes, some mandatory, and some voluntary, for all new buildings and renovations. It
is the first state level “green” building code to be implemented in the US.
San Bruno adopted the 2013 California Building Code, including the Green Building Code and
related Energy Code in 2014. All building projects are held to these updated standards.
Other Energy Conservation Opportunities in Building Standards and Practices
As described above, the San Bruno 2025 General Plan contains numerous policies that support
the development and evolution of green building standards and practices in the city. Examples of
energy conservation opportunities include weatherization programs and home energy audits;
installation of insulation; installation or retrofitting of more energy-efficient appliances and
mechanical or solar energy systems; and building design and orientation that incorporates energy
conservation considerations.
For the purposes of this Housing Element, we can elaborate on ways that residential building
design can be more energy efficient. Many modern design methods used to reduce residential
energy consumption are based on proven techniques in use since the earliest of days of collective
settlement. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
     Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during
     the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building
     techniques in this category include:

                                       Chapter 2: Needs Assessment
        locating windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain in
         the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
        use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
         absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
        “burying” part of the home in a hillside or berm to reduce solar exposure or to insulate the
         home against extremes of temperature;
        use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange between
         the interior of a home and the exterior;
        locating openings and using ventilating devices to take advantage of natural air flow; and
        use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during
         the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
    Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
    Examples include:
        north-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
        minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
        location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
    Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
        use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
        use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
        use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to these design techniques, other modern or technology-based energy conservation
methods include:
        use of solar energy to heat water;
        use of solar panels, photovoltaic technology, and other devices to generate electricity;
        window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
        weather-stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss; and
        use of energy efficient home appliances.
The city’s abundant sunshine provides an opportunity to use solar energy techniques to generate
electricity, heat water, and provide space heating during colder months, as well. Natural space
heating can be substantially increased through the proper location of windows and thermal mass.
Housing Element programs 4-A and 4-B support the other General Plan policies by promoting
energy conservation in residential design and renovation.
                                                                                                 2-41

PROMOTING ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND CHOICES
Finally, there are numerous financial and technical resources available today to help households
reduce their energy use. Housing Element Program 4-B commits City staff to promoting these
resources as they become available, and helping to connect residents with the information they
need to determine their eligibility and take advantage of appropriate programs.
Pacific Gas & Electric
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) provides both natural gas and electricity to residential consumers
in San Mateo County, including San Bruno. PG&E also participates in several financial and
technical assistance programs and offers incentives to help qualified homeowners and renters
conserve energy and control costs. These programs include:
        The California Alternate Rates for Energy Program (CARE) provides a 20 percent
         monthly discount on energy rates to income qualified households, certain non-profits, fa-
         cilities housing agricultural employees, homeless shelters, hospices and other qualified
         non-profit group living facilities.
        Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) is a rate reduction program for large house-
         holds of three or more people with low- to middle-income.
        The Energy Partners Program provides income-qualified customers free energy educa-
         tion, weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances to reduce gas and electric
         usage.
        The Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program pro-
         vides one-time energy assistance to low-income customers who have experienced severe
         hardships and have no other way to pay their energy bill. This program is managed by the
         Salvation Army.
        The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides eligible low-
         income persons, via local governmental and nonprofits, financial assistance to offset en-
         ergy costs and the weatherizing of homes to improve efficiency. This program is managed
         by the Department of Community Services and Development.
        Household Rebates for “Smart Home” improvements that make homes more energy ef-
         ficient and more environmentally responsible. PG&E offers a variety of incentives including
         rebates for installing energy-efficient appliances, whole house fans, or cool roofs; sealing
         heating and cooling ducts; recycling old appliances. With e-Rebates, customers have the
         ability to apply online for energy efficiency rebates for homes or small businesses.
        The Energy Efficiency Rebates for Multifamily Properties are offered to multifamily
         property owners and managers of existing residential dwellings that contain 2 or more
         units. The program encourages the installation of qualifying energy-efficient products in
         individual tenant units and in the common areas of residential apartment buildings, mobile
         home parks, and condominium complexes.
        The Balanced Payment Plan (BPP) is designed to eliminate big swings in a customer’s
         monthly payments by averaging energy costs over the year.

 Residential Energy Efficiency Federal Tax Credits. Existing homeowners and builders
  are eligible for tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and for solar energy sys-
  tems. For the latest information on federal tax credits for energy efficiency available
  through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009, see the Tax Incentives
  Assistance Project (http://energytaxincentives.org/).
 Non-Residential New Construction (NRNC), also known statewide as Savings By De-
  sign (http://www.savingsbydesign.com/), is a program for commercial, industrial, High
  Tech and agricultural customers that encourages energy-efficient building and process
  design and construction. The program, administered by California’s four investor-owned
  utilities under the auspices of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), offers
  analysis and resources to aid owners and design teams with energy-efficient facility de-
  sign.
 Single Family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH) program, a program to provide substan-
  tially higher incentives to help qualifying low-income homeowners install solar electric sys-
  tems. These projects help reduce long-term housing costs for low-income residents, help
  meet local greenhouse gas reduction targets under AB 32, and provide hands-on “green
  job” training opportunities for local job training programs. The goal of this incentive program
  is to provide low-income homeowners in California access to solar photovoltaic systems
  and reduce bills without increasing monthly expenses. The program requires no adminis-
  trative management since GRID Alternatives will provide outreach, project management,
  and installation services.
 Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) program, which provides higher incen-
  tives to offset the project costs of installing solar on multifamily affordable housing buildings
  in California. The goal of the MASH is to incorporate high levels of energy efficiency and
  high performing solar systems to help enhance the overall quality of affordable housing.

3        Housing Constraints and Resources
This chapter describes the potential constraints applied by local, State, and federal
governments, the private market, infrastructure, and the natural environment to the expansion of
San Bruno’s housing supply. Additionally, potential resources available through local, State, and
federal programs are also discussed. This chapter is designed to address the requirements of
Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) and (5).
3.1        GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Although local ordinances and policies are enacted to protect the health and safety of citizens
and further the general welfare, it is useful to periodically reexamine them to determine their
continued relevance and if they constitute a barrier to the maintenance, improvement, or
development of housing. This section describes existing governmental constraints and the ways
in which the City has worked to reduce or remove them over the last Housing Element cycle.
LAND USE REGULATIONS
San Bruno 2025 General Plan
The land use categories of the San Bruno 2025 General Plan allow residential growth at various
density levels. The General Plan Land Use Diagram is included as Figure 3.1-1. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance will be updated within one year after the adoption of the Housing Element to
reflect these residential densities in accordance with Program 2-A. The General Plan explicitly
provides that bonuses for “income-restricted housing shall be in accordance with State law, and
in addition to the density or FAR.” Land use categories that accommodate residential
development include:
        Very Low Density Residential. Single family detached residential development at a
         density of 0.1 to 2.0 units per acre; innovative development patterns, preservation of nat-
         ural features, pedestrian paths, and other amenities are encouraged.
        Low Density Residential. Single family detached development at a density of 2.1 to 8.0
         units per acre; single family attached development may be allowed where clustering
         permits additional open space.
        Medium Density Residential. Residential development at a density of 8.1 to 24.0 units
         per acre; allows for single family detached and attached housing, small-lot and zero-lot-
         line development, and duplexes.
        High Density Residential. Allows single family attached and multifamily residential de-
         velopment at a density of 24.1 to 40.0 units per acre; includes ancillary uses such as
         rooming and boarding houses, sanitariums, and rest homes.
The updated General Plan also re-designated three major commercial corridors in San Bruno to
new, mixed-use designations that will allow for commercial, office, and residential uses and so
capitalize on the proximity of these corridors to BART and Caltrain. The General Plan was
amended in February 2013 to revise the Transit Oriented Development land use designation to
accommodate higher intensity development within the Transit Corridors Plan area. General Plan
                                                                                            3-1

                             City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
land use designations that allow for residential development at higher densities with mixed uses
include:
       Central Business District (Downtown Mixed Use). Allows 3.0 base maximum FAR
        combined for all uses (residential and non-residential), with no separate residential den-
        sity limitation. Downtown Mixed Use permits one or more of a variety of uses, including:
        retail sales; hotels; eating and drinking establishments; personal and business services;
        professional and medical offices; financial, insurance, and real estate offices; theaters
        and entertainment uses; educational and social services; and government offices. Active
        uses are required at the ground level, and residential use is permitted on second and
        upper floors only. Wholesale trade, drive-through facilities, and auto-related uses are
        prohibited.
       Transit Oriented Development (TOD). Allows 2.0 base maximum FAR combined for
        residential and/or non-residential, and no FAR limit for parcels of 20,000 square feet or
        larger, as outlined in the Transit Corridors Plan. In addition to FAR limits, no maximum
        residential density is required for individual residential projects. However, the Transit
        Corridors Plan provides for a maximum of 1,610 housing units in the TCP area. City
        Council action and subsequent environmental review would be required to increase the
        maximum number of units. This classification permits a variety of uses, either individually
        or in mix with other permitted uses, including: retail sales; eating and drinking establish-
        ments; personal and business services; professional and medical offices; financial, in-
        surance, and real estate offices; hotels and motels; educational and social services; gov-
        ernment offices; and residential. This designation is generally applied in key corridors
        such as San Bruno Avenue and El Camino Real in areas with proximity to BART and
        Caltrain stations.
       Multi Use-Residential Focus. Allows 2.0 base maximum FAR combined for residential
        and/or non-residential, 3.0 maximum for parcels of 20,000 square feet or larger, with
        non-residential use not exceeding 0.6 FAR. Residential density shall not exceed 40.0
        units per acre (before State mandated affordable housing density bonus). The City may
        grant a discretionary bonus of up to 8.0 units per acre for projects that undertake public
        right-of-way streetscape improvements in accordance with criteria established by the
        City. Multi Use–Residential Focus extends south along El Camino Real from Crystal
        Springs Road, placing emphasis on multifamily housing in new development projects.
        Multi Use–Residential Focus permits one or more of a variety of uses, including: multi-
        family and attached single-family housing; eating and drinking establishments; personal
        and business services; hotels and motels; and financial, insurance, and real estate offic-
        es. New retail uses are only conditionally allowed to ensure that such activities are con-
        centrated in existing retail districts.
       Neighborhood Commercial. Residential units are conditionally permitted on upper
        floors as part of a mixed-use development with commercial uses; overall maximum FAR
        for all uses is 1.2 FAR (with no separate residential density limitation).

                                  Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Residential Development and Density Bonuses
California housing law requires that where affordable housing is included in residential
developments, a density bonus must be granted. SB 1818 (Hollingsworth) amended the law in
2004 implementing the density bonus granted on a sliding scale such that the amount of the
bonus increases as the percentage of affordable units increases, until the maximum of 35
percent is reached. Applicants also receive a greater bonus for provision of very-low income and
low-income units, versus the provision of moderate-income units.1
Transit Corridors Plan
The City adopted a Transit Corridors Plan in February 2013 that focuses on commercial/transit
corridors of El Camino Real, San Bruno Avenue, and San Mateo Avenue, adjacent to the future
location of the Caltrain Station on San Bruno Avenue. The Plan serves as the regulatory
document to implement the new General Plan Update transit-oriented development and mixed-
use land use classifications. The Plan includes design guidelines, development regulations,
parking standards, and an implementation strategy that will facilitate development of mixed-use
projects in the area.
Zoning Development Standards
A summary of development standards for the City’s current residential zoning districts is shown
in Table 3.1-1 and the current zoning designations are depicted in Figure 3.1-2. However, the
Zoning Ordinance is expected to be updated following the adoption of this Housing Element so
as to be in accordance with the new General Plan. Zoning requirements for setbacks and lot
coverages are similar to other cities in San Mateo County, and are not generally perceived as a
constraint to housing development in San Bruno. Multifamily apartments are allowed by-right in
the R-3 Medium Density and R-4 High Density Residential districts. San Bruno zoning and land
use designations do not distinguish between kinds of residential use, such as an apartment
building that provides transitional or supportive housing, or SROs. Program 6-E proposes
actions to address the need for more supportive and extremely-low income housing, including
arrangements such as SROs, rent-subsidized apartments leased in the open market, or long-
term set-asides of units within privately-owned buildings. Likewise, San Bruno has worked to
ensure that standards for single family residential areas also do not distinguish between kinds of
residential buildings.
Parking
Parking requirements in San Bruno are also similar to other cities in San Mateo County and are
not considered a major barrier to the development of affordable housing. However, recent
experience with the Planned Development on the former US Navy Site demonstrated that
reduced parking requirements can increase the affordability of housing without reducing the
attractiveness or convenience, particularly when the housing is transit-accessible and caters to
special needs groups that have less demand for parking, such as the elderly or the disabled. As
most of the opportunity sites in this Housing Element cycle are infill redevelopment in transit

ments consisting of five or more dwelling units.

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
accessible commercial corridors, this finding may apply to many of these parcels. Policies T-34
through T-42 in the San Bruno 2025 General Plan require existing parking requirements be
reviewed and revised in part to ensure they do not add unnecessary cost to affordable housing
development.
These General Plan policies also suggest ways in which the city can better meet parking needs
without raising parking requirements, such as allowing the joint or shared use of parking
facilities. Housing Element Program 3-H helps to implement those transportation policies by
requiring the review and revision of parking requirements in conjunction with the update of the
Zoning Ordinance to be consistent with the General Plan and the TCP.
Planned Development
The purpose of the P-D Planned Development District is to allow a mixture of land uses, density,
or design relationships that will produce a superior built environment but which may need a
variety of exceptions to existing land use and zoning regulations. The P-D process is initiated by
the property-owner/developer, at which time the City Council establishes a P-D district based on
a preliminary development plan. A Planned Development Permit is then issued for all uses within
the district, which in turn allows the City and the developer flexibility in development standards
and provision of amenities. Additionally, because land use planning, design, and environmental
review occur simultaneously, the P-D zone enables the City to approve multiple uses in one
consolidated, efficient, and timely process.
San Bruno’s largest Planned Development site is the former U.S. Navy Site, now called The
Crossing. Since 1999, the City has worked with the developer and consultants to prepare a U.S.
Navy Site and Its Environs Specific Plan (January 2001, amended January 2002 and August
2005), entered into a Development Agreement (February 2002), and has granted building
permits for all four phases of residential construction, resulting in the completion of 1,063 multi-
family apartments. All four phases are complete as of 2011. Other Planned Development
projects under construction or approved include Skycrest, approved for 24 units in 2005 and
completed in 2014, Cedar Mills, approved for 14 units in 2011 and completed in 2013, and the
rebuilding of 32 units in Crestmoor after the fire in 2010.
Airport Noise and Land Use Regulations
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is located just east of San Bruno in the City and
County of San Francisco, and is a major source of noise in some areas of the City. The San
Bruno 2025 General Plan contains policies designed to reduce the impact of airport noise on
new residential development in particular, by establishing higher noise insulation standards for
some noise-impacted areas, and by prohibiting new residential uses in the most airport noise-
impacted areas. While this is a governmental constraint in that the City is imposing these
regulations on new development, this issue is described in more detail under Environmental
Constraints later in this chapter.

HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Reasonable Accommodations
Both the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
(FEHA) mandate that cities make “reasonable accommodations” in their land use regulations
when necessary to provide housing for disabled persons. (42 U.S.C. Section 3604(f)(3)(B);
Government Code Section 12927(c)(1), 12955(1).) What this means is that reasonable
exceptions to zoning and land use regulations (such as minimum setbacks) should be made if
the reason is for improving the accessibility of one’s home. These fair housing requirements are
included in California’s Title 24 regulations, which are currently enforced by the City through its
Zoning Ordinance, building codes, plan review, and site inspections processes.
The San Bruno Zoning Ordinance allows housing for persons with disabilities by right in any
residential zoning district. The current definition of family in San Bruno’s Zoning Ordinance—
“one or more persons occupying a premises and living as a single housekeeping unit as
distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, fraternity, sorority house, rooming house, or
boardinghouse. A family shall be deemed to include necessary servants.” (Ord. 1410 § 1 (part),
1982: prior code § 27-3.1 (part))—does not create unreasonable restrictions on persons with
disabilities.
In regards to specific reasonable accommodations requests, San Bruno procedure is to process
these requests over the counter. For example, a request for building a wheelchair ramp is
processed over the counter and requires only a building permit, costing under $100. City code
allows a ramp to extend six feet into the 15-foot front yard setback, so it is unlikely that any
further planning review would be necessary. City procedure is to process building permits using
CalDAG 2003 and the 2007 California Building Code, as adopted by the City. No local
amendments to these codes diminish the ability of the City to accommodate persons with
disabilities. Requests for refunds to permit fees, based on economic need, are available through
City Council review and approval. Retrofits made according to the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) are handled by the Building Division. The San Bruno City Council adopted a Reasonable
Accommodation ordinance on August 26, 2014, amending the zoning ordinance to provide
exceptions in zoning and land use for housing for persons with disabilities in compliance with
state law and Program 3-E of the previous Housing Element. Program 3-E ensures that the City
will implement the adopted Reasonable Accommodation Program and facilitate development,
maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
Group Accommodations (Including Supportive and Transitional Housing)
Special residential care facilities of six persons or fewer are allowed by right in the R-1, R-2, R-3,
and R-4 residential zones. Special residential care facilities of six persons or fewer are treated
no differently than any other residential use. The Fire Department and Building Division inspect
the residence for compliance with codes for a single family residence; no special building permits
are required. No noticing (or community input) is required for special residential care facilities of
six persons or fewer. Special residential care facilities over six persons require a Conditional Use
Permit, with review by the Planning Commission. Such permits are routinely issued usually for
senior housing with disabled provisions. Community noticing and input for special residential
care facilities over six persons is the same for all Conditional Use Permits, with no differences

between types of residential development. No special residential care facility proposed within
San Bruno has yet been denied.
San Bruno does not restrict siting or apply minimum distances to any special needs housing.
There are also no explicit governmental constraints on the creation of specific kinds of special
residential care facilities such as supportive, transitional, or emergency housing. Supportive and
transitional housing are treated no differently than any other residential use.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance is currently compliant with Fair Housing Law. An update of the
Zoning Ordinance is in progress as an implementation measure of the Housing Element
(Program 2-A) to ensure consistency between the General Plan, Housing Element, and Zoning
Ordinance. The City Council adopted a Zoning Code amendment on August 26, 2014 to
implement Program 6-A revising definition of “special residential care facilities” to explicitly
include transitional and supportive housing uses.
OTHER EFFORTS TO FACILITATE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING
Other housing programs address special incentives for housing projects designed and
constructed for disabled persons. Although there was no new affordable housing development in
the last Housing Element cycle, the City remains committed to expedite permit review and waive
planning, building, and licensing fees for affordable housing development—including units
designed for persons with disabilities—as it did for The Crossing (U.S. Navy Site), and Program
5-F directs the City to continue this policy throughout the community by providing expedited
review and fee waivers for affordable housing, and housing for seniors and persons with
disabilities.
The City has also worked to facilitate affordable residential development in more areas of the
city. In accordance with recommendations in the last Housing Element, which suggested the City
modify development regulations in appropriate districts to encourage housing for special needs
groups, the City adopted two new General Plan land use classifications2 that encourage
residential development in accessible central locations, Transit Oriented Development and Multi-
Use Residential Focus, as well as amended the Zoning Ordinance to allow residential lofts in
commercial zones. Program 5-G represents the continuation of the program to consider
modifications to development regulations to encourage affordable housing through smaller-sized
units and other approaches to reduce construction costs. Program 5-E represents the
continuation of the program to encourage development of units designed for large families.
ORDINANCE 1284 HEIGHT AND DENSITY LIMITS
Initiative Ordinance 1284, which imposed city-wide height and density limits constraining higher
density residential development, was adopted by City Council in June 1977. The Ordinance was
intended to preserve the existing character of San Bruno by requiring voter approval for building
that exceed the maximum 50-foot or three story height limit, increased residential density,
construction of above-ground multi-story parking structures, and projects encroaching upon
scenic corridors and open spaces.
2 The Updated General Plan, including the land use classifications, was adopted March 2009.
                                                                                            3-9

                            City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Under Ordinance 1284, permits and approvals cannot be issued to allow construction of the
following types of buildings, unless approved by a majority of voters at a regular or special
election:
        Buildings or other structures exceeding 50 feet in height;
        Buildings or other structures exceeding three stories in height;
        Buildings or other structures, modifications or redevelopment thereof in residential dis-
         tricts which increase the number of dwelling units per acre or occupancy, within each
         acre or portion thereof, in excess of limits permitted on October 10, 1974, under the then
         existing Zoning Chapter of the City of San Bruno;
        Multi-story parking structures or buildings; or
        Buildings or other structures, modifications or redevelopment thereof which encroach
         upon, modify, widen, or realign the following streets hereby designated as scenic corri-
         dors:
        Crystal Springs Road between Oak Avenue and Junipero Serra Freeway, or
        Sneath Lane from El Camino Real to existing westerly City limits.
Each of the five restrictions under Ordinance 1284 may limit residential development within the
City. However, the City has built considerable amount of housing since 2003 (see Chapter 4)
while Ordinance 1284 has been in place.
In addition, during the 2000-2007 Housing Element cycle, the City took steps to address the
constraints posed by Ordinance 1284 and performed a legal analysis of the applicability of the
Ordinance in the Redevelopment Plan Area in 2005. The analysis revealed that while the
Ordinance 1284 limits the number of stories in a building to three, it does not specifically define a
story. Consequently, the City Council amended the Zoning Ordinance to define a “loft floor”
which opens to the space below separately from a “story” which does not, thus allowing extra
living space to be developed within the confines of the 50-foot height limit.
Overall, Ordinance 1284 is most restrictive to existing residential neighborhoods because of the
prohibition on increased densities on existing residentially zoned parcels (See below for a
description of the treatment of second units specifically). This is because the ordinance was
designed as a preservation measure. Ordinance 1284 is not viewed as a major constraint to
affordable housing development in this Housing Element, however, because most identified
housing opportunity sites are located in the TCP area where height limits have increased due to
the passage of Measure N, as described below. Height limits still apply in other parts of the City,
but in general the provisions of the ordinance are limited in scope and applicability for these
parcels. For instance, Ordinance 1284 does not prohibit any of the following along the target
corridors:
        Rezoning areas from commercial to residential use at any residential density standard;
        Permitting mixed-use development on commercially zoned properties at any residential
         density standard;
        Residential redevelopment on former school sites, consistent with zoning;
        Below ground (more than 50 percent below grade) parking facilities; and
        Proposed development regulated under State laws, such as density bonuses, etc.

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Due to the built-out nature of San Bruno, the ability to construct multi-story parking structures in
other parts of the City is limited less by this ordinance than by available parcel size. Most likely
candidates are located in the TCP area where development sites have the potential for
consolidation, such as the Citibank site adjacent to an existing City parking lot. The passage of
Measure N has removed the constraints to constructing above-ground multi-story parking
structures in the TCP area.
Potential constraints to housing development as a direct result of declaring Crystal Springs Road
and Sneath Lane as scenic corridors are also minimal. Major adjacent properties include the
Golden Gate National Cemetery, City Park, Junipero Serra County Park, and interstate highway
rights-of-way, all of which are already inappropriate locations for housing development.
Moreover, the designation of these two roadways does not prohibit development, but merely the
widening of the roadways themselves.
Although high densities are permitted by the General Plan along major corridors (with no limit on
density for individual development projects in the TOD designation), some development
professionals have indicated that the building height limit of Ordinance 1284 is a potential
constraint on the feasibility of developing high-density housing along commercial corridors
outside of the TCP area.
MEASURE N
The City Council placed a ballot measure, Measure N, the Economic Enhancement Initiative, on
the November 4, 2014 ballot to amend Ordinance 1284 and facilitate the implementation of the
Transit Corridors Plan. San Bruno voters approved Measure N overwhelmingly, with 67.3
percent of the vote. These new development standards will allow the development of multi-family
housing along major commercial streets within about ½-mile of the new San Bruno Caltrain
station.
Measure N modifies Ordinance 1284 to permit the following:
        Buildings exceeding the current 50-foot or three story maximum height as follows: up to
         70-feet or five stories along El Camino Real, building up to 65 feet or five stories along
         San Bruno Avenue, building up to 55 feet or four stories along San Mateo Avenue, and
         up to 90 feet or seven stories in the Caltrain station area.
        Rezoning of 42 low-density residential parcels to become a part of the TCP area and
         allow higher density residential development.
        Above-ground, multi-story parking garages.
While Ordinance 1284 is in effect, policies proposed in this Housing Element attempt to make
affordable housing development feasible whether or not Ordinance 1284 remains unchanged:
through financial and logistical support for lot consolidation (Program 2-E), reduced parking
requirements (Program 3-I), density bonus incentives (Program 5-B), fee waivers (Program 5-
F), modified development standards (Program 5-G), and other financing/subsidy strategies (e.g.
Program 5-D).
                                                                                           3-11

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
SECOND UNITS: ORDINANCE 1421 AND AB 1866
Ordinance 1421, adopted by City Council in 1983, was intended to preserve the existing scale
and character in established residential neighborhoods. Under the ordinance, only second units
constructed prior to June 1977 were permitted within the city due to safety, traffic congestion,
parking, and infrastructure concerns. However, the passage of AB 1866 in the California State
Assembly in 2002 conflicted with Ordinance 1421; AB 1866 mandates that as of July 1, 2003,
second unit applications are to be considered through ministerial process, without discretionary
review or hearing, according to an adopted City ordinance. AB 1866 stipulates that a City
ordinance may include “requirements relating to height, setback, lot coverage, architectural
review, site plan review, fees, charges, and other zoning requirements generally applicable to
residential construction in the zone in which the property is located” (California Government
Code 65852.2(b)(1)(G)). In other words, if all applicable zoning standards and procedures are
met, second units are to be ministerially approved in some residential areas of the City.
Therefore, in July 2003, San Bruno adopted a Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance pursuant to
California Government Code 65852.2. The ordinance, found in Section 12.92.031 of the City’s
Municipal Code, applies AB 1866 and sets standards for the development of second dwelling
units so as to increase the supply of smaller and affordable housing units while maintaining
compatibility with existing neighborhoods.
Permission to construct second units helps to ensure availability of affordable housing stock in
San Bruno while maintaining current zoning standards in residential districts and preventing
alteration of existing neighborhood character and scale. Program 5-J directs the City to
encourage second units in new single family neighborhoods to accommodate multi-generational
dwelling.
As a separate but related issue, Program 1-C continues the provision of information on how to
legalize second units developed prior to 1977 in R-1 and R-2 zones. During the current Housing
Element cycle (2007-2014), the City has successfully legalized 26 second units constructed prior
to June 30, 1977, through existing programs, and accomplished necessary life safety and
building code upgrades (with the work paid for by the homeowners). Continued legalization of
these units may also contribute a small proportion to the affordable units the City can count
toward its RHNA. Program 1-C also directs the City to develop a legalization process and
criteria for second units constructed between 1977 and 2003, while ensuring provision of
adequate parking.
DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
Generally, all projects undergo a development review process through the Planning Department
to ensure compatibility and safety of development throughout San Bruno. Permits and approvals
from the Building Department are also required. Projects that do not require a General Plan or a
zoning change do not need Planning Commission or City Council approval. The table below
summarizes the housing types permitted by zoning district. Table 3.1-3 summarizes the types of
permits required for housing projects and typical processing time. For non-conforming residential
projects—those requiring a conditional use permit and/or variance—the application is forwarded
to the Planning Commission upon recommendation by the Architectural Review Committee.

Depending on the conformity of a project application with the General Plan and the Zoning
Ordinance, and magnitude and complexity of a development proposal, the time that elapses
from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably. Factors which can affect
the length of development review on a proposed project include a rezoning or General Plan
amendment requirement, public meetings required for Planning Commission or City Council
review, or a required Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
For a typical single family (infill) unit, required planning review ranges from two to three months
and building review requires up to six weeks. A single family residential subdivision requires
three to six months for planning review, three months for engineering work, and three months for
building review. Multifamily developments generally require three to four months for planning
review and up to four months for building review. As Architectural Review is not required of
single family subdivisions but is required of multifamily housing developments, this could be seen
as a constraint to the development of affordable housing. However, the City is actively working to
mitigate this constraint through the development of the Downtown and Transit Corridors Plan,
which provides detailed development design standards and thereby increase certainty for
developers and streamline the building review process in the future. This is particularly important
in the transit corridors areas, because the vast majority of opportunity sites are in these corridors
and the planning effort represents the priority the City places on transit-oriented and compact,
efficient infill development. Program 2-B commits the City to working towards the
implementation of the Transit Corridors Plan. The City does not impose any additional fees or
burdens on multifamily development, supportive housing, transitional housing, SROs, or group
homes. Again, the development review process for all conforming residential development is the
same.

The length of San Bruno’s review process is comparable to other Bay Area cities and should not
be viewed as a constraint to housing development. Using a policy developed during the last
Housing Element cycle, the City expedited the permit process for 55 homes damaged during the
Glenview fire, and 308 apartments at Pacific Bay Vistas. To further encourage the development
of affordable housing, Housing Element Program 5-F continues this program of expediting
permit processing for very-low, low-, and moderate-income projects. The table below shows
typical processing procedures by type of project.

One way in which the City has expedited the review and approval of affordable housing projects
in the past is through specific planning, which was done for the former Navy Site. Because the
Specific Plan specified many requirements, such as environmental review, design guidelines,
and parking, individual projects built within the Specific Plan area were processed more quickly.
The City is currently working on the Downtown and Transit Corridors Plan, which will also be
designed to expedite the approval of projects that meet development standards and guidelines in
the area. Many of the opportunity sites identified in this document fall this new Plan area, so, in
effect, the City is already footing the bill for extensive pre-planning for these sites.

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
In order to increase approval certainty, San Bruno is working to clarify design criteria for project
approval through Program 2-A, Program 2-F, which concern the update of the Zoning
Ordinance to be consistent with the General Plan. Additionally, during the 2007-2014 housing
cycle, San Bruno adopted the Transit Corridors Plan, which streamlines the review process, and
will continue to be implemented through Program 2-B.
While the City’s General Plan and Zoning Ordinance brings uniformity and fairness to the
regulation of the community’s housing stock, they do not adequately address many unique
conditions that result from the city’s historic development patterns and great diversity. Therefore,
the City developed Residential Design Guidelines, implemented in 2010, to assist the staff,
Planning Commission, and City Council when considering exterior design of single-family and
two-family residences in the city that require discretionary approval or a building permit. The
design guidelines are intended to assist homeowners and builders in designing their projects
with sensitivity to their neighbors, and to communicate the community’s expectations regarding
new residential construction. The guidelines address important planning and design issues that
are not covered by the city’s primary regulatory documents, including enhancing the identity of
residential neighborhoods, assuring compatibility in scale of structures within residential
neighborhoods, controlling development of hillside lots, and encouraging the construction of
Green Buildings. The purpose of the design guidelines is not to be cost prohibitive but to
streamline the design review process by more clearly communicating community expectations to
property owners and builders.
COURT CASES
PALMER V. CITY OF LOS ANGELES (2009)
The California Court decision in Palmer v City of Los Angeles hinders San Bruno’s ability to
require affordable rental housing through the City’s Below Market Rate Housing Program. The
court ruled that local inclusionary housing programs cannot mandate rent restrictions in new
rental housing developments or require payment of in-lieu fees as an alternative. City staff is
participating in a countywide Nexus Study to potentially adopt an affordable housing impact fee
in place of the BMR ordinance.
FEES AND EXACTIONS
San Bruno has established fees for building permits and planning services for all residential
developments. As shown in Table 3.1-5, 2009 development fees for a model single family for-
sale home in a new subdivision total approximately $21,657, while those for a model multifamily
rental unit in an apartment complex total approximately $7,927. Other planning fees are listed in
Table 3.1-6, although they would not be applicable to a conforming residential project. These
costs are estimates of potential building and planning fees, and do not include environmental
review costs or the costs of providing new, or upgrading existing, infrastructure. However, they
represent reasonable development costs and are not viewed as a constraint to affordable
housing production. The building fees are still a small portion of overall housing development

LEED certified projects are eligible for up to a 10 percent reduction in permit fees. The City
Council may waive any fee in whole or in part based upon a showing of public purpose. A
comprehensive permit fee nexus study was performed in 2006.

                           Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Often, a majority of the cost for new homes in a conventional single family subdivision is a result
of the park in-lieu fee. However, this fee can be reduced or waived by providing on-site open
space and recreational facilities. The Zoning Ordinance requires dedication of two (2) acres of
parkland per 50 acres of residential subdivision (50 lots or more), or payment of in-lieu fees
equal to the market value of land at a rate of 4.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. It should
also be noted that the park in-lieu fee applies only to residential subdivisions. However, it is
assumed in this example that the developer would provide the park and recreational facilities
required by the Zoning Ordinance, and in most cases, the developer is given proportional credit
for the park and recreational facilities provided. The park in-lieu fee would be reduced or waived
for those opportunity sites on closed school locations which are developed to preserve existing
open space.

Below Market Rate Housing Ordinance and In-Lieu Fee
The construction of above-moderate income housing depletes the amount of available
residential land, while contributing to rising land prices because of increased scarcity of
developable sites. Market-rate housing development also exacerbates the affordable housing
challenge by creating more need for goods and services typically provided by low-wage
employees who need lower cost housing. In order to offset the negative effects of new market-
rate housing on the provision of non-market rate housing, to ensure the continued availability of
affordable housing, and to promote the economic integration of lower income households in
neighborhoods throughout the city, San Bruno adopted a Below Market Rate Housing Ordinance
in 2008. The Below Market Rate Housing Ordinance requires new residential developments of
10 or more units to provide a minimum of 15 percent of total units to very-low, low-, and
moderate-income households. For ownership housing, 40% of affordable units must be
affordable to low-income households and 60% must be affordable to moderate-income
households. For rental housing, 40% of affordable units must be affordable to very low-income
households and 60% must be affordable to low-income households. Although, as described on
page 3-15, the Palmer Court decision invalidated inclusionary requirements for rental housing,
and the City is exploring alternatives for the inclusion of affordable units in new rental
developments. The Ordinance requires that affordable units are comparable in number of
bedrooms, exterior appearance, and overall quality of construction to market rate units in the
same project.
The City’s first preference is for a developer to actually construct the affordable units; however,
the City Council may approve an in-lieu fee of $38,700 per single family detached unit and
$39,450 per multifamily unit if the new construction would be infeasible or present an
unreasonable hardship to the developer due to factors such as project size or site constraints.
The in-lieu fees are contributed to the City’s Below Market Rate Housing Trust Fund. Developers
have paid in-lieu fees totaling about $3.5 million instead of building the required affordable units
on site in 4 single family developments with a total of 97 units, or approximately $36,750 per unit
since 2008.
There has been extensive debate over the question of who bears the cost of an inclusionary
requirement. Depending on the relative strength of the housing market, the costs may be
incurred by:
        Land owners, who may receive a lower price for their land if developers are expecting a
         lower profit margin from the inclusionary requirement;
        Developers, who may have to accept lower profits if housing prices cannot be raised; or
        Purchasers of market-rate units, who may have to pay higher housing prices if the local
         and regional housing supply is limited and prices are at least as high in areas outside the
         City.
The fact that land-owners, developers, and/or purchasers of market-rate units may incur a
portion of the cost of providing affordable units may be construed as a constraint to the overall
development of housing in San Bruno. However, the City reduces this constraint by providing a
wide range of incentives to developers who provide affordable housing units. These incentives
include:
        Expedited processing for development applications;
        Planning and building fee waivers;

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
        Provision of State density bonuses; and
        Potential City subsidies for affordable housing in the Transit Corridors Plan Area.
Regarding Flexibility in Meeting BMR Requirements
San Bruno has built flexibility into the Below Market Rate Housing Ordinance. The City Council
may approve alternatives to the construction of new inclusionary units where the proposed
alternative supports specific housing element policies and goals (such as those for provision of
second units, or rehabilitation of older structures) and assists the City in meeting its state
housing requirements. Alternatives may include, but are not limited to:
        Construction of affordable units off-site;
        Acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable units;
        Conversion of existing market units to affordable units;
        Dedication of land to the City suitable for the construction of affordable units; and
        Construction of affordable second dwelling units.
The City’s first preference is for the actual construction of new affordable units. However, any
approval or conditional approval shall be based on a finding that:
        The net cost of the alternative is at least equal to the net cost to provide below market
         rate units; and
        New construction would be infeasible or present unreasonable hardship in light of such
         factors as project size, site constraints, market competition, price and product type dis-
         parity, developer capability, and financial subsidies available.
Evidence must be submitted to the City Manager or designee and included in the request for any
waiver of the construction of new affordable units.
The City encourages developers to apply for the State Density Bonus to reduce the impact of the
BMR requirement, including density bonus parking standards. For example, in 2009, the
supported reducing the parking requirement for a proposed 48-unit mixed-use project in the
downtown from the City standard of 2.1 per residential unit to 1.7 per unit, which would have
reduce the total by 20 spaces (applying a cost of $20-30,000 per structured parking space, a
savings of $2 to $3 million). Although that project was not constructed due to the economic
recession, it demonstrates the City’s commitment to facilitate the construction of affordable
housing.
Impacts on Timing, Cost, and Supply of Housing of BMR Requirements
During the development of the BMR Ordinance, San Bruno hired an economic consultant to
calculate reasonable in-lieu fees for new residential rental and ownership developments. This
analysis included assessment of impacts of the proposed in-lieu fees on the feasibility of
residential projects, and compared the parameters of San Bruno’s BMR Ordinance to
inclusionary requirements in neighboring jurisdictions. The analysis concluded that while San
Bruno’s Ordinance would make development projects in the city somewhat less profitable than
the status quo, the requirements would be within the range of practices in neighboring
jurisdictions. For example, the economic consultant found that 11 of the 21 jurisdictions in San
                                                                                               3-19

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Mateo County, have inclusionary ordinances. Nine of the 11 jurisdictions with ordinances require
15 percent or more affordable units, as does San Bruno. Ten of the 11 jurisdictions with
ordinances allow a fee to be paid in-lieu of the development of affordable units, as does San
Bruno.
Although the Below Market Rate Ordinance was only adopted in 2008, the inclusionary housing
policy has been applied to all new housing developments since the 2003 Housing Element was
adopted. As summarized on page 1-2 and described in more detail on page 4-2, the City has
met most of the RHNA housing objectives from the last cycle. The inclusionary policy has been
effective and there has been no evidence of a negative impact on the timing, cost, or supply of
housing in the city. For instance, the developer of the Merimont 70-unit single family project
negotiated a fee in-lieu of providing affordable units on site, and that project will be completed in
2010. A total of four projects have thus far negotiated payment of in-lieu fees because the sites
were located far from the transit corridors and in the midst of traditional single-family residential
neighborhoods. However, in the entitled downtown redevelopment project described in more
detail in Chapter 4, the affordable units are being provided on site because the location
specifically meets City goals for provision of affordable housing near transit and services.
Fees for Non-Conforming Projects
The development fees for non-conforming projects, as contained in Table 3.1-6, are not a
constraint to housing development. Residential uses are permitted by the new General Plan on
all of the City’s identified housing opportunity sites, so they would not require the higher
application fees associated with a General Plan or Zoning Ordinance amendment or from
Planned Development permits. In order to further encourage development of affordable housing,
the City has already adopted policies of waiving building and planning fees for development of
very-low, low-, and moderate-income housing. Programs 5-F and 5-G continue those policies
from the last Housing Element.

Comparison to Other San Mateo County Jurisdictions
According to the survey conducted by San Mateo County through its 21 Elements process, total
fees for single family housing vary significantly by jurisdiction from $15,300 to $50,500). San
Bruno’s total fees for single family housing thus fall below the average for jurisdictions in the
county.
According to the survey, total fees for 10-unit multifamily housing developments vary much more
dramatically than for single family developments, with a range from $529,000 to $2,405,000. In
this context, San Bruno’s fees associated with multifamily residential development are well below
the average across jurisdictions in the county.
INFRASTRUCTURE
The Network
As a built-out community, San Bruno’s infrastructure network has been extended to virtually
every corner of the city. All of the housing opportunity sites proposed in this Housing Element are
on existing developed property connected to all City services. Redevelopment of these infill sites
is not expected to require any infrastructure improvements by the City. Developers are required
to pay fees for service hook-ups and/or for their proportionate share of improvements to the
water treatment plant. The provision of on-site improvements, such as streets, curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, landscaping, drainage, water, and sewer infrastructure, are standard conditions of
development approval and have not been barriers to affordable housing development in the
                                                                                                                     3-21

Infrastructure costs are incorporated into the total residential development project costs
discussed under Market Constraints, below.
Water Supply
According to the San Bruno Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) (2007), the City receives
water from two major supply sources: wholesale surface water from the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) Regional Water System and local groundwater from the Westside
Basin. San Bruno has historically used SFPUC regional water to meet demands that could not
otherwise be met through local groundwater production. In the fiscal year 2004-2005, San Bruno
total water demand was 3.76 million gallons per day (mgd), which comes roughly to .00009415
mgd per capita. Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 2.25 mgd, or 55 percent of the City’s
total supply, was purchased as part San Bruno’s normal SFPUC purchases.
Back in 1984 San Bruno signed a Settlement Agreement and Master Water Sales Contract
(Master Contract) with San Francisco, supplemented by an individual Water Supply Contract.
These contracts provide San Bruno a Supply Assurance of 3.25 mgd. Although the Master
Contract and accompanying Water Supply Contract expired in 2009, the Supply Assurance
(which quantified San Francisco’s obligation to supply water to its individual wholesale
customers) survives their expiration and continues indefinitely.
Table 3.1-7 below roughly compares the total water demand projected and accommodated in the
City’s UWMP for 2015 to an estimate of the population and water demand that may result in
2014 from adding the RHNA allocation to today’s (2008) population. As can be seen in the table,
the UWMP was designed to accommodate a higher future population than is likely to occur even
if all of this Housing Element’s RHNA or Quantified Objectives (next chapter) are constructed this
cycle. As such, water supply is not expected to be a constraint to future housing development.

Waste Water Treatment
San Bruno jointly owns the South San Francisco-San Bruno Water Quality Control Plant whose
dry-weather treatment capacity is 13 mgd. During dry weather San Bruno currently uses about
30 percent of plant capacity, or 3.9 mgd. There is no formal agreement as to the proportion of
water treatment capacity entitled to each city, however, assuming fulfilling the RHNA represents
a population increase of about 7 percent3, and assuming that per capita waste water treatment
need remains unchanged, by 2014 San Bruno need would have increased by 7 percent to 4.2
mgd, or 32 percent of plant dry weather capacity. Waste water treatment is therefore not
expected to be a constraint to housing development during this RHNA cycle.
Solid Waste Disposal
San Bruno has been diverting at least 50 percent of solid waste from landfill since 2000.
Materials that are not recycled are transported to the 173-acre Ox Mountain facility, a Class III
(non-hazardous) facility managed by San Mateo County and serving other jurisdictions as well.
While the County anticipates the landfill to reach capacity in 2017, an expansion is underway
that is expected to extend capacity for an additional eight years. San Bruno does not anticipate
RHNA housing development to be constrained by solid waste disposal capacity.
BUILDING CODE AND ENFORCEMENT
The City has adopted the California Building, Building Conservation, Mechanical, Plumbing,
Electrical, and Fire codes and the California Energy Efficiency Standards as the basis of its
building standards. The City has also adopted the Uniform Code for the Abatement of
Dangerous Buildings. Permits are required for all electrical and plumbing work, and other major
home improvements and modifications. San Bruno has several requirements in addition to the
standard California Codes. These include:
        Complete removal of old roof materials required before replacement.
        Minimum roof quality required is Class B.
        Addition of sprinklers required in the rehabilitation of any building over 7,500 square feet.
        Noise insulation required for residential structures within the 65 dB community noise
         equivalent level (CNEL) or greater (necessary to meet Federal Aviation Administration
         standards).
In general, the City’s building codes represent basic construction standards within the State of
California and thus do not place an undue burden on the construction or rehabilitation of
affordable housing. The one exception to this may be the noise insulation requirement. However,
noise insulation is federally required in areas where noise levels meet or exceed 65 dB CNEL.
It may be costly to rehabilitate or remodel older buildings that were constructed under less
stringent building codes. San Mateo County offers a loan program enabling owners of such
buildings to achieve contemporary building standards, yet still maintain affordability.

FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
The enactment of ABx1 26 dissolved all redevelopment agencies in California on February 1,
2012, and created successor agencies to wind down their operations. Low and Moderate Income
Housing (LMIH) tax increment generated from the San Bruno Redevelopment Project Area was
the City’s main source of funding for affordable housing. San Bruno had one Redevelopment
Project Area, which was established in July 1999. During its 13 years of operation, the
Redevelopment Agency facilitated the development of 97 units affordable to very low income
households. The City monitors new state legislation that may restore some state funding for
affordable housing.
HOUSING CHOICES VOUCHER PROGRAM
The Housing Choices Voucher Program (formerly Section 8) is government assistance to help
low-income families obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. Under certain circumstances,
the program may also be used to assist the household in purchasing a home. Families that
receive vouchers can select units with rents that are either below or above market rate. The
recipient of the voucher is responsible for finding appropriate housing within the private market.
The federal government’s Housing and Urban Development Department (HUD) mandates that
the voucher recipient household must pay 30 percent of its monthly adjusted gross income for
rent and utilities. HUD, through the County Housing Authority, then pays the remainder of the
rent directly to the landlord. If the household chooses a unit where costs are greater than market
rate, the voucher recipient is expected to pay the additional amount. Fiscal Year 2013 HUD-
established fair market monthly rents for San Mateo County are $1,191 for studios, $1,551 for
one-bedroom units, $1,956 for two-bedroom units, $2,657 for three-bedroom units and $3,212
for four-bedroom units.
San Mateo County has received 4,322 vouchers from the federal government, all of which are
utilized, and many people on the waiting list.
Program Advantages
On-Time payments: The Housing Choices Voucher Program offers real estate investors
guarantees and safeguards unmatched by the private sector rental market. The government
pays on-time, every time. It arrives in the mail the first of the month every month. This alone may
outweigh all negatives from the perspective of a landlord.
Longer contracts: The program lease agreements are typically 1- and sometimes 2-year
contracts. Although the tenant can attempt to break the lease and move, he/she must first locate
the new property and go through the entire approval process again. The general rule is that if the
investor keeps up the property, tenants tend to stay the length of the contract and often will
renew to avoid having to go through the hassles of placement all over again.
Good Tenants: Generally speaking, program tenants tend to be good tenants. Most tenants
waited and worked hard to qualify for their vouchers and complaints to the housing authority
against the tenant could result in the tenant losing his/her voucher.

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Program Disadvantages
Difficulty of move-in: Often times, it is a lengthy process of paperwork and inspections before
the tenant can move in and start paying. Some housing authorities are better than others and it
depends on how quickly paperwork is submitted, inspections pass, etc.
Wear and tear: Most program tenants have large families and limited work, which means they
are at home more often than a working family with fewer children. As a result, the property
experiences more wear and tear.
Through Housing Element Program 3-B San Bruno will continue to support and participate in
this program.
3.2       FUNDING SOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING
This section describes several local, State, and federal housing programs that provide financial
assistance to very-low, low- and moderate-income households for monthly housing costs, home
rehabilitation, and down payment assistance.
FEDERAL RESOURCES
        Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). Annual direct grants provided to met-
         ropolitan areas and urban counties to revitalize neighborhoods, expand affordable hous-
         ing opportunities, and/or improve community facilities and services. The grants are
         aimed to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. In San Mateo County, CDBG funds
         are split between community development and housing development programs. The
         County received approximately $2.4 million in CDBG for Fiscal Year 2013-2014. Funds
         are shared among 16 cities within the County and the County unincorporated area. No
         funding was specifically allocated to San Bruno in Fiscal Year 2014-15.
        HOME Investment Partnerships Program. Federally funded program for use by the
         State for housing rehabilitation, tenant-based rental assistance, assistance to homebuy-
         ers, housing acquisition, and new housing construction. San Mateo County received ap-
         proximately $900,000 in HOME funds for Fiscal Year 2009-2010-.
        Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). Created by HUD in 1997, allocates the
         equivalent of approximately $5 billion annually to state and local agencies in tax credits
         for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of rental housing for low-income house-
         holds. In California, credits are administered by the California Tax Credit Allocation
         Committee (CTCAC). 22 affordable housing developments have been constructed in San
         Mateo County using LIHTC since 2003, comprising 1,365 units, but none have been in
         San Bruno.
        HUD Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) Technical Assistance
         Program. Provides technical assistance to promote the development of housing and
         supportive services as part of the Continuum of Care approach, and to enable local juris-
         dictions to better understand the scope and dimensions of homelessness in their com-
         munities so that they may address the issue and provide services more effectively.
        Emergency Shelter Grants. Federally funded program for use by states, metropolitan
         cities, and urban counties for the rehabilitation or conversion of buildings for use as
         emergency shelter and for homeless prevention activities. San Mateo County received
                                                                                              3-25

                           City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                          Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
       approximately $199,000 in Emergency Solutions Grant funds for Fiscal Year 2013-2014.
       The County dedicates all of its Emergency Shelter Grant funding to two agencies, Sa-
       maritan Housing and Innvision Shelter Network, which operate several homeless shel-
       ters and other types of social service assistance in communities on the San Francisco
       Peninsula.
      203k Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance. A tool for neighborhood revitalization and
       expansion of homeownership opportunities, HUD’s 203k Rehabilitation Mortgage Insur-
       ance programs insure the cost of rehabilitation of newly purchased homes that are at
       least a year old and fall within the FHA mortgage limit for the area. The 203k Streamline
       Limited Repairs program allows homeowners to refinance $35,000 into their mortgages
       to pay for less extensive improvements or upgrades to a home before move-in.
STATE RESOURCES
To ensure that lack of housing for California’s workforce does not derail economic activity, the
State maintains numerous housing programs including:
      California Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Augments the federal LIHTC
       program through allocation of additional tax credits for affordable housing rehabilitation
       and production. State tax credits are only available to projects that have previously re-
       ceived or are concurrently receiving federal tax credits, so the program does not stand
       alone. The 2009 cap for state tax credits is $85 million.
      Multifamily Housing Program. Provides deferred payment loans local public entities or
       nonprofit organizations for the purpose of construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of
       permanent and transitional housing for low-income households. Loans have a term of 55
       years with 3 percent interest and 0.42 percent payments due annually.
      Downtown Rebound Capital Improvement Program. Provides financing to revitalize
       downtowns and neighborhoods, reduce development pressure of agricultural and open
       space resources, and provide working families with options to live close to their jobs.
       Funding is through the Multifamily Housing Program.
      California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) First-Time Homebuyer Programs.
       Provides a variety of programs and assistance for eligible first-time homebuyers, includ-
       ing low-interest loans and down payment assistance. However, due to current State
       budget shortfalls, many of these programs are temporarily unavailable, including conven-
       tional 30-year fixed mortgage loans, the 30-year government insured/guaranteed mort-
       gage, the California Homebuyer Down payment Assistance Program (CHDAP), and the
       Extra Credit Teacher Home Purchase Program (ECTP).
      Inter-Regional Partnership Program. Between 2001 and 2004, provided grants to in-
       ter-regional consortia of two or more governments, two or more subregions within a mul-
       ti-county council of governments, or a county working collaboratively with the State or
       federal government, to develop, evaluate and implement policies and incentives to miti-
       gate current or future imbalances of jobs and housing. Grants were to be used for devel-
       opment of implementation plans, to promote jobs in residential communities and housing
       in “job rich” communities. Eight Inter-Regional Partnerships (IRPs) were funded by the
       program, and results from the projects are still being published. ABAG, of which San
       Bruno is a part, has been a leading participant.

                           Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
      Supportive Housing Initiative Act (SHIA). Administered by the Department of Mental
       Health, the intent of this initiative is to provide the incentive and leverage for local gov-
       ernments, the nonprofit sector, and the private sector to invest resources that expand
       and strengthen supportive housing opportunities. SHIA targets very-low income Califor-
       nians with disabilities such as mental illness, HIV and Aids, chemical dependency, and
       other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the
       Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, and may include families with chil-
       dren, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, CalWORKS par-
       ticipants, individuals exiting from institutional settings, or homeless people (AB 2780,
       Statutes of 1998, Chapter 310). SHIA grant money can be used to provide both an array
       of supportive services to clients in housing and for the housing itself, including leasing or
       operating costs.
      Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Housing Program. Provides funding to stimu-
       late the production of higher density housing and related infrastructure within close prox-
       imity to qualifying transit stations that encourages increased public transit ridership and
       minimizes automobile trips. Provide loans for rental housing development and land ac-
       quisition for proposed housing development; grants for infrastructure that supports hous-
       ing or facilitates connectivity to transit from one or more specific housing developments;
       or mortgage assistance for first-time low or moderate income homebuyers. All eligible
       projects must be within ¼ mile of a qualifying transit station, be at least 50 units in size,
       and include at least 15 percent of total residential units as restricted units for at least 55
       years. Maximum loan, grant or combination of the two for a single development is $17
       million. Maximum assistance for applications based on a single qualifying transit station
       is $50 million over the life of the program.
      Housing Enabled by Local Partnerships (HELP). Administered by the California Hous-
       ing Finance Agency to local governments, HELP aims to provide affordable housing op-
       portunities through program partnerships with local governments. However, as of March
       2008, HELP has been temporarily suspended due to declining applications from munici-
       palities and funding constraints.
LOCAL RESOURCES
San Bruno participates in, distributes information about, and/or refers residents and project
proponents to the following San Mateo County programs:
      San Bruno Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Fee Fund. The City collects affordable
       housing in lieu fees for projects that do not provide the required affordable housing units
       on site in accordance with the City’s BMR Housing Program. The fee can only be col-
       lected in for-sale developments, as the Palmer court decision has invalidated the afford-
       able rental requirements of inclusionary housing in California. The City has collected ap-
       proximately $3.5 million in BMR fees. Program 3-A commits the City to developing a
       strategy for the use of these funds to create and preserve affordable housing in San Bru-
       no.
      Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART) of San Mateo County. HEART’S
       mission is to raise funds from public and private sources to finance affordable housing in
       San Mateo County through loans to developers and homebuyers. As of Spring 2009,
       HEART had raised nearly $10 million and invested in nearly 650 new housing units. Over
       $7 million of the funds have come from public sources, including HCD, San Mateo Coun-
                                                                                             3-27

                             Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
        ty, CalHFA, and dues from member cities. HEART contributed $1.76 million to the Village
        at the Crossing.
       San Mateo County Home Loan Assistance Programs. The County has administered
        two different mortgage assistance programs for moderate- and low-income first-time
        homebuyers as well as a housing rehabilitation loan program for both rental and owner-
        occupied housing that is occupied by very-low and low-income households. The
        Start/StartPLUS Down Payment Assistance Program is a special low-interest, deferred-
        payment loan program for first-time homebuyers that allows deferral of principal and in-
        terest payments for the first five years of the loan. A 5 percent down payment is typically
        required. However, the program is currently unavailable due to lack of funding. The
        Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, also for first-time homebuyers, provides federal in-
        come tax credits equal to 15 percent of annual mortgage interest. Buyers must have a
        maximum gross income of $95,000 for a one- or two-person household and $109,250 for
        a three or more person household. Between 25 and 30 credit certificates were made
        available starting June 2008.
       FOCUS Priority Development Areas. The FOCUS program, a joint effort of the four re-
        gional planning entities in the Bay Area (Association of Bay Area Governments, Metro-
        politan Transportation Commission, Bay Conservation and Development Commission,
        and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District), aims to develop a region-wide strat-
        egy for development and conservation. As part of the program, cities can apply for Priori-
        ty Development Area (PDA) status for infill opportunity areas within existing communities,
        where they would like to see new housing and development along transit corridors. PDA-
        designated places are then eligible for technical assistance, planning grants, and capital
        funding from the regional agencies. San Bruno has earned “potential” PDA status for 700
        acres along its three transit corridors (San Bruno Avenue, San Mateo Avenue, and El
        Camino Real). Nearly all of the housing sites identified in this Element are within or near
        the PDA.

        Commission, this Program seeks to maximize public investments in the transit infrastruc-
        ture, encourage transit use, and address regional housing needs. In the third cycle of the
        program (FY 2007-08 – 2008-09), 11 projects have received funding totaling $16.7 mil-
        lion. Two projects are in San Mateo County (Daly City and South San Francisco).
Additionally, the Human Investment Project for Housing (HIP), a local non-profit organization,
administers several assistance programs, including the Self Sufficiency Program, which provides
housing assistance to low-income families who are currently enrolled in education or job training
programs. Rebuilding Together Peninsula, another local nonprofit, provides free home repairs
and rehabilitation for eligible low-income seniors, families, and persons with disabilities.
3.3       ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Environmental factors such as topography, soils, and seismic hazards, noise, and storm flooding
are constraints to housing development in the city. In some cases, development is entirely
precluded due to human health and safety risks or environmental sensitivity. In other cases,
environmental constraints can be mitigated through appropriate residential design. None of

                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
these environmental constraints disproportionately impacts affordable housing, and policies are
provided in the San Bruno 2025 General Plan to specifically address each of these issue areas
in the context of all potential types of development. The updated General Plan provides maps of
floodplains, wildfire hazards, geologic hazards, and other natural resource constraints to
development throughout the city. None of the housing opportunity sites fall in a flood or wildfire
hazard zone, and none of the sites were found to contain special status wildlife species or their
habitat. Redevelopment of these corridors as mixed-use and transit-oriented development was
analyzed at a programmatic level in the EIR on the General Plan Update. A summary of
pertinent findings is included below.
AIRPORT NOISE
Ambient noise is a major concern in San Bruno due to the proximity of three freeways (Highway
101, and interstates 380 and 280), Caltrain and BART tracks, and the flight paths of SFO. The
eastern portions of the city closest to SFO are most affected by noise from overhead flight
patterns. Average noise levels are measured by decibels (dB) and community noise equivalent
levels (CNEL). At a noise level of 65-69 dB CNEL, new residential development is required to
have noise reduction analysis and noise insulation as needed. At 70 dB CNEL and above, new
residential development is prohibited, which essentially means that new residential development
and/or redevelopment cannot be allowed in the areas surrounding the BART and Caltrain
stations, as well as in portions of the Belle Air Park North neighborhood. None of the sites
identified in this Housing Element fall within the 70 dB airport noise contour; however, several
are within the 65 dB contour, meaning that noise insulation on new housing construction will be
held to the higher standards defined for those areas in the San Bruno 2025 General Plan. This
additional noise insulation may incur somewhat higher costs for development relative to
development on adjacent parcels outside the 65 dB CNEL area.
GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
Geologic hazards, including landslides, mudslides, and erosion, can be related to seismic activity
but can also occur independently. The potential for future landslides is low east of Interstate 280
and west of Skyline Boulevard, and is low to moderate (with some pockets of high potential) in
the Crestmoor and Rollingwood/Monte Verde neighborhoods. Areas of the highest potential for
landslides are in Junipero Serra County Park and along the Park’s eastern edge.
The active San Andreas Fault runs in a northwesterly-southeasterly direction through western
San Bruno, roughly along Skyline Boulevard. Two inactive faults—Serra and San Bruno—are
also present in the western and eastern portions of the city. Because of its active status, surface
rupture potential is considered moderate to high along the San Andreas Fault and in western
San Bruno. A strong earthquake along the Fault could result in moderate to severe damage of
nearby structures. Soils and subsurface materials east of Skyline Boulevard have good
earthquake stability. Soils in the vicinity of Pacific Heights, Skyline College, and parts of the
Crestmoor neighborhood have poor to good earthquake stability. Eastern portions of the city that
are located on filled marsh lands may experience damage from soil liquefaction in the event of
an earthquake.
The San Andreas Fault Special Studies Zone runs roughly along either side of Skyline
Boulevard. State law requires cities and counties to regulate development within such zones and
precludes construction of a structure for human occupancy, except certain wood-frame single-
family dwellings, on an active fault trace or within 50 feet of an active fault. This is not considered
                                                                                               3-29

                           City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                           Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
to be a constraint, because none of the housing opportunity sites in this Housing Element are in
earthquake zones.
STORM FLOODING
Occasional flooding occurs in low-lying areas in the eastern portion of San Bruno, which consists
of filled marshlands. Flooding occurs in these areas because of old storm drain infrastructure
and low elevation, which subjects the areas to tidal influences. Spot flooding can occur in
residential areas if debris blocks the city’s drainage channels. High tide combined with heavy
rains results in storm flooding adjacent to residential areas in the eastern portions of the city.
This is not considered to be a constraint because none of the housing opportunity sites in this
Housing Element are within flood zones.
San Bruno notes recent statutory changes to Government Code Section 65302 (Chapter 369,
Statutes 207 [AB 162]) which requires amendment of the safety and conservation elements of
the general plan to include analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management
information upon the next revision of the housing element on, or after, January 1, 2009. As the
General Plan contains maps, analysis, and policies regarding flood hazards and management
described in AB 162; and as the General Plan was updated, adopted, and CEQA-certified in
March 2009; and as the General Plan has been a primary resource for the preparation of this
Housing Element, therefore the City holds this Housing Element to be consistent with the newest
and best information on flood hazards in San Bruno, pursuant to AB 162.
3.4       MARKET AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Market constraints significantly affect the cost of housing and can pose barriers to housing
production and affordability.
VACANT/UNDERDEVELOPED LAND
San Bruno is located in an urbanized portion of San Mateo County and has no unconstrained
vacant land on which new housing can be constructed. Steep slopes and seismic constraints
limit development in the hilly western portions of the city, while the central and eastern portions
have been built out since the 1960s. New development over the last seven years has been
limited to redevelopment opportunities such as the reuse of the former U.S. Navy Site (1,063
units), reuse of the Carl Sandburg Elementary School site (70 units), reuse of a former church
property at Cedar Mills (14 units) and reuse of the former Skycrest Center (24 units). As part of
the development of the Transit Corridors Plan, redevelopment and intensification opportunities
have been identified along the City’s main commercial corridors: the sites identified in this
Housing Element are located along El Camino Real (Highway 82), San Mateo Avenue, and San
Bruno Avenue. Parcels are relatively small, but because of high densities permitted, significant
project sizes can be achieved even on small sites, and in many cases sites are adjacent to each
other and could be assembled into a larger development opportunity site. Opportunity sites are
discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
OVERCOMING CHALLENGES OF SMALL SITES
San Bruno recognizes the challenges associated with building affordable housing on small sites.
Of the over 60 parcels listed as housing opportunity sites in the next chapter, the majority are
already consolidated under existing ownership into lots that are about one acre in size or larger.
3-30

                            City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                            Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
Furthermore, the City has demonstrated progress in existing Program 1-F designed to conserve
and expand the supply of small (non-conforming) residential lots. The General Plan allows
development density/intensity to increase with the size of the development site, which
encourages lot consolidation.        The passage of AB 26 and the loss of redevelopment funds
mean that the City can no longer use tax increment funds for land assembly.
RESIDENTIAL LAND COSTS
Because San Bruno is a virtually built-out city where residences and businesses have been
established for many years, very few sales transactions of raw land take place in a given year. A
search for land transactions on RedFin revealed just three land sales (of underutilized sites for
redevelopment) in San Bruno over the past three years; sale prices ranged from $400,000 to
$2.9 million (inflation adjusted), or $28.51 to $61.78/acre (inflation adjusted).. All of these sites,
including those in San Bruno, are designated for mixed-use development in the new General
Plan; their commercial zoning will be updated to reflect new General Plan designations during
the comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update in the next year.
Land costs in San Mateo County are high, due in part to the desirability of housing in the county,
and because available land is in short supply. These costs vary both between and within
jurisdictions based on factors like the desirability of the location and the permitted density. It is
anticipated that land costs within the City’s Priority Development Area will increase over time as
new development replaces existing, older land uses, infrastructure improvements take place and
the desirability of living closer to transit and amenities increases. Rising land values resulting
from the area becoming more desirable, may lead to increased market rents. This may impact
existing lower-income residents through increased housing costs, housing overpayment,
overcrowding, and deteriorating housing conditions (with lower income households
disproportionately having to locate in substandard conditions), resulting in direct displacement,
caused by the redevelopment of sites with existing residential properties, or indirect, caused by
increasing rents.
The Housing Element includes a number of programs to address the issue of displacement of
lower income residents, including (list programs from your housing element), that will strive to
minimize displacement of lower income residents. In addition, new Program 5-H commits the
City to participate in a San Mateo Countywide effort to evaluate potential strategies to address
displacement.
CONSTRUCTION COSTS
The following land costs are approximate, and derived from conversations with local developers.
For a typical multi-family construction in San Mateo County, land costs add approximately
$90,000 per unit. Land for a single-family home often costs $400,000 or more per lot.
Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft costs, such as
architectural and engineering services, development fees and insurance. For multi-family homes
in San Mateo County, hard costs account of 60-65 percent of the building cost and soft costs
average around 15-20 percent (the remaining 15-20 percent is land costs). For single family
homes, hard costs often are roughly 40 percent of the total cost, soft costs are 20 percent, and
land is 40 percent.
                                                                                             3-31

                             City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                             Chapter 3: Housing Constraints and Resources
According to housing developers in San Mateo County, construction costs for multi-unit buildings
vary based on the form of parking (structured vs. surface) in addition to other environmental
factors such as topography, pre-existing structures etc. For a larger, multi-unit building, costs
can vary from $185,000/unit to as high as $316,000/unit. The cost per square foot ranges from
$172-$200.
For the least expensive production single-family homes, the cost of preparing the vacant land is
around $100,000/lot, and the cost of construction is approximately $145/sf. For more expensive,
custom homes, however, the construction costs can be higher than $435/sf. In general, soft
costs add another approximate third to the subtotal.
Without subsidies, new for-profit housing is likely to be unaffordable to extremely-low, very-low,
and low-income households, and some moderate-income households. Reductions in amenities
and lower-quality building materials can reduce sales and rental prices, but minimum building
and safety standards must be maintained. In certain cases, greater density can increase the
affordability of residential projects by reducing per-unit costs. Reduced parking requirements can
also make housing more affordable (particularly for multifamily housing).
MORTGAGE FINANCING
Until mid-2008, home mortgage financing was readily available at attractive rates throughout San
Mateo County and California. Rates vary, but ranged around 6.25 percent to seven percent from
2006-2008 for a 30 year fixed rate loan (HSH Associates Financial Publishers). However, rates
have been as high as ten or 12 percent in the last decade.
As part of the aftermath of the subprime crisis in 2008, interest rates are very low. In San Mateo
County, rates range from 4.0-4.5 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage. One remaining
challenge is that many mortgages in San Mateo County are for more than $417,000, meaning
they qualify as jumbo loans and often have higher interest rates.
The data in the table below is from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and represents
loan applications in 2012 for of one- to four-unit properties, as well as manufactured homes.
More than 65 percent of the loan applications were filed by households earning above a
moderate income (greater than 120 percent of AMI). Moderate income households (80-120
percent of AMI) represented 18 percent of loan applicants, low income households (50-80
percent of AMI) represent 12 percent, and very low income households (less than 50 percent of
AMI) only 4 percent. Almost 75 percent of all loans were approved and accepted by the
applicants, and 10 percent were denied. Above moderate-income households had the highest
rates of approval of any group. Loan approval rates have improved since the subprime crisis.

CONSTRUCTION FINANCING
Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In past years,
lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to value ratio). In
recent years, due to market conditions and government regulations, banks require larger
investments by the builder.
Due to Federal and state budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a much harder
time securing funding. Since 2009, the Federal Government has cut programs such as
Community Development Block Grants, HOME, and HOPE VI funding by 27-50 percent (ABAG).
Traditionally, these programs have been a large source of affordable housing funds. In addition
to Federal cuts, the State dissolved Redevelopment agencies in 2012, leaving San Mateo
County with a loss of $25.5 million in funds for affordable housing. However, Low Income
Housing Tax Credits still provide an important source of funding, so it is important for
jurisdictions to consider which sites are eligible for affordable housing development. MidPen
Housing has agreed to help jurisdictions identify appropriate sites.

4 Land Inventory & Quantified Objectives
This chapter is designed to address the requirements of Government Code sections 65583(a)(3)
and (c)(1), and 65583.2. It describes the inventory of land in San Bruno that is suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and underutilized sites with the potential for
redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of the General Plan, zoning, and public
facilities and services to these sites. Here the realistic development capacity for the planning
period is determined. Quantified housing construction and rehabilitation objectives are identified
for extremely-low, very-low, low-, moderate-, and above-moderate income households. An
important conclusion of this chapter is that San Bruno will need to implement a program to
rezone sites to provide enough realistic development capacity to accommodate its RHNA.
Therefore, a program to rezone sites within the Transit Corridors Specific Plan area (Program 2-
A) is an integral part of this Housing Element because it ensures consistency between the
General Plan, the Housing Element, and the Zoning Ordinance and also provides for additional
sites that go beyond the baseline RHNA need.
4.1     EXISTING LAND USE SUMMARY
San Bruno’s gross acreage (all land uses including streets and roads) is approximately 3,600
acres. The majority (approximately 52 percent) of San Bruno’s net land area (excluding streets
and roads) is devoted to residential uses, with land used for single-family residences comprising
the great majority (44 percent of total). Commercial and industrial/auto-related land uses make
up approximately 8 percent and 2 percent of San Bruno’s net land area, respectively. Of these,
regional retail uses occupy the greatest area. Public and quasi-public land uses make up
approximately 20 percent of the city’s net land area. This public/quasi-public count is high due to
several non-local government uses, including the Golden Gate National Cemetery and Marine
Reserves Center. Parks and open space make up about 13 percent of the city’s net land area.
Around two percent of the city’s net land area is vacant land and surface parking lots.
EXISTING RESIDENTIAL AREAS
The majority of San Bruno’s land area consists of residential use, and neighborhoods are its
most prominent feature. The city’s older, eastern half (east of I-280) contains the greatest
diversity of land uses and residential types. Streets in this relatively flat area are organized in a
grid pattern that reflects their early 20th century roots. San Bruno’s newer, western half is
comprised primarily of single-family subdivisions, but also several large multifamily complexes.
The curvilinear street pattern in this area, commonly used in post-1950 residential subdivisions,
is adapted to the steep, hilly terrain.
Citywide, San Bruno’s average residential density is 10.6 housing units per net acre. East of El
Camino Real mixed single and multifamily neighborhoods average 16.3 housing units per net
acre. Single-family neighborhoods between El Camino Real and I-280 average 10.5 housing
units per net acre, with the notable exception of the Crossing development, which averages 50-
60 units per acre. West of I-280 in lower-density hillside neighborhoods residential densities
average 6.7 housing units per net acre. Aside from the Crossing, the other large multifamily
complexes average 29.1 housing units per net acre.
The approved Transit Corridors Specific Plan provides for 1,610 new housing units in the roughly
150-acre TCP area along the City’s main commercial corridors surrounding the new San Bruno
                                                                                              4-1

Avenue Caltrain Station. San Bruno voters passed Measure N on November 4, 2014, which
enacts TCP recommended increased maximum building heights and residential density allowing
the full amount of housing envisioned in the Plan. The City will complete the Zone Code update
to establish the mixed use zoning standards for the area and new development standards in
accordance with Measure N.
SUMMARY OF 2007-2014 HOUSING PRODUCTION
Effectiveness of the Housing Element
Approximately 764 housing units were approved and constructed between 2007 and 2014 in
San Bruno over the last Housing Element was. Table 4.1-1 summarizes these housing
production achievements in San Bruno over the last Housing Element cycle. This table provides
evidence of San Bruno’s good faith effort to facilitate housing development for all economic
levels within the city. Not only was most of the total RHNA need accommodated, but in San
Bruno all of the moderate income and 16 units of lower income housing need were actually
constructed. This was achieved despite delays in the update of the Zoning Ordinance.
Regarding Government Code Section 65584.09, San Bruno is under no obligation to rezone to
accommodate unmet need during the last cycle.

ASSISTED HOUSING SUPPLY
As described in Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment, San Bruno has three assisted housing
developments1, Avalon1, completed in 2005; Avalon2, completed in 2007; and Village at the
Crossing, also completed in 2007, all of which were built before the last Housing Element cycle.
All three projects are rental apartments; the two Avalon developments (formerly named
Archstone I and II) are for all household types with a total of 485 units of which 97 are affordable
to very low-income households and the Village at the Crossing is for senior households only with
228 units, all of which are affordable to low, very low, and extremely low-income seniors. None of
these assisted units are at risk of conversion during this Housing Element cycle.
San Bruno had one housing development with affordability covenants that expired during the last
Housing Element cycle. The 308-unit TreeTops apartment complex was vacated in 2005 due to
severe mold problems and remained closed until the complex was renovated in 2013. Treetops
had 62 restricted units for lower income households whose affordability covenants expired in
2013. For a more detailed analysis of the risk of conversion, please see Chapter 2.
Program 3-C ensures maintenance of affordability requirements at new assisted housing
developments; 55 years for assisted rental units and 45 years for assisted ownership units, after
initial occupation, and directs staff to annually reconcile the number of assisted units in the city to
ensure that all available affordable units are filled by low-income families. Program 3-J commits
the City to adopting an affordable housing impact fee based on the nexus study that is being
prepared in cooperation with a number of cities in San Mateo County. The City will also consider
an affordable housing commercial linkage fee which is being analyzed in the same study. The
impact fees would fill a gap created when the Palmer court decision invalidated the City’s rental
housing inclusionary program.
4.2       HOUSING PRODUCTION UNDERWAY
ENTITLED AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Approximately 120 housing units are in the pipeline as of the start of this Housing Element cycle
(June 30, 2014). This production underway is summarized in Table 4.2-1 (projects under
construction) and Table 4.2-2 (pipeline approvals) below, and contributes to meeting the new
RHNA obligation. This pipeline housing production is expected to be built within this Housing
Element cycle.
The majority of pipeline units are expected in one project, an 83-unit mixed-use development in
downtown San Bruno, called the Plaza apartments, and approved in October 2014. The Plaza is
also expected to accommodate a portion of the moderate-income needs based on the actual
affordability. The Plaza development has a TOD General Plan designation, which does not place
a maximum density on individual projects, and will be rezoned as part of the approval process.
The project is designed at 85 units to the acre, substantially higher than the default density for
San Bruno. The project consists of 45 one-bedroom and 38 two-bedroom units.
In order to determine reasonable market-rate prices for the Plaza units, comparison prices were
retrieved online 44 units in 6 apartment complexes listed for the open market in San Bruno
(October 2014), which were assumed to be market rates. The market rental rates for one-
1 Avalon1 and 2 were formerly known as Meridian and Paragon, then Archstone I and II.

                         Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
bedroom apartments range from $1,600 to $3,000/month with a median of $2,300, while the two-
bedroom apartments range from $2,000 to 3,900/month with a median of $2,740.
According to San Mateo County 2014 Income Limits, a one-person household in the low-income
category can afford a monthly rent of $1,551, while a two-person household in the low-income
category can affordable a monthly rent of $1,772. Thus, none of the units are expected to be
affordable to low income households. A two-person household in the moderate-income category
can afford a rent of about $2,472, and a three-person household in the moderate-income
category can afford a rent of about $2,780. This puts about 50 percent of the market-rate one-
bedroom apartments in the moderate-income affordability range for one- or two-person
households, and about 50 percent of the market-rate two-bedroom apartments in the moderate-
income range for three-person households.
This affordability assessment is reflected in the distribution for the Plaza Apartments by
affordability level in Table 4.2-1, in which 50 percent of one- and two-bedroom apartments are
allocated to the moderate-income category.

                        Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
4.3     ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL
As described in Chapter 3, San Bruno is located in an urbanized portion of San Mateo County
and has no unconstrained vacant land on which new housing can be constructed. Nonetheless,
this was also true during the last Housing Element cycle and the City demonstrated that
affordable housing can and will be built in San Bruno despite a lack of vacant land. In fact, high
land costs and a limited supply of vacant land constitute conditions ripe for more intensive,
compact, infill redevelopment in line with the goals of the General Plan and this Housing
Element. To address the requirements of Government Code Section 65583.2(g) regarding non-
vacant sites, the following section provides the supporting rationale behind the additional
affordable housing development potential City Staff have identified for 2014-2022, including
development trends and recent and ongoing planning efforts.
THRIVING MARKET FOR MIXED USE WITH RESIDENTIAL
Successful Redevelopment of the Former U.S. Navy Site
The successful completion of the residential development at the Crossing on the former U.S.
Navy Site is an important example of how San Bruno has been consistent in its message about
affordable housing and mixed-use development in the city. Since the adoption of the Navy Site
Specific Plan and certification of the EIR for the site in 2000, the completed residential phases
have occurred in line with City expectations and priorities for the provision of affordable housing.
A total of 1,063 units have been constructed, of which 325 are deed restricted affordable units.
Importantly, these developments, particularly the Village at the Crossing, provide proof that
reducing parking for senior units did not reduce desirability or convenience of the units.
Mixed Use Redevelopment Anchors Downtown
In October 2014, the City approved entitlements for the development of a three-story mixed-use
commercial and residential building on an approximately one-acre site at the southern end of
downtown San Bruno. The project involves the demolition of four commercial properties,
including a long-vacant theater building, and construction of approximately 6,500 square feet of
commercial space at the ground level, 83 residential apartment units, and 106 underground
parking spaces. The approvals include a General Plan Amendment, Specific Plan Amendment,
Zone Change, Architectural Review Permit, and Use Permit. The City had previously approved a
48-unit for-sale residential condominium project with 14,500 square feet of ground floor retail.
That project was not constructed as result of the economic recession though is now being
pursued with new developers. This development is consistent with the 2025 General Plan and
the TCP and the overall goals of this Housing Element. This project is an important example of
how San Bruno has been consistent in its message about mixed-use, higher density
development in the city, especially in proximity to transit.
PLANNING FOR HOUSING ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS
General Plan Goal and Policy Alignment
The identification of additional realistic future housing sites for San Bruno is based on the goals
and policies in the 2025 General Plan (LUD-A, LUD-B, and LUD-C) as updated by the 2013
Transit Corridors Specific Plan, which promote, among other things:
       Residential development to increase walkability and transit use;
                                                                                              4-7

                              City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                          Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
        Intensification of land uses around the San Bruno BART Station and planned San Bruno
         Avenue Caltrain Station; and
        The reuse and intensification with multi-use, transit-oriented development of El Camino
         Real, San Bruno Avenue, and San Mateo Avenue.
General Plan Land Use Designations
The San Bruno 2025 General Plan re-designated three major commercial corridors, El Camino
Real, San Bruno Avenue and Huntington Avenue, with a TOD (Transit Oriented Development)
designation to allow for a mix of commercial, office, and residential uses and capitalize on the
proximity of these corridors to BART and Caltrain. The Transit Corridors Specific Plan, adopted
in 2013, expanded the TOD designation to encompass the Central Business District along San
Mateo Avenue. The land use designations are described in detail in the Chapter 3 discussion of
governmental constraints and resources and Section 4.4 of this chapter. In line with General
Plan goals, all of the new2 housing opportunity sites identified in this Housing Element are
located in these mixed-use transit corridors.
Zoning Consistency with General Plan and Default Density
The 2025 General Plan took the first big step toward accommodating the development of transit-
accessible, affordable infill housing in San Bruno. As described above, each of the main transit
corridors now carries a General Plan land use designation sufficient to build more than 30
dwelling units to the acre, which is in accordance with the default density3 for the region
established by the State.4 In fact, the Transit Corridors Plan does not assign a maximum density
for individual residential development projects within the TCP area. Instead, the Transit Corridors
Plan identified a maximum of 1,610 units for the entire area, but allows flexibility in the size of
each project based on market conditions and development standards set forth in the Plan.
Nonetheless, San Bruno recognizes that HCD does not consider a General Plan Land Use
Designation alone sufficient for a default density claim, and therefore provides the following
reasoning for higher density development along transit corridors- the location characteristics of
the TCP area with proximity to transit, jobs, and the shopping make the area appealing to the
changing housing preferences of groups such as seniors, millennials and workers, and market
conditions have demonstrated the financial feasibility and demand for such housing projects. A
number of higher density residential projects have already built, are under construction or in the
2 Former school sites were available during the last Housing Element cycle and remain available for
this Housing Element, therefore they are not considered “new.” However, a number of development
sites requiring rezoning identified in the prior Housing Element were not counted towards the RHNA,
but are considered new in the this Housing Element.
3 According to Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B), if a local government has adopted density
standards that comply with the population based criteria defined in HCD’s AB 2348 Technical
Assistance Paper (for San Bruno this is 30 dwelling units to the acre), no further analysis is required
to establish the adequacy of the density standard to facilitate the development of housing affordable
to lower-income households per Section 65583.2(c)(3)(A). This Housing Element reasons that default
density is justified by General Plan designations as well as favorable location characteristics and
market conditions.
4 Density bonus for affordable housing would be in addition to these densities.

approval process along the El Camino Real corridor in San Bruno (the Plaza Apartments) and
neighboring Cities, such as South San Francisco and Millbrae.
San Bruno anticipates that Transit Corridors Plan and Measure N, approved in 2013 and 2014,
will stimulate developer interest to invest in residential development in the TCP area. The Transit
Corridors Plan provides a guide to developers, with detailed development standards and design
guidelines, and a Program Environmental Impact Report that will facilitate the application
process and minimize additional environmental review for projects. Measure N amends the San
Bruno Municipal Code to allow increased building heights to four stories in the downtown and
five stories elsewhere, increased residential density and above ground multi-story parking
structures that can support residential uses.
This Housing Element includes two Programs to amend the Zoning Ordinance by rezoning sites
to complete this shift in land use priorities and to meet the 2014-2022 RHNA, which is the final
major implementation step for the TCP. Programs 2-A and 2-B ensure the timely
implementation of the Transit Corridors Plan and Zoning Ordinance Update to ensure
consistency with the density standards depicted in the General Plan and Transit Corridors Plan.
Mixed Use Development Sites with Multiple Lots
This Housing Element relies on development of mixed-use sites within the Transit Corridors Plan
area to accommodate the City’s RHNA. The Transit Corridors Plan envisions mixed use projects
to be residential above retail uses, however the Plan does allow 100 percent residential projects
along El Camino Real and San Bruno Avenue, with the exception that key corners should be
anchored with ground floor retail. Many of these development sites consist of multiple parcels
and will need to be assembled. Several factors make this a very likely possibility, including the
fact that, several of the larger sites, such as a 4-acre site along El Camino Real at San Bruno
Avenue, are in single ownership, and the Transit Corridors Plan provides incentives for parcel
assembly. Development sites that are 20,000 square feet or greater have no limit on FAR,
allowing projects that can take advantage of the recently approved increased height limits.
Residential Rehabilitation
The San Mateo Housing Department administers a county-wide residential rehabilitation
program designed to help low and moderate income homeowners. Currently, the County is able
to undertake only a limited number of rehabilitation projects because of limited funding. The
Program provides low interest loans for housing repairs for low and very low income
homeowners and investor-owners who rent to low and very low income renters. Information
about rehabilitation loans is available on the County’s website.
The City’s Residential Rehabilitation Program funded by the former Redevelopment Agency
ceased to operate when redevelopment was eliminated in California in 2012. The City does not
have a replacement program.
In 1999, approximately 80 housing units within the former San Bruno Redevelopment Project
Area were identified as having the potential to be substantially rehabilitated. These sites are
scattered throughout the area, and are therefore not shown on a separate map. The City is
working with the County to encourage housing rehabilitation projects in San Bruno and to
improve public awareness of the program. The revised goal for rehabilitation projects for this
housing cycle is 16 (12 low-income units and four very-low income units).
                                                                                             4-9

                         Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
Please note, this Element does not rely on rehabilitated units to meet the regional housing need
for this cycle. The units are reported for monitoring and evaluation purposes in Table 4.5-1, but
they are not necessary to meet this RHNA. Program 1-D ensures that the City will explore
opportunities to create a City-sponsored program to assist homeowners with rehabilitation and
preventative maintenance, including potential funding from the City’s BMR Housing In-Lieu Fee
Fund. Program 1-I provides that the City will continue to waive permit fees for rehabilitation
projects administered under CDBG, San Mateo County programs, which helps to reduce the cost
of these desirable rehabilitation projects for affordable housing.
Consistent with these efforts, the updated General Plan includes a guiding policy to preserve
neighborhood character and quality in the city’s eastern neighborhoods through two policies that
address the preservation, renovation, and rehabilitation of historic structures in coordination with
the standards of the Secretary of the Interior and the Office of Historic Preservation during reuse
and intensification within the city’s older neighborhoods.
4.4      OPPORTUNITY SITES AND REALISTIC CAPACITY
REALISTIC DEVELOPMENT
As described in Section 4.2, San Bruno has demonstrated success in setting and achieving
regional housing needs targets. Recent development trends suggest that not only can San
Bruno bring affordable housing online in a timely fashion, but in line with the City’s long-range
vision, new housing development is shifting toward transit corridors and toward more multi-
family, condominium and rental opportunities (for example, the Crossing, and the Plaza
Apartments in Downtown approved in October 2014). Furthermore, as described in Section 4.3,
the San Bruno 2025 General Plan, community involvement in the preparation of the Transit
Corridors Plan, and success of Measure N suggests that there is widespread buy-in for the
redesign of the city’s major corridors into mixed-use, transit-oriented development. The housing
opportunity sites described in this section build on this momentum.
SITES
Under the land uses designated in the San Bruno 2025 General Plan (described in Section 4.3),
many acres of commercial land in San Bruno are newly eligible to be redeveloped with mixed
uses including housing at or above metropolitan regional default densities. Program 2-A
explains that in the interim before the Zoning Ordinance is updated, the City will in practice
enforce the new General Plan land uses and densities rather than the old zoning designations.
However, for the purposes of specificity in this Housing Element, the City has identified a specific
set of housing opportunity sites within the transit corridors, as well as the potential reuse of some
former school sites, all of which are especially appropriate and likely for redevelopment over the
period of this Housing Element cycle. Figure 4.4-1 and Table 4.4-1 illustrate and list by parcel the
specific opportunity sites identified for development or redevelopment of mixed-use or residential
projects that are counted towards the City’s RHNA obligation. Table 4.4-2 shows housing
opportunity sites that require rezoning for housing to be consistent with the recently adopted
General Plan and Transit Corridors Plan. The tables indicates both the maximum and realistic
development capacity of each parcel, as well as the connections to existing city infrastructure
and services. The table also describes the existing uses on each site.
These sites allow for the development of a wide variety of housing by right, including single-
family, duplex, multifamily ownership and rental, factory-built or other manufactured housing,

                               City of San Bruno Housing Element 2015-2023
                           Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
transitional housing, supportive housing, senior housing, and more. Most of the sites are
occupied by very low-value or transitional uses such as vacant buildings or lots, parking lots, and
used-car or used-goods dealers, making all of the sites particularly attractive targets for
redevelopment in the near-term. None of the sites are residential uses, thus redevelopment
poses no risk of displacing households. Program 2-E specifically states the City will support and
facilitate the redevelopment of the identified housing opportunity sites for future expansion of the
city’s housing stock to address a variety of housing needs.
The calculations used to estimate realistic development capacity along the transit corridors
assume complete redevelopment of each site at densities considerably lower than could be
permitted. In fact, the Transit Corridors Plan specify a maximum density for individual projects,
and the Plaza apartment project recently approved in the downtown has a density of 85 units per
acre. On these sites, there is reasonable potential for as many as 958 units to be constructed
during this Housing Element cycle.
The projected residential development capacity for mixed-use sites does not assume residential-
only development in order to produce the quantified objectives; for the TOD designation it is
assumed that about half of a project could be for non-residential uses. Furthermore, the
assessment of sites that may undergo change is very conservative, accounting for only 15
percent of the land actually designated for mixed-use development under the General Plan.
Additionally, a realistic development capacity of mixed-use sites was determined using both the
updated General Plan designations as well precedents, as follows:
         TOD Zones. The General Plan, as amended by the Transit Corridors Plan, does not
          specify a maximum density for individual projects, and development sites that are 20,000
          square feet or larger have no maximum floor area ratio. Furthermore, with the passage of
          Measure N, maximum building heights have increased to five stories along El Camino
          Real, San Bruno Avenue and Huntington Avenue, and four stories in Downtown along
          San Mateo Avenue. The density of each project will be determined by the development
          standards of setbacks, stepbacks, and height and the market for the type of housing
          proposed. Therefore, assuming conservatively that 50 percent of a project is devoted to
          nonresidential uses (commercial, parking, landscaping) a residential density of up to 110
          units per acre would result at average unit size (1,000 square feet). Thus, even if a
          project were built at 40 or 45 units per acre, this would still consume only half of the
          overall development capacity of a site. This analysis assumes TOD projects achieve 40
          units to the acre. Thus, the assumed residential density is less than half of the potential
          maximum, even without any bonuses.
              o   El Camino Real. The El Camino Real designation generally applies to parcels
                  along the El Camino Real corridor, and emphasizes new development of
                  residential uses with some ground floor retail to leverage proximity to the Caltrain
                  Station and Downtown, while being sensitive to adjacent existing lower density
                  neighborhoods. The El Camino Real designation allows new mixed-use
                  residential and commercial and single-use residential development. Residential
                  uses, such as condominiums, should front onto El Camino Real, with ground
                  floor retail at significant street corners. Medium-density residential uses, such as
                  townhomes, are encourage adjacent to existing residential neighborhoods.
                  Several large potential development sites consisting of multiple parcels in single
                  ownership are identified in Table 4.2-2.
                                                                                                4-11

                          Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
              o  San Bruno Avenue. The San Bruno Avenue designation encourage higher
                 intensity development along San Bruno Avenue and Huntington Avenue. While
                 residential densities are not as intense as along El Camino Real, because of
                 generally smaller development sites, San Bruno Avenue will become a transit-
                 oriented development corridor with both residential and commercial uses. The
                 San Bruno Avenue designation allows new mixed-use residential and
                 commercial and single-use residential development in areas outside of the 70
                 decibel SFO airport noise contour, primarily west of the new Caltrain Station and
                 along Huntington Avenue south of Euclid Avenue.
              o  Central Business District. The Central Business District (CBD) designation
                 allows for a moderate increase in intensity of uses along San Mateo Avenue, with
                 efforts to preserve the existing urban fabric and scale of storefronts. The CBD
                 designation allows mixed use with ground floor retail and upper-floor residential
                 or office uses are permitted, while new medium-density residential uses are
                 encouraged to infill existing surface parking lots. It should be noted that higher
                 density residential uses area allowed, as demonstrated by the approval of the
                 Plaza mixed use project in October 2014, which is an 83-unit multifamily building
                 with 6,500 square feet of ground floor retail, at a density of 85 units per acre.
        MU-RF. The General Plan allows up to 3.0 FAR with a maximum FAR of 0.6 FAR for
         non-residential uses. This designation is directly designed to incentivize housing
         production at high densities, reserving a vast majority of development capacity for
         residential use. Furthermore, the designation permits a residential-use only project
         (without requiring ground-level commercial uses). This designation permits a maximum
         of 48 units per acre without affordable housing bonus (40 units base + 8 units incentive-
         based bonus—such as for design and off-site improvements). Thus, an overall density of
         40 units per acre is considered reasonable.
These assumptions are reasonable because they are only for the selected housing opportunity
sites, and not for the entire TOD or MU-RF zones. Therefore, it allows for many other
unidentified sites in the transit corridors to convert to office-commercial mixed-use, or some other
ratio of residential to non-residential use permissible within the General Plan designations.
The General Plan provides for “sliding scale” FARs, with a 2.0 FAR for parcels less than 20,000
s.f. in size, and NO maximum FAR for sites 20,000 square feet or greater, providing significant
incentives for lot consolidation, and enabling higher densities to be realized.
DEFAULT DENSITY
A majority of the identified housing opportunity sites are subject to the default density argument
defined in Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B) (described earlier on page 4-11). These
sites account for over half of the total units and over 80 percent of the very low and low-income
units to meet the City’s RHNA These sites, shown in Table 4.4-1 and Table 4.4-2, are mostly
designated in the General Plan TOD designation. This designation allows for greater than 30
units to the acre and thus this Element assumes those units (921 in all) to be affordable at all
income levels. The result is that these TOD sites and second units, provides for most of the
affordable RHNA need during this cycle.

HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES ON FORMER SCHOOL SITES
Former school sites available for residential reuse within San Bruno include Crestmoor High
School, Edgemont School, Willard Engvall School, and Crestmoor Elementary School.
Crestmoor Elementary School became vacant in 2013, while the other schools were vacant
during the prior Housing Element cycle. While these former school sites are not considered
“affordable”, they represent opportunities for redevelopment in line with existing neighborhood
character. The former school sites require no zoning changes prior to redevelopment with
residential use. The realistic development capacity of these sites is 6 units to the acre because
they are designated Low Density Residential under the General Plan and Zoning (a maximum of
8 units to the acre). The quantified objectives for these sites assumes provision of 15 percent
affordable housing per Program 6-A and existing City Ordinance. The City anticipates that these
affordable single family units will likely fall under the moderate-income category. Program 2-D
describes the City’s role in monitoring and facilitating the School District’s redevelopment of
these sites with both affordable and market-rate housing, and reminds City Staff to align the
redevelopment program for the Crestmoor site with the General Plan policy to conserve open
space on the site for community use.
SECOND UNITS
As described in Chapter 3, San Bruno has a second dwelling unit ordinance pursuant to
California Government Code Section 65852.2. The second unit ordinance implements AB 1866
to set standards for the development of second dwelling units so as to increase the supply of
smaller and affordable housing while ensuring that they remain compatible with existing
neighborhoods. Over the last Housing Element cycle, the City was successful in legalizing 26
second units constructed prior to June 30, 1977, and has been able to accomplish life safety and
building code upgrades. Based on this record, and anticipation of higher than average demand
for second unit legalization in a difficult housing market and economy, the City anticipates
continued legalization and construction of second units at a rate of five units per year during this
housing cycle. New Program 1-C also ensures that the City will develop an expanded
legalization process to address second units constructed between 1977 and 2003.
EMERGENCY SHELTER ZONE
As discussed in Chapter 2, San Bruno has an identified need for a zone that permits emergency
shelters by right and can accommodate 32 beds. Program 6-D requires the City to amend the
Zoning Ordinance to provide an appropriate zone or zones within which emergency shelters are
permitted, in accordance with State law. In the previous Housing Element, the City had identified
the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) area designated under the San Bruno 2025 General
Plan as an appropriate zone for emergency shelters, because it is near public transportation and
commercial services.
However, during public meetings to consider adoption of the emergency shelter zone, residents
expressed opposition to locating emergency shelters in the TOD area because they could have
a negative impact on the surrounding low-density residential neighborhoods. Concerns included
increased concentration of homeless population in proximity to an existing 10-bed shelter5
already within the proposed TOD area, which would be detrimental to safety and quality of life,
and potentially diminish property values. City staff is conducting further research and public
outreach, and will present alternative location(s) for an emergency shelter zone to the Planning
Commission and City Council. The City anticipates completing the process to designate a zone
5 Saint Bruno’s Catholic Worker Hospitality House operates a 10-bed shelter on San Bruno Avenue.
                                                                                                 4-13

                        Chapter 4: Land Inventory and Quantified Objectives
that can accommodate the need during the planning period, and the timeline ensures the
program itself is accomplished within six months after adoption of the Housing Element.
An alternative location under consideration for the emergency shelter zone is the City’s M-1,
Light Industrial zoning district in the northeastern section of the City. The identified area is 5,5
acres with 45 parcels (the majority 5,000 square feet or greater, which is sufficient and
reasonably available (vacant or underutilized) to meet the City’s identified need, including the
potential for reuse or conversion of existing buildings. The area is near public transportation,
including San Bruno BART station and SamTrans bus routes (1/4 mile) and the Caltrain Station
(1/2 mile) and commercial uses including the Tanforan and Towne Center shopping centers (1/3
of mile) and downtown (½ mile).

4.5      QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The quantified objectives in Table 4.5-1 establish the maximum number of housing units by
income category that could be developed or rehabilitated during this Housing Element cycle
(described in detail in sections 4.2 through 4.4). The table shows that the City’s quantified
objectives for 1,700 units include units under construction and in the pipeline plus units on
sites that are already zoned residential or need to be rezoned, as follows:
        Recently completed, under construction, entitled or in currently in the approval
         pipeline equal 120 units.
        Sites that are already zoned for residential use have a capacity for 622 units.
        Sites that require rezoning to be consistent with the General Plan and Transit
         Corridors Plan would yield up to 958 units.
In addition, the City objectives for preservation and conservation is 130 units, distributed as
follows:
        Substantial rehabilitation of 18
        Legalization or construction of 32 second units.
        Creation of living spaces for 80 households through the Homesharing Program
More assumptions about the distribution of units by affordability category are provided in the
detailed footnotes to this table.

5        Goals, Programs, & Implementation
         Actions for 2015-2023
The goals, program, and implementation actions presented in this chapter serve to support the State
of California’s overarching aim of providing “decent housing and a suitable living environment for
every Californian” (Government Code Section 65580). The housing goals, programs, and
implementation actions that follow were created for the purpose of meeting the housing needs of the
citizens of San Bruno from 2015 to 2023 given the limitations imposed by current political, economic,
and social conditions, and in consideration of available State and federal funding.
Based on the successes of the last housing element cycle (detailed City review and comments on old
programs can be found in Appendix A), this Element consolidates, revises, and updates existing
programs in order to increase the usability of the document and to facilitate ongoing monitoring and
evaluation of progress. This Element also eliminates several programs that were completed in the
previous Housing Element to better facilitate the creation and retention of housing for lower-income
households and households with special needs. New and substantially enhanced or modified
programs are indicated with an asterisk (*).
5.1      QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
As required by Section 65583 of the California Government Code, the goals, policies, and programs
in this chapter seek to meet quantified housing objectives. These objectives are described in Chapter
4: Sites Inventory.
5.2      GOALS, PROGRAMS, AND IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS
The following section provides a complete list of the proposed goals, programs, and implementation
actions for the San Bruno Housing Element from 2015-2023, including responsible agencies, and
implementation time frame. Housing Element goals are summarized in Table 5.2-1 below.

Program 2-A:          Update the Zoning Ordinance to make available adequate sites to
                      accommodate San Bruno’s share of regional housing need.
Revise the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the San Bruno 2025General Plan and Transit Corridors Plan
(2013), including land use designations allowing mixed-use development.
Actions:
        Update the Zoning Ordinance to create Mixed Use and Multi Use–Residential Focus zoning
         districts with a minimum density of 20 units per acre that promote high-intensity mixed-use
         development, including retail, office, services, and housing to provide adequate sites to meet
         San Bruno’s RHNA. Limit retail development along El Camino Real to those sites north of
         Crystal Springs Road, thus reinforcing the existing retail activity in Downtown.
        Allow residential uses by right without a conditional use permit, planned development permit
         or other discretionary action in Mixed-Use and Multi-Use Residential Focus zoning districts,
         consistent with Section 65583.2(h) & (i).
        Update the Zoning Map to match the designations indicated in General Plan and TCP.

substitute for a dedication of land, Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF).
Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate
additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is
zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the same site or at
another location. The State regulates the types of development that are entitled to a density bonus.
Two examples are (1) a housing development that provides 20 percent of its units for lower-income
households; and (2) 10 percent of its units for very low-income households. (See “Developable

of housing. Under State law, Housing Elements have been updated every five years, although new
legislation (Senate Bill 375) now requires the alignment of future Housing Element cycles with
Regional Transportation Plan cycles.
Housing First: “Housing First” is an approach that centers on providing homeless people with
housing quickly and then providing services as needed. What differentiates a “Housing First”
approach from other strategies is that there is an immediate and primary focus on helping individuals
and families quickly access and sustain permanent housing. This approach has the benefit of being
consistent with what most people experiencing homelessness want and seek help to achieve. The
“Housing First” model offers an alternative to emergency shelter or transitional housing for
homeless individuals, but does not eliminate the City’s need to zone for such uses.
Housing Unit: The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. A housing unit
may be a single-family dwelling, a multi-family dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile
home, a cooperative, or any other residential unit considered real property under State law.

Appendix A: Detailed Program Accomplishments
During Last Cycle (2007-2014)
The California Department of Housing and Community Development requires that each housing element review the
effectiveness of the previous housing element (specifically, its goals, policies and programs); describe progress in
implementation; and analyze the appropriateness of these measures (i.e. whether and how these policies/programs
should continue). This appendix assesses the achievements of the 2010 Housing Element, in accordance with State
housing law. These results are quantified where appropriate and compared to what was projected in the 2010
Element. This evaluation provided a basis for the new Housing Element policies, as successful programs were
retained and/or expanded, while unsuccessful programs were discarded or revised. Specific implementation and
responsible agencies were identified in the revised Housing Programs (see Chapter 5).

    GOAL 1: Protect the quality and stability of existing neighborhoods through the conservation,
    rehabilitation, and improvement of the existing housing supply. (GC 65583(c)(4))
    Program 1-A: Support infrastructure upgrades. Continue to seek funding to upgrade and maintain
    infrastructure needed by San Bruno’s housing supply.
    Actions:
        Identify funding sources necessary for infrastructure improvements on a project-by-project basis. Funding
         sources may include gas tax, CDBG, RDA tax increment financing, etc.
        Continue to incorporate infrastructure requirements in the fee structure for development proposals.
        Implement upgrades and maintenance through the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
    Responsibility: Community Development Dept, Public Works Dept, Redevelopment Agency
    Funding Source: Staff time, Gas Tax, Measure A, RDA, & grants (e.g., C/CAG TOD-HIP), development fees
    Timeframe: Ongoing
    Funding sources &                    The City identifies infrastructure funding through infrastructure master plans,
    funding amount (2007-                 Capital Improvement Program and the Transit Corridors Specific Plan.
    2014):                                Outside funding sources include: Federal Tiger II grants for GBI planning and
                                          design, TLC funding for El Camino Real medians, and OBAG funds for
                                          station area pedestrian access improvements
                                         The City continues to rebuild the infrastructure destroyed in the Glenview
                                          explosion and fire on 9/9/10, funded through the $50 million PG&E trust
                                          agreement to rebuild the Crestmoor neighborhood
                                         Minimal outside funding is available. The elimination of Redevelopment in
                                          2012 ended a significant funding source for infrastructure improvements.

Program 2-B: Complete Downtown and Transit Corridors Plan. Complete and adopt a Downtown and
Transit Corridors Plan with the goal, amongst others, of increasing residential options in Downtown
and transit corridors of El Camino Real and San Bruno Avenue in the vicinity of the future Caltrain
Station.
Actions:
          Consider how best to promote new or different housing products or arrangements (e.g., shared
           housing, cube housing, co-housing, etc.) that better meet current housing needs, and work these
           concepts into the Transit Corridors Plan.
          Incorporate development standards and design guidelines for residential uses in second stories over
           commercial uses on sites with Central Business District (San Mateo Avenue) and Transit Oriented
           Development designations in the General Plan.
          Structure the Downtown and Transit Corridors Plan to foster streamlined project review and approval
           processes, especially for projects that contain housing. The Downtown and Transit Corridors Plan will
           define development standards and guidelines in preparation for the Zoning Ordinance Update in order
           to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency of applicable standards.
    Evaluate increasing the height limit or number of stories above the existing requirements of Ordinance 1284 in
     certain locations within the transit corridors area, such as in the vicinity of the future Caltrain station. Such a
     change would be designed to accomplish green building objectives and make mixed-use development and
     affordable housing more financially feasible. The change would require voter approval in a citywide election.
     (This change is not required in order to meet the RHNA need for 2007-2014 and is not included in the analysis
     of opportunity sites.)
    If the Transit Corridors Plan is approved and includes a recommendation to increase height limits, the City
     proposes to bring the plan before the voters as a ballot measure, as required by Ordinance 1284.

                                        applied for a modified project to allow a renovation alternative for the
   Successful                           existing 308 apartment units, which was approved in June 2010. The
   Unsuccessful                         affordability requirement was a condition of the original financing (1986)
   Neutral                              for the project. The developer paid off the original loan, which ended the
                                        affordability requirement. The renovation project began construction in
                                        December 2011, and the project will include no affordable units.
                                       The 308-unit Treetops apartment complex was vacated in 2005 due to
                                        severe mold problems and remained vacant until 2013. Treetops
                                        included 62 below market rate units. The affordability term was 30 years,
                                        but the loan terms allowed the developer to terminate the affordability
                                        covenant upon refinancing.
                                       An application to demolish the vacant complex and replace with a 510
                                        unit project was approved in 2008. That approval required maintaining
                                        the 62 units through December 31, 2017. However, the developer could
                                        not obtain financing during the economic recession.
                                       The developer, AIMCO, decided to renovate the existing complex, which
                                        was completed and occupied in 2013. The developer refinanced the
                                        project and removed the affordability obligation.

nonprofit builders who specialize in building housing for extremely-low income households, and facilitate the
creation of supportive housing units in accordance with the City’s share of countywide need identified in the
HOPE Plan.
Actions:
   Amend the Zoning Ordinance definition of “Special residential care facilities”—already allowed by right in
    any residential zone—to include transitional and supportive housing uses, including those designated as
    SROs. This amendment will ensure that transitional and supportive housing is treated as a residential use
    of property in accordance with SB2.
   Partner with local or regional agencies and non-profits that specialize in supportive housing development
    and management to identify opportunities for the development of supportive housing in San Bruno.
    Supportive housing may be organized as:
    (a) Apartment or single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings, townhouses, or single-family homes that
         exclusively house formerly homeless individuals and/or families;
    (b) Apartment or SRO buildings, or townhouses that mix special-needs housing with general affordable
         housing;
    (c) Rent-subsidized apartments leased in the open market; or
    (d) Long-term set-asides of units within privately-owned buildings.
   Work with partners to identify the range of local resources and assistance needed to facilitate the
    development of housing for extremely low-income households and to pursue access to specialized
    funding sources.
   Develop an action plan with partners, which will include assisting with site identification and acquisition,
    providing local financial resources, streamlining entitlements and providing incentives.
