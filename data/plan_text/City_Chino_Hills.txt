A.     Introduction
1.    Community Overview
The City of Chino Hills encompasses approximately
45 square miles in southwestern San Bernardino
County with a population of 74,79614. The City is
uniquely situated adjacent to 4 county jurisdictions
- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San
Bernardino - and is surrounded by the cities of
Chino to the east, Pomona to the north, Brea and
Diamond Bar to the west, and Yorba Linda to the
south. (Refer to Figure 3-2 – Vicinity Map.)
The City incorporated in December 1991. Since
that time, the City has adopted a General Plan and
a Development Code. The basic framework and
land use policies within these documents work to:
        Direct development away from environ-
         mentally sensitive areas, including steeply

   by one or more willow species. The dominant
   species of this community is arroyo willow
   (Salix lasiolepis), black willow (Salix

   and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). Approxi-

   scrub communities are designated by the
   CDFW and the CNDDB as “very threatened”
