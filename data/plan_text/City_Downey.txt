1. Introduction
1.1 – Housing Overview
1.1.1 – Historical Perspective
The City of Downey is a full service City of more than 112,000 people located in Los
Angeles County. As shown in Figure 1, Downey is located near and adjacent to four
major freeways including Interstates 5, 105, 605 and 710. Settlement in the Downey
area first occurred in 1873 when John Downey began subdividing the local Spanish
ranchos.      Soon after, the Southern Pacific Railroad was completed near the
settlements, and the community developed into a hub for local agricultural businesses.
By the early 1900s, the City was well established, with a Sunkist packing plant and retail
businesses downtown.
The World War II years marked the birth of the aerospace and petroleum industries in
Downey. North American Rockwell began producing aircraft for the war, and later
became the home of the Apollo and the Space Shuttle programs. In 1956, the City of
Downey incorporated amidst a post-war population boom. Following incorporation
during the 1950s and 1960s, the population grew from under 30,000 to more than
86,000, as agricultural land was rapidly replaced by new housing developments.
By 1970, almost no agricultural land remained in the community. Downey continued to
prosper during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly due to defense industry related
employment at the NASA/Rockwell Plant. During this time, the City became even
more accessible and central to the Southern California economy with the planning and
development of the Interstate 105 and the Metro Green Transit Line with the Lakewood
Avenue Station. This transit corridor facility was routed through the southern portion of
the City, directly connecting the City of Norwalk with the Los Angeles International
Airport and the South Bay-Redondo Beach area. As a result of the development of the
freeway and transit line, hundreds of homes were removed and the population of the
City declined slightly.
Today Downey is home to numerous families and offers a virtual plethora of
employment opportunities. The City’s location and freeway access make it an ideal
location to reside within the region. The City is recent years is planning for future
growth, specifically new residential development, through major planning efforts, like
the Downtown Downey Specific Plan. The Specific Plan area has already seen a
number of development applications and is positioned to serve as a catalyst for
revitalization of key neighborhoods within the City.

1.1.2 – Demographics
The City’s economic and population growth over the past five decades has been
accompanied by a shift in the demographic characteristics of the population.
Significant changes include an increase in the number of family households in the City,
racial composition of the City shifting from a non-Hispanic white majority to a Hispanic
majority and a decrease in the average age of residents in the City. Generally, a large
proportion of residents living in Downey are young, middle class, families that seek a
variety of housing options that are affordable and located strategically to access the
region.
1.1.3 – Housing Stock
In 2010, there were a total of 34,836 dwelling units in the City, a nominal increase (0.3
percent) from the 2000 Census. The City’s housing stock is predominately characterized
by single-family detached dwelling units which comprise 65 percent of the housing
stock. As the City plans for future housing activity it is important to note that
approximately 86% of the City’s housing stock is more than 30 years old and may be in
need of repair or rehabilitation.
Despite the limited availability of vacant residentially zoned land in the City, Downey
has experienced modest housing growth over the past several decades. Through
incentive programs the City has encouraged larger underutilized parcels including
large residential estate/agricultural parcels to be recycled and divided into smaller
parcels for new single family homes or consolidated for the development of larger
projects.
In 2010 the City also adopted the Downtown Downey Specific Plan (Specific Plan). The
Specific Plan was initiated by the City to guide growth and facilitate development in
the Downtown core, encourage economic revitalization, and create a dynamic center
of activity in the City. The 131-acre Specific Plan area is envisioned to take the form of a
traditional downtown, including a civic center, transit center and central gathering
space supported by commercial and residential development. A key component of
the Specific Plan is the introduction of housing into the Downtown area, an existing low
density commercial hub, at densities up to 75 dwelling units per acre. The Specific Plan
is intended to establish the Downtown as a vibrant urban center with dining,
employment, housing, shopping, entertainment, and cultural opportunities all within a
short walking distance of one another.
As a successfully developed community, Downey will focus on preserving and
enhancing existing housing, while encouraging and facilitating compatible higher
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1  H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t  11

                          C i t y  o f   D o w n e y
   density development within the 2014-2021 Housing Element. Housing goals, policies and
   programs will aim to preserve the condition of the existing housing stock, develop new
   housing in specific targeted growth districts, provide affordable housing opportunities
   for all income groups, and to improve the quality of life in the City’s neighborhoods.
   1.2 – Housing Element State Law
   California State Housing Element Law (California Government Code Article 10.6)
   establishes the requirements for Housing Elements of the General Plan. Specifically,
   California Government Code Section 65588 requires that local governments review and
   revise the Housing Element of their Comprehensive General Plans not less than once
   every five years.
   The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and
   suitable living environment for every Californian as the State's major housing goal.
   Recognizing the important role of local planning programs in the pursuit of this goal, the
   Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a Housing Element as
   part of their comprehensive General Plans.           Table 1-1 summarizes these State
   requirements and identifies the applicable sections in the 2014-2021 Housing Element
   where these requirements are addressed.
   Downey's Housing Element was last updated in 2009 and is currently being updated for
   the years 2014 to 2021 as part of the new update cycle for jurisdictions within the SCAG
   (Southern California Association of Governments) region to allow for synchronization
   with the 2012-2035 Draft Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities
   Strategy (RTP/SCS). The Element sets forth an 8-year strategy to address the City’s
   identified housing needs, including specific implementing programs and activities.
   Various amendments have been made to Housing Element law since adoption of the
   City’s current Housing Element. These include:
            •  AB 162: Requires the City, upon adoption of the Housing Element, to identify
               specific flood hazard zones in the Land Use Element and specific floodwater
               and groundwater recharge areas in the Conservation and Safety Elements.
            •  SB 244: Requires the City, upon the adoption of a Housing Element, to update
               the Land Use Element to include data and analysis, goals, and
               implementation measures regarding unincorporated island, fringe, or legacy
               communities and their infrastructure needs.

                                           C i t y   o f  D o w n e y
        •   SB 812: In addition to the existing special needs groups, the City must include
            an analysis of the housing needs for developmentally disabled persons.
        •   AB 1867: Under certain conditions, the City can now count multi-unit
            homeownership units that have been converted to affordable units toward
            their RHNA allocation.
        •   SB375 Implications: For jurisdictions that do not submit their adopted 2014-
            2021 housing element update within 120 days of the October 2013 deadline,
            their housing element updates revert to a four-year cycle.
The contents of this updated Housing Element comply with these amendments and all
other requirements of Housing Element law.
1.2.1 Regional Housing Needs Assessment
Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth the specific components to be
contained in a community's housing element. Included in these requirements is an
obligation on the part of local jurisdictions to provide their “fair share” of regional
housing needs. Local governments and Councils of Governments (COGs) are required
to determine existing and future housing need and the allocation of said need must be
approved by the California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD). Downey is a member of the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) and SCAG is responsible for preparing the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
for the six-county territory that it represents.
HCD established the planning period for the current Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) from January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2021. For the 2014-2021
planning period the City was allocated a total of 814 units, including 210 for very low
income, 123 for low income, 135 for moderate income, and 346 for above-moderate
income households.
Changes to Housing Element law, specifically, AB 1233 passed in January 2006, requires
“communities that failed to comply with requirements to make available sufficient sites
to meet their regional housing need in the previous planning period must, within the first
year of the new planning period, zone or rezone enough sites to accommodate the
RHNA not accommodated from the previous planning period.”
The Housing Element for the 2008-2014 planning period was adopted in 2010 and
certified by HCD, but the City was unable to complete the rezoning necessary to
                                              2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g E l e m e n t 13

                           C i t y    o f   D o w n e y
   provide adequate sites to accommodate the City’s lower income RHNA. Specifically
   per Program 5, Land Use Element/Zoning, the Downey Landing Specific Plan was not
   amended to accommodate residential units. Consequently, the City is required to plan
   for the current planning period of 2014-2021 as well as any unaccommodated shortfall
   identified from the previous (2008-2014) planning period. The City has provided a
   strategy in Section 6, Housing Resources, to address AB 1233 as well the current RHNA
   allocation.

   1.4 – Public Participation
   Section 65583 (c) (7) of the Government Code states that, "The local government shall
   make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the
   community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe
   this effort." A discussion of citizen participation is provided below.
   Prior to the submittal of the Housing Element for initial review, two public workshops
   were held to inform City Council, Planning Commission, residents, and interested
   stakeholders of the 2014-2021 Housing Element update process. The goal of the
   workshops was to receive feedback related to the current and future housing needs of
   the City. A public workshop to provide general information on the Housing Element
   process was held with the City Council on November 27, 2012 and a second workshop
   with the Planning Commission was held on December 19, 2012. Both workshops were
   noticed in the Downey Patriot, the local paper, as an 1/8th page ad, and flyers
   advertising the meetings were mailed directly to stakeholders, posted on the main
   page of the City’s website, and shown on a digital monitor at City Hall. A copy of the
   flyer and a list of the stakeholder groups that received that mailing are provided in
   Appendix B.
   In December of 2012 the Draft Housing Element was submitted to the State Department
   of Housing and Community Development for their initial review. In February 2013, the
   City received news from HCD that after only one round of review the Draft Element had
   been precertified, meeting all the requirements of State law. To formally adopt the
   Housing Element, additional hearings are planned before both the Planning
   Commission and City Council. These meetings are scheduled for May 1 and May 28,
   2013, respectively. Notification for these hearings will be published in the local
   newspaper, posted at prominent public facilities, and provided on the City’s website in
   advance of each hearing.

1.5 – General Plan Consistency
The Downey Vision 2025 General Plan is comprised of the following nine elements: 1)
Land Use; 2) Economic Development; 3) Circulation; 4) Housing; 5) Open Space; 6)
Conservation; 7) Safety; 8) Noise; and 9) Design. The Housing Element builds upon the
other General Plan elements and is entirely consistent with the policies and proposals
set forth by the Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the
Downey Vision 2025 General Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed to
ensure internal consistency is maintained.
1.6 – Organization of the Element
The Housing Element sets forth housing goals and policies for Downey to address the
City’s existing and projected housing needs. Specific housing programs to implement
these goals and policies are identified in the Section 2, Housing Plan. The updated
Downey Housing Element is comprised of the following major components:
    1. Preparation of a Housing Plan to address Downey's identified housing needs,
        including housing goals, policies and programs.
    2. An analysis of the City's population, household and employment base, and the
        characteristics of the housing stock.
    3. An updated evaluation of housing need, including the housing needs of very
        low-income households and the disabled.
    4. An examination of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the
        production, maintenance, and affordability of housing.
    5. Preparation of an inventory of housing resources including potential housing sites
        in the community to accommodate and facilitate housing development.
    6. An assessment of past housing element accomplishments.

2. Housing Plan
For the City of Downey the enduring objective is to facilitate and encourage housing
that fulfills the diverse needs of the community. To achieve this goal the Housing Plan
identifies long-term housing goals and shorter-term policies to address the identified
housing needs. The goals and policies are then implemented through a series of
housing programs. Programs identify specific actions the City plans to undertake
toward achieving each goal and policy.
The goals, policies, and programs within the Housing Plan build upon the identified
housing needs in the community, constraints confronting the City, and resources
available to address the housing needs. This Plan will guide City housing policy through
the 2014-2021 planning period. Downey’s housing goals, policies, and programs address
the following five major areas:
    1. Housing and Neighborhood Conservation;
    2. Adequate sites to achieve a diversity of housing;
    3. Opportunities for affordable housing;
    4. Removal of governmental constraints, as necessary; and
    5. Promotion of equal housing opportunities.
Downey’s housing plan for addressing unmet needs, removing constraints, and
achieving quantitative objectives is described in this section according to the above
five areas. The housing programs introduced on the following pages include programs
that are currently in operation and new programs which have been added to address
the City’s housing needs.

   Goal 1: Preserve and Improve Existing Housing
   Continued maintenance and preservation of the existing housing stock in Downey is
   crucial to ensure quality neighborhoods. Housing programs focused on the
   achievement of this goal include rehabilitation of single- and multi-family housing units,
   code enforcement, and efforts to preserve assisted housing units at risk of converting to
   market-rate housing. Through code enforcement, neighborhood, and home
   improvement programs, the City is able to maintain the condition of existing housing
   units.
   Policy 1.1:      Monitor and enforce building and property maintenance code
                    standards in residential neighborhoods.
   Policy 1.2:      Promote the repair, revitalization, and rehabilitation of residential
                    structures which have fallen into disrepair.
   Policy 1.3:      Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents of
                    the importance of property maintenance to long-term housing values
                    and neighborhood quality.
   Policy 1.4:      Provide a high quality of services to maintain the appearance of
                    neighborhoods and quality of life of residents.
   Policy 1.5:      Pursue comprehensive neighborhood preservation             strategies   for
                    portions of the community that need reinvestment.
   Program 1 - Code Enforcement
          The enforcement of existing property maintenance codes is a primary means to
          preserve housing and the quality of neighborhoods. The Code Enforcement
          Division is responsible for enforcing City ordinances affecting property
          maintenance, building conditions, and other housing and neighborhood issues.
          The Code Enforcement Division handles approximately 70 complaints a month
          for these types of violations. Building code violations are referred to the Building
          Division and to housing staff for rehabilitation assistance.
          Program Objective: Continue to conduct inspections on a complaint basis
          through the City’s Code Enforcement Division.

Program 2 – The Housing Rebate and Grant Program
    The Housing Rebate and Grant Program will offer homeowners the opportunity to
    apply for small grants and loans to complete improvement projects on their
    properties. The Housing Grant Program provides assistance for very low income
    households, offering grants up to $10,000 to allow residents to address code
    enforcement violations, health and safety concerns and complete exterior
    painting. The Grant Program also provides funding to residents to complete
    exterior and interior home repairs as well as perform architectural modifications
    to achieve ADA compliance or reasonable accommodation for residents with
    disabilities. The Housing Rebate portion of the program will focus on providing a
    refund of 50% or 80%, to homeowners that have completed a wide range of
    property, structural, and energy/water conservation improvements.
    Program Objective: Address property, structural, and energy/water conservation
    improvements for low income homeowners in the City. The City anticipates that
    10 projects will be assisted annually based on funding availability.

   Program 3 – Monitor and Preserve Affordable Housing
         The City will continue to keep an inventory of affordable housing units and
         promote, through the Housing Division, the use of additional affordable housing
         assistance programs, as appropriate, to preserve existing affordable units that
         are at risk of converting to market-rate. When available, the City will utilize
         resources such as HUD Section 208/811 loans, HOPE II and III Homeownership
         program funds, HOME funds, CDBG funds, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
         Programs, California Housing Finance Agency single-family and multi-family
         programs, programs to stimulate private developer and non-profit entity efforts in
         the development and financing of housing for lower and moderate-income
         households. The City will facilitate discussions between developers and local
         banks to meet their obligations pursuant to the California Community
         Reinvestment Act (CCRA) providing favorable financing to developers involved
         in projects designed to provide lower and moderate-income housing
         opportunities. Similarly, the City will maintain a list of mortgage lenders
         participating in the California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) program and
         refer the program to builders or corporations interested in developing housing in
         the City.
         Program Objective: City Staff will maintain a list of affordable units throughout
         the City including affordability information to ensure landlords are compliant with
         deed restrictions and to preserve affordable units. The Housing Division will
         continue to pursue partnership opportunities with non-profits to preserve and
         expand affordable housing in the City.

Program 4 – Energy Efficient Design
    The City will review ordinances and recommend changes where necessary to
    encourage energy efficient housing design and practices that are consistent
    with State regulations. The City provides information on their website and will
    continue to periodically update their literature regarding energy conservation,
    including solar power, energy efficient insulation, and subsidies available from
    utility companies, and encourage homeowners and landlords to incorporate
    these features into construction and remodeling projects. When possible the City
    will encourage energy conservation devices including, but not limited to lighting,
    water heater treatments, and solar energy systems for all new and existing
    residential projects. The City will encourage maximum utilization of Federal,
    State, and local government programs, including the County of Los Angeles
    Home Weatherization Program that are intended to help homeowners
    implement energy conservation measures. Additionally, as part of the Housing
    Preservation Program and the Home Improvement Loan Program, outlined
    above, residents can apply for loans to increase the energy efficiency of their
    home.
    Program Objective: Maintain and distribute literature on energy conservation,
    including solar power, additional insulation, and subsidies available from utility
    companies, and encourage homeowners and landlords to incorporate these
    features into construction and remodeling projects. Encourage energy
    conservation devices, including but not limited to lighting, water heater
    treatments, and solar energy systems for all residential projects. Encourage
    maximum utilization of Federal, State, and local government programs, such as
    the County of Los Angeles Home Weatherization Program, that assist
    homeowners in providing energy conservation measures. Continue to provide
    information on home loan programs available through the City and encourage
    residents to use the programs to implement energy efficient design.

   Goal 2: Encourage a variety of housing types to meet
   the existing and future needs of City residents.
   Downey strives to achieve a balanced community, with housing units available for all
   income segments of the population. The existing housing stock offers many affordable
   options throughout the City. The intent of this goal is to assist in the provision of
   adequate housing to meet the needs of the community, including the needs of both
   renter and owner households.
   Policy 2.1:       Provide adequate sites and zoning to encourage and facilitate a
                     range of housing to address the regional fair share allocation.
   Policy 2.2:       Encourage infill development and recycling of land to provide
                     adequate residential sites.
   Policy 2.3:       Facilitate and encourage the development of affordable housing for
                     seniors, large families, and other identified special housing needs.
   Policy 2.4:       Assist private and nonprofit developers in providing affordable housing
                     to low-income residents and special needs groups.
   Program 5 – Housing Opportunity Sites
          The Downey Land Use Element and Zoning Code provide for a variety of
          residential land uses to accommodate the City's 2014-2021 Regional Housing
          Needs Allocation (RHNA). The Zoning Code includes provisions for second units
          on R-1 and R-2 zoned lots in the City’s Second Unit Development Overlay (SUD)
          districts, development of additional units on R-1 and R-3 zoned sites that are
          currently underutilized, and future residential development within the Downtown
          Downey Specific Plan area. The adopted Downtown Downey Specific Plan,
          which includes five land use districts allows for mixed use development, which
          promotes new residential development at densities up to 75 du per acre. To
          encourage and facilitate the development of a variety of housing types, the City
          will provide information on housing opportunity sites identified in the Housing
          Element and any additional areas of the City to interested developers.
          Program Objective: Staff will continue to facilitate the redevelopment of
          underutilized sites through various outreach methods to the development
          community through an updated inventory available throughout the 2014-2021

Program 6 - Second Unit Zoning
    The City has many large lots (7,500 square feet and above) that are underutilized
    and that can accommodate additional housing. To facilitate affordable rental
    units for families, the City allows second unit developments. There are 24
    designated second unit development areas, 17 of which have potential to
    accommodate new development. In the R-1 zone, the second unit must be a
    detached structure; otherwise, it can be attached to the primary unit. In all
    cases, however, the secondary units cannot be sold separately from the primary
    unit and the owner must live in one of the units.
    Recently adopted amendments to the second unit zoning program (November
    2008) included allowing second units administerally and permitting a reduction
    in the required lot size (from 10,000 sq. ft. to 7,500 sq. ft.) to qualify for a second
    unit, thus increasing opportunities to construct second units in the City. Second
    units, also known as “granny flats,” are a practical method for a family to
    maximize the available land on their own lot. By utilizing land and utilities, a
    family minimizes construction costs. The City is capitalizing on the Zoning Code by
    increasing the stock of affordable units while maintain the existing single-family
    neighborhoods.
    Development of second unit housing provides lower-income households an
    affordable housing opportunity typically within a single-family neighborhood
    setting. Therefore, the City will continue to allow for second units to be
    constructed within the Second Unit Overlay.
    To ensure greater participation on behalf of Downey residents in the program,
    the City is committing to a public outreach program to encourage second unit
    development, including advertising second unit development opportunities on
    the City’s website, in local newspapers, in local utility bills, and at various
    community centers, including the Public Library.
    The City is also committed to monitoring the effectiveness of this program by
    conducting annual monitoring to determine the level of program participation
                                       2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1   H o u s i n g     E l e m e n t  25

         Program Objective: Based on previous planning periods, it is reasonable to
         expect 8-12 second units to be constructed during the planning period,
         therefore. Throughout the planning period, the City will inform eligible property
         owners of the potential to construct second units though updated handouts and
         information on the City’s website.

   Program 7 - Senior Housing Zoning
         The City facilitates and encourages the construction of senior housing. Senior
         housing is currently permitted in the R-3 (Multi-Family Residential), C-3 (Central
         Business District), C-M (Commercial Manufacturing), H-M (Hospital Medical Arts),
         and DDSP (Downtown Downey Specific Plan). Additionally, senior housing is
         allowed in the M-U (Mixed Use) zone, subject to the approval of a Conditional
         Use Permit. Affordable senior projects are permitted at densities up to 50 units per
         acre. To assist and facilitate the development of affordable senior housing, the
         Zoning Code permits the following additional incentives: reduced parking
         standards (only 1 space per unit), reduced units sizes (studio at 550 square feet,
         plus 150 additional square feet for each bedroom), height (up to 4 stories), and
         increased maximum lot coverage (60 percent). The City is committed to
         informing developers of the Senior Housing program incentives and will strive to
         promote the application to further encourage development.
         Program Objective: The City will continue to offer incentives to developers to
         facilitate the development of alternative housing models that are favorable to
         senior residents. Throughout the planning period, the City will inform eligible
         property owners of the incentives to develop senior housing through updated
         handouts and information on the City’s website.

Goal 3: Provide Housing Assistance Where Needed
Downey is home to a number of groups with special housing needs, including seniors,
large families, developmentally disabled persons, disabled persons, single parent
families, and extremely low-income individuals, among others. These groups may face
greater difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing due to special
circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's income, family
characteristics, disability, or health issues. The City will continue to cooperate with the
County to assist low income home owners and promote neighborhood stability.
Incentive programs, such as City’s density bonus allowance for projects with affordable
units will also continue and will offer a cost effective means of supporting affordable
housing development.
Policy 3.1:       Use public financial resources, as feasible, to support the provision of
                  housing for lower income households and special needs groups.
Policy 3.2:       Provide rental assistance to address existing housing problems and
                  provide homeownership assistance to expand housing opportunities.
Policy 3.3:       Support the conservation of mobile home parks, government-
                  subsidized housing, and other sources of affordable housing.
Policy 3.4:       Further public-private partnerships        to develop, rehabilitate and
                  maintain affordable housing.

       The City participates in the federal Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
       operated by the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission. The
       MCC program allows qualified first-time homebuyers to take an annual credit
       against their federal income taxes of up to 10 percent of the annual interest paid
       on the applicant's mortgage. The MCC helps the buyer qualify for a loan by
       allowing an authorized lender to reduce housing expense ratio by the amount of
       the tax savings, allowing homebuyers more income available to make monthly
       payments. While the City is not directly responsible for the administration of this

   Program 9 - Section 8 Rental Assistance
         The Section 8 program provides rent subsidies to very low income households
         who overpay for housing. Prospective renters secure housing from HUD-
         registered apartments that accept the certificates. HUD then pays the landlords
         the difference between what the tenant can afford (30 percent of their income)
         and the payment standard negotiated for the community. The City maintains an
         on-going memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Los Angeles County
         Housing Authority, which permits the Authority to provide rental assistance
         programs in the City of Downey. The City’s Housing Division keeps record on the
         number of households in Downey that participate in the Section 8 program. On
         average, there are approximately 620 households that participate in this
         program annually. The Housing Division regularly refers and provides general
         qualification and program information to interested individuals. While the City is
         not directly responsible for the administration of this program, Staff can direct
         residents to the County website and provide information on the program at City
         Hall, on the City website and in public places.
         Program Objective: Continue to provide assistance to households through
         continued participation in the Section 8 program and encourage rental property
         owners to register their units with the Housing Authority. The Housing Division will
         continue to monitor the number of residents accessing the program and units
         available for rent.

Program 10- Los Angeles County Partnership
    As a means of further leveraging housing assistance, the City will cooperate with
    the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (CDC) and Los
    Angeles County Housing Authority to promote resident awareness and
    application for County run housing assistance programs. These programs include:
        •  Housing Economic Recovery Ownership (HERO),
        •  Home Ownership Program (HOP),
        •  American Dream Down Payment Initiative (ADDI),
        •  The Single Family Grant Program (SFGP), and
        •  The Single Family Rehabilitation Loan Program.
    The County offers a variety of housing assistance programs that can supplement
    the City’s current housing programs. As the City has little control over how the
    County’s programs are administered the City will be responsible for providing
    program information on the City’s website and at City Hall.
    Program Objective: Increase resident awareness about housing programs
    offered by the County by advertising them on the City’s website and by offering
    Staff assistance at City Hall.

   Goal 4: Remove Governmental Constraints
   Market and governmental factors pose constraints to the provision of adequate and
   affordable housing. These factors tend to disproportionately impact lower and
   moderate-income households due to their limited resources to absorb additional costs.
   The City is committed to removing governmental constraints that hinder the production
   of housing and offers a streamlined permitting process to facilitate efficient entitlement
   and building permit processing. In addition to the density bonuses and flexible
   development standards already in place, the City proposes revisions to the Zoning
   Ordinance to encourage housing opportunities for extremely low-income households
   and special needs persons.
   Policy 4.1:       Review development fees annually to ensure that fees and exactions
                     do not unduly constrain the production and maintenance of housing.
   Policy 4.2:       Provide for streamlined, timely, and coordinated processing of
                     residential projects to minimize holding costs and encourage housing
                     production.
   Policy 4.3:       Utilize density bonuses, fee reductions, or other regulatory incentives to
                     minimize the effect of governmental constraints.
   Policy 4.4:       Utilize the Housing Authority as a tool to provide sites and assist in the
                     development of affordable housing.
   Program 11 – Remove Development Constraints
          City Staff will periodically review the development standards for the residential
          zones to identify standards that may constrain the development of affordable
          housing and housing for special groups, such as disabled individuals. The City of
          Downey is flexible and is committed to working with developers to build
          affordable units, which may require modifications to constraining standards. The
          City will work with the developer through density bonuses or a PUD if necessary
          and will further review any standards identified in the Housing Element as a
          constraint and alter them as necessary to ensure that the development of
          affordable housing is feasible. In the interim, Staff will continue to, on a case by
          case basis, identify ways that standards can be relaxed if it is determined that
          such requirements are in any way impeding the development of affordable
          housing or housing for disabled residents. The City will also continue to provide

                                    C i t y  o f   D o w n e y
    development standard modifications, streamlined processing for applications
    related to the creation of affordable housing, and will offer fee modifications for
    projects proposing affordable units that are required to apply for variations to
    the existing development standards. Incentives for extremely low income
    housing will be encouraged to prioritize the development of units for this income
    group.
    Program Objective: On an annual basis, the City will review development
    standards, to ensure that the development of lower income housing can occur.
    Revise the development code to address all constraints identified in Section 5 of
    the Housing Element. Staff will continue to use flexible development standards to
    facilitate the development of affordable housing through promotion of
    maximum development densities.

    Time Frame: 2014-2021
Program 12 - Density Bonus
    To facilitate development, the City offers developers the opportunity of a Density
    Bonus Program which is a density increase of 35 percent plus development
    incentives for qualified affordable projects. To be eligible for the Program, the
    affordable project must contain: (1) at least 10 percent of the units reserved for
    low income households; or (2) at least 5 percent reserved for very low income
    households; or (3) at least 50 percent reserved for senior households. The units
    must remain affordable for at least 30 years if both the density bonus and
    development incentives are granted, and 10 years if only the density bonus is
    granted. Additional incentives are available with planned unit developments.
    Developers are informed of the Density Bonus Program through contact with
    Community Development Department staff members and handouts.
    Program Objective: Inform and encourage developers to utilize the density
    program by promoting the program on the City’s website and by offering Staff
    assistance at City Hall.

   Program 13 - Planned Unit Developments
         The Planned Unit Development (PUD) process provides developers with the
         opportunity to plan creative projects that are not constrained by the literal
         application of zoning codes. The PUD application process allows for flexibility in
         site development standards and encourages innovative and imaginative land
         use concepts. The standards of the base zone apply in Planned Unit
         Developments; however, density, setbacks, and open space requirements are
         calculated on a project wide basis.
         Program Objective: Continue to encourage Planned Unit Developments as a
         means to provide affordable housing through creative land use techniques.

   Program 14 - Streamline Processing
         The City continues to monitor permit processing times to ensure the fastest
         possible turnaround for applications. The City modified the application packet to
         simplify and streamline the application process. The City has also been
         computerizing property data to provide more reliable information to the public in
         a more cost-effective manner using new permitting software by Accela. This
         includes zoning, general plan, land use, property owner information, prior
         planning cases, county assessor maps, and digital aerial photographs for each
         parcel. The City's comprehensive zoning map and general plan land use map
         have also been computerized using enhanced geographic information system
         technology.
         Program Objective: Continue to monitor permit processing times and investigate
         ways to streamline the process. Continue to digitize information including
         building permits and the Zoning Code.

Program 15 – Prioritize Housing Program Activities
    The City prioritizes housing program activities to address identified housing needs.
    Specifically, priority has been given to use of rehabilitation loans and grant
    monies to maintain Downey’s stable yet aging housing stock. In addition, the
    City uses CDBG and HOME funding sources to assist in improvements and
    expansions to the City’s existing housing stock. Similarly, funds are made
    available (through the Section 8 program) to address renter over payment issues.
    Finally, priority status has been given to the use of redevelopment agency
    housing set-aside funds to construct new housing affordable to low income
    residents.
    The City recognizes that housing priorities shift over time as housing needs
    change. The characteristics of the City’s current housing need have been
    identified through the Housing Needs Assessment specifically the analysis of the
    special needs groups. Based on the needs analysis in this Housing Element, there
    is a need to provide affordable rental units for large families. The City will also
    prioritize its program activities to meet the needs of other special needs groups,
    including extremely-low income households, and people with disabilities
    including developmental disabilities.
    Program Objective: Identify housing needs and prioritize housing program
    activities to meet those needs through annual updates to the City’s
    Consolidated Plan.

Program 16 - Planning and Development Fees
    The City conducts annual internal reviews of planning and development fees to
    ensure that the fees are not excessive and are appropriate to cover the cost of
    services provided. In addition, the City recently conducted a comprehensive
    review of its internal organization, operations, and finances. Included in this
    comprehensive study were recommendations for changes to the City’s fee
    structure, including development fees.
    Downey also streamlines the permitting process for residential projects, to
    minimize the holding and labor costs assumed by the project applicant.

         Pursuant to Chapter 727, Statues of 2005 (SB 1087), the City of Downey is required
         to deliver its adopted housing element and any amendments thereto to local
         water and sewer service providers, all of which are City of Downey service
         providers. This legislation allows for coordination between the City and water
         and sewer providers when considering approval of new residential projects, to
         ensure that the providers have an opportunity to provide input on the Element.
         Additionally, review of the Housing Element ensures that priority for water and
         sewer services is granted to projects that include units affordable to lower-
         income households.
         Program Objective: Submit the adopted Housing Element to local water and
         sewer providers for their review and input.

         In accordance with Government Code Section 65302, as part of the current
         General Plan update process the City shall review and revise where appropriate
         the Conservation and Safety Elements to consider flood risks when making land
         use decisions. Specifically, the City shall upon the next revision of the housing
         element on or after January 1, 2009, the Conservation Element shall identify
         rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land that may
         accommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and storm
         water management.

    not limited to flood hazard zones, National Flood Insurance Program maps
    published by FEMA, information about flood hazards, designated floodway
    maps, dam failure inundation maps, areas subject to inundation in the event of
    the failure of levees or floodwalls, etc. as listed in Section 65302(g)(2) and
    establish a set of comprehensive goals, policies, and objectives for the

Program 19 - Lot Consolidation
    Parcels identified as part of the Downtown Downey Specific Plan zone range in
    size from approximately 0.5 acres to 2.5 acres and in some cases are narrow or
    shallow in size, which could be seen as an additional constraint to the
    development of housing. To encourage the development of residential and
    mixed-use projects, the City offers incentives to encourage lot consolidation
    including: a reduction in the minimum lot size/dimensions. Also, when feasible
    Staff encourages applicants to utilize the Lot Line Adjustment process to
    consolidate parcels, which is an administrative process with lower fees.        To
    encourage lot consolidation and to promote more intense residential and mixed
    use development on vacant and underutilized sites within the Downtown
    Downey Specific Plan area, the City may also offer to subsidize a portion of
    development fees. The City will promote the program at City Hall, on its website
    and will evaluate requests for funding on a case by case basis.
    Program Objective:       Encourage lot consolidation of smaller parcels to
    accommodate projects including a minimum of 16 units at a density of at least
    30 dwelling units per acre or higher.

   Goal 5: Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
   To fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that housing is
   accessible to all residents, regardless of age, race, religion, family status, or physical
   disability. The City, attempts to achieve this through reasonable accommodation and
   through a partnership with the Fair Housing Foundation of Long Beach.
   Policy 5.1:        Encourage the use of barrier-free architecture in new housing
                      developments.
   Policy 5.2:        Provide Fair Housing Services.
   Program 20 - Reasonable Accommodation for Persons with
   Disabilities
           Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583, the City of Downey is obligated to
           remove potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
           improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons
           with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities
           and counties provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices,
           and procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford
           individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. Reasonable
           accommodation provides a basis for residents with disabilities to request flexibility
           in the application of land use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even
           a waiver of certain restrictions or requirements from the local government to
           ensure equal access to housing opportunities. Cities and counties are required to
           consider requests for accommodations related to housing for people with
           disabilities and provide the accommodation when it is determined to be
           “reasonable” based on fair housing laws and case law interpreting the statutes.
           The City of Downey encourages and promotes accessible housing for persons
           with disabilities. This includes the retrofitting of existing dwelling units and
           enforcement of the State accessibility standards for new residential construction.
           The City is committed to assisting residents in need of reasonable
           accommodation and offers financial assistance though the Housing Rebate and
           Grant Program, and will continue to direct eligible residents to apply for funds.
           Applicants can apply for grants or a rebate to complete improvement projects
           that remove constraints to their living facilities. In general, City Staff takes into
           consideration the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the
           review and approval of housing projects and grants modifications and

    disabilities. The City anticipates that they will have formal reasonable
    accommodations prepared by 2013, however in the instance that formal
    procedures are not implemented during the 2008-2014 planning period due to
    Staff cutbacks, the City would ensure that they are implemented within one year
    of Housing Element adoption.
    Program Objective: Administer the Housing Rebate and Grant Program to assist
    disabled households with architectural modifications to their homes and
    continue to implement the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act
    (ADA). Provide information in public places regarding the City’s reasonable
    accommodation ordinance that expands upon the provisions of the Housing
    Rebate and Grant Program and make information on this program more widely
    available to residents. If necessary implement reasonable accommodate

Program 21 - Fair Housing
    The City will continue to contract with a Fair Housing Foundation to provide
    residents with fair housing services using Community Development Block Grant
    (CDBG) funds. Fair housing services provided by the Fair Housing Foundation
    include counseling and mediation between tenants and landlords. The Fair
    Housing Foundation also conducts seminars and information activities
    throughout the region. The City will refer fair housing complaints to the Fair
    Housing Foundation as appropriate. The City will assist in program outreach
    through placement of fair housing program multilingual brochures at the public
    counter, City library, post office, and other community locations.

3. Quantified Objectives
3.1 – Affordable Housing
Objectives
California Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to estimate the number of
affordable housing opportunities that will be created over the planning period. The
quantified objectives for the 2014-2021 Housing Element presents the anticipated and
potential affordable housing development for the planning period starting on January
1, 2014 and ending September 30, 2021.
It is important to note that while the goal of the quantified objective section is to show
how the City will meet its remaining RHNA allocation, and based on the premise that
the City intends to make every effort to achieve these goals, Downey cannot
guarantee that these needs will be met given limited financial and staff resources, and
the increasing gap in affordability of housing resources and incomes. Satisfaction of
the City’s regional housing needs will partially depend on the cooperation of private
funding sources and resources of the State, Federal and County programs that are
used to support the needs of the extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income
households. Additionally, outside economic forces heavily influence the housing
market. State law recognizes that a locality may not be able to accommodate its
regional fair share housing need.
Table 3-1 presents the City’s quantified objectives in three categories: construction of
new affordable units, substantial rehabilitation of substandard units and the
conservation of affordable housing. New construction of affordable units focuses on the
City’s ability to accommodate its combined remaining RHNA allocation of 1,201units
(see Table 6-4) on land identified in the sites inventory. It is important to note that this
subcategory assumes optimum conditions for the production of housing and does not
take into account how environmental, physical and market conditions influences the
timing, type and cost of housing production in a community.
In addition to new construction, the City anticipates that approximately 10 units will be
assisted annually through the Housing Rebate/Senior Grant Program, as outlined in
Section 2, Housing Plan. As indicated in Table 4-25 there are four ownership properties

   assisted through City programs and 1,201 units will be facilitated and accommodated
   through the housing sites inventory as presented in Section 6, Housing Resources.
   In total the City anticipates that 1,457 units will be constructed, preserved or
   rehabilitated during the planning period, which is more than appropriate to
   accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA allocation.

   Notes:
   (a) Construction objectives represent the number of units the City realistically expects might be constructed within the
       planning period, as opposed to the “units accommodated by opportunity sites” which includes the City’s remaining
       RHNA.
   (b) Any CDBG funding received during the planning period will be used to fund projects that improve and maintain the
       quality of the City’s housing stock and residential infrastructure. The rehabilitation objective is consistent with the City’s
       Housing Plan.
   (c) The conservation/ preservation objective is consistent with the City’s total count of affordable units that are
       permanent but could potentially be at-risk units including 4 at risk ownership units.
   (d) The units included in the table as assisted through programs includes 10 households assisted annually through the
       Housing Rebate and Grant Program. The number of units was estimated by income category based on past utilization
       of the program.

4. Housing Profile
Assuring the availability of adequate housing for all social and economic sectors of the
present and future population is an important goal for Downey. To achieve this goal
requires an assessment of the housing needs of the community and region. This section
discusses the demographic, socio-economic, and housing characteristics of the City of
Downey in an effort to determine the specific housing needs of the City and its
residents.
4.1 – Population Trends and
Characteristics
4.1.1 Population Growth Trends
The 1990 U.S. Census reported that the City of Downey had a population of 91,444
persons. The number of residents grew to 107,323 by the year 2000, marking an
increase of 15,879 people in ten years. This was a 17.4 percent increase. During the
same period, Los Angeles County’s population grew 7.4 percent from 8,863,164 to
9,519,338. The City’s population growth rate was 2.4 times the County’s population
growth rate. In comparison to the cities surrounding Downey (including Bellflower, Bell
Gardens, Norwalk, Paramount, Pico Rivera, and South Gate), Downey had the highest
population growth rate. The surrounding cities experienced population growth rates
ranging from a low of 2.6 percent in Bellflower to a high of 15.9 percent in Paramount
with an average growth rate of 8.9 and a median average population growth rate of
9.6 percent.
Based on the U.S. Census, in 2010 the City's population was 111,772, a 4.1 percent
increase from the population reported in 2000. In comparison to Los Angeles County,
the City’s growth rate was lower than the countywide growth rate of 10.7 percent.
Overall, between 1990 and 2010, the total population growth in Downey was 22.2
percent. During this same period, the growth rate for Los Angeles County was 10.7
percent. The growth rate for Downey was nearly 2 times the County’s growth rate. The
cities surrounding Downey experienced population growth rates during this period
ranging from a low of 6.3 percent in Pico Rivera to a high of 24 percent in Bellflower.
Table 4-1 indicates population growth trends for Downey and surrounding communities.

   4.1.2 Age Characteristics
   Age distribution is an important indicator for determining the future demand for housing
   types in the City. Traditional assumptions are that the young adult population (20 to 34
   years old) has a propensity for choosing apartments, low to moderate priced
   condominiums, and smaller single-family units. The adult population (35 to 65 years old)
   is the primary market for moderate to high-end apartments, condominiums, and larger
   single-family homes. This age group traditionally has higher incomes and larger
   household sizes. The senior population (65 years and older) generates demand for low
   to moderate cost apartments and condominiums, group quarters, and mobile homes.
   Table 4-2 shows the age distribution of the population of the City of Downey in 2010,
   and the proportionate age distribution Los Angeles County residents in 2010.
   According to the 2010 Census, Los Angeles County, as a whole, can be characterized
   as having a young population (34.8 years in 2010). Downey follows this trend with a
   median age of 33.3 years in 2010. In Downey, preschool and school age residents
   comprised 30 percent of the population in 2010. Young adults between the ages of 25
   and 44 comprised 29.5 percent of the population. Finally, senior residents, ages 65 years
   and older, comprise approximately ten percent of the total population. As the majority
   of the population is school age or considered to be a young adult, it evident the
   Downey is predominately made up of families.

4.1.3 Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of a community affects housing needs due to the
particular household characteristics of different groups. Table 4-3 shows the changes in
the racial/ethnic composition of Downey residents between 2000 and 2010.
In Downey, between 2000 and 2010, there was a major and continuing shift in the
racial/ethnic composition of the population. The greatest shift, reflecting a regional
trend, has been the growth and predominance of the Hispanic population group,
transitioning from a white, non-Hispanic majority. In 2010, the Hispanic population made
up 70.7 percent of the total population, a 12.8 percent increase from 2000.
In addition to the Hispanic Origin/White, Non-Hispanic demographic trends, between
2000 and 2010, the Black (African-American) population decreased by 3.8 percent,
and the Asian/Pacific Islander population increased by 0.4 percent. The 2010 Census
identified 495 Black, and 608 Asian/Pacific Islander residents in the City. In 2010 the U.S
Census also reports that 320 people identified as American Indian a significant
decrease from 929 persons in 2000.

   4.1.4 Employment
   The 2010 U.S. Census reports that there were 54,941 people in the Downey labor force.
   As shown in Table 4-4, there were 49,557 Downey residents employed, indicating an
   unemployment rate of 9.8 percent. Out of the six occupational categories listed in
   Table 4-4, 20.4 percent of the employed worked in educational services, and health
   care and social assistance occupations. The next highest category (with 11.4 percent
   of the employed) is retail trade. Generally, pay compensation for managerial,
   professional and related occupations are significantly higher than all of the other
   occupation categories. However, because the categories listed below are so broad, it
   is difficult to draw more specific conclusions.
   The construction industry has a 6.7 percent share of the employed labor force for the
   City. Current industry trends in Southern California suggest a significant drop in
   construction industry employment. The residential construction industry, although
   recently booming, has stalled and shrunk due to the contracting of the housing market
   as of the writing of this document. The education, health and social services industry,
   however, has been growing and is expected to continue to grow as long as the State
   population continues to grow and the aging “baby boomer” population continues to
   grow.

4.2 – Housing Characteristics
An analysis of household characteristics provides important information on the housing
needs of the community. Income and affordability are best measured at the
household level, as are the special needs of certain groups, such as large families,
female-headed households or very low-income households. For example, if a City has
a substantial number of young families whose incomes preclude the option of buying a
home due to local housing costs; it may wish to initiate a homebuyer assistance
program.
4.2.1 - Household Composition and Size
The Bureau of the Census defines a "household" as all persons who occupy a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
                                                   2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g E l e m e n t 45

   blood, or unrelated persons sharing living quarters. Persons living in retirement or
   convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered
   households. The characteristics of the households in a City are important indicators of
   the type of housing needed in that community.
   According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 33,936 households in the City of Downey
   with an average household size of 3.27 persons. Of these households, 26,490
   (approximately 78 percent) were families. Generally, Downey was among the leading
   cities in the region with an overwhelming majority of family households. In comparison,
   in 2010, the Los Angeles County family households comprise 67.7 percent of all
   households. Single-person households also had a significant presence in the City. In
   2010, 16.8 percent of all households in Downey were single person households. The
   remaining 5.1 percent of households were unrelated non-family households, which
   consist of households with unrelated persons living together. Household characteristics
   are shown in Table 4-5.

   Household size is an important indicator of a source of population growth. A City's
   average household size is also an indicator of the character and size of households,
   which represent the most basic unit of demand for housing. Although there can be
   more than one household in a housing unit, which is a trend that is increasing regionally,
   the measure of persons per household provides not only an indication of the number of
   persons residing in a household organizing unit, but the number of persons living in a
   housing unit. Average household size can be both a result and indicator of housing
   affordability and other household economic conditions.
   As indicated in Table 4-5, between 2000 and 2010, the average household size in
   Downey increased significantly from 3.20 to 3.27 persons per household. However, as

noted in Table 4-6, among neighboring cities, Downey had the third lowest persons per
household compared to its neighboring cities. The persons per household among
neighboring cities range from a low of 3.13 persons per household in the City of
Bellflower to a high of 4.18 persons per household in the City of Bell Gardens. The
County of Los Angeles had 2.97 persons per household in 2010.

4.2.2 – Overcrowding
The federal government defines an overcrowded household as one with more than
one occupant per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. An
overcrowded household results from either a lack of affordable housing (which forces
more than one household to live together) and/or a lack of available housing units of
adequate size.
According to the 2011 American Community Survey, 2,288 households, or 6.74 percent
of all households in Downey were overcrowded. Of this total approximately 955 were
renter households, representing 2.9 percent of all overcrowded households and 5.7
percent of all renter households. The incident of overcrowded households can lead to
neighborhood deterioration due to the intensive use of individual housing units leading
to excessive wear and tear, and the potential cumulative overburdening of community
infrastructure and service capacity. Furthermore, overcrowding in neighborhoods can
lead to an overall decline in social cohesion and environmental quality. Such decline
can often spread geographically and impact the quality of life and the economic
value of property and the vitality of commerce within a City.

   4.2.3. – Household Income and Income
   Distribution
   Assessing income groups is a major component of evaluating housing affordability.
   According to the 2010 Census, the median household income in Downey was $59,674
   per year. The median household income for the County of Los Angeles was less but
   close to the City median at $55,476 per year. Among neighboring cities, the median
   household income ranged from a low of $39,167 in Bell Gardens to a high of $50,565 in
   Bellflower. The $45,667 median household income for the City of Downey was the third
   highest among neighboring cities, behind Bellflower at $59,674 and Norwalk at $60,488.
   The State Department of Housing and Community Development developed the
   following income categories based on the Median Family Income (MFI) of a
   Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) established by the U.S. Department of Housing and
   Urban Development:
       •    Very Low-Income: 50 percent or less of the area MFI;
       •    Low-Income: between 51 and 80 percent of the area MFI;
       •    Moderate-Income: between 81 and 120 percent of the area MFI;
       •    Upper-Income: greater than 120 percent of the area MFI.
   The 2010 MFI for the Los Angeles County MSA ($63,000) was used to interpolate the
   City's income distribution from the census according to the above categories. The
   income distribution of the City of Downey, based on 2010 Census data, is presented in
   Table 4-8. In 2010, it is estimated that: 7 percent of the households earned less than
   $14,999 annually; 20 percent earned between $15,000 and $34,999 annually; 15
   percent earned between $35,000 and $49,999 annually; 21 percent earned between
   $50,000 and $74,999 annually; and 37 percent earned above $75,000 annually.

4.2.4 – Housing Overpayment
State and Federal standards indicate that a household paying more than 30 percent of
its income for housing is overpaying. Overpayment for housing can cause an
imbalance on the remainder of a household’s budget. In 2010, there were 27,917 total
households paying mortgage or rent, of those households 55 percent were overpaying
for housing according to the Census.                   Of these overpaying households, 7,165 (45
percent) were households with a mortgage, while the remaining 8,409 households (55
percent) were in renter-occupied units. Table 4-9 summarizes housing overpayment
statistics by tenure for the City of Downey and also LA County.

   4.3 – Special Needs Groups
   State law recognizes that certain households have more difficulty in finding adequate
   and affordable housing due to special circumstances. Special needs populations
   include the elderly, persons with disabilities, female headed households, large
   households and farm workers. In addition, many often have lower incomes as a result of
   their condition. Table 4-10 summarizes the special needs populations in Downey. Each
   of these population groups, as well s their housing needs is described below.

4.3.1 – Elderly
The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern in Downey. Many of
the elderly resident in the City are retired and living on a fixed low-income, which puts
them at greater risk of impaction, or housing overpayment. In addition, the elderly
maintain special needs related to housing construction and location. The elderly often
require ramps, handrails, lower cupboards and counters to allow greater access and
mobility. In terms of location, because of limited mobility, the elderly typically need
access to public facilities (i.e., medical and shopping) and public transit facilities.
As reported in the 2009-2011 American Community Survey, 11,099 City residents, or 10
percent of the total population, were 65 years old or older. In terms of tenure, 4,544
owner-occupied and 1,503 renter-occupied units were headed by occupants 65 years
old or older. Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most
often retired and have fixed income.               While the vast majority of seniors are
homeowners, the number of lower income senior renters who are overpaying for
housing remains a general concern moving into the 2014-2021 planning period. The City
is aware of this issue and has worked with developers in the past to provide affordable
rental housing specifically for seniors. In 1999 a 31-unit senior housing complex, Heritage
Courts Senior Apartments was developed that is 100 percent affordable and limited to
residents 65 or older. Within the complex there are 12 one-bedroom units and 19 two-
bedroom units. The covenant on the development does not expire until 2039.
The City will continue to work with developers to provide affordable housing
opportunities for senior residents and will continue to offer funding for home
modifications through the Housing Rebate and Grant Program.
4.3.2 – Disabled Persons
Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to traditionally designed housing
units as well as potentially limit the ability to earn adequate income. As shown in Table
4-11, the 2008 - 2010 American Community Survey Estimates indicates that 7.8 percent
of Downey’s population age 18 years and older has some form of work or mobility/self-
care disability. A total of 8.2 percent of the City’s population age 18 years and over
has one or more disabilities.
Although no current comparisons of disability with income, household size, or
race/ethnicity are available, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial portion of
disabled persons would have annual incomes within Federal Section 8 income limits,
especially those households not in the labor force. Furthermore, many lower-income
                                              2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g E l e m e n t 51

                                C i t y      o f     D o w n e y
   disabled persons are likely to require housing assistance. Their housing needs are further
   compounded by design issues and location requirements, which can often be costly.
   For example, special needs of households with wheelchair-bound or semi-ambulatory
   individuals may require ramps, holding bars, special bathroom designs, wider doorways,
   lower cabinets, elevators, and other interior and exterior design features.
   Housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities can be addressed through the
   provision of affordable, barrier-free housing. Rehabilitation assistance can be targeted
   toward disabled renters and homeowners for unit modification to improve accessibility.

   4.3.3 – Developmentally Disabled Persons
   According to Section 4512 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code a
   "Developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains
   age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a
   substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral
52      2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1       H o u s i n g         E l e m e n t

                                                   C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be
closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for
individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions
that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue
in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the
person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and
their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental
centers, and two community-based facilities. The South Central Los Angeles Regional
Center is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry
to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit
community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of
services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
Table 4-12 provides information from the South Central Los Angeles Regional Center of
on the number of developmentally disabled individuals in the City of Downey. In 2012,
there were approximately 268 individuals actively utilizing services at the Regional
Center for a developmental disability.

To assist with any housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will
implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the South
Central Los Angeles Regional Center and encourage housing providers to designate a
portion of new affordable housing developments for persons with disabilities, especially
                                                      2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1    H o u s i n g  E l e m e n t 53

   persons with special needs and disabilities.
   4.3.4 – Large Households
   The 2010 Census reports that 7,615 households (22.8 percent) in the City of Downey are
   large households. Large households are defined as those with five or more members.
   The special needs of this household type are based on the potential limited availability
   of adequately sized, affordable housing units. The 2010 Census also indicates that 3,159
   large households are renter households, representing 41.4 percent of all large
   households and 18.9 percent of all renter households in the City.
   There are approximately 13,826 housing units in the City with four or more bedrooms.
   There are an additional 6,326 3-bedroom housing units. Cumulatively, over two-thirds of
   the City’s housing stock has three bedrooms or more. However, due to the fact that
   some large families often have limited financial resources, these households may be
   more vulnerable to overcrowded living conditions. The housing needs of large
   households can be addressed through the expansion of existing smaller units, and the
   provision of new, affordably-priced larger units. The fact that the majority of unit
   overcrowding occurs in the City's rental housing stock indicates the need for larger
   rental units and/or rental subsidies to allow for large households to afford adequately
   sized units. The City has included a housing program to specifically address the needs of
   this group in the 2014-2021 Housing Plan.
   4.3.5 – Female-Headed Households
   Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance due to
   their greater need for affordable and accessible day care, health care, and other
   supportive services. In particular, many female-headed households with children are
   susceptible to having lower incomes than similar two-parent households. Single, female
   mothers also face social marginalization pressures that often limit their occupational
   choices, housing options and access to supportive services.
   The 2006 – 2010 American Community Survey indicates that there are 6,418 female-
   headed households in the City of Downey, of which 3,286 have children under the age
   of 18. These numbers account for approximately 19 percent and 9.8 percent,
   respectively, of all households in the City. In the County, there are 491,428 female –
   headed households with no husband present, of which 261,586 have children under the
   age of 18. These numbers account for approximately 22 percent and 12 percent,
54    2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1   H o u s i n g  E l e m e n t

                                         C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
respectively, of all households in the County. The percentage of female-headed
households within the City is slightly higher than that of County as a whole.
4.3.6 – Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through seasonal agricultural work. Farm workers have special housing needs because
they earn lower incomes than many other workers and move throughout the year from
one harvest location to the next.
The 2006 – 2010 American Community Survey reported that less than one percent of the
City of Downey’s residents (158 persons) were employed in Agriculture, Farming,
Forestry, and Fishing occupations. Due to Downey’s urban setting, the non-existence of
agricultural activities in the City, and nominal farm worker population, the special
housing needs of this group can generally be addressed through overall programs for
housing affordability.
4.3.7 – Extremely Low-Income Households
According to 2005 – 2009 CHAS data generated for the City, there were approximately
4,310 very low-income households living in Downey. Very low-income households are
those households that earn 50 percent or less of the median family income (MFI) for the
statistical region in which they are located. Extremely low-income households are those
households which earn less than 30 percent of the MFI. There are approximately 4,055
extremely low income households in Downey (renters and owners). Table 4-13, below,
includes data characterizing affordability and other housing problems in Downey for
various income groups.
There are limited opportunities to address the housing needs of extremely low-income
households in Downey. However, the needs of this special needs group are taken into
consideration and are generally addressed through the City’s overall programs for
housing affordability.

   4.3.8 – Homeless Persons
   According to the City of Downey Community Development Department, there are a
   nominal number of transients in the City at one time. The Downey Police Department
   estimated that approximately15-20 individuals may reside in the City at any one time,
   however it was stated that the number does fluctuate. The City of Downey has seen an
   increase in that number since hospitals in neighboring cities have shut down. Transients
   are transported to Downey hospitals and when they are released, they stay in the City.
   The City provides the transients with homeless shelters and emergency food locations,
   but typically this assistance is refused.
   The City of Downey is one of 100 communities nationwide participating in the 100,000
   Homes Campaign, a national movement to identify and house 100,000 of the most
   vulnerable homeless nationwide by July 2014. Through this effort, known as Downey

from January 29-31, 2013, between the hours of 8 PM and 1 AM to count the number of
homeless individuals sleeping in the City. Downey Counts is a community-driven street-
to-home initiative spearheaded by The Moravian Church of Downey, Kingdom Causes
Bellflower, and Our Place Housing Solutions, in collaboration with local government,
regional non-profit organizations, and community volunteers that aims to identify and
permanently house the most vulnerable homeless persons living on the streets of
Downey. Hotspots for homeless encampments within Downey were selected by a team
of outreach workers and the Downey Police Department. The final count for the City
included 65 individuals in January 2013.
4.3.9 – Emergency Shelters and Transitional
Housing
There are two confidential emergency shelters or transitional housing facilities in the City
of Downey. The additional emergency shelters and transitional housing facilities are
available the nearby Cities of Bell, Long Beach, Santa Ana and Downtown Los Angeles.
These facilities provide temporary shelter and some services for individuals to help them
prepare for re-entering market rate rental housing. Table 4-14 lists homeless services
and facilities in the region.

   4.4 – Housing Characteristics
   A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, or single room occupied as separate
   living quarters or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
   Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from
   any other person in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the
   building or through a common hall. A community's housing stock is the compilation of
   all its housing units.
   4.4.1 – Housing Growth
   According to the 2006 – 2010 American Community Survey, there are 34,836 dwelling
   units in Downey, an increase of 87 units (0.25 percent) since 2000. The growth rate for
   the City is significantly lower than the growth rate for the County overall (5.4 percent).
   Compared to neighboring jurisdictions, Downey had the lowest growth rate for the time
   period of 2000 to 2012. A comparison of housing growth trends for Downey and
   neighboring jurisdictions is provided in Table 4-15.

4.4.2 – Housing Type and Tenure
Table 4-16 provides characterization of the City's housing stock in 2000 and 2010 by unit
type. The 2010 Census indicates that single-family detached homes continue to be the
predominant housing type in the City; however the majority of growth occurring is
condominium and apartment complexes with five or more units. As the City is largely
built out, most new housing development is occurring as infill on underutilized parcels.
According to the 2010 Census, the proportion of owner-occupied households in
Downey was 51.4 percent which is slightly higher than that of renter-occupied
households at 48.5 percent.

   4.4.3 – Age and Condition of Housing Stock
   Table 4-17 shows the age of the housing stock in Downey. In general, housing over 30
   years old is usually in need of some major rehabilitation, such as a new roof, plumbing,
   etc. As indicated in Table 4-17, approximately 85.7 percent of Downey’s housing units
   were constructed prior to 1980 with a significant portion (42 percent) constructed
   between 1950 and 1960. Typically, units that are more than 30 years old, require
   preventative maintenance to avoid major housing deterioration. Some households,
   such as senior households, who are long time homeowners living on limited income,
   may not be able to afford the cost of major repairs or renovations needed to maintain
   their property. Assistance, however, is available through the City’s housing rehabilitation
   assistance programs, including the Housing Rebate and Grant Program. These existing
   programs can help preserve the City's existing affordable housing stock.

   The Code Enforcement Division is responsible for code enforcement activities in the
   City. In the process of handling code enforcement caseloads, the Code Enforcement
   Division compiles statistics on the number and type of code complaints in the City.
   According to the Code Enforcement Division, in 2012 there were approximately 829
   residential property complaints. Of these complaints, 645 were for property
   maintenance issues and 184 were for illegal conversions of garages into housing units.

maintenance complaints usually involve overgrown and un-kept landscaping, peeling
paint, broken windows and screens, deteriorated roofs and other property deficiencies
that indicate prolonged deferred maintenance. The illegal-conversion of garages to
living quarters, on the other hand, can indicate the presence of overcrowding due to a
lack of affordable housing in the community. Although there are other categories of
code enforcement complaints received by the Code Enforcement Division, these two
types of complaints are the most common that relate to housing condition and
affordability.
4.4.4 – Housing Costs
Affordability is determined by comparing the cost of housing to the income of local
households. HUD defines affordable housing costs as contract rents or mortgage
payments, including taxes and insurance, but not utilities, that are equal to or less than
30 percent of the gross income of very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
Households spending more than 30 percent of gross annual income on housing
experience a housing cost burden, which occurs when housing costs increase faster
than household income. When a household spends more than 30 percent of its income
on housing costs, it has less disposable income for other necessities such as health care.
Lower income households with a burdensome housing cost are more likely to become
homeless or experience overcrowding. Homeowners with a housing cost burden have
the option of selling the homes and becoming renters. Renters, however, are vulnerable
and subject to constant changes in the housing market.
For purposes of determining housing affordability, the California Health and Safety
Code Section 50052.5 provides the following definition of affordable housing cost
based on the area median income (AMI), which is adjusted by family size and income
level for each multi-family income (MFI) range.

   4.4.4.A – For Sale Housing
   The City of Downey currently has the highest median value for owner-occupied housing
   stock in the southeast Los Angeles County area. The 2010 Census documents a median
   housing unit value of $522,800 in Downey. This is approximately 2 percent above the
   countywide median of $508,800. Table 4-19 compares single-family and condominium
   sales prices during August 2012 in Downey and nearby communities by ZIP code, and
   contrasts this with the sale prices during August 2011. A total of 81 units were sold in the
   City during 2012, commanding a median sales price of $342,000. Median sale prices in
   Downey were higher than all of the neighboring communities. The year to year price
   increase was comparable to that experienced among all the neighboring jurisdictions,
   the majority of which experienced an increase in single-family median home prices.

   According to Trulia.com, in October 2012, there were 7 less housing listings in than in
   September 2012. A sample of 152 sold homes (single-family residences and
   condominiums/townhouses) sold in early 2008, showed that the majority (53.2 percent)
   had 3 bedrooms. The second most sold type (26 percent) had 2 bedrooms. Four-
   bedroom homes were 15 percent of the total homes sold. In comparison, Table 4-20,
   below, indicates that two and three-bedroom homes still constitute the greatest
   proportion of housing units within the City. Three-bedroom homes make up the most
   significant part (33.5 percent) of the City’s housing stock. Four or more bedroom homes
   were approximately 15 percent of the housing stock. Most of these larger homes were
   built during or after the 1980s.

A review of recent Craig’s List listings for Los Angeles, a regional internet classified ad
website, and Spring Street at www.springstreet.net, an internet rental real estate
service, shows that rental rates in Downey are comparable to those in the immediate
neighboring Cities of Bellflower and Norwalk.
4.4.4.D – Housing Costs and Affordability
The costs of home ownership and rent can be compared to a household's ability to pay
for housing, using the 2012 HUD-established Area Median Family Income (MFI) limit for
Los Angeles County of $64,800. Table 4-24 illustrates maximum affordable mortgage
payments and rents for a four-person household in Los Angeles County. Affordable
housing cost is based on a maximum of 30 percent of gross household income devoted
to mortgage or rental costs. These maximum affordable costs would be adjusted
downward for smaller households, or upward for larger households.
Comparison of these maximum affordable                     housing costs with the sales price data
shown sold in Downey. It should be noted,                  however, that listing previously, indicates
that not even moderate income households                   (81 to 120 percent MFI) would be able to
afford the lowest priced single-family homes               recently prices can often be higher than
                                                    2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1   H o u s i n g    E l e m e n t 67

                         C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
   actual sales prices.
   According to the data in Table 4-24, very low-income households would not be able to
   afford rental apartments in the City given the current market trends. The lowest priced
   rental unit offered, according to the data collected, was a one-bedroom apartment
   for $950/month. The maximum rent affordable to very low-income households is $658
   (for a four-person household). Some low-income households are also priced out of the
   rental market in Downey. The maximum rental rate affordable to a low- income
   household is $1,026. This would make only studios and one-bedroom apartments
   available to the highest earning low-income households.
   Moderate-income households could afford rental units within the City. However, they
   would be limited to one and two-bedroom apartment units. The range of affordability
   for moderate-income rental housing is $696 to $2,138 per month. Rental rates for one
   and two-bedroom units range from $950 to $1,850. Some 3-bedroom apartments
   would also be affordable to the moderate-income household with a rent cost of 1,785
   and below.
   As previously indicated, there are condominiums, townhouses and single-family
   residences for rent in the City but in limited numbers. Their rental rates range from a low
   of $1,300 to a high of $2,100 per month. Within this range, there are limited rental
   opportunities for some moderate-income households.

    4.5 – Assisted Housing At-Risk
    of Conversion
    State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for currently rent-
    restricted low-income housing units to convert to market rate housing, and to propose
    programs to preserve or replace any units “at risk” of conversion. This section presents
    an inventory of all assisted rental housing in Downey, and evaluates those units at risk of
    conversion during the eight year 2014-2021 planning period. There are currently two
    rental properties with affordability convents; neither is at risk during the planning period.

    Currently the City has no renter occupied units at risk during the planning period.
    Conversely, all of the owner-occupied units, shown in Table 4-25, are at risk of
    conversion during the 2014-2021 planning period. The City will actively work to create
    programs in which the focus is to preserve these units beyond the expiration of the
    covenant so that the owners are able to have affordable housing options.

5. Housing Constraints
This section of the Housing Element examines constraints that could hinder the City’s
achievement of its objectives and the resources that are available to assist in the
production, maintenance and improvement of the City’s housing stock.
Constraints to the provision of housing may be governmental, such as development
standards and zoning regulations or non-governmental which may include market and
environmental factors. State law requires that Housing Elements analyze potential and
actual governmental and non-governmental constraints to the production,
maintenance, and improvements of housing for all persons of all income levels and
disabilities. The constraints analysis must also demonstrate efforts by the local jurisdiction
to remove governmental constraints that hinder achievement of housing goals.
5.1 – Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints are policies, development regulations, standards,
requirements or other actions imposed by the various levels of government upon land
and housing ownership and development. Although Federal and State agencies play
a role in the imposition of governmental constraints, the actions of these agencies are,
for the most part, beyond the influence of local government and are therefore not
addressed in this document. Apart from federally determined interest rates and State
Building Codes, most governmental constraints are local. Land use controls, building
codes, processing procedures, and development fees are all factors that may
constrain the maintenance, improvement and/or development of housing in the City.
State and federal regulations, which the City has no control over, can also add to
governmental constraints. Regulations related to environmental protection, building
codes, and other topics have significant, often adverse, impacts on housing costs and
availability. While constraints exist at other levels of government, this section emphasizes
policies and regulations that can be mitigated by the City.

   5.1.1 – Land Use Controls
   The Land Use Element of the City of Downey's Vision 2025 General Plan sets forth the
   City's policies for guiding local development. These policies, together with existing
   zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land to be allocated for
   different uses within the City. The City of Downey Vision 2025 General Plan and Zoning
   Ordinance provide for a range of different intensities of residential land use, including
   the following:
   •   Single-Family Residential (R-1) - up to 8 dwelling units per acre, including:
       •   R-1 5,000 - up to 8 dwelling units per acre
       •   R-1 6,000 - up to 7 dwelling units per acre
       •   R-1 7,500 - up to 5.8 dwelling units per acre.
       •   R-1 8,500 - up to 5 dwelling units per acre
       •   R-1 10,000 - up to 4 dwelling units per acre.
   •   Two-Family Residential (R-2) - up to 17 dwelling units per acre
   •   Multi-Family Residential (R-3) - up to 24 dwelling units per acre
   •   Downtown Downey Specific Plan (DDSP) – up to 75 dwelling units per acre
   Housing supply and cost are greatly affected by the amount of land designated for
   residential use and the density at which development is permitted. In Downey, 62
   percent of the City's land area (3,764 acres) is designated for residential use. Single-
   family residential neighborhoods are by far the most common residential use in
   Downey, accounting for 54 percent of all City acreage, and 87 percent of residential
   acreage in the City. Residential land use acreage includes land used for stacked-flat
   apartment complexes, “stacked flat” -style condominiums, and “townhome” -style
   condominiums.
   The Final EIR for the Downey Vision 2025 General Plan, adopted in 2005, documents a
   residential “build out” of 36,915 units, or 2,156 units above the City’s existing (2000)
   housing stock of 34,759 units. This figure includes all vacant and developed residential
   land. Most of the land is already developed but some parcels are underutilized under
   the Zoning Code. All new housing units are likely to come from under-utilized residential
   properties. This will occur through the expansion of the existing housing supply through
   recycling of lower density development or underutilized land to higher densities. The
   City also anticipates new development in the mixed use districts established in the
   Downtown Downey Specific Plan, adopted in September 2010.

5.1.2 – Residential Development Standards
The City's current residential development standards, both on and off-site, are typical
for those cities immediately surrounding Downey. The surrounding cities developed and
matured during the same period. The density permitted, yard setback requirements,
and other standards regulating residential development in the City are in concert with
those being used by other surrounding communities and to a great extent, throughout
the suburbs of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. The Downey Municipal Zoning Code
limits all single-family residential building heights to between 26 and 30 feet in two
stories. Multifamily building heights are limited to 35 feet or 3 stories, whichever is less.
The City currently offers a height and/or density bonus for affordable units. In addition,
the application of these standards, particularly in the multiple-family residential zone
districts (R2 and R3 zones), has resulted in the redevelopment of parcels (that were
previously underdeveloped) with new residential projects.              Typical redevelopment
includes demolition of current structures and the construction of new units to the
allowed maximum density (24 du/acre), usually consisting of multifamily dwellings with
units located above ground floor garages. Examples of these types of projects include
projects recently constructed on the south side of Telegraph Road, along the City’s
northern border with Pico Riviera.
The City has recently undertaken a comprehensive update to its residential
development standards in 2008. The adopted residential development standards
place slightly greater restrictions on the permitted sizes of houses in R-1 zone districts,
including more restrictive setback requirements. These standards are aimed to limit the
size of single family homes in the City to discourage over-sized homes that are
incompatible with homes in existing single-family neighborhoods. For properties in the R-
3 zoning district, the development standards remain largely unchanged (setback,
height, and parking requirements) from the existing standards. Therefore, the new
standards will not introduce new regulatory requirements nor would they impede the
redevelopment of underdeveloped multifamily zoned properties as described above.
The current residential development standards for single-family development are shown
in Table 5-1 and development standards for multi-family development are summarized
in Table 5-2.

   5.1.3 – Provisions for a Variety of Housing
   Types
   Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to identify available sites in appropriate zone
   districts with development standards that encourage the development of a variety of
   housing types for all income levels, including multi-family rental housing, factory-built
   housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. The following
   paragraphs describe how the City makes provisions for these types of housing.
   5.1.3.A – Multi-Family Rental Housing
   Multiple-family housing is the second most predominant dwelling type in the City,
   comprising about 42 percent of the total housing units. The number of multi-family units
   has increased in recent years as underdeveloped multi-family zoned lots with only one
   unit located on them are recycled and redeveloped with higher density uses. Many

multi-family zoned lots occupied with single-family homes are still located throughout
the City. The City’s Zoning Ordinance provides for multiple-family units in the R-3 Zone.
In addition, the City has also identified the Downtown Downey Specific Plan area as an
opportunity area for the development of multifamily housing. The Downtown Downey
Specific Plan was initiated by the City to guide growth and residential development in
Downtown, encourage economic revitalization, and create a lively center of activity
for the City. The Specific Plan establishes 131 acres as mixed use and looks to create
unique districts with specific development standards and design guidelines. Downtown
Downey is envisioned as a vibrant urban center providing a wide array of dining,
working, living, shopping, entertainment, and cultural opportunities all within a short
walking distance. The Specific Plan includes specific objectives to focus growth in the
Downtown area, by allowing and promoting higher density residential and mixed use
development and to develop residential uses for all income levels.
The Specific Plan, adopted in 2010, establishes five unique land use districts, four of
which all for mixed use and residential development by right. The four districts
permitting residential development do so at the following densities:
    1. Downtown Core – 20 to 40 dwelling units per acre
    2. Downtown Residential – 8 to 40 dwelling units per acre
    3. Firestone Boulevard Gateway – 40 to 75 dwelling units per acre
    4. Paramount Boulevard Professional – 20 to 40 dwelling units per acre
Table 5-3 presents the development standards for the Downtown Downey Specific Plan
area.

   Source: Downtown Downey Specific Plan, adopted September 2010.
   The City has identified the Downtown Specific Plan area as a key growth area. The
   Specific Plan strategically aims to facilitate the development of employment
   opportunities, dining, shopping, neighborhood services, and residential uses in close
   proximity to reduce vehicle trips and create a vibrant downtown. In 2012, the City
   approved an application for the first new multifamily residential project within the
   Specific Plan area. The 50 unit project, named The View, is deed restricted for very low
   (5 units) and low income (45 units) households. It is anticipated based on the allowed
   densities and the sites available that the Specific Plan area will offer significant
   opportunities to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation. Furthermore the City
   encourages the development of residential uses to the maximum extent possible
   through development incentives, including: density bonuses, shared parking/parking
   reductions, development standard modifications, and fee modifications whenever
   feasible.
   5.1.3.B – Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
   The 2006-2010 American Community Survey Estimates, report there were 318 mobile
   homes in the City in 2010. A more recent mobile home survey conducted by the
   Planning Division Staff found, however, that there are actually only 185 mobile homes in
   the City. The City of Downey provides for mobile homes within existing mobile home
   parks, and manufactured homes in residential established neighborhoods provided
   they meet specific standards, including being certified according to the National
   Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Manufactured
   units must be installed on a permanent foundation in compliance with all applicable
   building regulations and Title 25 of the California Health and Safety Code.
   Existing mobile home parks in Downey are show in Table 5-4.

5.1.3.C - Second Units
The City’s zoning ordinance specifically provides for second dwelling units on single-
family residential zoned lots in 24 specially designated R-1 overlay districts set aside for
second unit development (called “SUD’s”). Specific development standards are
included in the SUD overlay, to accommodate second single family dwellings that are
compatible with the existing single-family dwelling on each lot. An inventory of sites
with potential to accommodate second units within the Second Unit Overlay is
included in Section 6, Housing Resources. The City has historically seen great success
with their second unit development overlay and promotes the program on the City
website and in other public places. Generally, second units include one or two
bedrooms and the City has found they are rented at below market rents. Based on the
price per square foot of the units developed during the previous planning period, City
Staff has found that 50 percent of second units are affordable to lower income
households and 50 percent moderate income households. Consequently, for the 2014-
2021 planning period, the City has utilized this ratio to estimate that second units are a
key strategy to equally accommodate their low and moderate income RHNA
allocation.
5.1.3.D - Transitional Housing and Emergency Shelters
Pursuant to State law, the City permits transitional or supportive housing (when there are
6 or fewer residents) in all residential zones in the City. These facilities are subject to the
                                                    2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t 79

                          C i t y   o f  D o w n e y
   same underlying zoning standards as other residential uses in the same residential
   zoning district.
   Due to funding reductions and staff cutbacks the City was unable to complete the
   Zoning Code amendments to address transitional housing and emergency shelters in
   the time specified by the 2008-2014 Housing Plan. The City has drafted an ordinance
   amending the Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters and transitional living facilities
   in the Hospital Medical Arts (H-M) Zone by right without any other discretionary permit
   required. During the planning period a new residential care facility opened for disabled
   residents and City Staff approved the expansion of an existing emergency shelter. The
   City will take the Ordinance to City Council in early 2013.
   5.1.3.E – Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing
   Due to funding reductions and staff cutbacks the City was unable to complete the
   Zoning Code amendments to address SRO units in the time specified by the 2008-2014
   Housing Plan. The City has drafted an ordinance amending the Zoning Code to permit
   SRO’s in at least one non-residential zone as a permitted use and SRO’s as a
   conditionally permitted use in appropriate residential zones. The applicable
   development standards are no more restrictive than standards that apply to other
   residential uses of the same type permitted in the same zone. The City will take the
   Ordinance to City Council in January 2013.
   5.1.3.F – Housing for Persons with Disabilities
   Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of traditional design as well as
   limit the ability to earn adequate income. In 2010, approximately 8.2 percent of
   Downey’s population was reported to be living with a disability. This count includes age-
   related as well as other disabilities. Housing opportunities for the physically disabled are
   maximized through the provision of affordable, barrier-free housing. Special
   modifications include units with access ramps, wider doorways, assist bars in bathrooms,
   lower cabinets, and elevators. This is accomplished through the City’s compliance with
   the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the 2007 Title 24 Part 2, California
   Building Code regulations. In addition, the City administers the Housing Rebate and
   Grant Program that provides financial assistance to disabled households to perform
   modifications such as those described above.
   As previously indicated, the Downey Municipal Code permits residential care facilities,
   including facilities for the disabled (with 6 or fewer residents), by right in all zones that all
   residential uses in the City. For group homes with 7 or more residents, the City requires
   approval of a conditional use permit in all residential zones in the City. There are no
   facility concentration or distance requirements or similar limitations for either type of
   residential care facility. The applicable development standards are no more restrictive

                                        C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
than standards that apply to other residential uses of the same type permitted in the
same zone.
The City of Downey defines a “family” as “two (2) or more persons bearing the generic
character of, and living together as, a relatively permanent single bona fide
housekeeping unit in a domestic relationship based upon birth, marriage, or other
domestic bond of social, economic, and psychological commitment to each other, as
distinguished from a group occupying a boarding house, club, dormitory, fraternity,
lodging house, motel, rehabilitation center, rest home, or sorority.”
5.1.4 – Development Impact and Planning
Entitlement Fees
The City collects various development impact fees and planning entitlement fees from
developers to cover the costs of processing permits and providing necessary services
and infrastructure. Fees are usually collected upon filing of an application for
development projects that require discretionary approval or at the time building
permits are issued.
5.1.4.A – Development Impact Fees
Development impact fees collected from developers include school fees ($3.20/square
foot) and an Art in Public Places fee (applies to residential of four or more units with a
value of 1 percent of the total valuation) which is one percent of the building valuation
with a maximum fee of $150,000. In addition, a parkland dedication fee is required for
each residential unit built. The current rate is $1,289.61 per newly built single-family
dwelling, and $980.50 for multifamily dwelling units. The parkland fees are adjusted
annually for the CPI-U. Two additional development impact fees include the Record
Management Fee (0.05 percent of building permit valuation) and General Plan
Maintenance Fee (0.2 percent of building permit valuation)
Additionally, residents are charged for refuse collection for single-family residences and
pay a utility users tax on electric, gas, and telephone. No utility tax is charged for
water. All of these fees are charged to provide revenues to enhance services, facilities
and infrastructure serving residents, businesses, employees and visitors in the City.
5.1.4.B – Planning Entitlement Fees
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g    E l e m e n t 81

   Table 5-5 provides a listing of planning entitlement fees the City of Downey charges for
   residential development. These fees are typically collected at the time a development
   entitlement application is filed with the City. In addition, there may be other fees
   assessed depending upon the circumstances of the development. For example, the
   builder may need to pay an inspection fee for sidewalks, curbs, and gutters if
   installation is required or the builder may need a variance, conditional use permit, or
   site plan review for special entitlement issues. The planning entitlement fees listed in
   Table 5-5 show those which are typically charged for a standard residential
   development.

                                                      C i t y         o f    D o w n e y
presents the development fees for a 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom/two-bathroom
single-family unit as well as the development fees for a 1,000-square-foot, two
bedroom/one-bathroom multiple-family unit. For a single family residential unit, the
amount of the development fee is approximately $17,889.71. Furthermore, the
development fee for a multiple-family unit is approximately $12,883.3. The highest fees
for the single family residential unit and multiple-family units are the School Fee ($3.20
per square foot), Plans Archival/Record Management, and the Strong Motion-State
Quake Tax.
The development processing fees and school fees are largely determined by square
footage, valuation and a number of other factors including the number or bedrooms,
bathrooms, outlets, etc. This makes it difficult to accurately determine the average and
actual fees charged to a developer for residential development. In summary, Downey
development fees represent a small portion of overall cost of residential development,
and are comparable to, if not lower than, other Los Angeles jurisdictions. The City has
worked hard to keep fees low and will continue to do so, utilizing allocated funds to
promote development of affordable housing, housing for extremely low income and
disabled residents.

   5.1.5 – Building Codes and Enforcement
   In addition to land use controls, local building codes also affect the cost of housing.
   Downey has adopted the International Building Code (IBC) which establishes minimum
   construction standards. As required of all jurisdictions in California, Downey, has
   adopted the latest (2010) California Green Building Code establishes construction
   standards necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare. The provision of the
   California Building Code is to ensure that barrier-free design is incorporated in all
   buildings, facilities, site work and other developments to which this code applies and to
   ensure that they are accessible to and usable persons with disabilities.
   The following are local amendments to the Building code adopted by Downey to
   protect public health and safety from hazards indigenous by the City:
   •     The City requires copper wire as the preferred material used for wiring. For electrical
         systems utilizing aluminum wiring, plans must be submitted by a registered engineer
         for approval, prior to issuance of an electrical permit. Existing aluminum wiring may
         not be connected to a copper wiring system except in a manner approved by the
         Building Official and shall have a properly sized over current protection device.
   •     The provisions of the California Mechanical Electrical Code, as adopted and
         amended by the Downey Municipal Code, will apply to gas piping from the point of
         delivery, gas appliances and related accessories as covered in this code. These
         requirements apply to gas piping systems extending from the point of delivery to the
         inlet connections of appliances and the installation and operation of residential and
         commercial gas appliances and related accessories.
   •     Any individual who receives a permit to do mechanical work, must be a contractor
         licensed to perform such work covered by the permit; the exception, mechanical
         work associated with R-3 and U occupancies.
   •     The City council will set the amount of fees to be requited for the issuance of permits
         required by the Downey Mechanical Code, and will adjust fees annually based
         upon data provided by the Building and Safety Division of the Community
         Development Department
   •     The City will issue re-inspection fees for failure to provide access when the approved
         plans are not readily available to the inspector on the date for which inspection is
         requested or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official.
84    2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1          H o u s i n g         E l e m e n t

                                       C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
•   Any individual who receives a permit to do plumbing work must be a contractor
    licensed to perform such work covered by the permit; the exception, plumbing work
    associated with R-3 and U occupancies.
•   Every application for a permit to do work related to plumbing must state in writing
    on the application form provided for that purpose, the character of the work
    proposed to be done and the amount and kind in connection.
•   An investigation, in addition to the permit fee, will be collected whether or not a
    plumbing permit issued. The provisions of the California Residential Code, as
    adopted and amended by the Downey Municipal Code, shall apply to the
    construction, alternation, movement, alteration, movement, enlargement,
    replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, removal and
    demolition of detached one and two-family dwellings or townhouses not more than
    three stores above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their
    accessory structure.
•   The provision of the California Energy Code, Title 24, Part 6 shall apply to all matters
    governing the design in and construction of buildings for energy efficiency.
•   The provisions of the California Green Building Standards Code, will apple to the
    planning design, operation, construction, use and occupancy of every newly
    constructed building or structure.
These local amendments do not constrain the development of housing, but rather
ensure that applicants adhere to the proper process to obtain permits and that the
health and safety of residents is considered.
5.1.6 – Local Processing and Permit
Procedures
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is
often cited as a prime contributor to the high cost of housing. Additional time may be
necessary for environmental review, depending on the location and nature of a
project. In response to State law, California cities have been working to improve the
efficiency of permit and review processes by providing 'one-stop processing,' thereby
eliminating duplication of effort. The passage of the Permit Streamlining Act limits City
processing times for entitlements to a 30 day review and 60 days for a hearing. The City
of Downey has fully implemented the provisions of the Permit Streamlining Act, as well
as more recent legislation requiring the establishment of one-stop permit coordination.
Based on periodic surveys conducted by the City, local processing times are
comparable to those experienced in neighboring communities. For example, for single-
                                          2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g    E l e m e n t   85

                            C i t y  o f  D o w n e y
   family residences and two-family residences, no discretionary review process is required
   and the proposed residential building application can proceed directly to plan check
   (assuming the proposed residence meets of all of the zoning requirements). For
   multiple-family projects, the applicant is required to complete the City’s Site Plan
   Review process, which is typically a 6 to 8 week process from the time an application is
   filed and building permits are issued for the project. There is no design review
   requirement for single-family or multifamily residential projects in the City. However, site
   plan review applications for multifamily residential projects are approved only after
   making the following findings:
   •    That the proposed development is in accordance with the purposes and objectives
        of this article and the zone in which the site is located;
   •    That the proposed development’s site plan and its design features, including
        architecture and landscaping, will integrate harmoniously and enhance the
        character and design of the site, the immediate neighborhood, and the surrounding
        areas of the City;
   •    That the site plan and location of the buildings, parking areas, signs, landscaping,
        luminaries, and other site features indicate that proper consideration has been
        given to both the functional aspects of the site development, such as automobile
        and pedestrian circulation, and the visual effects of the development from the view
        of the public streets;
   •    That the proposed development will improve the community appearance by
        preventing extremes of dissimilarity or monotony in new construction or in alterations
        of facilities;
   •    That the site plan and design considerations shall tend to upgrade property in the
        immediate neighborhood and surrounding areas with an accompanying
        betterment of conditions affecting the public health, safety, comfort, and welfare;
        and
   •    That the proposed development’s site plan and its design features will include
        graffiti-resistant features and materials in accordance with the requirements of
        Section 4960 of Chapter 10 of Article IV of the Zoning Code.
   Many minor permits are issued requiring only “over-the-counter” approval such as for
   residential room additions and residential rehabilitation permits (plumbing, electrical,
   roofing). In addition, the City allows the issuance of separate grading and foundation
   permits prior to the issuance of the building permits. Plans are allowed to be submitted
   to plan check prior to the Planning Commission and City Council final approval of the
   project with the submittal of a hold harmless agreement. Discretionary permits (i.e.
   variances, conditional use permits, tentative maps, etc.) typically require 3 to 4 months
   to review and process for a public hearing. This processing time varies with the type of
   environmental review required. The Planning Commission remains the only entity in the
   discretionary review process, except when the processing involves a legislative action,

                                        C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
or unless a Planning Commission decision is appealed. In these cases, approval by the
City Council is required.
To encourage and facilitate the development of a variety of housing types, the City
continues to monitor permit processing times to ensure the fastest possible turnaround
for applications. The City has modified their application packet to simplify and
streamline the application process and works with developers to ensure efficient case
processing. The City has also been computerizing property data to provide more
reliable information to the public in a more cost-effective manner using new permitting
software by Accela. This includes zoning, general plan, land use, property owner
information, prior planning cases, county assessor maps, and digital aerial photographs
for each parcel. The City's comprehensive zoning map and general plan land use map
have also been computerized using enhanced geographic information system
technology.
5.1.7 – On and Off-Site Improvement
Requirements
On and off-site improvement requirements for residential development in the City are
imposed on a case-by-case basis. In general, full street width dedication is required
along with the construction of sidewalks where widening is needed. The typical
residential street in Downey has a 60-foot width, which includes 36 feet from curb-to-
curb and a 12-foot wide parkway/sidewalk on each side of the street. The project
applicant, however, is only obligated to dedicate property for the street widening.
Construction costs associated with the right-of-way improvements (including sidewalk
construction) are borne by the City. On and off site improvements have not been
determined to be a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
5.2 – Non-Governmental
Constraints
5.2.1 – Construction Costs
The cost of building materials for residential construction has risen dramatically in recent
years. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the overall cost of residential
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t   87

                         C i t y   o f  D o w n e y
   construction materials rose by 2 percent between 2011 and 2012, with steel costs
   increasing 0.4 percent and the cost of cement increasing 1.5 percent. With the
   slowdown of the real estate market from 2008 until 2012, the price of construction
   materials has shown a significant decrease compared to the construction boom. The 2
   percent increased in over all construction costs experienced over the past year is
   primarily due to the cost of labor.
   Together, the cost of building material and construction labor are the most significant
   cost components of developing residential units. In the current southern California
   market, construction costs are estimated to account for upwards of 50 percent of the
   sales price of a new home. Typical construction costs for high-density apartment (20
   units per acre) development run around $150,000 per unit including $10,000 per unit for
   structured parking. Hard construction costs for development of median-density (15 units
   per acre) condominiums over podium parking run approximately $200,000 per unit,
   including $35,000 per unit for the parking structure.
   Variations in the quality of materials, type of amenities, labor costs and the quality of
   building materials could result in higher or lower construction costs for a new home.
   Pre-fabricated factory built housing, with variation on the quality of materials and
   amenities may also affect the final construction cost per square foot of a housing
   project. Furthermore, the unit volume - that is the number of units being built at one
   time - can change the cost of a housing project by varying the economies of scale.
   Generally, as the number of units under construction at one time increases, the overall
   costs decrease. With a greater number of units under construction, the builder is often
   able to benefit by making larger orders of construction materials and pay lower costs
   per material unit.
   Density bonuses granted to a project, can also impact construction costs.
   Municipalities often grant density bonuses as an incentive for the builder to provide
   affordable units at the project site. The granting of a density bonus provides the builder
   with the opportunity to create more housing units and therefore more units for sale or
   lease than would otherwise be allowed without the bonus. Since greater units can
   potentially increase the economy of scale, the bonus units could potentially reduce the
   construction costs per unit. This type of cost reduction is of particular benefit when
   density bonuses are used to provide affordable housing.
   5.2.2 – Land Availability and Cost
   There is very little vacant residential land available in the City. This is a significant
   constraint to the development of new housing within the City. Another constraint to the
   development of additional residential units can occur on underdeveloped properties,
   particularly R-3 multiple family zoned properties. The economy of land value and the
88    2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1  H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t

                                        C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
cost of new construction can limit what a property owner can expect to achieve on an
underdeveloped property. Even with an allowable 24 units per acre, as permitted by
the Downey Municipal Code, recycling and redevelopment can be difficult.
Chapter 6, Housing Resources, includes an analysis and discussion of vacant and
underutilized residentially-zone parcels in the City that can accommodate new
housing. For example, vacant single-family zoned parcels were identified and
inventoried to determine the number of single-family dwellings that could be built. Also,
if developed lots in R-1 and R-2 zones in the City met certain size and configuration
criteria, and were located in one of the City’s Second Unit District (SUD) Overlay districts
(See Figure 3), additional unit capacity was counted.
Aside from the three residential zones in the City that accommodate residential
development (R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones), the City has also identified opportunities in
which commercial properties can be “recycled” for residential purposes and has
specifically identified an additional “residential development opportunity area” which
will support the development of housing in a mixed-use configuration, primarily within
the Downtown Downey Specific Plan area. In 2010 the City Council adopted the
Specific Plan, identifying it as an opportunity area for the development of mixed use,
multifamily housing. The Specific Plan establishes five unique land use districts, four of
which all for mixed use development, including residential uses at densities up to 75
dwelling units per acre. According to the survey conducted for the 2008-2014 Element
including potential capacity in R-1 and R-2 zones (including second dwelling unit
overlay areas), R-3 zones, and within the Downtown Downey Specific Plan area, there is
sufficient capacity for new units to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation.
The price of raw land and any necessary improvements is a key component of the total
cost of housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction
combined with a fairly steady demand for such development has served to keep the
cost of land high and rising in southern California. In addition, the two factors which
most influence land holding costs are the interest rate on acquisition and development
loans, and government processing times for plans and permits. The time it takes to hold
land for development increase the overall cost of the project. This cost increase is
primarily due to the accruement of interest on the loan, the preparation of the site for
construction and processing applications for entitlements and permits.
5.2.3 – Availability of Financing
The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including
the type of lending institutions active in the community, lending practices, rates and
fees charged, laws and regulations governing financial institutions, and equal access to
those institutions. Through analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HDMA) data on
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g  E l e m e n t    89

                                C i t y      o f    D o w n e y
   the disposition of residential loan applications, an assessment can be made of the
   availability of residential financing within a community.
   Residential lending activity in Downey consisted of 417 applications for conventional
   home purchase loans in 2012, reflecting 2 percent of the ownership housing stock. This is
   a significant decrease from the 3,202 total applications in 2006. Table 5-7 provides the
   status of home purchase loan applications in both Downey and Los Angeles County. As
   illustrated by this table, the 73 percent loan approval rate in Downey was slightly higher
   than the 71 percent approval rate Countywide.

   Notes:
        (a) Approved loans include: loans originated and applications approved, but not accepted.
   Table 5-7 also indicates the number of total applications for home improvement loans
   in Downey. Home improvement loans generally have lower approval rates than loans
   used to purchase homes. In 2012, for example, 422 households in the City of Downey
   applied for home improvement loans. Approximately 40 percent were approved and
   36 percent denied, indicating a significant gap differential between those who were
   actually able to obtain the financing to complete home improvements and those that
   were not. This may indicate a potential need for the City to consider making available
   additional assistance to the households that could not qualify for a home improvement
   loan, perhaps making available rehabilitation loans with special finance rates.

5.3 – Environmental Constraints
Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic conditions
that provide the greatest threat to the built environment. The City has identified areas
where land development should be carefully controlled. The following hazards may
impact future development of residential units in the City.
5.3.1 – Seismic Hazards
As stated in the General Plan Safety Element, the entire City – as well as most of
Southern California – is located within a seismically active region that has been subject
to major earthquakes in the past. There are no known faults in Downey. However, the
Whittier fault, which is approximately 5 miles from the City of Downey. According to the
Southern California Earthquake Data Center, the maximum probable earthquake that
can be generated by the Whittier Fault is a magnitude 7.2. Other lesser known but
seismically active faults have been identified at the ground surface within Downey. The
greatest damage from earthquakes results from ground shaking. Although ground
shaking is generally most severe near quake epicenter, property not immediately
adjacent to the epicenter may be subject to extreme damage due to liquefaction. The
greatest potential danger is the collapse of older residential units constructed from
unreinforced masonry, and explosions of petroleum and fuel lines. Downey has the
combination of silts and sand soils types and relatively high water table that are
conductive for liquefaction to occur during intense ground shaking. The State Division of
Mines and Geology has designated all areas within the City within a liquefaction zone,
which requires geotechnical reports for construction projects to mitigate the potential
undermining of structural integrity during earthquakes.
5.3.2 – Flooding
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) publishes maps that identify
areas of the City subject to flooding in the event of a major storm. These Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) indicate areas that may be inundated in the event of a
100-year or a 500-year storm. In addition, the maps indicate the base flood elevations
at selected intervals of the floodway. The City had been subject to periodic flooding
and flood insurance requirements imposed by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) until improvements were constructed by the Army Corp of Engineers.
The improvements included installing dams upstream (including Whittier Narrows dam
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g  E l e m e n t 91

                         C i t y  o f  D o w n e y
   approximately 6 miles to the north), providing concrete bottoms for riverbeds, and
   construction levees and flood walls on sides of concrete channels.
   Since the Army Corp of Engineers completed raising the channel levees in 2000, no
   properties within Downey are considered by FEMA to be within a 100-year flood zone (a
   100-year flood is one of such intensity that it has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any
   given year. Flood hazards in Downey are less than significant. Areas that are
   designated for future residential development do not fall within the 100-year floodplain
   and are not subject to specialized flood construction requirements.
   5.3.3 – Fire Hazards
   The most serious fire threat within the City is building and structure fires. Like most
   southern California cities on the urban fringe, the late summer fires that result from the
   accumulation of this brush have the potential to spread into the City proper. Since the
   City center is largely developed, there is less potential for fire in central City
   communities. Other fire hazards within the City may be associated with heavy industrial
   uses, older commercial and residential structures, the presence of hazardous materials,
   and arson.
   5.3.4 – Noise
   Noise generated from mobile sources such as traffic and aircraft will continue to have
   the greatest potential impact on land use. The Noise Element describes the existing
   noise environment using maps that indicate high levels of noise in the planning area.
   The Noise Element also identifies noise sources and contains goals and policies that will
   be useful in reducing the effects of noise, if not the actual intensity of noise. Land use
   policy discourages the placement of noise-sensitive land uses in areas that are subject
   to high noise levels. The amount of noise generated by aircraft traffic is significant since
   Downey lies under the fight path to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

6. Housing Resources
This section summarizes the land, financial, and administrative resources available for
the development and preservation of housing in Downey. The analysis includes an
evaluation of the availability of land resources for future housing development; the
City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs, the financial
resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative resources
available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs and policies.
6.1 – Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA)
With the passage of SB 375, the Housing Element planning period has been extended to
8 years to allow for synchronization with updates to the Regional Transportation Plan
and the Sustainable Communities Strategy. For the 2014-2021 Housing Element update
cycle, HCD allocated a number of housing units for the Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) region who then allocated units to each individual jurisdiction.
SCAG released final draft Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for each
jurisdiction in April 2012. These numbers were finalized in October of 2012 allowing the
City to move forward in the update process to accommodate their allocated housing
need. The RHNA allocation for each jurisdiction is divided into four household income
categories used in Federal and State programs: Very Low (50 percent of AMI); Low (50-
80 percent of AMI); Moderate (80-120 percent of AMI); and Above-Moderate Income
(over 120 percent of AMI). The allocations are further adjusted to avoid an over-
concentration of lower income households in any one jurisdiction.
For the 2014-2021 planning period, Downey has been allocated a RHNA of 814 housing
units, including 210 units for very low-income households, 123 units for low-income
households, 135 units for moderate-income households, and 346 units for above
moderate-income households. It is assumed that the projected need for extremely low
income households is fifty percent of the allocated need for very low income
households, or 105 units. The 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the City
of Downey is shown in Table 6-1.

   6.2 – AB 1233 Compliance
   In January 2006, changes to Housing Element law, including Assembly Bill 1233, have
   created additional incentive for jurisdictions to achieve a compliant Element. AB 1233
   requires “communities that failed to comply with requirements to make available
   sufficient sites to meet their regional housing need in the previous planning period must,
   within the first year of the new planning period, zone or rezone enough sites to
   accommodate the RHNA not accommodated from the previous planning period.”
   The Housing Element for the 2008-2014 planning period was adopted in 2010 and
   certified by HCD, but the City was unable to complete the rezoning necessary to
   provide adequate sites accommodate the City’s lower income RHNA. Specifically per
   Program 5, Land Use Element/Zoning, the Downey Landing Specific Plan was not
   amended to accommodate residential units. Consequently, the City is required to plan
   for the current planning period of 2014-2021 as well as any unaccommodated shortfall
   identified from the previous (2008-2014) planning period. The 2008-2014 RHNA for
   Downey is shown in Table 6-2.

As Downey’s 2008-2014 Housing Element was adopted, but not fully implemented the
City must evaluate two key factors to determine their exact shortfall, in compliance
with AB 1233. First, as the RHNA process establishes January 1, 2006 as the baseline for
growth projections for the Housing Element planning period of 2008-2014, jurisdictions
may count any new units built or approved since January 1, 2006 toward their 2008-
2014 RHNA allocation. As Downey’s Housing Element was adopted and certified, but
not fully implemented, any units built or approved from 2006 to the present may be
credited toward the City’s 2008-2014 RHNA allocation of 1,108 units. Second, as AB 1233
focuses on units that are accommodated specifically on rezoned sites, the shortfall will
primarily include lower income units that were to be accommodated on sites in the
amended Downey Landing Specific Plan. Table 6-4 below, presents the number of units
that the City must address in their 2014-2021 sites inventory, including any shortfall from
the 2008-2014 planning period.

   Notes:
       (a) 2008-2014 Moderate and Above Moderate RHNA allocations were accommodated on land zoned R-1 and R-3.
   As shown in Table 6-4, between 2006 and 2012 the City approved or developed 190
   units, including 9 units with covenants for very low income, 55 units with covenants for
   low income, 1 units with covenants for moderate income, and 125 units for above
   moderate income households. Additionally, within the 2008-2014 Housing Element the
   Housing Resources section demonstrated appropriate sites to accommodate the City’s
   remaining moderate income allocation of 186 units and remaining above moderate
   income allocation of 345 units. The sites identified in the 2008-2014 sites inventory
   included land zoned R-1 (up to 8.7 dwelling units per acre), R-3 (up to 24 dwelling units
   per acre) and parcels located in the City’s Second Unit Overlay (SUD) district.
   Based on the requirements of AB 1233, as shown in Table 6-4, for the 2014-2021 planning
   period the City must make available sites to accommodate a total of 1,201 units,
   including 478 units for very low income, 242 units for low income (a total of 720 lower
   income units), 135 units for moderate income, and 346 units for above moderate
   income.

6.3 – Densities to Accommodate
Lower Income Housing
Density is a critical factor in the development of affordable housing. Maintaining low
densities typically increases the cost of construction per unit, while higher density
development lowers the per-unit land cost and facilitates construction in an economy
of scale. In addition to the potential for density bonus provisions, more intense
residential development is achieved through a number of mechanisms, including
clustering of residential development and zero lot line development, subject to City
development standards. Clustering of housing can produce higher densities on a
portion of land while creating space for amenities, and retaining the overall density
assignment of the entire property. This method is effective when portions of the
property not utilized for residential development can be developed with compatible
uses, such as open space/recreation, parks, schools and public facilities.
Affordability is typically correlated with density. The State Housing and Community
Development Department (HCD) has established “default densities” that by definition
are considered sufficient to provide market-based incentives for the development of
housing for lower-income households. For jurisdictions with a population greater than
25,000 and located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of
more than 2 million, the default density is 30 dwelling units per acre (or higher). Downey
has a population greater than 25,000 and is within the Long Beach-Los Angeles-Ontario
MSA; consequently the default density for the City is 30 dwelling units per acre.
To facilitate and encourage the development of housing units affordable to very low-
and low-income residents, the City has identified zones with permitted densities
appropriate to accommodate the development of a variety of housing types.
6.3.1 – Residentially Zoned Land
There are three residential zoning districts in the Downey Zoning Code that correspond
to land use designations in the General Plan. They include: the R-1 Single Family
Residential zone, including the second unit provision for the Single Family (R-1) zone; the
Two-Family Residential (R-2) zone, and the Medium Density Family (R-3) zone. Each
residential zoning district that has associated development standards that dictate the
maximum residential densities permitted. The densities allowed by the General Plan, in
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1  H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t 97

                           C i t y  o f  D o w n e y
   conjunction with existing zoning regulations, establish the location, intensity and
   appearance of residential development within the City.            Specifically, the Downey
   Vision 2025 General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide for a range of residential land
   use development densities as follows:
       1. Single-Family Residential (R-1) – Allows up to 8.7 dwelling units per acre. Minimum
           lot size permitted is 5,000 square feet. There are varying development standards
           for each of the following zone R-1 designations:
               a. R-1-5000
               b. R-1-6000
               c. R-1-7000
               d. R-1-8500
               e. R-1-10,000
               f.  Lots of 15,000 square feet (regardless of zoning)
       2. Two-Family Residential (R-2) – Allows between 9.0 and 17.0 dwelling units per
           acre. This is equivalent to one unit for each 2,500 square feet to 5,000 square
           feet.
       3. Multi-Family Residential (R-3) – Allows up to 24 dwelling units per acre. This is
           equivalent to 1,980 square feet per unit for lots 15,000 square feet or less, and
           1,815 square feet per unit for lots greater than 15,000 square feet.
   Within the City there are a number of vacant or underutilized residentially zoned parcels
   that are appropriate to accommodate a portion of the City’s remaining RHNA. These
   parcels are shown in Figure 2 and a parcel specific inventory is provided in Appendix A.
   As shown in Figure 2, and in Table A-1 of Appendix A, there are 32 parcels zoned R-1,
   Single Family Residential, that were included in the 2008-2014 Housing Resources site
   inventory and were not developed during the previous planning period. Sites zoned R-1
   can accommodate densities up to 8.7 dwelling units per acre. If developed at their
   maximum allowable density, the 32 identified parcels can accommodate a total of 144
   new units. As these parcels were included in the certified and adopted 2008-2014 sites
   inventory, but not developed during the planning period, they remain viable
   opportunity sites for the 2014-2021 planning period. Based on the densities permitted,
   parcels zoned R-1 that are included in the inventory are appropriate to accommodate
   the City’s above-moderate income RHNA allocation.

      Also shown in Figure 2, and in Table A-2 of Appendix A, there are 22 parcels currently
      zoned R-3, Multi-Family Residential that were included in the 2008-2014 Housing
      Resources site inventory and were not developed during the previous planning period.
      Sites zoned R-3 can accommodate densities up to 24 dwelling units per acre. If
      developed at their maximum allowable density, the 22 identified parcels can
      accommodate a total of 244 new units. As these parcels were included in the certified
      and adopted 2008-2014 sites inventory, but not developed during the planning period,
      they remain viable opportunity sites for the 2014-2021 planning period. Based on the
      densities permitted, parcels zoned R-1 that are included in the inventory are
      appropriate to accommodate the City’s moderate and above-moderate income
      RHNA allocation.

      available to accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA allocation.

      6.3.2 – Second Unit Development
      A second strategy to accommodate the City’s 2014-2021 RHNA allocation is the
      identification of properties that may be developed with a second unit. The City
      acknowledges that second units, also known as “granny flats,” are a practical method
      for a family to maximize the available land on their own lot. By utilizing land and utilities,
      a family minimizes construction costs. Throughout the City there are a number of large
      lots (7,500 square feet and above) that can accommodate additional housing. To
      facilitate affordable rental units, the City allows second unit developments in 24 areas
      designated second unit development, through the Second Unit Overlay.
      The Second Unit Overlay, most recently amended in November 2008, allows second
      units to be administerally approved and permits a reduction in the required lot size
      (from 10,000 sq. ft. to 7,500 sq. ft.). The development of second unit housing provides

                                           C i t y   o f   D o w n e y
 lower-income households an affordable housing opportunity within single-family
 neighborhoods. To ensure greater participation of residents in the program, the City is
 committed to a public outreach program to encourage second-unit development,
 including advertising second-unit development opportunities on the City’s website, in
 local newspapers, in local utility bills, and at various community centers. The City has
 historically seen great success with their second unit development overlay and
 promotes the program on the City website and in other public places. Generally,
 second units include one or two bedrooms and the City has found they are rented at
 below market rents. Based on the price per square foot of the units developed during
 the previous planning period, City Staff has found that 50 percent of second units are
 affordable to lower income households and 50 percent moderate income households.
 Consequently, for the 2014-2021 planning period, the City has utilized this ratio to
 estimate that second units are a key strategy to equally accommodate their low and
 moderate income RHNA allocation.
 Of the 24 identified Second Unit Overlay areas 17 areas can accommodate the
 development of new units. There are approximately 234 parcels that can
 accommodate second units. Following a review of the City’s existing parcel inventory
 within the Second Unit Overlay, it is estimated that approximate 234 low and moderate
 income units can be accommodated within the Overlay area. The areas are shown in
 Figure 3 and a parcel specific inventory is provided in Appendix A. Table 6-6, provides
 a summary of the acreage and units that can be accommodated within the Second
 Unit Overlay areas.

6.3.3 – Downtown Downey Specific Plan
In addition to the residential zones and second unit development areas presented, the
City has also identified the Downtown Downey Specific Plan area as an opportunity
area for the development of housing for all income levels. The Downtown Downey
Specific Plan was initiated by the City to guide growth and residential development in
Downtown, encourage economic revitalization, and create a lively center of activity
for the City. The Specific Plan establishes 131 acres as mixed use and looks to create
unique districts with specific development standards and design guidelines. Downtown
Downey is envisioned as a vibrant urban center providing a wide array of dining,
working, living, shopping, entertainment, and cultural opportunities all within a short
walking distance. The Specific Plan includes specific objectives to focus growth in the
Downtown area, by allowing and promoting higher density residential and mixed use
development and to develop residential uses for all income levels.
The Specific Plan, adopted in 2010, establishes five unique land use districts, four of
which allow for mixed use development, including residential uses. The four districts
permitting residential development do so at the following densities:
    1. Downtown Core – 20 to 40 dwelling units per acre
    2. Downtown Residential – 8 to 40 dwelling units per acre
    3. Firestone Boulevard Gateway – 40 to 75 dwelling units per acre
    4. Paramount Boulevard Professional – 20 to 40 dwelling units per acre
The City has identified the Downtown Downey Specific Plan area as a key growth area
and incorporated the introduction of residential uses, by right, as a key vision for the
Specific Plan. The Specific Plan strategically aims to facilitate the development of
employment opportunities, dining, shopping, neighborhood services, and residential
uses in close proximity to reduce vehicle trips and create a vibrant downtown. In 2012,
the City approved an application for the first new multifamily residential project within
the Specific Plan area. The 50 unit project, The View, is deed restricted for very low (5
units) and low income (45 units) households. It is anticipated based on the allowed
densities and the sites available that the Specific Plan area will offer significant
opportunities to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation.
The Downtown is an ideal location for the development of future affordable housing as
many public service buildings such as the library, City Hall, senior center, police facilities,
medical clinics, and a connection to the Metrolink Green Line station are located
nearby. Throughout the Specific Plan area there is a mix of uses including single-family
housing,     multi-family   housing,   retail,   professional    office,   medical,      and
                                          2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1   H o u s i n g   E l e m e n t     103

                            C i t y  o f  D o w n e y
    underutilized/vacant parcels. Currently, higher density development is concentrated
    along Downey Avenue and Firestone Boulevard; however there is great potential for
    redevelopment throughout the Specific Plan area, with underutilized parcels scattered
    in each district.
    The entire Specific Plan area is approximately 97 acres with roughly 223 parcels. A
    parcel specific inventory with unit capacity is provided in Appendix A. Based on the
    total acreage of the Specific Plan area, the permitted densities for each district, and
    assuming mixed use sites are developed at 50% capacity, the Specific Plan area can
    accommodate 2,567 units. It is unrealistic to assume the entire area will be redeveloped
    as many of the uses on site have already redeveloped and, furthermore, the
    environmental documentation analyzed a maximum build out of 735 units for the area.
    To better facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of housing
    opportunities the City has identified parcels within the Specific Plan area that are ripe
    for redevelopment. A detailed description and aerial image of specific sites are
    provided in the following pages to illustrate the potential of the area to accommodate
    affordable housing. Sites inventoried range in size and typically contain non-
    conforming, underutilized or older dilapidated or vacant structures. The City will offer a
    menu of incentives to further facilitate and encourage the redevelopment of these
    sites, prioritizing fund and opportunities for extremely low- and very low-income housing.
    6.3.4 - Calculating Unit Potential
    The City of Downey has determined that the zoning established by the Downtown
    Downey Specific Plan is the best approach to accommodate a mix of housing, at
    densities appropriate to facilitate lower income housing, while encouraging
    redevelopment. The existing land uses within the Downtown Downey Specific Plan area
    include parcels with low density commercial and office buildings and a handful of
    underutilized parcels housing single family dwelling units. To transform the Downtown
    area, the Specific Plan establishes a land use plan, development standards, and design
    guidelines that will allow for and encourage the introduction of residential uses, at
    significantly higher densities than what currently exists, in an area that did not previously
    allow for residential development.
    The Specific Plan proposes a range of residential densities from 8 dwelling units per acre
    up to 75 dwelling units per acre. The development standards presented in the Specific
    Plan are shown in Table 5-3. The Specific Plan allows multi-family residential uses by right
    and includes incentive to encourage the development of purely residential projects
    and affordable units, including: streamlined processing, density bonuses,
    shared/reduced parking requirements, and fee modifications, when feasible. City Staff
    has play an integral role in encouraging the maximum buildout of residential projects
    within the Downtown.

                                         C i t y    o f  D o w n e y
During the 2008-2014 planning period the City approved several major multifamily
projects with the Specific Plan area including a 46-unit multifamily complex in 2012 and
50-unit development affordable to low and very low income households. These projects
are a reflection of the change occurring in the Specific Plan area and the City’s
commitment to the development of affordable units. The lack of vacant land in the
City has required creative redevelopment and infill projects resulting in high density
residential projects on smaller sites. The City will continue to employ this strategy in order
to address their remaining RHNA. It is likely, due to the size of parcels in the Downtown
that infill projects will be constructed at higher densities near the maximum allowed.
Staff will continue to encourage the development of residential projects through the
menu of incentives listed above. The City has a proven history of approving high density
projects and the development of affordable housing and is committed to achieving a
range of affordable housing opportunities in the Specific Plan area.
To calculate the realistic capacity of the sites identified in the Section 6, Housing
Resources, the City has identified sites within each district and calculated development
at the maximum density permitted.

PARAMOUNT BOULEVARD PROFESSIONAL DISTRICT
SITE 1
General Plan Designation: Mixed Use
Zoning: Downtown Downey Specific Plan
Permitted Density: 40 du/ac
Acreage: 0.58
Existing Land Use: Carwash/Vacant
Potential Unit Capacity: 11
Description: Site 1 is located in the Paramount Boulevard Professional District. The
Paramount Boulevard Professional District is located east of Paramount Boulevard and
generally west of Parrot Avenue between Second and Seventh Streets. The intent of the
District is to create a professional office environment with related service uses (quick
lunch dining, coffee, and juice bars). While the ground floor is reserved for office and
commercial uses for properties fronting Paramount Boulevard, residential uses will be
permitted and encouraged on the second and third floors,
Site 1 totals 0.58 acres and is located on the corner of Second Street and Paramount,
fronting Second Street. The majority of the site, approximately 75 percent, is surface
parking with an existing car wash structure located on the remaining 25 percent. The
City considers the car wash to be a non-conforming use that is not consistent with the
previously permitted zoning, the Downtown Downey Specific Plan permitted land uses,
                                           2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g E l e m e n t 107

considers excessive in a pedestrian oriented environment. Given this, the site is poised
for redevelopment to introduce high intensity uses including residential units that better
conform to the existing surrounding uses and the vision of the Downtown Downey
Specific Plan. The City has also identified this site, based on its proximity to the recently
constructed multi-family senior complex, Heritage Court Apartments. A mixed use

Description: Site 5 is located in the Downtown Core District. The Downtown Core District
is located north of Second Street and south of Fifth Street between La Reina Avenue
and Civic Center Drive. The Downtown Core district is envisioned to be a vibrant,
pedestrian-oriented down-town with a mix of uses. To produce a unique walkable
shopping, dining, working, and living experience, development with commercial uses
on the ground floor and residential above is encouraged.
Site 5 includes 1 parcel approximately 0.41 acres in size. The site is generally located
west of New Street, East of La Reina Avenue, fronting Third Street. On site there is an
existing 4 floor commercial-office building, with retail uses on the ground floor. Many of
the office suites are vacant and the building is in need of rehabilitation and major
repairs. It has been determined that this structure is currently un-safe to occupy and
would require extensive seismic retrofitting before it could be used for another
commercial use. During the previous planning period the City received inquiries from

(located on the corner of New Street and Second Street) and a one-story office
building with a lot of surrounding surface parking (located at the corner of Third Street
and New Street). The property owner of the restaurant property has approached City
Staff to discuss potential redevelopment scenarios. Both properties contain older
structures in need of improvements and rehabilitation. The increase in permitted density
on the site, as permitted by the Specific Plan, creates greater economic incentive for
the property owners to redevelop all or part of their property to include higher density
mixed-use development. Assuming a 50% development capacity and a maximum

Site 7 totals 0.24 acres and is located east of Downey Avenue and south of Third Street.
The site is home to a vacant movie theater, the Avenue Theater, built in the 1950’s that
is now closed leaving the space is vacant. The theater currently occupies a one story
space with the lobby entrance on Downey Avenue and additional access points off of
Third Street. During the planning period the City received a proposal from an affordable
housing developer to construct residential units over the theater space and several
adjacent storefronts. The project proposed approximately 30 units, but was not
implemented due to funding limitations. This site is seen as a key opportunity site within
the downtown, located along Downey Avenue, the “main street” of Downey, and
could serve as a catalyst for new residential redevelopment on underutilized sites in the

    approximately 32 units at densities appropriate to accommodate lower income
    households. It is likely that additional units would be developed based on previous talks
    with housing developers. Through lot consolidation, the City believes this site could be
    redeveloped as a cohesive mixed use project. The City is also in the process of
    evaluating the feasibility of adding a parking garage near City Hall which would allow
    for shared parking opportunities.

SITE 12
General Plan Designation: Mixed Use

Permitted Density: 75 dwelling units per acre
Acreage: 3.00
Existing Land Use: Parking Structure/Vacant Industrial
Estimated Housing Units Potential: 107
Description: Site 12 is located in the Firestone Boulevard Gateway District. The Firestone
Boulevard Gateway District is located north of the Union Pacific railroad right-of-way in
Downey, and south of Second Street, between Paramount Boulevard and Brookshire
Avenue. The City envisions the Firestone Boulevard Gateway district to be a lively area
consisting of high intensity/density development with flexible retail, office, and
residential space.
Site 12 includes the entire block between Myrtle Street and La Reina Avenue fronting
Nance Avenue. This site includes 3 parcels and is approximately 3.0 acres. At the
western end of the block there are two parcels with industrial manufacturing uses.
These uses are non-conforming and the extent of activity on-site is uncertain. These
parcels were formerly home to an onion processing plant, but in recent years are not as
active and are non-conforming with the Specific Plan permitted uses and surrounding
neighborhoods. The eastern end of the site is City-owned and currently home to the
Downey Depot transportation center. The City is in the process of relocating their transit
center closer to City Hall to better serve the downtown area. The City was awarded
funding through the SCAG Compass Blueprint program and is currently under contract
to develop a plan to configure circulation in the Downtown and determine where the
                                            2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1 H o u s i n g E l e m e n t  129

    new transit center should be located. It is realistic that the transit center will be
    relocated within the planning period and that this site will be prime for redevelopment.
    The City envisions this block redeveloped with a mix of higher intensity uses, including
    residential uses up to 75 dwelling units per acre. Assuming a 50% development capacity
    and a maximum permitted density of 75 dwelling units per acre, Site 11 can
    accommodate approximately 107 units at densities appropriate to accommodate
    lower income households.
    To further encourage and facilitate the development of affordable units for low- and
    very low-income families on the Site, the City will offer a menu of development
    incentive opportunities, including: development fee modifications, streamlined
    processing, density bonus incentives, and reductions in development and parking
    standards, as indicated in the Housing Plan. Funding for potential regulatory and
    financial incentives will be prioritized to encourage housing for extremely low- and very
    low-income households.

Description: Site 13 is located in the Firestone Boulevard Gateway District. The Firestone
Boulevard Gateway District is located north of the Union Pacific railroad right-of-way in
Downey, and south of Second Street, between Paramount Boulevard and Brookshire
Avenue. The City envisions the Firestone Boulevard Gateway district to be a lively area
consisting of high intensity/density development with flexible retail, office, and
residential space.
Site 13 includes the majority of parcels on the block between La Reina Avenue and
Downey Avenue fronting Firestone Avenue, with the exception of the two parcels at
the eastern end. This site includes 7 parcels and is approximately 1.54 acres. Existing
uses on this site include single-story retail commercial businesses with parking lots in the
rear off of Nance Street. Many of the tenant spaces are vacant and/or are in need of
significant rehabilitation. This block is ideal for redevelopment with the opening of a
new Porto’s Bakery across the street and the new Downey Surgery Center at the
eastern end of the block. The City envisions this block redeveloped with a mix of higher
intensity uses, including residential uses up to 75 dwelling units per acre. Assuming a 50%
development capacity and a maximum permitted density of 75 dwelling units per acre,

6.4 - Summary of Available Sites
As outlined in the previous section, Table 6-3 and Table 6-4 illustrate the City’s RHNA
allocation for the 2014-2021 planning period as well as unaddressed carry over units
from the 2008-2014 planning period. Table 6-7 provides a summary of the strategies the
City has identified to facilitate the development of new residential units to
accommodate their remaining RHNA allocation.

Notes:
   (a) Densities of 24 units per acre are appropriate to facilitate the development of moderate and above moderate
       income housing; therefore the unit potential has been divided evenly between the two income categories.
   (b) The Second Unit Overlay is intended to provide housing options for lower income households including low and
       moderate income households; therefore the unit potential has been divided evenly between the two income
       categories.
   (c) Parentheses indicate a surplus of units.
As shown in Table 6-7, the City can accommodate the combined remaining RHNA
allocation of 1,201 units. Based on the permitted densities, vacant land zoned R-1 can
accommodate 144 above-moderate income units, and land zoned R-3 can
accommodate 270 units divided evenly between the moderate and above-moderate
income categories. The City’s existing Second Unit Overlay is appropriate to
accommodate the low and moderate income categories. An estimated 234 new units
are possible on areas within the overlay. Finally, the City has identified the Downtown
Downey Specific Plan area with permitted densities at 40 and 75 dwelling units per area
to accommodate its remaining lower income RHNA. The Specific Plan area can
accommodate more than 2,500 units, however specific opportunity sites have been
identified that are likely to be redeveloped during the planning period. The City has
identified a surplus of opportunity sites, beyond its combined RHNA allocation.

    6.4.1 - Environmental Constraints
    Potential environmental constraints to future development of sites identified include the
    seismic and liquefaction hazards, which are addressed in the Non-Governmental
    Constraints section of the Housing Element. Parcels identified in the Sites Inventory were
    compared with all hazards maps included in the City’s Safety Element; none were
    found to be within areas that have development restrictions due to risk of damage from
    disasters (such as floods, wildfires, or seismic events). The sites inventoried have a land
    use designation which was determined based on surrounding land uses and has
    already examined potential environmental constraints. Aside from the constraints
    mentioned above, there are no additional constraints that would impede the
    development of new housing units in the future on the identified sites.
    6.4.2 - Infrastructure Constraints
    The 2014-2021 Housing Element promotes the production of housing which in turn may
    result in population growth. The Downey Vision 2025 General Plan, documents a
    residential “build out” of 36,915 units and a maximum population of 121,063 residents.
    For the current planning period the City of Downey has a combined RHNA allocation of
    1,201 units. Based on the amount of residentially zoned vacant and underutilized land,
    and non-residentially zoned land that have been identified as “residential development
    opportunity areas,” it was determined that a total of approximately 1,383 units can
    feasibly accommodated during the 2014-2021 planning period Element on the parcels
    identified in the sites inventory. If the City’s total RHNA allocation of 1,201 units is
    developed and added to the existing housing stock of 35,601 units the total count is
    36,802 units. This total is less than the total housing unit build out analyzed in the Downey
    Vision 2025 General Plan and related environmental documents, indicating that there is
    currently infrastructure capacity available to accommodate development consistent
    with the City’s RHNA allocation.
    To ensure that infrastructure needs of specific projects are addressed, the City requires
    that project applications for new development be reviewed for adequate
    infrastructure. Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is the
    capacity to service new developments. Infrastructure requirements and costs are also
    discussed in the Non-Governmental Constraints Section of the Housing Element.

6.5 – Financial Resources
A variety of potential funding sources are available to finance housing activities in
Downey. Due to both the high cost of developing and preserving housing, and
limitations on both the amount and uses of funds, layering of funding sources may be
required for affordable housing programs and projects. Table 6-8 lists the potential
funding sources that are available for housing activities. They are divided into five
categories: federal, State, county, local, and private resources.
In previous years, the primary source of funds for affordable housing activities in
Downey was the Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside fund. The 2010-2014
Implementation Plan allocated RDA funding for housing programs during that period,
as indicated below:
        •  Housing Improvement Program
        •  Affordable Housing Program
        •  Underutilized Sites Program
        •  First Time Homebuyer Program
        •  Prioritize Housing Program Activities
On Dec. 29, 2011, the California Supreme Court ruled to uphold ABx1 26, which
dissolved all redevelopment agencies (RDAs) in the State. A companion bill, ABx1 27,
which would have allowed the RDAs to continue to exist, was also declared invalid by
the court. The court’s decision required that all RDAs within California be eliminated no
later than February 1, 2012. The City of Downey Redevelopment Agency was dissolved
as of February 1, 2012 and the City was selected to be the Successor Agency
responsible for all enforceable obligations owed.
Downey previously relied on estimated redevelopment housing set-aside revenues
ranging from $1.26 to $1.5 million annually to support the development of affordable
housing and the implementation of programs outlined in the Housing Plan. For the
2014-2021 planning cycle, the City is investigating new funding sources to utilize to
continue administering its existing programs.

    6.5.1 - Potential Future Funding Sources
    In addition to the funding sources listed in Table 6-8, affordable housing advocates are
    working with large foundations in hopes of creating a low-interest loan fund from
    endowments. Housing groups are also continuing attempts to broaden infrastructure
    financing authority. An infrastructure financing district (IFD) may be formed pursuant to
    California Government Code Section 53395 et seq. (the “IFD Law”). These districts have
    rights to the tax increment for financing public infrastructure. This authority exists at both
    the state and local level, but under current law requires a vote. Another hurdle is that
    current IFD law prohibits IFDs within any portion of a redevelopment project area that is
    or has been previously created; coupled with the fact that the legislative intent of the
    IFD law is that IFD areas are substantially undeveloped. However, many advocates
    remain hopeful that IFDs may provide an opportunity to fill the redevelopment gap.
    Current drafts of new legislation would allow cities to create infrastructure districts
    without voter approval and make IFDs more user-friendly. There is also proposed
    legislation that, in addition to allowing for IFD formation by resolution, would require set-
    asides for affordable housing where an IFD is formed in a transit village development
    district. Certain legislation also seeks to broaden the share of property tax increment
    that IFDs in specified locations may collect, and seeks to address the current
    deficiencies in the IFD Law.

    6.6 – Energy Conservation
    Opportunities
    As cities construct more housing to meet growing population demands, the
    consumption rate of energy becomes a significant issue. The primary uses of energy in
    urban areas are for transportation, lighting, water, heating and space heating and
    cooling. The high cost of energy demands that efforts be taken to reduce or minimize
    the overall level of urban consumption.
    There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing residential units.
    Construction of energy efficient buildings does not lower the price of housing.
    However, housing with energy conservation features should result in reduced monthly
    occupancy costs as consumption of fuel and energy is decreased. Similarly, retrofitting
    existing structures with energy conserving features can result in a reduction in utility
    costs. Examples of energy conservation opportunities include weatherization programs
    and home energy audits; installation of insulation; installation or retrofitting of more
    efficient appliances, and mechanical or solar energy systems; and building design and
    orientation which incorporates energy conservation considerations. The City enforces
    all provisions of Title 24 of the California Administrative Code, which provides for energy
    conservation features in new residential construction.
    Southern California Edison programs: Southern California Edison offers a variety of
    energy conservation services under the Low Income Energy Efficiency programs (LIEE),
    which help qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and control electricity
    costs. Eligible customers can receive services from local community agencies and
    licensed contractors working with Edison. Services include weatherization, efficient
    lighting and cooling, refrigerator replacement, and energy education. In addition,
    Edison participates in the California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) program, which
    provides a 15% discount reduction on electric bills for low-income customers and the
    Family Electric Rate Assistance Program (FERA) that provides discounts for families with
    household incomes slightly exceeding the low-income energy program allowances.
    Southern California Gas programs: The Southern California Gas Company offers two
    direct assistance programs to limited income customers: (1) a no-cost weatherization
    (attic insulation and water heater blankets) and (2) a no-cost furnace repair and
    replacement service. The Gas Company also participates in the State LIEE and CARE
    programs, helping low-income customers conserve energy and providing them with a
    discount on their gas bills.

6.6.1 - Techniques to Conserve
Many modern design methods used to reduce residential energy consumption are
based on proven techniques that have been known to humans since the earliest days
of collective settlement. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
    1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and out in the
       summer. Designs aim to reduce air conditioning and heating demands. Proven
       building techniques in this category include:
           •   Orienting windows and openings of a building to follow the path of the
               sun, in order to minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain
               in the winter;
           •   Utilizing “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete,
               and tiles that absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
           •   “Burying” sections of the structure in a hillside or berm to insulate the home
               against extremes of temperature;
           •   Application of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to
               reduce heat exchange between the interior and the exterior of the home;
           •   Strategic placement of openings and the use of ventilating devices that
               take advantage of natural air flow (particularly cool evening breezes);
               and
           •   Designing eaves and overhangs above windows to block direct summer
               solar gain during the summer, but allow for solar gain during the winter.
    2. Building orientation that allows natural elements to maintain a comfortable
       interior temperature. Examples include:
           • Orienting the long axis of a building in a north-south position;
           •   Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
           •   Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the
               building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions;
           •   Positioning dwelling units to take advantage of natural air circulation and
               evening breezes.
    3. Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques
       include:
           • Planting of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
                                            2 0 1 4 - 2 0 2 1   H o u s i n g    E l e m e n t 147

                            C i t y  o f   D o w n e y
                 •   Design including natural or artificial flowing water; and
                 •   Strategic placement of trees and hedges to control air flow.
    In addition to natural techniques that have been used historically, a number of modern
    energy conversion methods have been developed and advanced in more recent
    years. These include:
                 •   Implementation of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
                 •   Application of solar energy to heat water;
                 •   Employment of window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter
                     warmth;
                 •   Use of weather-stripping and other insulating devices to reduce heat gain
                     and loss; and
                 •   Acquire energy efficient home appliances.
    6.6.2 – State Building Code Standards
    The California Energy Commission was created in 1974 by the Warren-Alquist State
    Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act. Upon its creation the first task of
    the Commission was to adopt energy conservation standards for new construction. The
    first set of residential energy conservation standards were developed in the late 1970s
    (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations) and have been periodically
    revised in the years following. Downey currently utilizes Tier 1 of the California Green
    Building Code and has not adopted any local amendments to the building standards.
    A focus of the Commission’s energy conservation standards is the definition of “climate
    zones”. These zones were created to allow for flexible approaches to energy
    conservation that can be tailored to different geographic regions of the State. The City
    of Downey is located in Climate Zone 10, which covers the semi-arid inland valleys. This
    climate zone is characterized by a mild winters, hot summers, desert winds, and
    abundant sunshine.
    Because of these climate conditions, a substantial percentage of residential energy use
    goes to space cooling between the months of May and October. Residential site
    design and construction techniques that can reduce the amount of energy used for
    space cooling would significantly reduce overall energy demand. As discussed above,
    a number of traditional and modern techniques can decrease energy throughout the
    City.

7. Progress Report
Section 65581 of the Government Code underscores the need for the periodic review
of the Housing Element. This process of review and evaluation permits local officials to
evaluate trends in the community and to initiate new programs that will further housing
goals. The City established five objectives to be achieved in the previous planning
period. For each objective, housing programs were established to assist the City in
realizing their objectives. Table 7-1 provides a brief description of the housing programs
outlined in the previous Element, the program’s objective and the progress/status of the
program. In providing the status of the program the table will indicate whether the
program will be carried into the next planning period.

                                            program has successfully brought cited residential
                                            units into compliance with City codes.
                                            Appropriateness: As the housing stock continues to
                                            age, proactive code enforcement will be both
                                            appropriate and necessary to maintain the City’s
                                            residential standards. This program provides referrals
                                            to the Housing Rebate and Grant Program. This
                                            program will be included in the 2014-2021 Housing
                                            Element.
    2. Housing Improvement Program          Effectiveness: From 2006 to 2012, the City provided
                                            loan assistance and grants for housing rehabilitation
    Objective: Provide loans for 30         to 443 projects applicants. This total includes loans
    homeowners annually.                    and grants issued as part of the City–sponsored
                                            property improvement program for low to
                                            moderate-income households (loans up to $40,000
                                            and grants up to $2,000), and the Home
                                            Modification Program, implemented by the City to
                                            assist households with disabled persons with
                                            performing architectural modifications to achieve
                                            ADA compliance. Improvements will be provided for
                                            up to 180 homeowners until December 2014.
                                            Appropriateness: With the dissolution of the City’s
                                            Redevelopment Agency and the taking of RDA
                                            funds, the City has limited funding available to fund
                                            the program. This program will continue into the
                                            upcoming planning period as the Housing Rebate
                                            Program, which will be combined with the Grant
                                            Program. This combined program will offer a grant
                                            to residents until a more permanent funding source
                                            is identified.

                                 program will be merged with the Grant Program.
                                 This combined program will offer smaller grants to

                                                  2010, the City adopted the Downtown Downey

                                                  Appropriateness: The City did not implement the
                                                  program as originally planned; however, alternative

                                                 ensure that fees are not excessive and poorly
                                                 administered. Downey also streamlines the
                                                 permitting process for residential projects, to
                                                 minimize the holding and labor costs assumed by
                                                 the project applicant.
                                                 Appropriateness: The City recognizes the
                                                 importance of minimizing the impact of planning,

                                                 fees on an annual basis. This program will be
                                                 included in the 2014-2021 Housing Element.

21. Provide Accommodations for          Effectiveness: Due to staffing reductions and budget
Persons with Disabilities               cuts, the City was unable to effectively implement a

                                        Appropriateness: The City will effectively implement
                                        this program within the planning period. Due to
                                        staffing restrictions, the timeframe was pushed back
                                        from the goal date; however, the program will be in
                                        place and advertised by the end of the planning
                                        period. The City will modify this program for the
                                        2014-2021 Housing Element to promote the adopted
                                        reasonable accommodation procedures on the
                                        City website and at City Hall.
22. Water & Sewer Service Priority for  Effectiveness: Following the certification and
Affordable Housing                      adoption of the 2008-2014 Housing Element the City

providers for their review and input.   Appropriateness: As required by State law, the City
                                        will submit the final 2014-2021 Housing Element to
                                        local water and sewer providers for their review and

    23. Affordable Housing Improvements        Effectiveness: Due to Staff and funding limitations
                                               this program was not implemented. During the

                                               affordable housing and has determined that limited
                                               resources and time should be dedicated to
                                               processing Municipal Code amendments that
                                               address true constraints to the development of
                                               affordable housing. This program will not be

                                               information at identified public locations, via regular
                                               press releases, and through public service ads in a
                                               variety of newspapers and on radio stations. During
                                               the planning period the Foundation also held
                                               educational workshops tailored to tenants, and
                                               educational and training sessions tailored to
                                               landlords, rental property owners, realtors, and
                                               property managers.
                                               Appropriateness: The City recognizes this program
                                               as an effective and efficient way for affected
                                               residents to obtain correct information regarding
                                               landlord/tenant regulations. This program will be

to address recommended changes by     related to manufactured homes and mobile homes
ending 2010.                          in residential zones in the City. The new Code
                                      provisions continue to require mobile home parks to
                                      obtain the approval of a conditional use permit;
                                      however manufactured housing proposed on single-
                                      family lots in existing residential neighborhoods will
                                      be subject to the same development standards as
                                      for existing residences. Like other residences, the
                                      manufactured housing will be subject to the City’s
                                      Site Plan Review process to ensure architectural
                                      consistency.

                                      required Zoning Code amendments to address
                                      mobile home and manufactured housing in
                                      residential zones, this program will not be included in
                                      the 2014-2021 Housing Element. The City may,
