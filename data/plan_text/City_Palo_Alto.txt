INTRODUCTION
                                                                                      1
  VISION: Each of us has a vision of what Palo Alto should be like in the future.
  Although our visions are different, they share common qualities. We aspire to
  create a safe, beautiful City for ourselves, our children and future generations.
  We envision a City with diverse housing opportunities and a sustainable
  transportation network, where the natural environment is protected, where
  excellent services are provided and where citizens have a say in government.
  We aspire to create a City that is economically healthy and a good place to
  do business.
  The Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan strives to build a coherent vision of the City’s
  future from the input of a diverse population. It integrates the aspirations of the
  City’s residents, businesses, neighborhoods and officials into a bold strategy for
  managing change.
  The Comprehensive Plan is the primary tool for guiding the future development
  of the City. On a daily basis the City is faced with tough choices about growth,
  housing, transportation, neighborhood improvement and service delivery. A
  Comprehensive Plan provides a guide for making these choices by describing
  long-term goals for the City’s future as well as policies to guide day-to-day
  decisions.
I
PURPOSE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
The Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan contains the City’s official policies on land use
and community design, transportation, housing, natural environment, safety,
business and economics and community services. Its policies apply to both public
and private properties. Its focus is on the physical form of the city.
The Plan is used by the City Council and the Planning and Transportation
Commission to evaluate land use changes and to make funding and budget
decisions. It is used by City staff to regulate building and development and to make
recommendations on projects. It is used by citizens and neighborhood groups to
understand the City’s long-range plans and proposals for different geographic areas.
The Plan provides the basis for the City’s development regulations and the
foundation for its capital improvements program.

                                                      The Comprehensive Plan is a legal document and must meet specific State
                                                      requirements for content. State law establishes the topics that must be addressed
                                                      and the maps and diagrams the Plan must contain. The Plan must be
                                                      comprehensive, long-range and internally consistent. Its policies apply to all property
                                                      within Palo Alto’s “sphere of influence,” a boundary that includes all land within the
                                                      City limit, the Stanford University campus and other property in unincorporated
                                                      Santa Clara County. Although the County is not obligated to comply with the Plan in
                                                      the unincorporated area, mutual cooperation provides benefits to the City, County
                                                      and University. The 1985 Land Use Policy Agreement between the City, the County
                                                      and University outlines this cooperation.
                                                      MAJOR THEMES OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
                                                      The Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan has eight major themes, summarized here.
                                                      B UILDING C OMMUNITY AND N EIGHBORHOODS
                                                      Palo Alto’s diverse, livable neighborhoods are the building blocks of the community.
                                                      Public facilities, schools, libraries, parks, arts and community centers and small
                                                      businesses, and cultural, environmental, social service and neighborhood
                                                      associations are essential components of neighborhood life and help build the
                                                      bridge between neighborhoods and the wider community. The City is committed to
                                                      building upon the strengths of its neighborhoods, keeping them safe and attractive,
                                                      maintaining a distinct identity for each and delivering top-quality community services
                                                      that meet the needs of and benefit all residents.
                                                      M AINTAINING AND E NHANCING C OMMUNITY C HARACTER
                                                      The community treasures the special qualities of the city, including its historic
                                                      buildings, pedestrian scale, high-quality architecture, thriving urban forest and
                                                      beautiful streets and parks. Maintaining the physical qualities of the city is an
                                                      overarching consideration, incorporated in all parts of the Plan. The Land Use and
                                                      Community Design Element includes specific provisions to maintain Palo Alto’s best
                                                      features and enhance and improve those areas where these features are lacking.
                                                      Future land use decisions will encourage sustainable development, preserve
                                                      neighborhoods and focus infill within the Urban Service Area.

R EDUCING R ELIANCE ON THE A UTOMOBILE
The Plan provides new policies and specific actions for reducing traffic congestion
and auto emissions by facilitating an increase in pedestrian, bicycle and transit use
and encouraging evolving technologies like electric vehicles. In the future, a greater
emphasis will be placed on improving the City’s multi-modal transit connections.
Expanded Caltrain service, bus service, shuttles and pedestrian and bicycle facilities
are envisioned. In coordination with other transportation demand management
initiatives, the Plan provides parking-related policies and parking management
strategies that optimize use of existing spaces. Caltrain grade separations will be
prioritized to improve east-west connections for automobiles, transit, pedestrians and
bicyclists, and to reduce traffic congestion, improve safety and reduce noise impacts.
The City will strive to create a development pattern where people can walk, bicycle
or take public transit rather than drive and will work collaboratively to find regional
solutions that reduce single-occupant vehicle trips.
M EETING H OUSING S UPPLY C HALLENGES
Palo Alto is perceived as a built-out city and has a substantially higher number of
jobs than residents. This imbalance has contributed to skyrocketing housing costs,
affecting long-time and new residents and creating concern about Palo Alto’s future
diversity. Providing a mix of housing types is a community priority and this Plan
seeks to increase the supply of housing that is affordable. The Plan also safeguards
existing single family neighborhoods, encourages smaller units such as studios and
cottages, sets the stage for redevelopment where higher densities are allowed in
appropriate locations and includes new policies to ensure that the remaining
housing sites are used efficiently. The Housing Element is updated more frequently
than the rest of this Plan and must respond to very specific State requirements.
P ROTECTING AND S USTAINING THE N ATURAL E NVIRONMENT
With most of the baylands and foothills already protected as permanent open space,
the Comprehensive Plan’s focus turns inward to the fragile ecosystems within
developed portions of the City. The natural infrastructure, which includes a network
of trees, open spaces, parks and other green spaces, and the connections between
them, will provide access to nature. The City’s urban forest, which benefits humans,
plants, animals, and microorganisms, will be promoted throughout the city. The Plan
fosters energy and water conservation, healthy soils, and a sustainable water supply.
During the life of this Plan, climate change is expected to affect Palo Alto’s physical
infrastructure and natural ecology. To minimize these impacts, and to protect the

                                                      natural environment, Palo Alto will maintain a holistic approach to managing its
                                                      creek corridors, habitat areas and green infrastructure, which have been a source of
                                                      civic pride. Implementation of the climate change adaptation strategies identified in
                                                      the Plan will ensure that Palo Alto meets today’s needs without compromising the
                                                      needs of future generations.

                                                      Like every community, Palo Alto is subject to the unpredictability of future natural
                                                      and human-caused hazards. Particularly in the face of climate change, the Plan
                                                      implements a range of adaptive improvements that will ensure the City’s natural and
                                                      built infrastructure are resilient. The Plan also reinforces the City’s commitment to
                                                      preparing for emergencies, raising awareness of risks and minimizing the impacts of
                                                      these hazards to Palo Alto residents and visitors alike. The framework in the Plan
                                                      complements the City’s existing disaster preparedness strategies and balances a
                                                      complex series of safety-related factors through the adoption of best practices and
                                                      technological innovations, as well as through coordination with relevant
                                                      organizations. The City believes that safety begins internally, and the Plan affirms
                                                      education, awareness and action at the neighborhood level.

                                                      Palo Alto is well known as a desirable residential community and as a City with a
                                                      dynamic, vital business community. Meeting the needs of all facets of the
                                                      community is a major theme of the Plan. The Plan establishes the physical
                                                      boundaries of residential and commercial areas and ensures that business and
                                                      housing remain compatible and interdependent. It encourages a thriving business
                                                      community that provides services to local residents and revenue to the City while
                                                      also working to protect neighborhoods and the environment. The City is committed
                                                      to retaining existing businesses, maintaining vibrant commercial areas, and attracting
                                                      innovative small and independent businesses.

                                                      The Plan emphasizes the City’s commitment to strong community participation. It
                                                      encourages collaboration among citizens, businesses, neighborhood associations,

USE AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PLAN
Palo Alto’s Comprehensive Plan is to be used by all members of the community, as
well as any other person or organization interested in the future of the city. The
hundreds of citizens and officials who have participated in the preparation of the
Plan hope you will find it useful, clear and easy to understand.
A key concept in each Element of the Plan is the idea of a Vision for Palo Alto—a
shared dream of Palo Alto in the future. The long-term aspirational thinking
embodied in each vision statement was the foundation of the development of the
Plan.
State law requires that local plans contain seven mandatory sections, or “elements.”
The State provides considerable flexibility in how these elements are organized.
Table 1 shows the State-mandated elements and their counterparts in the Palo Alto
Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan addresses all the topics required by
State law but, as permitted by the law, has tailored the organization of the topics to
the Palo Alto context.

                                                      Palo Alto’s Plan utilizes the flexibility allowed by state law to include local goals and
                                                      issues in a number of ways. The scope of the Land Use Element has been
                                                      broadened to address community design. The Natural Environment Element
                                                      incorporates open space, conservation, energy, climate change and noise. The Safety
                                                      Element encompasses both natural and human-caused threats to public safety. The
                                                      Plan also includes a Business and Economics Element and a Community Services
                                                      and Facilities Element. Although these two elements address topics that are not
                                                      required by State law, the issues they address are fundamental to the future quality
                                                      of life in Palo Alto. Once adopted, the optional elements have the same legal status
                                                      as the mandatory elements. No single element or subject supersedes any other.
                                                      The Elements of the Plan share a common format and use similar terms and
                                                      references. Each Element contains background information on specific subjects to
                                                      make the Comprehensive Plan more useful as a reference document and to provide
                                                      the technical basis for its policies and programs. Each Element contains maps that
                                                      provide current information about the City, or graphic illustrations of the City’s
                                                      policies for specific geographic and topical areas, as well as sidebars to highlight
                                                      major themes and concepts.
                                                      Each Element includes goals, policies and programs that are the essence of the Plan
                                                      and provide a framework to guide decisions on a wide range of issues. The meaning
                                                      of goals, policies and programs is described below.
                                                             A Goal is a general end towards which the City will direct effort.
                                                             A Policy is a specific statement of principle or of guiding actions that implies
                                                              clear commitment. A general direction that a governmental agency sets to
                                                              follow, in order to meet its goals and objectives before undertaking an action
                                                              program.
                                                             A Program is an action, activity, or strategy carried out in response to an
                                                              adopted policy to achieve a specific goal or objective. Programs require
                                                              resources—primarily time and money—to complete. This is a long-range plan
                                                              and the City intends to implement these programs over time. The Planning
                                                              and Transportation Commission and City Council will conduct regular reviews
                                                              of the Implementation chapter to prioritize programs for implementation.

OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN
The Land Use Designations Map is probably the most familiar part of the Plan and
identifies land use designations for each property in the city. The type of
development allowed within each designation shown on the Map is described in the
Land Use and Community Design Element.
The Plan includes a Governance Chapter intended to provide guidance to citizens
and community groups participating in City decision-making. The Governance
Chapter is a vehicle for implementation rather than a Plan element and is, therefore,
not subject to the State requirements for consistency and comprehensiveness. It is
background information, not policy direction.
The Plan also includes an Implementation Chapter that identifies specific actions to
be taken to carry out the Plan. For each action, the priority, anticipated level of effort,
and responsible agency or department is identified. Like Governance, the
Implementation Chapter is not a Plan Element, but is intended as a description of
the steps to be taken in order to achieve the Plan’s goals.
In the Appendix is the Housing Element Technical Document, which contains
detailed information on the City’s housing programs; as well as one or more concept
plans which contain policies specific to key areas of the City.
A Glossary and Index are provided for reference.
Although not a component of this Plan, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has
been prepared for this Plan and is contained in a separate document. The EIR
evaluates the effects of the Plan’s policies and programs on Palo Alto’s environment.
It identifies where more detailed environmental analysis may be required as specific
projects are proposed in the future.
HOW THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED
The Comprehensive Plan (Our Palo Alto 2030) is the product of a multi-year effort
that involved hundreds of Palo Alto residents and other interested parties. As a city
that experiences acute development pressures associated with its location in the
heart of Silicon Valley, issues such as traffic congestion, housing affordability and
environmental protection are important to its residents, and contribute to strong
interest in the Comprehensive Plan Update process.

                                                      Palo Alto recognized the need to update the Plan in 2006 and began the process in
                                                      earnest in 2008, when a consultant was retained to work with staff and the City’s
                                                      Planning and Transportation Commission (PTC). The 2015-2023 Housing Element
                                                      was created and adopted through a separate process to meet State legal deadlines.
                                                      The first phase of the process focused on Concept Area Plans for two parts of Palo
                                                      Alto most likely to change over the next 10 to 15 years: the California Avenue area,
                                                      including the Fry’s Electronics site; and the East Meadow Circle/Fabian Way area. City
                                                      staff reached out to key stakeholders, interest groups, residents, neighborhood
                                                      organizations, business representatives, home owners’ associations, school district
                                                      representatives and other interested parties who desired to be involved in the
                                                      update process. The draft Concept Area Plans are intended to preserve space for
                                                      small businesses, preserve of retail and community services to support new
                                                      residential growth and incorporate sustainability concepts.
                                                      The PTC’s review of the Comprehensive Plan continued from 2010 to 2013 and was
                                                      provided to the City Council in early 2014. The PTC focused on organizational

                                                      After considering the PTC’s work product, in early 2014, the City Council adopted a
                                                      schedule and strategy for “reframing” the long-running update to include expanded
                                                      community engagement and a full evaluation of alternatives, cumulative impacts and
                                                      mitigation strategies. A Leadership Group of local citizens formed in 2014 to advise
                                                      City staff on community engagement portion of the planning process. The Group
                                                      met monthly between late 2014 and mid-2015 and was a key resource in planning
                                                      engagement activities.

                                                      members that included presentations, informational booths and small group

Following the Summit, the Council appointed the Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) made up of 22 community members, plus 3 non-voting members
representing Stanford University, the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) and
the PTC. On a monthly basis over almost two years, from July 2015 to May 2017, the
full CAC held 23 public meetings, and CAC subcommittees held 29 public meetings,
to advise the Council on incorporating PTC input and other changes to the existing
Comprehensive Plan policies and programs. At these meetings, the CAC considered
public comment and discussed critical issues to arrive at their recommendations
regarding the policies and programs for each of the Plan’s seven Elements or to
propose policy options for Council consideration.
Over the course of 2016 and 2017, the Council reviewed and provided direction on
the draft Elements forwarded by the CAC. The PTC reviewed a complete draft Plan in
summer and fall 2017, and the Council considered and incorporated PTC input at
final adoption hearings in late 2017. The Comp Plan was adopted on [date.]
IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
Long-range planning in Palo Alto does not end with the adoption of this document.
It is important to continue the steps necessary to bring forth the vision of the Plan. As
such, decisions about development projects, capital improvements, subdivision
maps, specific plans, area plans and other plans and policies affecting land use,
transportation and the physical environment will be reviewed to evaluate consistency
with the Plan, thus advancing its vision and policy framework. The Plan is intended to
be a living document, to grow and evolve as local conditions change. In fact, the Palo
Alto Municipal Code requires the PTC to review the Comprehensive Plan annually
and recommend to the City Council any modifications that it considers necessary.
Additionally, the City Council may change the prioritization of programs through the
regular five-year review cycle of the Implementation Plan.
It may, at times, be necessary to amend the Plan. While some amendments change
the land use designation of a particular property, any part of the Plan may be
amended as circumstances change. Amendments may be initiated by property
owners, the PTC, the City Council or City staff. All amendments require public
hearings by the PTC and City Council and evaluation of the potential impacts to Palo
Altos’ physical environment, in accordance with the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA).

                                                      Palo Alto reach towards the vision sought by all the dedicated people who
                                                      contributed to the development of the Plan.

    VISION: Palo Alto’s land use decisions shall balance our future growth needs
    with the preservation of our neighborhoods, address climate protection priorities
    through sustainable development near neighborhood services and enhance
    the quality of life of all neighborhoods.

  INTRODUCTION
  The Land Use and Community Design Element sets the foundation for future
  preservation, growth and change in Palo Alto and serves as the blueprint for the
  development of public and private property in the city. It includes policies and
  programs intended to balance natural resources with future community needs in a
  way that makes optimal use of available land, to create attractive buildings and
  public spaces that reinforce Palo Alto’s sense of place and community, to preserve
  and enhance quality of life and services in Palo Alto neighborhoods and districts and
  to maintain Palo Alto's role in the success of the surrounding region.
  This Element meets the State-mandated requirements for a Land Use Element. It
  defines categories for the location and type of public and privates uses of land under
  the City's jurisdiction; it recommends standards for population density and building
  intensity on land covered by the Comprehensive Plan; and it includes a Land Use
  Map (Map L-6) and Goals, Policies and Programs to guide land use distribution in
  the city. By satisfying these requirements, the Land Use and Community Design
  Element lays out the basic guidelines and standards upon which all of the other
  Comprehensive Plan elements rely and build. Other elements of the Plan
  correspond with the land use categories and policy direction contained in this
  Element, while providing more specialized guidance focused on particular topics,
  such as transportation or conservation.

                                                        The Land Use and Community Design Element is replete with direct connections to
                                                        all of the other elements of the Comprehensive Plan. Its guidance for land uses is
                                                        strongly linked to the Housing Element’s prescriptions for residential development,
                                                        even though the Housing Element is cyclically updated on a separate State-
                                                        mandated timetable. The inextricable tie between land use and transportation is
                                                        clearly apparent both in this Element and the Transportation Element, as the co-

                                                        replace vehicle travel, in addition to capitalizing on the presence of rail service in
                                                        Palo Alto. The success of programs in the Natural and Urban Environment and Safety
                                                        Element is largely dependent on land uses decisions that protect the environment as
                                                        well as people and property. The Land Use Element dovetails with both the quality
                                                        of life initiatives in the Community Services and Facilities Element, and the prosperity
                                                        objectives of the Business and Economics Element.

                                                        natural beauty. Views of the foothills contribute a sense of enclosure and a reminder
                                                        of the close proximity of open space and nature. Views of the baylands provide a

                                                        Preserving the city’s attractive and valuable natural features is important for a

                                                        Palo Alto cooperates with numerous regional partners on a range of issues of
                                                        common interest. Regional planning partners include the California Department of
                                                        Transportation (Caltrans) and other State agencies, Metropolitan Transportation

                                                        Mateo County and neighboring cities. The City of Palo Alto works together with the
                                                       cities of East Palo Alto and Menlo Park on a variety of shared programs relating to
                                                       economic development, social services, education, public safety and housing.
                                                       Palo Alto also works with Mountain View, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills on joint
                                                       ventures such as fire protection and water quality control. In addition, Palo Alto
                                                       elected officials and staff participate in numerous countywide and regional planning
                                                       efforts, including via both advisory and decision-making boards and commissions.
                                                       Palo Alto also maintains a strong relationship with Stanford University. Although the
                                                       campus lies outside of the city limits, as shown in Map L-2, important Stanford-
                                                       owned lands are within Palo Alto, including Stanford Shopping Center, Stanford
                                                       Research Park and the Stanford University Medical Center. The City, Santa Clara
                                                       County and Stanford maintain an inter-jurisdictional agreement regarding
                                                       development on unincorporated Stanford lands and collaborate on selected land use
                                                       and transportation projects.

                                                        There is evidence in the archaeological record of people living along San
                                                        Francisquito Creek as far back as 4000 BC, and the first widely recognized inhabitants
                                                        are the Costanoan people starting in about 1500 BC. The Costanoan are Ohlone-
                                                        speaking Native Americans who lived near the water from San Francisco Bay to
                                                        Carmel. Costanoan and earlier artifacts have been identified in the city, particularly
                                                        along the banks of San Francisquito Creek. Preservation of these resources is a high
                                                        priority for the City and essential to defining the character of the community.

                                                        From its earliest days, Palo Alto has been a world-class center of knowledge and
                                                        innovation. The city incorporated in 1894 on land purchased with the specific intent
                                                        of serving the newly established Stanford University. Originally centered on
                                                        University Avenue, Palo Alto grew south and east, incorporating the older town of
                                                        Mayfield and its California Avenue district in 1925. By the 1970s, the city had almost
                                                        doubled in size, stretching into the foothills and south to Mountain View, with
                                                        commercial centers along Middlefield Road in Midtown and El Camino Real through
                                                        formerly unincorporated Barron Park, and research and development areas at the
                                                        city’s outskirts.
                                                        Today, Palo Alto covers almost 26 square miles (16,627 acres) of land, about a third
                                                        of which is open space, including 34 city-owned parks and 1,700 acres of protected
                                                        baylands. Ensuring that activities in and around the baylands, including airport

                                                        Palo Alto was an early adopter of compact development principles, as embodied in
                                                        the Urban Service Area designated to manage growth in the current Comprehensive
                                                        Plan. Through this strategy, the City has endeavored to direct new development into
                                                        appropriate locations—such as along transit corridors and near employment centers—
                                                        while protecting and preserving neighborhoods as well as the open space lands that
                                                        comprise about half of the city.

eliminate the community’s dependence on fossil fuels and adapt to the potential
effects of climate change. Through the direct provision of public utility services by the
City to the community, Palo Alto is able to achieve truly outstanding energy efficiency
and water conservation. The City and community also are leaders in promoting non-
automobile transportation, waste reduction and diversion and high-quality, low-
impact development.
In addition to efficiency and conservation, the City sees an adequate housing supply
as a fundamental component of a sustainable and equitable community. As of the
adoption of this Comprehensive Plan, renting or owning a home in Palo Alto is
prohibitively expensive for many. The housing affordability crisis in Palo Alto and in
the Bay Area more broadly, has a number of negative consequences, including
diminished socioeconomic diversity and increased traffic congestion as local workers
commute from distant places where housing is cheaper. In response, this Element
lays out a multi-faceted strategy to both preserve existing housing and create new
housing in a variety of types and sizes. Most new housing is anticipated to be multi-
family housing on redeveloped infill sites near housing. These policies and programs
work hand-in-hand with Housing Element programs and focus change along transit
corridors, while preserving the character of established single-family neighborhoods.
Together, all of these efforts make Palo Alto a more resilient community, able to
adjust behaviors and actions in an effort to protect and preserve environmental
resources.
CITY STRUCTURE
C OMPONENTS
The city is composed of unique neighborhoods and distinct but connected
commercial centers and employment districts. Understanding how these different
components of the city structure support one another and connect to the region can
help inform land use planning. By reflecting the existing structure in its policies, Palo
Alto will ensure that it remains a community that encourages social contact and
public life and also maintains quality urban design.

facilities. Their boundaries are based on land use and street patterns and community

                                                        perceptions. Most of the residential neighborhoods have land use classifications of
                                                        single-family residential with some also including multiple-family residential, and
                                                        transitions in scale and use often signify neighborhood boundaries.
                                                        Each neighborhood is a living reminder of the unique blend of architectural styles,
                                                        building materials, scale and street patterns that were typical at the time of its
                                                        development. These characteristics are more intact in some neighborhoods than in

                                                        thoughtful development review to ensure that new construction, additions and
                                                        remodels reflect neighborhood character.
                                                        Neighborhoods built prior to the mid-1940s generally have a traditional pattern of
                                                        development with relatively narrow streets, curbside parking, vertical curbs and street
                                                        trees between the curb and sidewalk. Many homes are oriented to the street with
                                                        parking often located to the rear of the lot.
                                                        Many later neighborhoods were shaped by Modernist design ideas popularized by
                                                        builder Joseph Eichler. The houses are intentionally designed with austere facades
                                                        and oriented towards private backyards and interior courtyards, where expansive
                                                        glass walls “bring the outside in.” Curving streets and cul-de-sacs further the sense of
                                                        house as private enclave, and flattened curbs joined to the sidewalk with no planting
                                                        strip create an uninterrupted plane on which to display the house. Some
                                                        neighborhoods built during this period contain other home styles such as California
                                                        ranch.
                                                        Both traditional and modern Palo Alto neighborhoods have fine examples of multi-
                                                        unit housing that are very compatible with surrounding single-family homes,
                                                        primarily because of their high-quality design characteristics, such as entrances and
                                                        gardens that face the street rather than the interior of the development. Examples
                                                        include duplexes and small apartment buildings near Downtown, as well as second
                                                        units and cottage courts in other areas of the city.

bicycling distance of virtually all Palo Alto residents, as shown in Map L-3. There are
three basic types of Centers in Palo Alto:
      Regional Centers include University Avenue/Downtown and Stanford
       Shopping Center. These areas are commercial activity hubs of citywide and
       regional significance, with a mix of shopping, offices and some housing.
       Downtown is characterized by two- and three-story buildings with ground
       floor shops. Downtown Palo Alto is widely recognized for its mix of culture,
       architecture and atmosphere of innovation, which make it a uniquely special
       place. Trees, benches, outdoor seating areas, sidewalks, plazas and other
       amenities make the streets pedestrian-friendly. Transit is highly accessible and
       frequent. Downtown plays a key role in concentrating housing, employment,
       shopping and entertainment near each other and regional rail and other
       transit, exemplifying and supporting citywide sustainability and resiliency.
       However, a recent cycle of economic growth has brought increased pressure
       for additional office space in Downtown Palo Alto. In recent years, the
       demand has become so strong that other important uses that contribute to
       Downtown’s vitality, such as storefront retail, are at risk of being pushed out.
       This Element includes policies and programs to preserve ground floor-retail
       uses Downtown and sustain its role as a gathering place. Programs are also
       included to convert some unused development potential from commercial to
       residential potential in the future.
       Stanford Shopping Center has evolved from its original auto-oriented design
       into a premier open-air pedestrian environment known for extensive
       landscaped areas surrounded by retail and dining.
      Multi-Neighborhood Centers, including California Avenue, Town and
       Country Village and South El Camino Real, are retail districts that serve more
       than one neighborhood with a diverse mix of uses including retail, office and
       residential. They feature one- to three-story buildings with storefront windows
       and outdoor seating areas that create a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.
       These centers also contain retail uses clustered around plazas and parks that
       provide public gathering spaces. They can be linked to other city Centers via
       transit.
      Neighborhood Centers, such as Charleston Shopping Center, Edgewood
       Plaza and Midtown Shopping Center, are small retail areas drawing customers
       from the immediately surrounding area. These centers are often anchored by

                                                               offices oriented toward the everyday needs of local residents. Adjacent streets
                                                               provide walking, biking and transit connections.

                                                        Palo Alto’s employment districts, such as Stanford Research Park, Stanford Medical
                                                        Center, East Bayshore and San Antonio Road/Bayshore Corridor, represent a
                                                        development type not found in other parts of the city. These Districts are
                                                        characterized by large one- to four-story buildings, with some taller buildings,
                                                       separated by parking lots and landscaped areas. The Districts are accessed primarily
                                                       by automobile or employer-supported transit, though future changes in land use and
                                                       tenancy could support a shift toward transit, pedestrian and bicycle travel.
                                                        GROWTH MANAGEMENT
                                                        The pace of non-residential growth and development in Palo Alto has been
                                                        moderated by a citywide cap on non-residential development first adopted by the
                                                        City Council in 1989. Based on the demonstrated and continuous strength of the
                                                        city’s economy, and recent changes in the approach to growth management
                                                        throughout California, this Plan presents an updated cumulative growth
                                                        management and monitoring system. This system moderates the overall amount of
                                                        new office/R&D development and monitors its impacts on Palo Alto’s livability. An
                                                        implementation program addresses the pace of new office/R&D development by
                                                        updating an existing ordinance establishing an annual limit on the amount allowed.
                                                        This updated approach uses 2015 as the baseline from which to monitor new
                                                        development and establishes a cumulative, citywide cap on office/R&D uses,
                                                        including conversions of existing square footage to office/R&D space. It also
                                                        establishes clear guidance to address what the City should do as the cap is

B UILDINGS
Palo Alto has many buildings of outstanding architectural merit representing a variety
of styles and periods. The best examples of these buildings are constructed with
quality materials, show evidence of craftsmanship, fit with their surroundings and
help make neighborhoods comfortable and appealing. To help achieve quality
design, the Architectural Review Board reviews buildings and site design for
commercial and multi-family residential projects. Palo Alto’s commercial and
residential buildings have received regional and national design recognition. Design
issues in residential neighborhoods include sympathetic restoration and renovation
of homes, protection of privacy if second stories are added, and efforts to make
streets more inviting to pedestrians.
H ISTORIC R ESOURCES
Palo Alto has a rich stock of historic structures and places that are important to the
city’s heritage and preserving and reusing these historic resources contributes to the
livability of Palo Alto. The City’s Historic Inventory lists approximately 400 buildings of
historical merit, with more than a dozen buildings on the National Register of
Historic Places, as well as three historic districts (Green Gables, Greenmeadow and
Professorville) and one architectural district (Ramona Street). Map L-5 illustrates
historic resources in Palo Alto.
Historic sites include the El Palo Alto Redwood, believed to be the site of a 1776
encampment of the Portola Expedition and one of 19 California Points of Historical
Interest in the city. The garage at 367 Addison that was the birthplace of Hewlett-
Packard is one of seven sites or structures listed on the California Register of Historic
Landmarks. The length of El Camino Real from San Francisco to San Diego, including
the section that passes through Palo Alto, is a State Historic Landmark. Many historic
buildings in the city have been rehabilitated and adaptively reused as office or
commercial spaces, including former single-family homes in and near downtown.

Throughout Palo Alto are a variety of public spaces from parks and schools to plazas
and sidewalks, to cultural, religious and civic facilities. Each of these can increasingly
serve as centers for public life with gathering places, bicycle and pedestrian access,
safety-enhancing night-time lighting and clear visual access, and, in some cases,
small-scale retail uses such as cafes.
Well-designed streets also invite public use and enhance quality of life. Palo Alto’s
reputation as a gracious residential community is due not only to its fine street trees
and attractive planting areas, but also to appropriate street width for neighborhood
character, accommodation of pedestrians and bicycles, height and setbacks of
buildings and color and texture of paving materials. These components help to
ensure that streets are pleasant and safe for all travelers.
Parking lots occupy large amounts of surface area in the city. Well-designed parking
lots make efficient use of space while contributing positively to the appearance of the
surrounding area. A parking lot can provide an opportunity for open space and
outdoor amenities rather than just a repository for cars. Many parking lots in Palo
Alto include trees, landscaping and public art.
G ATEWAYS
Community identity is strengthened when the entrances to the city are clear and
memorable. In Palo Alto, these entrances or gateways include University Avenue, El
Camino Real, Middlefield Road, Oregon Expressway/Page Mill Road, San Antonio
Road and Embarcadero Road and the Palo Alto Transit Center and California Avenue
Caltrain station. Well-designed gateways are defined by natural and urban landmarks
that complement the character and identity of the neighborhood.

Palo Alto’s urban forest—including both public and privately owned trees—is a key
part of the community’s history, identity and quality of life. It offers enormous social,
environmental and financial benefits and is a fundamental part of Palo Alto’s sense
of place. Regular spacing of trees that are similar in form and texture provides order
and coherence and gives scale to the street. A canopy of branches and leaves
provides shade for pedestrians and creates a sense of enclosure and comfort. On the
city’s most memorable streets, trees of a single species extend historic character to
the corners of blocks, reducing the apparent width of streets and intersections and

                                                        keep pace with growth and development. While the purpose of infrastructure is
                                                        usually utilitarian or functional, attention to design details can add beauty or even
                                                        improve urban design. For example, replacing a sidewalk can provide an opportunity
                                                        to create larger tree wells and provide new street trees.
                                                        State law (California Government Code Section 65302.10) requires the City to
                                                        address potential regional inequity and infrastructure deficits within disadvantaged

                                                        PALO ALTO AIRPORT
                                                        Palo Alto Airport (PAO) is a general aviation airport owned and operated by the City
                                                        of Palo Alto. PAO occupies 102 acres of land east of Highway 101 in the baylands
                                                        and has one paved runway. The airport functions as a reliever to three Bay Area
                                                        airports. PAO facilities include an air traffic control tower operated by the Federal
                                                        Aviation Administration and a terminal building. Flight clubs and fixed base operators
                                                        operate on-site, offering fuel sales, flight lessons, pilot training and aircraft sales,
                                                        rentals, maintenance and repair. From 1967 to 2015, PAO was operated by Santa
                                                        Clara County under a lease agreement. Operations and control have since been

LAND USE MAP AND LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Map L-6 shows each land use designation within the city of Palo Alto. The land use
designations translate the elements of city structure into a detailed map that presents
the community’s vision for future land use development and conservation on public
and private land in Palo Alto through the year 2030. Residential densities are
expressed in terms of dwelling units per acre. Population densities per acre are not
absolute limits.
Building intensities for non-residential uses are expressed in terms of floor area ratio
(FAR), which is the ratio of gross building floor area (excluding areas designated for
parking, etc.) to net lot area, both expressed in square feet. FAR does not regulate
building placement or form, only the spatial relationship between building size and
lot size; it represents an expectation of the overall intensity of future development.
The maximums assigned to the land use designations below do not constitute
entitlements, nor are property owners or developers guaranteed that an individual
project, when tested against the General Plan’s policies, will be able or permitted to
achieve these maximums.

                                                       recreation and whose character is essentially urban. These areas, which may have
                                                       been planted with non-indigenous landscaping, may provide access to nature within
                                                       the urban environment and require a concerted effort to maintain recreational

                                                        Streamside Open Space: This designation is intended to preserve and enhance
                                                        corridors of riparian vegetation along streams. Hiking, biking and riding trails may be
                                                        developed in the streamside open space. The corridor will generally vary in width up
                                                        to 200 feet on either side of the center line of the creek. However, along San

                                                        creek, the open space corridor varies in width between approximately 80 and 310
                                                        feet from the center line of the creek. The aerial delineation of the open space in this

                                                        Open Space/Controlled Development: Land having all the characteristics of open
                                                       space but where some development may be allowed on private properties. Open
                                                       space amenities must be retained in these areas. Residential densities range from 0.1
                                                       to 1 dwelling unit per acre but may rise to a maximum of 2 units per acre where
                                                       second units are allowed, and population densities range from 1 to 4 persons per
                                                       acre. Other uses such as agricultural, recreational and non-residential uses may be
                                                        allowed consistent with the protection and preservation of the inherent open space

                                                        Single-Family Residential: This designation applies to residential neighborhoods
                                                       primarily characterized by detached single-family homes, typically with one dwelling
                                                       unit on each lot. Private and public schools and churches are conditional uses
                                                       requiring permits. Accessory dwelling units or duplexes are allowed subject to certain
                                                       size limitations and other development standards and duplexes may be allowed in

                                                       and do not create traffic and parking problems. The net density in single family areas
                                                       will range from 1 to 7 units per acre, but rises to a maximum of 14 units on parcels
                                                       where second units or duplexes occur. Population densities will range from 1 to 30

Multiple-Family Residential: The permitted number of housing units will vary by
area, depending on existing land use, proximity to major streets and public transit,
distance to shopping and environmental problems. Net densities will range from 8 to
40 units and 8 to 90 persons per acre. Density should be on the lower end of the
scale next to single-family residential areas. Densities higher than what is permitted
may be allowed where measurable community benefits will be derived, services and
facilities are available, and the net effect will be consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan. Population densities will range up to 2.25 persons per unit by 2030.
Village Residential: Allows residential dwellings that are designed to contribute to
the harmony and pedestrian orientation of a street or neighborhood. Housing types
include single-family houses on small lots, second units, cottage clusters, courtyard
housing, duplexes, fourplexes and small apartment buildings. Design standards will
be prepared for each housing type to ensure that development successfully
contributes to the street and neighborhood and minimizes potential negative
impacts. Net densities will range up to 20 units per acre. Population densities will
range up to 2.25 persons per unit by 2030.
Transit-Oriented Residential: Allows higher density residential dwellings in the
University Avenue/Downtown and California Avenue commercial centers within a
walkable distance, approximately 2,500 feet, of the City’s two multi-modal transit
stations. The land use category is intended to generate residential densities that
support substantial use of public transportation and especially the use of Caltrain.
Design standards will be prepared to ensure that development successfully
contributes to the street and minimizes potential negative impacts. Individual project
requirements will be developed, including parking, to ensure that a significant
portion of the residents will use alternative modes of transportation. Net density will
range up to 50 units per acre, with minimum densities to be considered during
development of new City zoning regulations. Population densities will range up to
2.25 per person per unit by 2030.
COMMERCIAL
Neighborhood Commercial: Includes shopping centers with off-street parking or a
cluster of street-front stores that serve the immediate neighborhood. Examples
include Charleston Center, Edgewood Center and Midtown. Typical uses include
supermarkets, bakeries, drugstores, variety stores, barber shops, restaurants, self-
service laundries, dry cleaners and hardware stores. In locations along El Camino

                                                        a wider variety of goods and services than the neighborhood shopping areas. They
                                                        rely on larger trade areas and include such uses as department stores, bookstores,
                                                        furniture stores, toy stores, apparel shops, restaurants, theaters and non-retail
                                                        services such as banks. Non-retail uses such as medical and dental offices and
                                                        software development may also locate in this designation. Examples include Stanford

                                                        some locations, residential and mixed use projects may also locate in this category.
                                                        Non-residential FARs range from 0.35 to 2.0. Consistent with the Comprehensive
                                                        Plan’s encouragement of housing near transit centers, higher density multi-family
                                                        housing may be allowed in specific locations.
                                                        Service Commercial: Facilities providing citywide and regional services and relying
                                                        on customers arriving by car. These uses do not necessarily benefit from being in
                                                        high volume pedestrian areas such as shopping centers or Downtown. Typical uses
                                                        include auto services and dealerships, motels, lumberyards, appliance stores and
                                                        restaurants, including fast service types. In almost all cases, these uses require good
                                                        automobile and service access so that customers can safely load and unload without
                                                        impeding traffic. In some locations, residential and mixed-use projects may be
                                                        appropriate in this land use category. Examples of Service Commercial areas include
                                                        San Antonio Road, El Camino Real and Embarcadero Road northeast of the Bayshore
                                                        Freeway. Non-residential FARs will range up to 0.4. Consistent with the
                                                        Comprehensive Plan’s encouragement of housing near transit centers, higher density

                                                        Mixed Use: The Mixed Use designation is intended to promote pedestrian-oriented
                                                        places that layer compatible land uses, public amenities and utilities together at
                                                        various scales and intensities. The designation allows for multiple functions within
                                                        the same building or adjacent to one another in the same general vicinity to foster a
                                                        mix of uses that encourages people to live, work, play and shop in close proximity.
                                                        Most typically, mixed-use developments have retail on the ground floor and

and Residential/Office development. FARs will range up to 1.15, although
development located along transit corridors or near multi-modal centers will range
up to 2.0 FAR with up to 3.0 FAR possible where higher FAR would be an incentive
to meet community goals such as providing affordable housing. The FAR above 1.15
must be used for residential purposes. FAR between 0.15 and 1.15 may be used for
residential purposes. As of the adoption of this Comprehensive Plan, the Mixed Use
designation is currently only applied in the SOFA area. Consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan’s encouragement of housing near transit centers, higher density
multi-family housing may be allowed in specific locations.
Commercial Hotel: This category allows facilities for use by temporary overnight
occupants on a transient basis, such as hotels and motels, with associated
conference centers and similar uses. Restaurants and other eating facilities, meeting
rooms, small retail shops, personal services and other services ancillary to the hotel
are also allowed. This category can be applied in combination with another land use
category. FAR currently ranges up to 2.0 for the hotel portion of the site. An
implementation program indicates that the City will explore increasing this FAR.
Research/Office Park: Office, research and manufacturing establishments whose
operations are buffered from adjacent residential uses. Stanford Research Park is an
example. Other uses that may be included are educational institutions and child care
facilities. Compatible commercial service uses such as banks and restaurants and
residential or mixed-uses that would benefit from the proximity to employment
centers, will also be allowed. Additional uses, including retail services, commercial
recreation, churches and private clubs may also be located in Research/Office Park
areas, but only if they are found to be compatible with the surrounding area through
the conditional use permit process. In some locations, residential and mixed-use
projects may also locate in this category. Maximum allowable FAR ranges from 0.3 to
0.5, depending on site conditions. Consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, multi-
family housing may be allowed in specific locations.
Light Industrial: Wholesale and storage warehouses and the manufacturing,
processing, repairing and packaging of goods. Emission of fumes, noise, smoke, or
other pollutants is strictly controlled. Examples include portions of the area south of
Oregon Avenue between El Camino Real and Alma Street that historically have
included these land uses, and the San Antonio Road industrial area. Compatible
residential and mixed use projects may also be located in this category. FAR will

 of safe, accessible and efficient transportation and parking
 solutions for all users and modes, while protecting and
 enhancing the quality of life in Palo Alto. Programs will include
 alternative and innovate transportation processes, and the
 adverse impacts of automobile traffic on the environment in
 general and residential streets in particular will be reduced.
 Streets will be safe, attractive and designed to enhance the
 quality and aesthetics of Palo Alto neighborhoods. Palo Alto
 recognizes the regional nature of its transportation system, and
 will be a leader in seeking regional transportation solutions,
 prioritizing Caltrain service improvements and railroad grade
 separations.

INTRODUCTION
This Element addresses transportation and mobility issues comprehensively and
acknowledges that the future will be different than the present and the past.
Recognizing changing demographics and travel preferences, new technologies and
new opportunities, the Element provides a policy framework which includes
solutions for implementation today in order to lay the groundwork for the future.
Together with investments in infrastructure, the policy framework seeks to reduce
reliance on single-occupant vehicles, address congestion and reduce through traffic
and non-resident parking in Palo Alto neighborhoods, leading to an integrated
transportation system that serves local, regional and intercity travel.
This Element meets the State requirement for a Circulation Element, addressing the
various aspects of circulation, including complete streets, expressways and freeways,
transit, walking, bicycling, parking and special transportation needs.

occupant vehicles to collective forms of transport, including mass transit, carpools
and private shuttles. TDM is a critical component of a comprehensive strategy to
reduce traffic congestion. TDM programs are typically incorporated in new
development and can include a range of infrastructure investments and incentives
for the use of alternatives to the automobile, as well as parking management
strategies and marketing. Employers and local governments often collaborate in
developing and implementing area-wide TDM programs aimed at reducing single-
occupant vehicle use by existing employees. These activities can be coordinated
through a transportation management association (TMA) made up of local
businesses in a commercial district or industrial park. Stanford University operates a
comprehensive and successful TDM program for the University and the Medical
Center, and a program is in development for the Research Park. In January 2015, the
City of Palo Alto supported establishment of a TMA for the downtown area, in
collaboration with local businesses and residents. The success of this effort and its
potential to expand to other areas of the City will depend on securing ongoing
funding and on the committed participation of employers who face parking and
traffic challenges in downtown.
ALTERNATIVE F UEL VEHICLES
Alternative fuel vehicles—those that run on electricity, biodiesel, compressed natural
gas and other alternatives to petroleum fuels—help reduce GHG emissions by
utilizing cleaner fuels or zero emission alternatives. In 2014, the City of Palo Alto
adopted an ordinance that requires electric vehicle (EV)-ready infrastructure for all
new commercial construction to encourage the use of electric vehicles and develop
the infrastructure for this growing market. As the City continues this effort, additional
infrastructure may be necessary. However, while alternative fuel vehicles do reduce
GHGs, they are still a contributor to congestion and delay.
MOBILITY AS A SERVICE
The use of transportation services is beginning to replace private vehicle ownership
in the region, led by a number of prominent ride sharing and e-hailing car services
(like Uber and Lyft). Originating in Europe, the concept of “Mobility as a Service”
(MaaS), allows on-demand trip planning enabled by smartphones and mobile
devices and provided by "pop up" bus-, car- and bike-sharing services. Palo Alto is
partnering with Joint Venture Silicon Valley, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) and the City of San Jose to develop a MaaS/smartphone app
(Commuter Wallet) that combines access to multiple transportation modes and
employer commute benefits, incentivizing non-single-occupant vehicle travel.

                                                     As of the adoption of this Comprehensive Plan, autonomous vehicles, also known as
                                                     self-driving cars and trucks, are being tested but are not yet in widespread use.
                                                     However, many predict that they will become a significant proportion of the cars on
                                                     the road by 2030. Autonomous vehicles will allow people to travel safely and use
                                                     their travel time productively, and will dramatically reduce the need for parking. Zero

                                                     However, by eliminating the downsides of single-occupant driving, autonomous
                                                     vehicles could contribute to sprawl and increase mobility inequity, stranding those
                                                     who can’t afford access to the new technology. To avoid these pitfalls, this plan
                                                     focuses on autonomous vehicles that are shared, electric, safe and equitable.

BUS SERVICE
Three transit providers, VTA, SamTrans and AC Transit, provide bus service in Palo
Alto, connecting residents to both local and regional destinations. The VTA operates
local bus service within the city, with 14 bus routes in Palo Alto and an express bus
network that serves the Stanford Research Park. VTA also offers connections to VTA
light rail, Caltrain, Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) and AMTRAK Capitol Corridor.
SamTrans operates bus service throughout San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa
Clara counties, helping to connect Palo Alto to other parts of the Peninsula and
Silicon Valley. AC Transit’s Dumbarton Express provides express bus service between
the East Bay and communities on the Peninsula.
The VTA’s proposed El Camino Real Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project aims to improve
transit operations and increase transit ridership along the El Camino Real Corridor.
Policies in this Element support enhanced bus service in shared travel lanes with
curbside stations and signal priority with queue jump lanes to provide faster, more
reliable service with target stops and specialized transit vehicles and facilities.
SHUTTLE SERVICE
There are four types of shuttle services operating in Palo Alto, including the Stanford
University Marguerite shuttle, the VTA shuttle, the City-operated Palo Alto Shuttle and
private employee shuttles which transit through Palo Alto offering transportation for
employees to other job centers on the Peninsula. The Marguerite, run by Stanford
University Parking and Transportation Services, is a free service that connects the
Stanford campus to the Palo Alto Transit Center and Downtown. The VTA provides
low cost fare based service for residents of Santa Clara County. The Palo Alto Free
Shuttle is a free wheelchair-accessible shuttle provided by the City to connect
important destinations in the community, including Caltrain stations. The City is
developing plans for enhanced service in response to community input. Marguerite
and Palo Alto Shuttle routes are shown on Map T-1.

                                                   FIRST/LAST MILE CONNECTIONS
                                                   Many people live or work within a mile from a transit station or bus stop; however,
                                                   distance, perception of safety and inconvenience may deter them from using transit,
                                                   so the entire trip is made by single-occupant vehicle simply for lack of convenience
                                                   of a small but crucial segment of the trip. Currently, the Palo Alto shuttle, bicycling
                                                   and walking are the best first/last mile option for most of Palo Alto. Future
                                                   improvements should focus on making walking, bicycling, shuttle service and
                                                   ridesharing more efficient, comfortable and safe.
                                                   BICYCLING
                                                   Palo Alto dedicated its formal bikeway system—one of the nation’s first—in 1972.
                                                   Bikeways have since become commonplace, and considerable progress has been
                                                   made in overcoming barriers to bicycle travel in and around Palo Alto. Palo Alto’s
                                                   bikeway network consists of on-road bicycle lanes, bicycle boulevards and bicycle
                                                   routes, off-roadway shared-use paths and bridges and bicycle parking facilities.
                                                   Fourteen underpasses and bridges span barriers such as freeways, creeks and
                                                   railroad tracks. Map T-3 shows the existing and planned bikeway network in Palo
                                                   Alto. Palo Alto is in a position to build on the existing network, significantly increasing
                                                   its proportion of travel by bicycle and is actively pursuing an expanded bike share

                                                   The Palo Alto Bicycle + Pedestrian Transportation Plan, adopted in 2012 (BPTP
                                                   2012), contains a policy framework, design guidance and specific recommendations
                                                   to increase walking and bicycling rates over the next decade and beyond. BPTP 2012
                                                   encourages planning, construction and maintenance of complete streets that are safe
                                                   and accessible to all modes and people of all ages and abilities.

                                                  Palo Alto each day, yet is an often overlooked means of transportation. As shown on
                                                  Map T-4, Palo Alto's pedestrians are generally well-served by current facilities and
                                                  will benefit from the attention given to street trees, walkable neighborhoods and
                                                  pedestrian-oriented design. The most needed improvements are to fill in the gaps in
                                                  the sidewalk system, make intersection crossings “friendlier” and overcome barriers
                                                  to northeast-southwest travel.
                                                  STREETS
                                                  All modes of transportation in Palo Alto depend to some degree on the street
                                                  network. The City’s street network has remained essentially unchanged since the
                                                  1960s, except for projects along the Sand Hill Road corridor.

                                                  Palo Alto’s streets are categorized according to purpose, design and the volume of
                                                  traffic they carry. This street hierarchy is defined below and is illustrated on Map T-5.
                                                  Improvements to road surfaces, curbs, crossings, signage, landscaping and sight lines

                                                  pedestrians and cyclists as well.

                                                  most constricted points on the network and tend to see the highest levels of
                                                  congestion during the peak morning and afternoon commute periods. For that
                                                  purpose, several key intersections and roadways segments, as shown on Map T-6,
                                                  have been identified for monitoring.

                                                  A challenge is to balance the free flow of traffic with the safety of pedestrians and
                                                  cyclists of all abilities, as well as with residents’ desire to maintain low traffic speeds
                                                  on residential arterials.
                                                  Most future improvements will be made within existing rights-of-way and will

                                                  turn lanes or making other intersection adjustments. Other, specific local and

V EHICLE M ILES T RAVELED
Transportation planning analyses used by cities to describe traffic and roadway and
intersection operation, both for infrastructure planning and for new development
projects, are evolving away from the traditional LOS metric towards a multi-modal
perspective based on Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). California Senate Bill 743,
passed in 2013, requires impacts from new development on transportation network
performance to be viewed through a filter that promotes the reduction of GHG
emissions, the development of multi-modal transportation networks and a diversity
of land uses. This Bill will shift the State away from LOS as the metric for evaluating
transportation impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
towards use of VMT or VMT per capita. This shift recognizes that prioritizing the free
flow of cars over any other roadway user contradicts State goals to reduce GHGs.
While LOS describes local-level impacts at a specific location, VMT describes
network-wide impacts by measuring the number of miles traveled by motor vehicles
within an area. VMT per capita divides the total amount of VMT by the population
living and working in a community. Together, these measures can inform efforts to
reduce commute lengths and enhance the availability of alternative transportation
options.
Multi-modal level of service (MMLOS) is another analytical approach endorsed by
policies in this Element, and applies the concept of LOS to all modes of travel,
including transit, bikes and pedestrians as well as cars and trucks. Within Santa Clara
County, VTA is developing guidelines for multi-modal transportation planning to
include in all transportation studies, and the City of Palo Alto will have an
opportunity to participate in this effort. One possible outcome could be the adoption
of metrics for safety, convenience and delay for transit, bicycles and pedestrians
similar to the LOS standards the City has adopted for motor vehicles.

Palo Alto is bisected by the Caltrain rail corridor, which provides important
connections to the wider Bay Area; however, it also creates a significant barrier to
local connectivity and circulation. Policies in this Element address these issues as well
as safety and desired service expansions to better serve the California Avenue
Caltrain station.
To enhance local connectivity, improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation and
increase safety, the City of Palo Alto is also committed to pursuing grade separation

                                                     motor vehicle traffic. The City has designated some streets as residential arterials to
                                                     recognize that they carry large volumes of through-traffic but also have residential
                                                     uses on both sides of the street. The objective is to address the desires of residents
                                                     of these streets who would like to have slower speeds, safer conditions for bicycles
                                                     and pedestrians and aesthetic improvements. This must be done economically and

                                                     Additionally, to address community concerns, the City has developed a Traffic

                                                     importance given the advent of technology that helps drivers navigate local streets to
                                                     avoid congestion. Traffic calming also includes education and enforcement measures
                                                     that promote changes in driver behavior. Some examples of traffic calming measures
                                                     include:
                                                          Curb and Sidewalk Design. In many of the areas of Palo Alto built since World
                                                           War II, an integral curb and sidewalk design was used, resulting in sidewalks
                                                           immediately next to traffic lanes. Adding planting pockets and street trees would

      promote pedestrian use and also provide visual cues to drivers to reduce
      speeds. Curb extensions at intersections and crosswalks can also slow traffic
      speeds.
     Reducing and Narrowing Lanes. In commercial areas, it may be feasible to
      reduce the number of lanes for through-traffic without losing too much traffic
      handling capacity. In these areas, curb lanes are often not very useful for
      through-traffic since they may be blocked or slowed by cars turning into and out
      of driveways and parking spaces. In other areas, narrowing the travel lanes is a
      technique that can be used to reduce motor vehicle speeds.
     Traffic Circles. A traffic circle is a raised island in the center of an intersection
      that helps reduce speeding by forcing drivers to slow. Traffic circles have been
      shown to reduce collisions and are considered more bicycle-friendly than
      traditional two- or four-way stops controls. Because they don’t require stops,
      traffic circles also reduce local air and noise pollution from stop-and-go traffic,
      and offer opportunities for added landscaping and tree planting. Traffic circles
      are already used in Palo Alto’s residential neighborhoods, and the 2012 Palo
      Alto Bicycle + Pedestrian Transportation Plan calls for greater use of traffic
      circles, particularly along bicycle boulevards.
PARKING
Effectively managing parking supply and demand can reduce traffic congestion,
protect the livability of residential neighborhoods and support local businesses.
The parking-related policies in this plan articulate a phased approach. In the near-
term, the focus will be on conducting needs assessments, which establish a baseline
for adequate parking in each of the city's commercial centers and employment
districts under current conditions, and creating parking management strategies,
which optimize the use of existing parking spaces. In the mid- to long-term, as it
becomes easier and more convenient to walk, bike, rideshare and use transit, and as
the effectiveness of parking management programs can be measured, the focus will
shift to recalibrating parking supply. Bridging between these two phases will require
identifying performance standards for transit, walking, ridesharing and bicycling that
represent the thresholds at which point mechanisms to phase in updated parking
requirements and reduce space allocated to parking over time should be considered.

                                                  Parking management can be done in a number of ways, including optimizing use of
                                                  existing spaces and incentivizing use of alternatives to the automobile. Technology is
                                                  central to optimizing the use of existing spaces, and shared parking arrangements
                                                  that allow different users to use the same spaces at alternate times can also optimize
                                                  the use of existing spaces. Improving transit service, providing safe, convenient
                                                  bicycle parking and enhancing the pedestrian realm can incentivize the use of
                                                  transportation modes that don't require vehicle parking, while charging for parking
                                                  makes it more likely that people will carpool, take transit, walk or bike.
                                                  The City has already begun to pilot new programs and gauge the effectiveness of
                                                  parking management strategies in coordination with other transportation demand
                                                  management initiatives. This plan seeks to set the stage for continued innovation
                                                  and experimentation in both the public and private sectors to develop effective
                                                  solutions. Over time, carefully managing parking supply can significantly reduce the

                                                  support Palo Alto’s goals for livable neighborhoods.
                                                  Policies also support increasing the number of safe, attractive and well-designed
                                                  bicycle parking spaces in Palo Alto, as well as bike share hubs and bike stations at

                                                  Traffic safety will continue to be among the City’s top priorities in the future. City

offers seniors 65 and over a discounted Regional Transit Connection Card. In
addition, Outreach, a non-profit organization that serves seniors and people with
disabilities, offers transportation services in Santa Clara County, including a
subsidized transit pass and subsidized taxi rides. While Outreach provides an
important service to the community, there is a daily cap on the number of rides
offered so all user requests may not be accommodated.
VTA’s paratransit services are also provided by Outreach. Riders may reserve
paratransit trips from one to three days in advance, between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
for service the next day. However, paratransit services are limited to a ¾-mile
corridor around the VTA bus routes and light rail stations. For travel outside of the
service area, customers must arrange a transfer to the paratransit operator.
The policies in this Element support these and other efforts to serve transit
dependent communities and also embrace the principle of universal design to
achieve roadways and sidewalks that can accommodate people of all abilities and all
users, including automobiles, pedestrians, bicyclists. Examples of universal design to
support people with disabilities include placing pedestrian push buttons at
wheelchair level, audible pedestrian crossing systems, sidewalk curb ramps,
including wider ramps for strollers, increasing pedestrian crossing times, sidewalk
widths of six feet or greater, roadway and sidewalk materials that reduce slipping and
add stability, minimizing driveway crossings and obstructions and avoiding steep
grades and slopes.

                                                  Increasing population and traffic congestion over the past 20 years have required an
                                                  increased emphasis on regional solutions to transportation issues. A regional
                                                  approach is needed to avoid local solutions that simply shift the problem elsewhere
                                                  or produce unintended results. Transportation facilities like Caltrain or the Bayshore
                                                  Freeway need to be managed regionally. Palo Alto is actively participating with other

                                                  Electrification Project (PCEP), which will replace existing diesel trains with electric

                                                  regional commuters, they will increase delays and congestion at rail crossings until

  Palo Alto’s longstanding belief that city safety begins internally, with education,
  awareness and action at the neighborhood level. Such prepared communities
  strengthen the City’s ability to be vigilant to both natural and human-caused
  hazards, and ultimately to minimize the impacts of these hazards. Community
  safety demands balancing a complex series of factors, and Palo Alto will
  continually develop best practices, coordinate with other organizations and
  adopt technological innovations in order to achieve this balance.

INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element satisfies the State-mandated requirement for a Safety Element. It
addresses larger safety topics that are relevant to all cities, such as community safety
and emergency management, and also focuses on a series of hazards, both natural
and human-caused, that are important to Palo Alto. The Element addresses the
potential risks to residents of and property in Palo Alto from the threat of
earthquakes and other geological hazards, floods and fires, as well as risks associated
with hazardous materials and excess solid waste. Just as vital, it establishes a plan for
a robust security infrastructure.
The text is organized in to three topics, each with a corresponding goal, policies and
programs:
   Community Safety
   Natural Hazards
   Human-Caused Threats

                                                  COMMUNITY SAFETY
                                                  The potential of different types of hazards in Palo Alto varies greatly. Given this
                                                  unpredictability, a safe City begins with a solid network of safety-related support,
                                                  procedures and preparation at the community level. The goal of these policies and
                                                  programs is to broaden public education and awareness of safe behaviors and to
                                                  promote implementation of community safety measures. The policy framework also
                                                  reflects Palo Alto’s belief that safety can be built into the physical, behavioral and
                                                  organization fabric of the community, including individual neighborhoods, the urban
                                                  center and rural areas. In addition to preparation, community safety is defined by
                                                  effective emergency management practices, adoption of effective regulation and
                                                  application of innovative technologies by all safety-related City departments. Map S-1
                                                  shows the locations of fire and police stations within the city.
                                                  NATURAL HAZARDS
                                                  As is the case in every community, residents of Palo Alto are subject to a series of
                                                  largely unpredictable, but rarely occurring, natural hazards. The very factors that
                                                  make the city so desirable—its bayfront position, foothills topography with beautiful
                                                  creeks, and location at the center of globally significant but geologically active Bay
                                                  Area—are directly associated with some of these natural risks. The goal of the Natural
                                                  Hazards policy framework is to establish general safety measures, including adoption
                                                  of a certified Local Hazard Mitigation and Adaptation Plan (LHMP) and then to
                                                  minimize the potential for injury, loss of life and property damage resulting from
                                                  individual hazards. The LHMP describes the type, location and extent of natural
                                                  hazards that can affect the city; describes the city’s vulnerability to these hazards; and
                                                  includes a mitigation strategy for reducing the potential losses. Natural Hazards
                                                  include seismic events, as shown in Maps S-2, S-3 and S-4; flood events, as shown in
                                                  Map S-5 and sea level rise, as shown in Map S-6. In the unlikely of event of dam
                                                  failure, some areas of the city may be subject to inundation; these areas are shown
                                                  in Map S-7. Finally, wildfire hazards zones are shown in Map S-8.
                                                  As is evident throughout the Safety Element, policies are based on the City’s belief
                                                  that risk reduction is best achieved through planning, regulation, technology and
                                                  education.
                                                  HUMAN-CAUSED THREATS
                                                  Just as Palo Alto—a world-class city in a prime location—is subject to natural hazards,

  VISION: Palo Alto will provide high quality community services to its residents,
  businesses and visitors. Its schools, libraries, parks, community facilities and arts
  and cultural centers are treasured and will be enhanced to serve current and
  future generations. The City will continue to provide services and programs that
  meet the needs of special populations—including children, seniors and people
  with disabilities—as well as programs in recreation, lifelong learning and the arts
  that benefit all populations. Palo Alto’s success in providing these services will
  be expressed and measured by the satisfaction of the public at large. The City
  will pursue new opportunities to deliver community services in the most efficient
  and cost-effective way possible. The City will coordinate its efforts with other
  public agencies, nonprofits and the private sector to reduce overlap and
  maximize the use of resources.

INTRODUCTION
Palo Alto provides a diverse array of community services and facilities for those who
live, work and go to school in the city. Community services and facilities play a vital
role in fostering public health and enriching the social life of the community. A
nationally recognized leader in delivery of public services, the City of Palo Alto is
committed to providing high quality, responsive service for its residents and
businesses. The City of Palo Alto is also committed to a leadership role within the
Mid-Peninsula and greater Bay Area region, promoting efficient service delivery and
addressing shared community service needs that cross jurisdictional lines.
The Community Services and Facilities Element is not explicitly required by State law;
however, the topics addressed here are all key components of the high quality of life
that Palo Alto offers. This Element describes the range of community services,
programs and facilities currently provided in Palo Alto, and outlines City policy
intended to maintain and enhance these services and facilities to suit the needs of
the city's diverse population now and in the future.

                                                         have strong connections to this Element: future residents will use community
                                                         facilities services, and will need a variety of transportation options to access those
                                                         facilities and services. The Natural Environment Element addresses habitat
                                                         preservation and critical ecological connections provided by the City’s parks and
                                                         open spaces. Finally, the Land Use and Community Design Element identifies the
                                                         locations of City parks, open spaces and other public land.
                                                         While parks and recreational and cultural facilities are a central focus of the
                                                         Community Services Element, the protection and preservation of natural open

                                                         Palo Alto enjoys approximately 174 acres of parkland and almost 4,400 acres of

                                                         for people of all ages and abilities. Table C-1 lists parks, recreation and cultural

                                                         PAUSD have a long-standing cooperative agreement that provides community access

                                                         need use of the fields. The cultural amenities offered in Palo Alto rival those offered
                                                         in large cities and thus attract regional visitors with two museums, three theaters, a

                                                       Palo Alto’s parks, community centers and cultural amenities are an important part of
                                                       what makes the City a desirable place to live. The City is committed to the continued
                                                       investment in and proactive stewardship of its infrastructure and public facilities, as
                                                       resources are available and in consideration of the costly effects of delayed
                                                       maintenance. An ongoing commitment to maintenance, rehabilitation and
                                                       modernization of existing parks, community centers and cultural facilities, as well as
                                                       stewardship of nature preserves, are important to ensure that community facilities
                                                       remain relevant and accessible.
                                                       Planning and construction of new parks and facilities will be guided by the principle
                                                       of equal access, with respect to the location, design and availability of transportation
                                                       options to reach them. New parks, plazas, community facilities and cultural amenities
                                                       will help the City achieve the goal of “walkable” residential neighborhoods and
                                                       sustain its position as a model for public service delivery. This Plan includes a policy
                                                       to use the National Recreation and Park Association standards as guidelines for
                                                       locating and developing new parks. Flexibility is essential, both in the initial layout of
                                                       the space and in its on-going use. New facilities should be designed to allow for
                                                       changing community needs and demographics, particularly as the populations ages.
                                                       The City will also adapt existing parks and facilities to ensure their accessibility and
                                                       inclusivity to all persons, and will improve bicycle, pedestrian and transit provisions
                                                       to reduce reliance on the automobile.
                                                       In addition, the City is committed to providing new facilities in areas that are under-
                                                       served, and in areas where change is expected in the future. For example, access to
                                                       shared open and recreational space will be an important amenity in locations where
                                                       increased housing density is permitted. The principle of equal access and inclusivity
                                                       for all members of the Palo Alto community is an integral part of this commitment.
                                                       Equal access is based on the location of facilities, their design and the availability of
                                                       transportation to reach them.

                                                       The Palo Alto City Library operates five branches that cater to the needs of a wide

author introductions and non-profit shared events. Table C-2 shows the locations of
the branches and a description of the facilities and services they provide.
The Palo Alto City Library has embraced technology to enhance the delivery of
services to the community. The Library website functions as a virtual branch, offering
online reference materials, e-books, audio books, films, music, online training and
practice tests and more. All branches offer well-used self-service check out kiosks.
All five library branches were renovated between 2007 and 2015. The Mitchell Park
Library, completed in 2014, is now the largest branch, with state-of-the-art
equipment and a collection of over 140,000 items, including books in several
languages. Major renovations on the Main Library were also completed in 2014, and
the branch re-opened with a new name—Rinconada Library. The Library now houses
a new program and group study rooms. The City also completed extensive
renovations of the Downtown Branch in 2011 and a seismic retrofit and upgrade of
the College Terrace Branch in 2009, as well as a major expansion of the Children's
Library.
The City Library receives funding from the general fund and fees, supplemented
through the fundraising activities of Friends of the Palo Alto Public Library (FOPAL), a
member-supported non-profit organization, primarily through book sales. The
renovations of the City Libraries were funded from a $76 million general obligation
bond, as well as the Palo Alto Library Foundation, which ceased operations on June
30, 2015.
A RT AND C ULTURE

Art Center and the Lucie Stern and Cubberley Community Centers, host exhibitions,
music and dance classes, concerts, school performances and theater productions, as
well as classes and educational programming for people of all ages. Through the
Cubberley Artist Studio Program (CASP), the City sponsors affordable studio space
for artists, and the Junior Museum and Zoo offers science and nature programming.
The City also supports a Public Art Program and a Public Art Commission.

                                                             The Palo Alto Office of Human Services oversees a grant program which provides
                                                             financial support for a safety net of services to the community, working to enhance

                                                             According to the State Department of Finance, between 2015 and 2030, the
                                                             proportion of seniors in Santa Clara County is projected to grow significantly and the

                                                             trend, it is essential to develop long-term and short-term strategies to deliver the

                                                             human services for all groups are constrained by limited resources. Coordination

The Office of Human Services contracts for after-school care at each of Palo Alto's 12
elementary schools. The City of Palo Alto maintains a register of licensed child care
facilities in the city that serves as a resource for residents. The City also provides child
care subsidy assistance for income-eligible residents administered through Palo Alto
Community Child Care (PACCC), a private group that operates several center-based
facilities in Palo Alto. This subsidy can be used at PACCC-run facilities or at other
child care centers. The City has an Early Care and Education Committee that advises
the City Manager on child care issues. Additionally, the Office of Human Services acts
as a clearinghouse of information on how to open a child care facility in Palo Alto.
Y OUTH AND T EEN S ERVICES
The Community Services Department offers a wide range of services, programs and
facilities for youth and teens through the Recreation Division, and partners with
schools and community organizations to provide access to a broader range of
educational and recreational activities available in Palo Alto. Expanding access to
programs and services that meet the diverse range of interests and vocations among
youth and teens is essential for their healthy development – a priority the City seeks
to foster through a culture of peer-to-peer support and Developmental Asset
building. The City supports teen leadership groups such as the Teen Arts Council,
Recreation Teen Advisory Board and Palo Alto Youth Council, and operates an
afterschool teen center program at Mitchell Park Community Center called The Drop.
The City also supports programs for youth and teens that address developmental
disabilities and teen mental health by partnering with nonprofit and government
agencies that implement community-based mental health support, including
education, suicide prevention and intervention strategies.
S ENIOR S ERVICES
According to the State Department of Finance, Palo Alto has, and is projected to
continue to have, a higher percentage of persons over 60 years of age than almost
any other city in Santa Clara County, and therefore has a greater demand for senior
services than neighboring communities. The City’s Community Services Department
offers an array of services in coordination with community service providers,
including Avenidas, a nonprofit organization that offers a comprehensive range of
services for the independent living, education and enrichment of people ages 50 and
over. Avenidas’ Palo Alto facility provides a central location for the delivery of these
services, as well as a focal point of social activity for seniors. The City also encourages

                                                       Despite significant efforts on the part of public agencies and non-profit organizations,
                                                       homelessness remains a continuing problem in all parts of Silicon Valley. Each year,
                                                       thousands of residents experience an episode of homelessness, including families

                                                       chronically homeless. The transient nature of the homelessness makes tracking the
                                                       unhoused population difficult; however, as many communities in Santa Clara and
                                                       San Mateo Counties share boundaries, the issue of homelessness is best approached
                                                       on a regional basis in coordination with other local jurisdictions and non-profit

Closet located at All Saints Episcopal Church in downtown Palo Alto. Also, Peninsula
HealthCare Connection offers physical and mental health services out of the
Opportunity Services Center.
The City of Palo Alto works to address homelessness by supporting the provision of
services and shelters in the community. The City administers Community
Development Block Grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Services, and has financed the development of different homeless facilities that serve
the local unhoused population.
COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS
Delivering high quality City services with finite fiscal resources requires efficiency and
coordination, along with recognition of changing community needs. Demand for
services like child and senior care, education and recreation continue to grow and
change. Technology has revolutionized the way many services are provided, but has
also added a new level of complexity.
At the same time, the service delivery system itself has changed. Services that were
once exclusively provided by the City may now be provided by another public entity
or by a nonprofit agency or private company. The result of this trend has been a
growing emphasis on partnership and coordination. The only way to achieve
maximum efficiency in City service delivery is to collaborate with other jurisdictions,
avoid duplication of efforts, build coalitions with the PAUSD and enlist the assistance
of businesses and volunteers to supplement City resources.
The City is able to provide a multitude of community services because of strong
partnerships with more than 50 local service organizations and nonprofits, and the
support of active nonprofit arms including the Palo Alto Art Center Foundation,
Friends of the Junior Museum and Zoo, Friends of the Palo Alto Children’s Theatre,
Friends of the Parks and the Palo Alto Recreation Foundation.

  VISION: Palo Alto’s business environment will be dynamic and vital. Businesses
  will have access to a wide array of support services and will enjoy positive
  relationships with Palo Alto residents, officials and City staff. The diverse
  character of Palo Alto will remain, so that the City’s livable neighborhoods are
  protected and enhanced, while its business districts remain competitive and
  attractive. The local economy will thrive, a diverse array of goods and services
  will be provided to Palo Alto consumers, and the City’s historic, mutually
  beneficial relationship with Stanford University supported. Most development will
  occur within Palo Alto’s business employment districts and will be consistent with
  the role and character designated for those districts by this Plan.
INTRODUCTION
The Business and Economics Element addresses economic development policy
issues. It is not a State-required Comprehensive Plan element. Instead, it is an
optional element, but its contents are equally important to those in the mandatory
elements. This Element, informed by local economic conditions and forecasts,
focuses on the role of local businesses in the community and provides mechanisms
for the City to support innovation, entrepreneurship and local-serving retail and
professional services. Its goals emphasize a thriving economy, compatibility and
interdependence with residential neighborhoods, fiscal health, a culture of
innovation and business diversity, flexibility and predictability in City regulations, as
well as attractive, vibrant business centers and business employment districts.
Implementation of this Element will take place over time and will utilize available
planning and regulatory tools, such as the Zoning Ordinance, Coordinated Area
Plans and design review and ongoing outreach by the City to businesses.
Land use topics relevant to the design of retail centers (Goal B-5) and business
employment districts (Goal B-6) are discussed in the Land Use and Community
Design Element. Transportation-related topics, such as employee commutes, the
impact of commute-related congestion on residents and adequate parking, are
addressed in the Transportation Element.

                                                          Since 2010, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the Silicon Valley region has
                                                          experienced nearly a 20 percent increase in the number of jobs. During the same
                                                          period of time, the unemployment rate has decreased to record lows. These trends
                                                          are consistent with broader employment trends in both California and the Bay Area.
                                                          The City is recognized as a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship, with employers
                                                          concentrated in the education, medical, software, technology, biotechnology,
                                                          financial, professional, and government services industries. Major employers in Palo
                                                          Alto include Stanford University, Stanford Health Care, Lucile Packard Children’s

                                                          Hewlett-Packard and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. Each of these companies,
                                                          institutions or agencies employs more than 2,000 persons. The top three employers,
                                                          who are all affiliated with Stanford University, also include employees who work just

                                                          based on approximately 95,000 jobs within the City limits. Stanford Research Park
                                                          contains the largest concentration employees—36 percent—while the University

                                                          important employment areas, each hosting nine percent of the City’s employees.

                                                          Successful businesses and employers are an integral part of a thriving, complete
                                                          community. Local businesses offer many positives, including offering goods and

                                                          Alto’s services. However, Palo Alto has an unusually high concentration of jobs, with
                                                          approximately three times as many jobs (over 100,000) as employed residents
                                                          (about 36,000). This indicates an exceptionally strong local economy, but it has also

Palo Alto, resulting in traffic congestion, air pollution and parking constraints. The
understandable desire of workers to live close to their jobs has driven up the price of
housing dramatically. The resulting high cost of living prevents restaurants, hotels
and others in the service industry from finding sufficient employees. Similarly,
commercial rents have risen precipitously in response to the demand for a Palo Alto
address, driving a conversion of retail spaces to office uses and pricing out smaller
stores and professional services. The City recognizes the importance of providing
affordable housing and efficient transit opportunities for employees of all types of
businesses, as addressed in the Land Use and Community Design, Transportation
and Housing Elements of this Plan.
R ETAIL
Palo Alto is home to a wide array of retail opportunities, from Stanford Shopping
Center, to University Avenue, to small neighborhood-oriented shopping centers.
Currently, retail sales tax provides approximately 5.3 percent of general fund
revenues to the City. Figure B-2 shows the revenue the City received in 2015 from
sales tax (tax imposed on purchases of all goods in the state) and use tax (tax
imposed on all purchases of goods from out-of-state vendors). Of the approximately
$23 million in revenue, over half was generated by Stanford Shopping Center,
Stanford Research Park and Downtown/University Avenue combined. The significant

PLANNING CONTEXT
T HRIVING E CONOMY
The City’s fiscal health and livability depend on maintaining a diverse community of
businesses that are supported by residents, visitors, and workers. The City recognizes
the need for all types of goods and services in the community, including by utilizing
public-private partnerships and supporting non-profit agencies. Additionally,
developing and maintaining advanced communications infrastructure is crucial to
ensuring the City continues to be a viable location for new and established
technology businesses.
I NTERDEPENDENCE
A thriving business environment in Palo Alto is one that complements and supports
the city’s residential neighborhoods and natural environment. The City can help
cultivate interdependence between commercial centers and surrounding
neighborhoods through policies that maintain the natural environment while
minimizing potential impacts on neighborhoods such as traffic and parking.

Palo Alto’s continued fiscal health is crucial to providing the range and quality of
infrastructure, services, amenities and maintenance that residents expect. The key

                                                          increased steadily over the last seven fiscal years (FY), from approximately $478
                                                          million in FY 2009-2010 to about $580 million in FY 2015-2016. This revenue comes
                                                          from diverse sources, from the sale of utilities such as electricity, gas, water and fiber

                                                          However, as illustrated in Figure B-6, Palo Alto’s total revenue has consistently
                                                          outpaced its expenses, by an average of approximately $23 million per fiscal year.

                                                          Palo Alto is a center of innovation within the technology sector. The City plays a key
                                                          role in supporting business growth, including community-serving businesses and

                                                          economic goals. Partnerships and paired research efforts with Stanford University
                                                          have consistently advanced across business sectors.

                                                          The City can support a healthy businesses environment by providing regulations and
                                                          operating procedures that provide business owners and neighbors with predictability
                                                          and certainty through changing economic cycles, while maintaining efficiency and
                                                          adaptability as market conditions change. This could involve streamlining
                                                          administrative and regulatory processes, and simplifying design guidelines for new
                                                          development. The City can act as a facilitator between residents and businesses in
                                                          these processes to help ensure that neighbors, as well as employers, understand
                                                          requirements and know what to expect.

                                                          Palo Alto’s robust retail economy is focused in retail centers, including both regional
                                                          retail draws such as University Avenue/Downtown and Stanford Shopping Center,

                                                          centers like Edgewood Plaza. Regional retail centers employ large numbers of

                                                                                          9
    regional, State and national policy discussions affecting the community. The
    City will work with neighboring communities to address common concerns and
    pursue common interests. The public will be actively and effectively involved in
    City affairs, both at the Citywide and neighborhood levels. Where appropriate,
    the City Council will delegate decision-making responsibilities to local boards
    and commissions. The Council will also assign advisory roles to these bodies as
    well as other community groups. Residents, businesses and elected and
    appointed officials will work collaboratively to address the issues facing the City
    in a timely manner. This inclusive, participatory process will help build a sense of
    community.

  INTRODUCTION
  The Governance chapter of the Comprehensive Plan is a non-mandatory section that
  addresses community involvement and participation in the city planning process. It is
  not an Element of the Plan. The chapter provides background information and
  guidance to citizens and neighborhood groups seeking to participate in this process.
  It also provides guidance to those carrying out the policies and programs in this Plan.
  The chapter is intended as a vehicle for implementation rather than a Plan “element”
  in the traditional and legal sense. Consequently, it is not subject to the State
  requirements for consistency and comprehensiveness that apply to the Elements of
  the Plan.
  The Governance chapter begins by describing the framework within which local
  planning decisions are made. It profiles the City’s governing bodies and major
  departments as well as the funding sources for municipal activities. This sets the
  stage for the goals, policies and programs that follow.

                                                    FRAMEWORK FOR LOCAL DECISION-MAKING
                                                    F ORM OF G OVERNMENT
                                                    Palo Alto was incorporated as a Chartered City in 1909. The City has adopted a
                                                    strong City Council/City Manager form of government. In 2014, residents voted to
                                                    reduce the size of the City Council from nine members to seven, a change effective
                                                    in 2018. Each City Council member serves a four-year term, with a mayor and vice-
                                                    mayor who are elected to one-year terms by their fellow Council members. The City
                                                    Council has three standing committees: the Finance Committee, Policy and Services
                                                    Committee and City/School Liaison Committee. In addition to their legislative duties,
                                                    Council members represent the City on a variety of local, county, regional and
                                                    statewide boards, commissions and other organizations. These include the Santa
                                                    Clara County Cities Association, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
                                                    and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), among others.
                                                    B OARDS AND C OMMISSIONS
                                                    The City Council has created a number of boards and commissions to advise the
                                                    Council on policy issues. With the support of a series of temporary citizen
                                                    committees that advise on specific projects and issues, these standing groups serve a
                                                    variety of specific functions such as development review, protection of historic
                                                    resources and youth relations. The purpose and membership specifics of each board
                                                    and commission are summarized in Table G-1 below.
                                                    P UBLIC P ARTICIPATION
                                                    Palo Alto citizens are highly engaged in the work of the City. There are numerous
                                                    opportunities for public participation in the decisions and policies of local
                                                    government. These range from in-person meetings and community workshops, to
                                                    online technologies to mobile applications. Citizens can serve on boards and
                                                    commissions, as well as issue-specific committees that address programs and
                                                    activities across the City. Every City Council meeting also offers the opportunity for
                                                    citizens to speak about an agenda item or topic and to watch the proceedings on
                                                    their local cable channel.

Palo Alto recognizes the importance of inviting all residents into civic life. In such a
diverse community, it is vital that all citizens feel comfortable participating, regardless
of how long they have lived in Palo Alto, their national or ethnic background, or
whether they rent or own. Palo Alto engages in two-way conversations with citizens
across a variety of accessible technologies, including social media and dedicated
online portals for direct citizen input. There are also a number of City mobile
applications that citizens can download and use to report issues or problems they
would like the City to address. Palo Alto maintains a transparent development review
process that targets predictable outcomes, is user-friendly and invites public
involvement.
Palo Alto continues to seek out new technologies, engagement opportunities and
neighborhood communication programs that will allow interested residents to
engage more effectively in the civic life of the City.

G ROUPS
Palo Alto encourages the formation of programs to support neighborhood
connectedness, civic organizations and volunteer service. Many individuals find the
best way to improve their city is to work at the neighborhood level or to get involved
with a topic they feel strongly about. The City has developed a number of
community-building initiatives that foster strong neighborhoods and build
connections block by block.
Neighborhood organizations are the foundation of civic involvement for many
residents, and provide residents with opportunities to learn about citywide issues on
a localized scale. They also provide a useful means of relaying local priorities and
concerns back to the City Council and others involved in City government. In
addition to neighborhood groups, there are dozens of organizations providing
services in child care, youth and senior activities, local schools, environmental
protection, emergency response and civic engagement.
V OLUNTEERISM
One of Palo Alto’s greatest assets is its highly motivated and talented citizenry.
Residents offer their time and skills to the City in a variety of capacities, ranging from
service on boards and commissions to construction of public improvements to
delivery of services like recreation and elder care. The City is committed to

    exploring innovative, hands-on classroom programs coordinated with local schools.

    The City Council is served by four Council-appointed officers: the City Manager, City
    Attorney, City Clerk and City Auditor. The organization of City departments and their
    major functions is illustrated in the following chart.

    Many issues affecting Palo Alto are best addressed at the regional level, by working
    collaboratively with other cities. Palo Alto believes that it has a responsibility to be an
    active participant in regional problem solving.

B UDGET
The City of Palo Alto’s budget as approved by the City Council reflects resource
allocations consistent with City policies, goals and priorities. It also communicates an
action plan for the upcoming fiscal year to citizens and staff, including program goals
and the standards by which the delivery of services to the public will be measured.
Palo Alto maintains full transparency of its actual and adopted budgets. As part of the
City’s internet-based Open Data Portal, citizens are able to explore and analyze City
expenses and revenues, each broken down by a series of user-selected filters such as
Departments, expense/revenues types, funds and fiscal years. The City’s budgets can
be compared over time and the results downloaded in graphic form.
S TRUCTURES OF D ECISION M AKING
The Palo Alto City Council performs two levels of decision-making: Legislative,
meaning adopting local laws and regulations, and Quasi-Judicial, meaning applying
existing local laws and regulations based on evidence and facts. Legislative decisions
typically affect many different properties; examples include the adoption of a zoning
code update or a Coordinated Area Plan. Quasi-judicial decisions usually affect
individual applications being considered for approval; examples include a
Conditional Use Permit or approval of a subdivision map. Both types of decision-
making must occur within a public forum—Council meetings—and both must be
based “on the record,” meaning Councilmembers are limited in their ability to
receive information outside the hearing.
A third level of City government decision-making is ministerial. Ministerial decisions
are those that can be decided by applying an ordinance or regulation. These are
objective, mandatory decisions to evaluate whether a project or application meets
fixed standards and quantitative measurements; whether, for example, a new
building has an adequate number of fire sprinklers. If a project meets the
requirements, the City must allow it. Most ministerial decisions are made at the staff
level and do not involve noticing or public input.

  The City Council referred this draft chapter to the Planning and Transportation
  Commission for review and recommendation.
IMPLEMENTATION
  VISION: Palo Alto’s Implementation Plan is intended to provide
  an overview of priorities for future actions to accomplish the
  goals of the Comprehensive Plan. It provides a key mechanism
  to link Comprehensive Plan implementation to Palo Alto’s
  budget process, and it will ultimately be a yardstick against
  which Palo Alto can measure its Comprehensive Plan
  accomplishments.
Palo Alto’s Comprehensive Plan will be implemented both through the day-to-day
decisions that rely on its vision, goals and policies, as well as the implementation
programs identified in this chapter. All substantive decisions about development
projects, capital improvements, zoning changes and other plans and policies
affecting land use, transportation and the physical environment will be reviewed for
conformance with this Comprehensive Plan, thus advancing the Plan’s overall vision
and policy framework. To complement the implementation of this plan that will
occur as a review of individual decisions are made, the City has identified a list of
implementation programs intended to provide an overall sense of the priorities for
future actions in support of accomplishing the goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
FORMAT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION TABLE
The following table presents programs the City wants to undertake to help achieve
the goals in the Comprehensive Plan, to the extent that resources are available. The
programs in the Implementation Table describe and prioritize actions to implement
various aspects of the Comprehensive Plan goals and policies. Some programs are
already budgeted and ongoing, while the City Council will need to identify resources
during future budget cycles in order to implement other programs. The Planning &
Transportation Commission may recommend changing priorities or adding or
subtracting programs in the course of their annual review, and staff may likewise

                                                     recommend prioritization or funding during the annual budget process. The City
                                                     Council may change the prioritization of programs through the regular five-year
                                                     review cycle of the Comprehensive Plan’s implementation.
                                                     For each program, the Implementation Table identifies the following:
                                                          Lead Department or Agency: The City Department that would have primary
                                                           responsibility for tracking and completing the program. Note that many
                                                           programs will require collaboration between multiple departments as well as
                                                           outside agencies; collaboration with appropriate parties would be coordinated
                                                           by the Lead Department named in this column.
                                                          Timing: This column identifies the timing for each program. While it would be
                                                           desirable to pursue every program and policy immediately, the
                                                           Comprehensive Plan is a long-range document that will be implemented over
                                                           a number of years and priorities must be established to focus the City's efforts
                                                           and to allocate the City's resources (City Council emphasis, staff time and
                                                           budget resources). With resource constraints and changing circumstances, it is
                                                           expected that the timing identified here may change. For example, as short-
                                                           term programs begin, they will change to “In Progress.” Also, given these
                                                           constraints together with the breadth of programs included, the City
                                                           anticipates and expects that it may not be able to complete all of the
                                                           programs listed within a specified timeframe. Five categories are used:
                                                           •     R: “Routine” activities that are part of the normal course of business for
                                                                 staff;
                                                           •     IP: “In progress” – programs that are already underway to complete a

                                                           •     S: “Short-term” – programs planned for implementation within the first

                                                           •     M: “Medium-term” – typically means programs that would be
                                                                 implemented or completed roughly within five to ten years after
                                                                 Comprehensive Plan adoption; and
                                                           •     L: “Long-term” – programs that would be implemented or completed
                                                                 more than ten years after Comprehensive Plan adoption.
                                                          Anticipated Level of Effort: Gives an order-of-magnitude of cost in terms of
                                                           staff and monetary resources required to implement the program. It is difficult

       to determine the exact cost of most of the programs and the specific staffing
       requirements needed to support the scope of future detailed work plans. In
       general, physical improvements and major planning efforts are the most
       expensive type of investment the City can make; revisions to existing plans or
       studies would likely fall in the middle of the range; and some ongoing staff
       roles, such as providing education or some one-time activities, would be least
       expensive.
RESOURCES
Although Palo Alto would like to implement all programs during the term of this
Plan, there are capital resource and staffing limitations, as well as limitations to the
amount of work that the City and the City Council can focus on effectively during this
period. The completion of actions is contingent upon the availability of funding
resources. Issues that cannot be anticipated may arise in the future that may act to
divert resources from the programs and priorities of the Comprehensive Plan. It is
hoped that by acknowledging and focusing on Comprehensive Plan priorities, the
City can avoid diversion of resources and attention.
REVIEW AND UPDATE
The Comprehensive Plan is a living document. Palo Alto's priorities will evolve
through the life of this Plan, and therefore changes will need to be made to the
Implementation Plan. Annually, as required by State Law and the Municipal Code,
the Planning and Transportation Commission will submit a report to the City Council
on the status of the Comprehensive Plan and its implementation. This review can be
combined with the Commission’s review of the City’s Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), which also occurs on an annual basis.
CONCLUSION
The Implementation Plan was designed to advance the overarching vision and
themes of the Comprehensive Plan. The City recognizes there are resource
constraints and a need to focus those resources.

LOS D
Designates where the level of traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections still
function but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle
during short peaks.
LOS E

stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon at
peak hours, with frequent stopping, longstanding queues and blocked intersections.
LOS F
Represents unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by "traffic jams" and
stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait
through one or more signal changes, and "upstream" intersections may be blocked
by the long queues.

incineration of garbage, mixing and application of fertilizers and pesticides, road
construction, industrial processes such as steel making, mining operations,
agricultural burning (field and slash burning) and operation of fireplaces and
woodstoves. Particulate pollution can cause eye, nose and throat irritation and other
health problems. Particulates are categorized by diameter; PM10 and PM2.5 are
particulate matter with diameters of 10 microns and 2.5 microns, respectively.

                                                    Wildlife Corridor
                                                    A landscape element that serves as a link between historically connected habitats or
                                                    landscapes that are otherwise separated. Wildlife corridors provide avenues along
                                                    which wildlife can travel, migrate and meet mates; plants can propagate; genetic
                                                    interchange can occur; populations can move in response to environmental changes
                                                    and natural disasters; and individuals can re-colonize habitats from which
                                                    populations have been locally extirpated.
                                                    Williamson Act
                                                    Known formally as the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, the Williamson Act
                                                    is a state law designed as an incentive to retain prime agricultural land and slow its
                                                    conversion to urban uses. Each year landowners are offered reduced property tax
                                                    assessments if they agree to not develop their land for the following 10 years. The
                                                    lowered assessments are based on the agricultural use of the land rather than its
                                                    “market value.”
