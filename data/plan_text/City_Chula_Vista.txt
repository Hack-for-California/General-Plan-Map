  1.2 Implementing the Vision and Themes
  The General Plan establishes the vision of the type of community Chula Vista will become. The Growth
  Management Element serves as the assurance that the vision is achieved, without sacrificing the
  quality of life enjoyed in the community. The Growth Management Element establishes a framework
  for directing new development, redevelopment, and community enhancement, and provides the
  guidance to realize the City’s vision.
  A full discussion of our eight Themes is found in Chapter 4 of this General Plan. While the Growth
  Management Element has broad impact, specific focus is placed on the following five Themes:
  Healthy and Sustainable Economy
  Chula Vista continues to expand its local economy by providing a broad range of business,
  employment, and housing opportunities that support an excellent standard of living, and improve the
  ability for residents to live and work locally.

 Strong and Safe Neighborhoods
 Chula Vista is a diverse, yet integrated, community that celebrates its neighborhoods as the building
 blocks that make it a great place to live.
 Healthy and Sustainable Environment
 Residents of Chula Vista cherish the open space and natural resources of our City and continue to
 protect, enhance, and preserve them.
 High Quality Community Services
 Chula Vista places a high priority on exemplary community services and facilities, (such as police and
 fire protection, libraries, and parks and recreation) and continues to ensure that services and
 infrastructure expand to match needs created by growth and redevelopment.
 Effective Growth Management and Plan Implementation
 The City of Chula Vista effectively implements the General Plan’s vision and goals through coordinated
 policies and programs, developed with input from residents and business owners.
 To reflect the vision established by the General Plan, the key points of Chula Vista's Growth
 Management Program are:
       !   Building upon the success of the Growth Management Program as it has been
           implemented since its inception in 1987.
       !   Updating City-wide Threshold Standards to reflect current measurement techniques and
           circumstances.
       !   Implementing new Threshold Standards that recognize differences between redevelopment
           and revitalization areas of western Chula Vista, particularly the Urban Core Area, and other
           areas of the City.
       !   Establishing criteria and techniques that allow additional control of the rate of development
           activity.
       !   Expanding financing programs for infrastructure improvements.
       !   Improving regional and intergovernmental cooperation.

           services provided by the City and/or service agencies can be effectively gauged in a
           manner that will not overextend existing facilities and in order that deficient services may
           be brought up to required and necessary standards.
  1.3 Relation to Other General Plan Elements and Policies
  The Growth Management Element describes the tools to allow the development patterns presented
  in the Land Use and Transportation Element to take place over time. It considers capacities and
  generation rates described in the Public Facilities and Services Element and supporting documents
  to establish Threshold Standards for new development, redevelopment, and revitalization. It
  recognizes the importance of resources described in the Environmental Element and the
  contribution they make to the overall quality of life enjoyed by existing and future residents. Where
  applicable, cross-references are provided in this Growth Management Element to identify where
  interrelationships with other General Plan elements exist.
  1.4 Related Plans and Programs
  1.4.1       Chula Vista Growth Management Program
  The General Plan Growth Management Element provides the policy framework for Chula Vista's
  Growth Management Program. In addition to achieving Threshold Standards and regulating the
  rate of growth, the program includes a systematic application of land use regulation and policies,
  environmental review, financing mechanisms, and monitoring and enforcement functions. These
  components have evolved to ensure that development in the City is balanced with other needs,
  including infrastructure, the quality of life, and open space and financing.
  Table 10-1 summarizes the components of the City's Growth Management Program as it is
  integrated into various local, regional, and state land use planning and development regulation
  programs.

                                       PLANNING FACTORS,
  GM 3.0                               OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
  There are several planning factors involved in achieving the goal of the Growth Management
  Element. Such factors are discussed in Sections 3.7– 3.13 of this element. Each factor has at least
  one objective, or focused goal, and each objective has at least one policy, which describes how the
  City will meet the objectives.
  3.1          Reasons for Growth Management in the City of
               Chula Vista
  The ultimate aim of growth management is to achieve a high “quality
  of life” for existing and future residents throughout Chula Vista. An
  optimum rate of growth provides for a healthy and sustainable
  community. At the core of the Growth Management Program lie the
  Threshold Standards imposed primarily to assure adequate
  infrastructure and services are in place as development occurs, and to
  contrtol the rate of growth.
  3.1.1        Eastern Chula Vista
  During the late 1980s, the City of Chula Vista, in response to rapid development in the eastern
  portion of the City, created a multi-faceted growth management program that assures infrastructure
  and facilities are constructed concurrently with growth. While the methods and details of these
  policies and their implementation have evolved over time, their legacy has resulted in the creation
  of new neighborhoods offering a diversity of housing types and densities, served by well-planned
  and adequate infrastructure and public facilities.
  3.1.2        Western Chula Vista
  Western Chula Vista, with its established neighborhoods and commercial areas, presents the
  challenge of maintaining the existing quality of life while accommodating an increasing density of
  development as redevelopment continues. This challenge of revitalizing existing urban areas,
  maintaining and restoring infrastructure, and sustaining high-quality municipal services can be
  more challenging than achieving infrastructure concurrent with new development. Assuring that
  new development “pays its own way” is relatively straightforward. Maintaining service standards
  and infrastructure in an existing developed area can be considerably more challenging, given the
  financial constraints and other obstacles facing redevelopment and revitalization projects.

                                                                  GROWTH MANAGEMENT
                                                                                     CHAPTER 10
 3.1.3         Growth Management Components
 Chula Vista's Growth Management Program includes two components. The first involves
 establishing minimum Thresholds Standards for providing identified municipal facilities and
 services; the second involves controlling the rate of growth, itself. The reasons for the Growth
 Management Program include: maintaining a healthy fiscal base for the City; assuring qualitative
 project reviews and implementation; providing vibrant and varied neighborhoods; assisting the
 provision of affordable housing; and coordinating with adjacent jurisdictions and other agencies on
 issues that affect quality of life in the region.
 The rate of growth influences the quality of life of the community, and, when excessive, can create
 stress on the community cohesiveness, the loss of a sense of place, and a potential degradation of
 community values caused by rapid increases in population.
 Specific concerns regarding the excessive rate of growth include:
          ·         Avoiding absorption of more than a balanced regional “share” of growth; use of
                    reserved future development areas in advance of projected regional growth.
          ·         Preventing uniformity of design, and lack of product diversity, and corresponding
                    demographic homogeneity.
          ·         Overtaxing municipal operations, including public safety, library, parks, and
                    recreation.
          ·         Lagging municipal revenues because of the lag of income-generating commercial
                    development.
          ·         Developing large areas and its associated infrastructure will lead to simultaneous
                    aging and degradation of housing stock and capital facilities, leading to less
                    efficient maintenance and replacement cycles.
          ·         Losing the opportunity to apply emerging planning principles and building
                    technology.

        Vision                                                                         CHAPTER 10
           2020
  3.1.4       Threshold Standard Review
  The City of Chula Vista's Growth Management Program, originally established in 1987, has
  successfully monitored and managed growth for nearly twenty years. Thresholds established for
  eleven areas affecting the quality of life in Chula Vista, including: traffic; police; fire and emergency
  services; schools; libraries; parks and recreation; water; sewer; drainage; air quality; and economics
  have helped the City maintain a positive image in the face of substantial development. Reviews
  and updates of the Growth Management Program not only look back on past performance, but
  look forward in a formal fashion to understand anticipated development and direct growth and
  services. Reviews and updates allow the City to successfully face challenges associated with
  revitalizing older portions of the City.
  3.1.5       Annual Reporting
  The Growth Management Program uses specific Threshold Standards to analyze the adequacy of
  each facility associated with the eleven quality of life indicators. As part of the Program, the Growth
  Management Oversight Commission (GMOC) receives information annually to determine whether
  compliance is being maintained with each standard for the current time and forecasted condition.
  In addition, project-level reviews incorporate analyses of development impacts on facilities.
  3.1.6       Inter-agency Coordination and Cooperation
  Few of the critical growth management issues facing Chula
  Vista are contained by jurisdictional boundaries. Decisions
  regarding growth and development within the City and the
  planning area will impact regional transportation, air quality,
  water, schools, and other issues. If not coordinated, impacts
  could be felt within the City and the region. Providing
  services that keep pace with growth and development
  requires coordination between City departments, outside
  agencies and service providers. A continuous open dialogue
  regarding growth projections and facility needs ensures the
  best possible outcome for meeting demand.

 3.1.7        Concurrent Public Facilities and Sercvices
                                        Objective - GM 1
 Concurrent public facilities and services.
 Policies
 GM 1.1              Maintain a set of quantitative level-of-service measures (Growth Management
                     Threshold Standards) as a tool to assess the relative impact of new facility
                     and service demands created by growth, and apply those standards, as appropriate,
                     to approval of discretionary projects.
 GM 1.2              Appoint and provide staff support to the Growth Management Oversight
                     Commission, which is authorized to administer the Growth Management
                     Program and to prepare an Annual Growth Management Report.
 GM 1.3              Prepare detailed development forecasts and monitor development activity as it
                     occurs in support of growth management program activities.
 GM 1.4              Provide growth forecasts and related information to City departments and other
                     local government entities and request annual responses regarding their ability to
                     provide services and facilities consistent with the Threshold Standards.
 GM 1.5              As part of the Growth Management Program, conduct an ongoing Development
                     Monitoring Program focused on new development activity and related infrastructure
                     and public facility construction to determine compliance with Threshold Standards
                     and other City policies and programs.
 GM 1.6              Periodically review and revise the Threshold Standards to assure that they reflect
                     current service delivery and measurement techniques and to assure their effectiveness
                     at achieving quality of life goals.
 GM 1.7              Create and periodically update a set of Facility Master Plans for major municipal
                     infrastructure and public facilities.

           2020
  GM 1.8           Adopt and periodically update Development Impact Fee Programs that assure that new
                   development contributes a proportional share of funding for necessary municipal
                   infrastructure and public facilities.
  GM 1.9           Require that all major development projects prepare a Public Facilities Financing
                   Plan (PFFP) that articulates infrastructure and public facilities requirements and
                   costs and funding mechanisms.
  GM 1.10          Provide incentives that make agreements attractive for major development projects.
                   Agreements should be offered when items or concessions are sought that cannot
                   be exacted through zoning and subdivision map requirements.
  GM 1.11          Establish the authority to withhold discretionary approvals and subsequent building
                   permits from projects demonstrated to be out of compliance with applicable
                   Threshold Standards.
  GM 1.12          Establish the authority for the City Council to impose limits on the total amount of
                   development demonstrated to be out of compliance when such development, in
                   aggregate, has or is forecasted to exceed Threshold Standards or otherwise
                   negatively affect quality of life and public health, safety, or welfare of the City.
  GM 1.13          Establish the authority for the City Council to impose limits upon the rate of
                   development, as needed, to assure that development occurs at an optimal rate that
                   does not negatively affect quality of life and public health, safety, or welfare of the
                   City.
  3.1.8       Healthy Economy and Fiscal Base
  Managed and balanced growth is an essential part of sustaining a healthy economy and fiscal
  base in Chula Vista. Growth and related development results in a range of economic benefits
  associated with private and public investment, jobs, and retail sales. At the same time it is
  important for growth to be balanced, assuring long-term fiscal well-being by creating jobs and a
  retail sales base in proportion to new population. A healthy economy and fiscal base also
  requires that investment and development occur throughout the community, not only in newly
  developing areas. As Chula Vista matures, this reinvestment and revitalization will become the
  focal point of community development. New development also requires increased services to be
  provided that will have financial impacts upon the City.

 Provide adequate and sustainable fiscal base.
 Policies
 GM 2.1              Achieve and maintain a balance of land uses within the City that assures
                     residential development is complemented by expanded local employment
                     opportunities, retail and commercial services, and recreation and entertainment
                     venues; and that the City-wide mix of land uses provides fiscal balance between
                     those that produce revenues and those that require public expenditures.
 GM 2.2              Require a Fiscal Impact Analysis to be conducted for major development projects
                     that documents the project's effects upon the City's operating budget over time.
 GM 2.3              Prepare an Annual Fiscal Assessment of the City that considers the soundness of
                     major infrastructure financing programs (e.g., Development Impact Fees) and the
                     future prospects for overall fiscal balance of the City.
 GM 2.4              Consider fiscal effects of Growth Management Program components and balance
                     its fiscal objectives with other community values.
 GM 2.5              Consider establishing a program that controls the rate of residential development
                     as needed to assure a positive fiscal impact of new development and its ability to
                     maintain the quality of life for all the City's residents.
 3.1.9        Vital Neighborhoods
 Vital neighborhoods are a key component of quality of life in Chula Vista. While the Growth
 Management Program focuses upon assuring adequate and concurrent infrastructure and services
 associated with newly developing areas, population growth is occurring throughout the City, due to
 demographic changes and the trend toward redevelopment and revitalization of older developed
 neighborhoods. Thus, the Growth Management Program must increasingly respond to growth in
 the City, regardless of where it occurs, and assure a high quality of life throughout the City.

  GM 3.1     In addition to Facility Master Plans for newly developing areas, the City should
             prepare Facility Master Plans for older neighborhoods of the City that focus upon
             improving their local infrastructure and public facilities.
  GM 3.2     Adapt existing or establish new Threshold Standards to reflect the local
             circumstances and policy objectives for the Urban Core Area, major arterial
             commercial areas, and other portions of the City designated for urban densities.
  GM 3.3     Assure that all new and infill development within existing urban areas pays its
             proportional share of the cost for urban infrastructure and public facilities required
             to maintain the Threshold Standards, as adopted for its area of impact.
  GM 3.4     Create special financing programs and other development incentives that promote
             desirable urban revitalization and redevelopment projects in the Urban Core
             Subarea, major arterial commercial areas, and other portions of the City designated
             for urban densities, in order to fulfill the facility needs of the development in those
             areas while making such development economically feasible and meeting the
             goals and policies of the General Plan and the Urban Core Specific Plan.
  GM 3.5     Allow differential growth rates for portions of the City consistent with local planning
             and redevelopment objectives and City Council objectives.
  GM 3.6     Allow for adjustment of growth rates, as needed, to attract high quality and
             extraordinary cultural, entertainment, recreational, and educational facilities.
  GM 3.7     Consider additional methods to regulate or limit new development that is consistent
             with long-term planning goals and policies, and supports the public health, safety
             and welfare.
  GM 3.8     Encourage the creation of vibrant and varied neighborhoods and a diversity of
             housing types, including, housing affordable to a range of income groups,
             consistent with Housing Element objectives.

                  support their efforts to build and maintain adequate school facilities, and to
                  cooperate in providing recreational facilities to the community.
 3.1.11 Maintaining Applicable Development Threshold Standards
 Threshold standards generally achieve the purpose of assuring that infrastructure and services
 necessary to serve new development are in place in a timely, concurrent manner. As the City
 matures, development occurs in varying patterns and densities. In addition, new ways of
 measuring service standards emerge. To remain relevant to changing development patterns and
 methods of providing services, the Threshold Standards used to measure the adequacy of services
 and facilities must remain flexible and may vary depending upon the location of development.
                                       Objective - GM 5
 Maintain appropriate and applicable Threshold Standards that reflect
 changing development patterns, location of development, and methods of
 providing services.
 Policies
 GM 5.1           Create or modify Threshold Standards in a manner that recognizes emerging
                  urban development and planning policy objectives within western Chula Vista,
                  particularly the Urban Core Area, and other newly emerging urban-density areas.

                                                                                    CHAPTER 10
 GM 5.2              Coordinate with City departments, outside agencies, and service providers to assure
                     that Threshold Standards used to measure effective services and facilities reflect
                     current service delivery and measurement techniques.
 GM 5.3              Require periodic review of Threshold Standards to determine their utility and
                     effectiveness in achieving quality of life goals.
 GM 5.4              Revise and update the Chula Vista Growth Management Ordinance to assure that
                     the Ordinance remains effective and efficient.
 3.1.12 Annual Monitoring of Growth Management Implementation
 To effectively address development impacts, review of growth trends in Chula Vista should be held
 on an annual basis. Annual reviews allow the City to understand actual growth relative to
 projections, facility improvements relative to anticipated projects, and the effectives of service
 standards, in light of actual demand and response.
                                       Objective - GM 6
 Conduct annual reviews of the effectiveness of the Chula Vista Growth
 Management Program.
 Policies
 GM 6.1              Monitor the issuance of building permits and development entitlement in order to
                     determine and forecast the rate of future development.
 GM 6.2              Continue to actively solicit annual responses from the applicable service-providing
                     agencies and City departments to the Growth Management Oversight Commission
                     annual information request in order to judge current Threshold Standard
                     compliance, growth impacts, facility improvements, maintenance issues, and
                     funding opportunities.
 GM 6.3              Maintain a staffing and organizational structure that allows the City to monitor and
                     manage the Growth Management Program.

  3.1.13 Coordinating With City Departments and Outside Agencies
  Chula Vista is an integral part of the greater San Diego metropolitan area. Many issues affecting
  the quality of life of local residents transcend jurisdictional boundaries, such as economic
  conditions, traffic, air quality, open space, and population growth.
                                        Objective - GM 7
  Foster coordination and cooperation between City departments, outside
  agencies, service providers and adjacent jurisdictions.
  Policies
  GM 7.1            Through the development monitoring process pursuant to Policy GM 6.1, produce
                    development forecasts to appropriate City departments and outside agencies so
                    that they periodically update their Facility Master Plans to plan for and provide
                    needed facilities in a timely manner.
  GM 7.2            Participate in regional and sub-regional planning forums, including SANDAG's
                    Regional Comprehensive Plan, or others that may address matters affecting the
                    quality of life in Chula Vista and the San Diego region.
  GM 7.3            Review and comment on development proposals in adjacent communities to
                    minimize potential environmental and economic impacts to Chula Vista.
  GM 7.4            Coordinate residential, commercial, and industrial development timing and phasing
                    with construction in adjacent jurisdictions so as to coordinate the facilitation of
                    appropriate traffic flow, water supply, air quality, sewage disposal, and regional
                    economic balance.
  GM 7.5            Expand use of Memoranda of Understanding and Agreements to coordinate
                    subregional planning in such areas as transportation facilities, schools, parks, and
                    recreation facilities and regional open space.

                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.0
The City of Chula Vista General Plan Housing Element details the City’s seven-year strategy for the
enhancement and preservation of the community’s character, identifies strategies for expanding
housing opportunities for the City’s various economic segments and provides the official policy
guidance for local decision-making related to housing. The Housing Element of the General Plan
provides the implementation mechanisms for effectively addressing housing needs in Chula Vista
throughout the 2013-2020 planning period.
The Housing Element provides in-depth analysis of the City’s population, economic and housing
stock characteristics as required by State law. The Element also provides a comprehensive evaluation
of existing programs and policies of the 2005-2010 Housing Element to determined necessary
revisions to meet current needs. Through this analysis, the City has identified goals, objectives,
policies and program actions the directly address the current needs of Chula Vista’s population.
The Housing Element is organized into four policy components, including:
    •    Introduction – Explains the purpose, process and content of the Housing Element:
    •    Part I: Issues & Opportunities – Describes the key issues and opportunities identified from
         needs assessments and the public participation process upon which the update to the
         Housing Element should focus.
    •    Part II: Policy & Implementation Plan – Details specific policies and programs the City of
         Chula Vista will carry out over the five-year period to address the City’s housing goals.
    •    Part III: Quantified Objectives – Specifies the number of households assisted and housing
         units constructed, rehabilitated, conserved and preserved through the adoption of policies
         and programs.
Additionally, a number of Appendices are included to supplement the development of the Housing
Element’s Policy and Implementation Plan.

A particular emphasis of this Housing Element is addressing the City’s diverse housing inventory and
population and providing a balance of housing opportunities within each of the four planning areas,
Northwest, Southwest, Bayfront and the Eastern Area. The Policy and Implementation Plan provides
focused attention to needs, challenges and opportunities particularly for those economically
disadvantaged populations, given the recessionary economy and the limited financial resources
available to the City as a result of the elimination of Redevelopment statewide and its Low and
Moderate Income Housing funds, the majority of the resources previously available to the City’s
Redevelopment Agency. The Plan focuses on leveraging resources

1.0                  COMMUNITY CONTEXT
Who We Are
Once the largest lemon growing center in the world, Chula Vista has rapidly
grown, developed, and expanded to become one of the nation’s fastest
growing cities. Of cities with a population over 100,000, Chula Vista had the
eight fastest growth percentage rate nationally since the 2000 U.S. Census.
Initially incorporated in 1911, much of the City’s historical growth and
development traces back to World War II and the relocation of Rohr
Aircraft Corporation to Chula Vista in early 1941. The presence of
Rohr along the City’s Bayfront and the post-WWII boom brought to
Chula Vista extraordinary population growth and demands for
housing, roads, schools, public services, and retail services (e.g., shops,
restaurants, markets, banks, etc.) to the City’s historic core, east of the
Bayfront and west of First Avenue.
Over the next several decades, California’s continued rate of
population growth and housing production, coupled with Chula Vista’s regional and waterfront
location between the Mexican border and downtown San Diego, spurred the City’s outward
expansion and development to the east (east of Interstate-805). In 1985, residents of the
unincorporated Montgomery area voted to become part of the Chula Vista, adding approximately
23,000 new residents. During the late 1980’s and 1990’s, Rancho del Rey, Eastlake and other master
planned communities began to develop in the East. In 1992, the City annexed 14 square miles of
Otay Ranch for future development.
Now home to nearly a quarter-million residents, Chula Vista is the second largest city in San Diego
County. The City encompasses approximately 52 square miles of land area from the San Diego Bay
eastward to Otay Lakes and includes most of the land between the Sweetwater River to the north and
the Otay River to the south. The bayfront, rivers, hills define the City’s planning area. Located minutes
from downtown San Diego and the U.S.-Mexican border Chula Vista has convenient access to the
region’s cultural, recreational, educational and business opportunities.
                                                                                    Page H-1

                                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                        INTRODUCTION
Chula Vista will continue to play a significant role in the region’s
growth and is emerging as the hub of civic and cultural activity
in South San Diego County. As one of the fastest growing cities
in the nation with its picturesque backdrops and inviting climate,
Chula Vista is a city whose growth is ripe with opportunities for
both growing businesses and growing families.

Legislative Authority
A Housing Element is based on legal requirements
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal. Recognizing the important part
that local planning programs play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities
and counties prepare a Housing Element as part of their comprehensive General Plans (California
Government Code Section 65580 et al.).
The City of Chula Vista adopted the previous housing element for 2005-2010 in October 2006. State
law requires each jurisdiction’s Housing Element be updated at least every five years to reflect a
community’s changing housing needs. Senate Bill 575 adjusted the deadline for adoption of local
jurisdiction housing elements in the San Diego region. The adjusted deadline occurs eighteen (18)
months following the adoption of the 2050 Regional Transportation Plan, which occurred on October
28, 2011. Therefore, housing elements in the San Diego region are required to be completed, with a
finding of compliance by HCD, by April 27, 2013. This document represents the 2013-2020 update
required for jurisdictions within the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) region and
responds to the issues that currently face the City.

                    HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
4.0                 PROCESS
Come and tell us what’s on your mind
The City of Chula Vista has identified community participation as a priority in the planning process.
The Housing Element is representative of the desires of the local residents and addresses the
concerns most important to the community both now and in the future. Additionally, the State of
California requires local governments make diligent efforts to involve all economic segments of the
population in the development of the Housing Element. The public’s input and participation in the
Housing Element Update process is key to ensuring a shared vision and strategy for the City.
During the preparation of the Housing Element, community involvement included a presentation
before the City’s Housing Advisory Commission, a housing stakeholder meeting, three community
workshops, and implementation of a Housing Needs Survey. Meetings and presentations focused on
(1) informing the community of past and existing efforts to address previously identified housing
needs, identified housing needs based on current demographics and anticipated resources and (2)
hearing from the community their top priorities in terms of housing needs by income group or
targeted population and to identify/refine possible housing policies/programs to address the specific
needs and any geographical/locational considerations. A Housing Needs Survey was made available
in both English and Spanish to identify types of affordable housing needed, priorities for special
needs groups, priority housing programs to address affordable housing needs in the community,
location of emergency housing, and any perceived constraints to housing.          Responses from the
community guided the Needs Assessment portion of the Housing Element, as well as the Housing
Policy and Implementation Plan (Part II of this Element).
Opportunities for public participation throughout the Housing Element process include, or will include
the following components:

                      STATE LAW AND LOCAL PLANS
5.0
5.1 Consistency with State Law
The Housing Element is one of seven elements of the General Plan mandated by the State of
California, as articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California Government Code. State Law
requires that a jurisdiction’s Housing Element consist of “an identification and analysis of existing
and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled
program actions for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The Housing
Element is responsive to the need of providing housing for all segments of the population.
Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth specific requirements regarding the scope and
content of each Housing Element. Table Intro-1 summarizes these requirements and identifies the
applicable section in the 2013-2020 City of Chula Vista Housing Element where these requirements
are addressed.

5.2 Consistency with General Plan and Policies
The Housing Element of the General Plan is one component of the City’s overall long-range planning
strategy. The California Government Code requires that General Plan contain an integrated, consistent
set of goals and policies. The Housing Element, is therefore, affected by policies contained in other
elements of the General Plan.
The Housing Element is most intricately related to the Land Use and Transportation (LUT) Element.
The LUT Element sets the framework for development of housing by laying out the land designations
for residential development and indicating the type and density permitted by the City. Working within
this framework, the Housing Element identifies priority goals, objectives and program actions for the
next eight years that directly address the housing needs of Chula Vista existing and future residents.
The policies contained in other elements of the General Plan affect many aspects of life that residents
enjoy – the amount and variety of open space, the preservation of natural, historic and cultural
resources, the permitted noise levels in residential areas, and the safety of the residents in the event
of a natural or man-made disaster.
The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan Elements
and the policies and programs in this Element reflect the policy direction contained in other parts of
the General Plan (See Appendix F). As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, this
Housing Element will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
5.3 Relationship to Other City Plans and Policies
The Housing Element identifies priority goals, objectives, policies and action programs for the next
eight years that directly address the housing needs of Chula Vista. These are briefly described below
and include the City’s Municipal Code, Specific Plans, General Development Plans, Sectional Planning
Area Plans, Precise Plans, and Redevelopment Plans and the Local Coastal Program Plan.
5.3.1 Chula Vista Municipal Code
The Chula Vista Municipal Code (CVMC) consists of all the regulatory and penal Ordinances and
certain administrative Ordinances of the City, codified pursuant to the provisions of Sections 50022.1
through 50022.8 and 50022.10 of the Government Code. The CVMC includes the City’s Subdivision
Ordinance and Zoning Ordinance, including the Growth Management Ordinance.

                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                INTRODUCTION
Subdivision Ordinance
The Subdivision Ordinance regulates the design, development and implementation of land division.
It applies when a parcel is split into two or more parcels; a parcel is consolidated with one or more
parcels; or the boundaries of two or more parcels are adjusted to change the size and/or
configuration of the parcels.
Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan, and is designed to
protect and promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of
the people. It includes a zoning map designating various districts that are described in the text of the
document and outlines the permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited uses for each zone
district. Finally, the Zoning Ordinance provides property development standards for each zone district
and overall administrative and legislative procedures.
5.3.2 Specific Plans
Specific Plans are customized regulatory documents that provide focused guidance and regulations
for a particular area. They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan, infrastructure plan,
zoning classifications, development standards, design guidelines, phasing plan, financing plan and
implementation plan. Chula Vista has seven approved Specific Plans, which are listed below.
            Bayfront Specific Plan
            Gateway Specific Plan
            Auto Park North Specific Plan
            Bonita Glen Specific Plan
            Bonita Gateway Specific Plan
            Urban Core Specific Plan
            Southwest Specific Plan (under preparation)
5.3.3 General Development Plans
A General Development Plan (GDP) is a smaller scale version of a General Plan that typically
addresses large, previously undeveloped areas of the City, such as those in eastern Chula Vista. It
establishes general development parameters, including the distribution of land uses, vehicular
circulation patterns, development densities, and an overall master planned community urban
structure. A GDP is implemented by the adoption of a Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plan. The City
has six GDPs, which are discussed further in the Land Use and Transportation Element Section 10.0,
East Area Plan, of this Element. GDPs must be in conformance with the General Plan.
                                                                               Page H-17

                                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                              INTRODUCTION
5.3.4 Sectional Planning Area Plans
A Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plan is a comprehensive master plan that addresses a portion of a
planned community area. It is intended to implement the goals, objectives, and development
parameters prescribed in the GDP. A SPA and GDP must be adopted as a prerequisite to develop
land in a Planned Community (PC) Zone.
A SPA consists of integrated guidelines and development standards that provide detail on the land
use mix, design criteria, pedestrian and vehicular circulation pattern, open space, recreation,
infrastructure requirements, and other components for the entire or portion of an adopted GDP. It is
based on City regulations, guidelines, and policies; but once adopted, a SPA supersedes these
documents, except where incorporated by reference.
5.3.5 Precise Plans
A Precise Plan is a zoning implementation tool that creates specific property development standards
and design guidelines in combination with underlying zone standards to allow site design flexibility
within areas zoned as a Precise Plan modifying district. Precise Plan development standards and
guidelines, adopted by Ordinance, can be tailored for a particular area through rezoning action. The
Precise Plan is adopted through a discretionary review process that establishes standards and
guidelines affecting the property.
5.3.6 Local Coastal Program
A Local Coastal Program (LCP) is the planning tool used to carry out the shared partnership between
the California Coastal Commission’s (CCC) mandate to protect coastal resources, and local
government’s regulation of land use through its General Plan. An LCP includes a land use plan with
land use classifications, types and densities of allowable development, plus goals, objectives, and
policies concerning development use of coastal resources. After an LCP is approved by the CCC, their
permitting authority is delegated to the local government. It is not intended that the CCC and their
permitting authority usurp local government.
Chula Vista’s Bayfront has an LCP, which contains the goal and objectives relating to coastal
development. It is provided by the General Plan Land Use Diagram and the associated goals,
objectives and policies that relate to coastal area.

                    HOUSING ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
6.0
California Government Code Section 65583 requires a jurisdiction’s Housing Element to include the
following components:
        A review of the previous element’s goals, policies, programs, and objectives to ascertain the
         effectiveness of each of these components, as well as the overall effectiveness of the Housing
         Element;
        An assessment of housing need and an inventory of resources and constraints related to
         meeting these needs;
        An analysis of programs for the preservation of assisted housing developments;
        A statement of community goals, quantified objectives and policies relative to the
         maintenance, preservation, improvement and development of housing; and,
        A policy program that provides a schedule of actions that the City is undertaking, or intends
         to undertake, in implementing the policy set for in the Housing Element.
The Chula Vista Housing Element is organized into four parts, including:
Introduction                           Explains the purpose, process and contents of the Housing
                                       Element
I.   Issues & Opportunities            Describes the key issues and opportunities identified from needs
                                       assessment and the public participation process upon which
                                       the update to the Housing Element should focus.
II. Policy & Implementation            Details specific policies and programs the City of Chula Vista
     Plan                              will carry out over the five-year period to address the City’s
                                       housing goals.
III. Quantified Objectives             Specifies the number of households assisted and housing units
                                       constructed, rehabilitated, conserved and preserved through the
                                       adopted policies and programs.
                                                                                Page H-19

                                                                                  INTRODUCTION
                     FOCUS OF 2013-2020 HOUSING
7.0                  ELEMENT
As of 2012, the City of Chula Vista encompasses approximately 52 square miles within its
boundaries. Over time, it has evolved into varying and distinct neighborhoods and communities.
Chula Vista’s communities can be distinguished by the west and east areas of the City and more
specifically into four distinct planning areas within the west and the east.
Initially incorporated in 1911, much of the City’s historical growth and development centered around
the historic City center also known as the urban core. Therefore, City’s older and more established
neighborhoods are generally located west of Interstate-805.            Over the next several decades,
California’s continued rate of population growth and housing development spurred Chula Vista’s
outward expansion and development to the east (east of Interstate-805), including the development
of such master planned communities as Otay Ranch, Eastlake, Rancho del Rey, and Sunbow.
The City’s communities can be further distinguished by geographic planning areas that follow the
overall development patterns of the City.
         Northwest – That area north of L Street and east of Interstate 5, also referred to as the City’s
          historic urban core;
         Southwest – That area south of L Street, generally encompassing those neighborhoods
          included within the Montgomery annexation of 1985;
         East – That area east of Interstate 805, generally encompassing master planned communities
          developed from the early 1990’s; and,
         Bayfront – That area west of Interstate-5 and north of L Street, currently underdeveloped with
          some development and large vacant waterfront properties.
Figure Intro-3 identifies the four designated geographic planning areas.
For the purpose of this Element, the City of Chula Vista focuses on each of the four geographic
planning areas to target appropriate programs and activities given their unique physical, economic,
and cultural characteristics. By utilizing a geographic focus area approach, the City is able to
implement programs that better address the growing needs of the Chula Vista community.
                                                                                 Page H-21

                                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                            INTRODUCTION
While the Bayfront is included within the four geographic planning areas, this area is currently
underdeveloped with some development and a large amount of vacant waterfront properties. A
master plan for the Bayfront was approved by the California Coastal Commission in August 2012.
During this planning period it is expected that housing policies and programs will be initially limited
to planning activities with new development opportunities occurring towards the later part of the
planning period.

A significant focus of the previous Housing Element was ensuring a balance of housing
opportunities city wide particularly in light of the market conditions at the time that anticipated
significant growth city wide at higher price points than had previously been experienced. Under the
prevailing market conditions at that time and the availability of vast undeveloped lands in the East,
the private market was able to respond to the housing needs of moderate- and upper-income
households. The City’s efforts were focused on production of housing for lower-income households
through the implementation of the City’s Balanced Communities Affordable Housing Program
requiring a minimum of 5% of the total new units constructed (for projects of 50 or more units) for
Low-Income affordable housing, primarily in the East, and other incentive programs. Within the
older neighborhoods of the Northwest and Southwest Planning Areas, policies and programs were
focused on the preservation and maintenance of housing and neighborhoods and revitalization of
these areas with newer development.
Although eastern Chula Vista has developed significantly in the past decade and the supply of
developable land is decreasing, most new development in Chula Vista during the 2013-2020 time
period will continue to be in that area of the City. It continues to be one of the most important
sources of vacant land for new housing inventory in San Diego County. The City’s General Plan
Update and the adoption of the Urban Core Specific Plan give particular focus to increasing
residential densities and capacities that could provide additional opportunities for future production
and preservation of affordable housing in urbanized parts of the Northwest and Southwest planning
areas. (Appendix C, Housing Resources, describes land availability for meeting future housing
needs.)
Chula Vista’s significant role in accommodating the region’s housing need and growth over the past
five to six years is evidenced through the production of new housing. While possessing just over 1%
of San Diego County’s land area and having a little more than 7% of the County’s population, Chula
Vista has accommodated from approximately 18% to almost 25% of new housing development and
population growth within San Diego County over the past several years. As indicated by SANDAG’s
current 2050 forecast, Chula Vista will continue to play an important role in providing housing supply
within the region.
The City’s ability to continue to provide new affordable rental and for-sale housing opportunities will
become more challenging under current economic conditions and with dwindling financial resources
to provide needed assistance. Challenges to providing for affordable housing may include the
tightening of capital for construction, availability of permanent financing, and the loss of
Redevelopment Low and Moderate Income Housing Set-aside funds. Policies and programs of the 2013-
2020 Housing Element were developed to primarily address the challenges associated with a lack of
financial resources to address housing needs.
A full discussion of the City’s five-year strategy for housing production, conservation, and preservation
is presented in Part II of this Element.

                     OVERVIEW:
1.0                  KEY ISSUES & APPROACH
                                                                               “The past 5
Marking its 100th anniversary as a City in 2011, Chula Vista has expanded      years have seen
by ten times in area, and transitioned from an agricultural community to a     a drastic decline
rapidly changing, more urban place. It has become one of California’s 15
                                                                               in housing

During the housing boom of the early 2000’s, the City saw rapid change         mounting
with tremendous growth experienced in the master planned communities           foreclosures
east of I-805. The current economic recession has tempered housing             and cautious
growth and has seen a dwindling of financial resources available to            lenders, making
residents and the City. The current economic conditions and their
implications to the City’s housing policies are evident during this update of  it harder for
the Housing Element.                                                           buyers to get

More specifically, the Chula Vista community, City policymakers, and staff
identified two key interrelated housing issues which the Housing Element update should focus given
the recessionary economy, plagued by lack of financial resources, high unemployment rates and
increasing foreclosures. These issues are:
(1) A greater need exists to preserve and expand affordable housing opportunities for those existing
    extremely low- and very low-income households, particularly for those most vulnerable
    populations such as the homeless, seniors, and the disabled ; and
(2) In addressing these needs, there are opportunities to revitalize, reuse, and enhance existing
    resources available and to look at new collaborations to leverage resources to benefit those in
    need of housing but also for the economic benefit of residents and the community.

The Policy and Implementation Plan of this Housing Element, (see Part II), aims to provide the City
and the residential development community with policy and program tools that address these issues.
The City’s efforts will be concentrated in preserving and enhancing single family housing and
neighborhoods, promoting balanced and diverse housing, and looking at City government’s role and
processes to facilitate residential development.

                    COMMUNITY FACTORS
2.0
In order to develop a comprehensive strategy to preserve and expand housing for very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households and address development challenges, it is important to understand the
needs of residents, the current real estate market and the existing housing stock. An overview of
these factors follows and includes highlights of the City’s demographics and housing characteristics.
A more detailed analysis of demographic characteristics and needs are provided in Appendix A of
this Element.
2.1 The Growing Need
Based upon population projections, it is expected that the region’s population will continue to
expand; further impacting the demand on housing by both existing and future households. Currently
home to an estimated 243,916 people (2010 U.S. Census), it is anticipated that Chula Vista’s
population will grow to approximately 330,381 by 2050. More housing is needed to accommodate
Chula Vista and the region’s future growth projections.
2.2 Higher Housing Costs and a Lack of Affordability
As a result of the growing demand and lack of sufficient supply, the cost of owning and renting a
home is beyond the ability of many households to pay. The San Diego region is routinely ranked as
one of the top ten areas with the highest priced and least affordable homes in the nation by both the
National Association of Realtors (NAR) and National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). Housing
prices have been in a downward trend for the past few years, and the median sales price for a home
in Chula Vista dropped about 8 percent from 2010 to 2011. Despite this trend, the median sales price
for a home in Chula remains unaffordable for very-, and low-income households in Chula Vista.
The lack of affordable homes within Chula Vista and the San Diego region is causing many,
irregardless of income level, to seek housing far from their jobs with some even moving outside of
the region to South Riverside County and the Tijuana border region. Others are forced to pay more
than their incomes can afford and/or forced to move into overcrowded or unsafe/unsanitary housing
conditions.
                                                                             Page H-27

                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                              PART I
2.2.1        Homeownership
In years past, Chula Vista’s housing market offered some of the more affordable housing prices as
compared to other areas of San Diego County. Today, housing costs in Chula Vista are still beyond
the affordability of a majority of San Diego households, with the median sales price in October 2011
at $308,000, representing a decrease of nearly 8 percent from 20101. To afford this median sales
price, a worker would need to earn at least $88,000 a year or $46 an hour (based upon 3 ½ times
their annual income). With the current median income for Chula Vista residents at $66,246 a year,
most residents would be unable to “afford” the median priced home (see Figure I-1).
California has traditionally been a higher cost area in the nation. The high cost of housing is
evidenced by City’s homeownership rates. Reflective of the higher costs in California, in 2010, the
City’s homeownership rate was 58 percent, compared to national average of 65 percent. On a
regional basis and Statewide basis, the Citywide homeownership rate at 58 percent is comparable to
the 54 percent for the San Diego County region and 56 percent for California.
In Western Chula Vista, the homeownership rate falls significantly lower when compared to the City,
regional and California homeownership rates. Only 42 percent of the housing is owner-occupied.
Based upon current sales data, for-sale housing in Chula Vista is not affordable to most lower-
income households. Those households with incomes substantially above moderate- income (greater
than 120 percent of County Median Income) can more readily afford current sales prices within
Chula Vista. With such a large gap between what a household can “afford” to pay and current
housing prices, for-sale housing does not provide a financially feasible alternative opportunity for very
low- and low-income households with more limited incomes.

2.2.2       Rental Housing
Rental housing is also out of reach for many, particularly very low-income households. According to
the Fall 2011 rental survey by the San Diego Apartment Association, the average monthly rent for a
two-bedroom apartment in Chula Vista was $1,222, a slight decrease from 2010 at $1,251. Although
average rents have dropped, rental housing remains unaffordable to many of Chula Vista’s
households. To afford the rent for an average two-bedroom apartment, a household with one or two
children would need to earn about $43,992 a year or $23 an hour. In Chula Vista, approximately 39
percent of the households would be unable to afford this rent based upon earnings of less than
$49,000 per year (see Figure I-2). Two minimum wage workers combined earn just $16.00 an hour or
about $30,720 a year.
Rental units in Chula Vista are only affordable to households at the very top of the income range for
low-income households and moderate-income households. Despite these slightly high costs, rental
housing presents the most financially feasible opportunity to provide affordable and suitable housing
for very low- and low-income residents.
                                                                              Page H-29

                                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                            PART I

                        Average Rent vs. Affordable Cost for Very Low Income Households
The high demand for rental housing is evidenced by the City’s rental vacancy rates. The estimated
vacancy rate for all housing units in the San Diego County region as 2010 was 7.9 percent2 , while
the City of Chula Vista averaged 4.9 percent. The industry standard for a “healthy” vacancy rate is
approximately 4 to 6 percent. Lower vacancy rates largely influence increases in rental rates. Chula
Vista’s low vacancy rate suggests an unmet demand for housing and means that renters looking for
housing may have difficulty finding it in Chula Vista or pay a higher rent.
2.2.3          Overpayment and Overcrowding
Higher housing costs force households to pay more than they can afford (overpayment) or to double
up in housing units (overcrowding) to make the housing more affordable. When households overpay
for housing, less money is available for discretionary spending and necessities, such as food,
childcare, healthcare, and maintenance of the home. Households may choose to live in
inappropriately sized units that do not meet the needs of the household (i.e. overcrowding) to reduce
their housing expenses.
Overpayment is defined as households that pay more than 30 percent of their gross income on
housing related expenses, with more significant overpayment at 50 percent of their income.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 25 percent of Chula Vista’s households paid more than 50
percent of their income towards housing costs. Overpayment was more prevalent in renter-occupied
households (63 percent) than owner-occupied households (46 percent).

                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                              PART I
As a result of rising housing costs, lower-income households are often forced to double up
households in one unit, which may result in overcrowding. Overcrowding is defined as households
having an average of more than 1 person per room, with households considered to be severely
overcrowded having more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding puts a strain on public facilities
and services, reduces the quality of the physical environment, and can eventually cause conditions
that contribute to a more rapid deterioration of the housing stock. Eight percent of Chula Vista
households were considered overcrowded in 2010. Of the overcrowded households, a majority were
renter-occupied (83 percent) compared with owner-occupied households (17 percent).
Overcrowding and overpayment are more prevalent in renter occupied households with very low- and
low-income levels. With the continuing weak economy and California’s high jobless rate, it is
anticipated that more households are overpaying for housing today and households are doubling up
in order to afford current housing costs. Policies and programs aimed at maintaining and increasing
the number of rent restricted housing will assist in decreasing the number of households overpaying
for housing and reduce incidents of overcrowding.
2.3 Who Are Our Residents
Chula Vista is the second largest city in San Diego County and
continues to surpass the rate of growth in the County and the State.
Chula Vista is a community with a growing and diverse population. By
understanding our diversity and basic demographic characteristics, City
policies and programs can be developed to better accommodate these
various needs.
2.3.1        Racial Diversity
Chula Vista’s population is ethnically diverse. Approximately, 60 percent of Chula Vista residents
identified themselves to be of Hispanic or Latino origin, and fourteen percent of Asian origin.
                                                                               Page H-31

                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                              PART I
2.3.2       Age
The estimated average age in Chula Vista is 34.3 years. According to the
2010 Census, a majority (59 percent) of the City’s population were
between the ages of 21 to 64. Children and teens aged 0-20 years
comprised 31 percent of the population, and seniors, 65 and over,
represented 10 percent of the City’s population.
A major shift in the age structure of the City’s population is forecasted
over the next 20 years. By 2030, the forecasted average age is over 40 and the San Diego region is
expecting a decline in the growth of age groups below 55, while all age groups above 55 will
increase. Specifically, the western portion of Chula Vista is forecasted to experience a higher increase
in the 55-74 year old age group as compared to the region. According the U.S. Census American
Community Survey 1 year estimates, approximately 7 percent of
householders over the age of 65 in Chula Vista were living below the
poverty level in 2010. The provision of housing opportunities to serve this
growing population group, including rental housing and home repair and
modifications, will be needed in the future.
2.3.3       Special Needs–Persons with Disabilities
In addition to the age of the population, another important characteristic of the population are those
with special needs, including individuals with physical, emotional, or psychological disabilities. The
U.S. Census reports that 6 percent of Chula Vista’s population has a disability. New housing
opportunities should consider accessibility and adaptability to accommodate those with disabilities
and mobility limitations. Rehabilitation and repair programs should encourage modifications of
existing housing to enhance accessibility.

                                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                          PART I
2.3.4        Household Size
The City’s average household size is increasing. In 2010, Chula
Vista’s average household size was 3.21 persons per household,
increasing from 2.99 persons per household in 2000.               In
comparison, San Diego County had an estimated household size of
2.75 in 2010. With growing household sizes and overcrowding
experienced by many Chula Vista residents, where feasible given
the limited resources available, policies should encourage the
maintenance and provision of large family housing (3 or more
bedrooms).
2.3.5        Very Low–and Low-Income Households
In 2010, about 43 percent of the households living in Chula Vista reported an annual income of at
least $75,000 which falls into the low-income category (51-80 percent of the County median income.
Of these households, 25 percent reported incomes of less than $34,999 a year, which falls into the
very low- (less than 50 percent of County Median Income).
With a significant number of Chula Vista residents characterized as very low- and low-income,
preserving and increasing affordable housing is encouraged to meet the needs of many in the Chula
Vista community. The disparity in income from the East to the West, a median income of $86,032 to
$47,969, also suggests that greater efforts are needed to promote a balance of housing opportunities
throughout the City to avoid enclaves or concentrations of lower income households.

2.4 What Housing is Available
To provide for adequate and suitable housing to meet the needs of existing and future Chula Vista
households, it is important to understand what type of housing units are currently available in the
City and evaluate current and future trends for the provision of a variety of housing types.
2.4.1       Housing Unit Type
The U.S. Census reported a total of 79,416 housing units in the
City of Chula Vista in 2010. Of Chula Vista’s housing units, 74
percent were single family (detached and attached) and 29
percent multifamily. In Western Chula Vista, 48 percent of the
housing units were single family, 41 percent were multifamily,
and 11 percent were mobile-homes. In the East, the housing
market is predominated by single-family housing (83 percent).
By encouraging more diverse and balanced housing through
new construction opportunities in eastern Chula Vista and opportunities for intensification of existing
properties in the western built out area, the city is better able to provide opportunities for all income
levels, household sizes and types throughout.

Page H-34       City of Chula Vista General Plan

                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                            PART I
2.4.2       Large Family Units
Units with a large number of bedrooms (comprising of 3 or more bedrooms) are primarily found in
single family owner-occupied units. Approximately 74 percent of owner-occupied units had 3 or more
bedrooms compared to 38 percent of renter-occupied units with 3 or more bedrooms. The lack of
units with a large number of bedrooms, especially for rental housing limits housing choices for large
families and can contribute to overcrowding.
2.4.3       Age of Housing
In Chula Vista, 15 percent of the City’s housing units were built prior to 1960, and approximately 47
percent of housing units were built prior to 1980. Due to the development patterns of the City, most
housing built in Eastern Chula Vista was more recent (91 percent since 1980), while 68 percent of
housing in the West was built before 1980. This statistic indicates that substantial rehabilitation or
replacement of housing in the Western portion of the City may be needed in the next twenty-five (25)
years.

It is expected that market and development trends will continue in this planning period, and that
much of the new residential development constructed in the East Planning Area by the private
market will be affordable to the above-moderate income sector. The City’s efforts will focus increased
attention on the housing needs of very- low-, low- and moderate-income households, which are not
typically addressed by the private market.
Policies and programs of this Housing Element focus on the strategic use of the City’s limited
resources to encourage new housing choices and preserving existing housing to promote diversity
and a balance of housing choice.

 3.1 Available Financial Resources
 Providing affordable housing for lower and moderate income households requires the creative
 layering of multiple funding sources. In years past, the City’s main financial resource available to
 support housing activities was its Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Funds, at least 20 percent of
 collected redevelopment funds were set aside and held in a low- and moderate-income housing
 fund. The City’s redevelopment project areas generated an annual contribution of approximately
 $3,000,000 for affordable housing. As of February 1, 2012, the Redevelopment Projects Areas were
 dissolved pursuant to AB1X26. This resource is no longer available to the City for implementing its
 affordable housing programs.
 The key funding sources available to the City of Chula Vista for affordable housing consist of its
 entitlement allocation from the federal Community Development Block Grant program, HOME
 Investment Partnership, and Emergency Shelter Grant. Implementation of the City’s affordable
 housing programs and funding of housing activities will rely on its annual allocation of HOME
 program funds anticipated to be $590,000 for direct housing opportunities (minus administrative
 expenses at 5 percent of the allocation).

3.2 Housing Policies & Programs
The following is a partial list of these policies and programs, specified in greater detail in Part II of the
Housing Element. Implementation of these programs will based upon the availability of funding and
priorities established.

The loss of the affordability of these units as a result of conversions
to market rate prices would impact the current residents of these
communities and decrease the availability of affordable housing in
the city. The preservation of these units, when financially feasible
and practical, is needed to maintain an adequate supply of
affordable housing opportunities.

New Rental Housing Opportunities
The City will initiate efforts that expand rental housing opportunities for
very low- and low-income households.                                                “Rental housing

The disparities in household income and housing stock that currently exist between the East and

The City will initiate efforts to promote homeownership opportunities in areas with significant rental
housing to provide a diverse and balanced housing stock and encourage neighborhood stability.

with so much invested, homeowners contribute to neighborhood
stability and are more likely to be advocates for quality of life issues,
such as reducing crime, childhood education and
neighborhood upkeep.
Chula Vista’s overall homeownership rate of 58 percent is
slightly higher than San Diego County (54.4 percent).
However, in Western Chula Vista the rate is lower at 42
percent, than the citywide rate. Lastly, homeownership
opportunities are now slipping out of reach of even
moderate-income households. The City’s efforts to increase
homeownership opportunities will focus primarily in the
Northwest and Southwest Planning Areas of the City and
promoting homeownership for moderate-income households.

                   OVERVIEW:
1.0                POLICY & IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
This section of the Housing Element describes the “Plan of Action” the City of Chula Vista will
implement during the 2013-2020 planning period to implement its Vision and Themes, address the
community’s present and future housing needs, and meet the specific requirements of State law. In
developing the goals, objectives, policies, and programs described in this Plan, the City assessed its
housing needs, evaluated the performance of existing programs, and received input from the
community through participation in housing workshops and a housing needs survey.
The Policy and Implementation Plan establishes three primary goals that guide the policy program
toward providing housing opportunities for Chula Vista residents. These goals are:
Goal 1:     A Maintained and Enhanced Housing Stock and Neighborhoods;
Goal 2:     Housing Opportunities that Meet the City’s Diverse Needs; and,
Goal 3:     Maximized Funding and Implementation of Services Vital to Community Housing Needs.
 To realize these goals, the Policy and Implementation Plan details objectives, policies, and
 implementing programs according to three major policy focus areas: 1) Maintain and Enhance
 Housing and Residential Neighborhoods; 2) Balanced and Diverse Housing Opportunities; and, 3)
 Government Role and Process. While the plan covers a broad array of housing issues that are
 applicable Citywide, the emphasis of the 2013-2020 Policy and Implementation Plan is on actions
 enabling the City to maintain and increase housing opportunities affordable to very low-, low-, and
 moderate-income households.

                      POLICY FOCUS AREAS
2.0
The following three policy focus areas provide the foundation for implementing the City’s vision of
providing housing opportunities for existing and future residents of Chula Vista and establishes a
framework for decision-making to implement this vision.
Policy Focus 2.1 Maintain & Enhance the Quality and
Sustainability of Housing and Residential Neighborhoods in the City:
Rehabilitation of the City’s housing stock and preserving the integrity of residential neighborhoods by
preventing deterioration, leveraging housing programs with planned capital improvement activities
and to encourage further private investment in neighborhoods. Utilize community-based
rehabilitation programs such as CHIP and HUCD and other programs supported by local utilities and
regional partners to encourage the maintenance and enhancement of residential quality and
sustainability. The City’s activities will complement the San Diego Association of Governments
(SANDAG)’s Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS).
Policy Focus 2.2 Support Housing Opportunities to Meet the City’s
Diverse Needs:
Utilizing available resources, seek to preserve and provide sufficient, suitable, and varied housing by
small and large family size, type of unit, and cost, particularly permanent affordable housing that
meets the diverse housing needs of existing and future residents of Chula Vista.
Policy Focus 2.3 Fund and Implement Services that Provide Vital
Community Resources for Lower Income Residents:
Utilizing available tools and resources, fund and implement services and programs that improve
residents’ ability to secure and maintain quality housing.
                                                                                Page H-45

                   POLICY FOCUS AREAS, OBJECTIVES,
3.0                POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The following three policy focus areas provide the foundation for implementing the City’s overall
housing goals:
    1) Maintain and Enhance Housing and Neighborhoods;
    2) Balanced and Diverse Housing Opportunities; and,
    3) Government Role and Process.
These policy focus areas are further described below.
Each policy focus area is accompanied by at least one objective, or focused goal, and each objective
has at least one policy, describing how the City will meet the objective. Objectives and policies are
general in nature and serve as the framework for decision-making and priority setting. They address
specific needs and are followed by related implementing programs and actions.
For each identified policy action, a level of priority has been assigned, lead Department identified,
possible funding sources described, and an implementation timeline identified. The programs and
policies in the Policy and Implementation Plan are categorized into two levels of priorities, due to
significant contraction of resources.
    •    Level 1 Priorities are those that the City is dedicating to address during the 2013-2020
         planning period utilizing anticipated resources.
    •    Level 2 Priorities are those that the City acknowledges as important to address and will
         supplement Level 1 Priorities, based upon available resources.
Some of these policies and programs are currently being implemented, ongoing, and will continue
through this planning period. However, many programs are newly proposed and will be
implemented within this 2013-2020 planning period.
                                                                             Page H-47

                                                                                             PART II
3.1 Maintain and Enhance the Quality and Sustainability of
         Housing and Residential Neighborhoods in the City
The City’s existing housing stock plays an important role in a providing a decent, safe and sanitary
living environment for lower income households and in maintaining the quality and sustainability of
residential neighborhoods. With a majority of the existing housing citywide being 30 years or older
(63 percent), there is a potential loss in value and quality as a result of deterioration. A significant
number (22 percent) of the City’s housing stock is 50 years old and is likely to require major repairs.
Within the West (area west of I-805), 33 percent of the housing stock is 50 years old.
Programs to enforce building, health, and housing codes and the funding minor repairs,
rehabilitation of housing will encourage the provision of decent, safe and sanitary housing and
preserve neighborhood quality. The particular focus of the 2013-2020 Policy and Implementation
Plan is repair, rehabilitation and improvement of housing and neighborhoods in the City’s Northwest
and Southwest Planning Areas.
To improve the sustainability of existing housing stock, programs to facilitate whole-house upgrades
will be implemented, which maximize energy and water efficiency potential, reduce occupant utility
costs, increase home value, and preserve neighborhood quality. These programs should be designed
to help residents overcome common upgrade barriers such as acquiring upfront capital and
simplifying the application processes to minimize time constraints. An emphasis will be on cost-
effective, efficiency retrofit measures - including building insulation and air sealing, high-efficiency
HVAC units, turf lawn conversions, and other emerging initiatives - with comprehensive audits,
installation services, and attractive financing. Complementary City policies will help ensure consistent
enforcement of energy and water efficiency standards for remodels to existing homes.
At a community planning scale, the City will actively implement General Plan policies that promote
the integration of land use planning and transit. Specifically, the City shall pursue and provide
incentives, if feasible, for mixed-use development that include housing, retail, and office space at
transit nodes and other high-intensity locations. The City shall also collaborate with SANDAG to
update the Smart Growth Concept Map to reflect the changes to Chula Vista’s land use plans
contained in the 2050 Regional Growth Forecast and to the regional transportation network.

existing housing, and maintain the integrity of residential neighborhoods.
Policies & Programs
  H 1.1       Facilitate rehabilitation of the City’s existing housing stock to correct housing
              deficiencies and increase the useful life and sustainability of existing housing.
        1.1.1 Rehabilitation of Owner Occupied Housing: Continue implementation of the
              City’s Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP), which provides
              favorable loans to low-income homeowners, and to include improvements for
              water conservation, energy efficiency, and lead based paint abatement.
              Assistance will be focused on a block by block basis to homeowners residing in
              the Northwest and Southwest Planning Areas with priority given to those single-
              family home owners of very low-income, special needs and/or senior households.
              The City will leverage its Home Upgrade, Carbon Downgrade (HUCD) program,
              which provides low interest loans to homeowners for energy efficiency and
              renewable energy upgrades, to better serve low-income and moderate-income
              residents. The City will also increase marketing and outreach efforts for the CHIP,
              especially in lower-income neighborhoods and mobile home parks, and integrate
              the HUCD program into the City’s First-Time Homebuyers Program as an optional
              financing tool.

        1.1.2 Encourage Climate Resilient Design Techniques: To respond to a changing
               climate and promote sustainability in the community, the City has adopted
               policies and programs to reduce the impacts of climate change through
               adaptation strategies. Many of these strategies, such as designing more energy-
               efficient buildings, also help to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse
               gas emissions. To support the City of Chula Vista’s Climate Action Plan and its
               related goals, the City supports the following design measures to improve climate
               change resilience:
                     • Design natural ventilation and passive solar into residential buildings.
                     • Limit internal heat by specifying high-efficiency lighting and equipment.
                     • Modeling of energy performance with higher cooling design
                         temperatures.
                     • Avoid building in flood zones.
                     • Elevate mechanical and electrical equipment to minimize damage and
                         danger from flooding.
                     • Specify Class A roofing to reduce risk of wildfire.
                     • Design buildings to maintain livable conditions in the event of loss of
                         power or heating fuel, or shortages of water.

Board (CARB). The key component of the 2013 – 2020 Housing Element will be
to promote the integration of land use planning and transit, whereby:
    • The City encourages the use of incentives, when available, for mixed-use
         development, which includes housing, retail, and office space, at transit
         nodes and other high-intensity locations as appropriate.
    • The City supports implementation of the San Diego Association of
         Governments (SANDAG)’s Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS),
         including the adopted Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) Plan,
         which includes the following:
             o Increasing the housing supply and the mix of housing types,
                  tenure, and affordability in an equitable manner
             o Promote infill development and socioeconomic equity, the
                  protection of environmental and agricultural resources, and the
                  encouragement of efficient development patterns.
             o Promote an improved intraregional relationship between jobs and
                  housing.
             o Allocate a lower proportion of housing need to an income
                  category when there is a disproportionately high share of
                  households in that income category, as compared with the most
                  recent decennial United States census.
    • Work with SANDAG to update the Smart Growth Concept Map to reflect
         the changes to Chula Vista’s land use plans contained in the 2050
         Regional Growth Forecast and to the regional transportation network.
    • Encourage joint development opportunities to promote the construction
         of sustainable housing and mixed-use projects at existing and planned
         transit stations.

3.2 Balanced and Diverse Housing Opportunities
Chula Vista is a community with a diverse population and housing stock, particularly in the western
area of the City. Housing should be preserved and created to maximize housing opportunities for
larger households, a growing senior population, special needs groups, and very low-and low-income
families.
The disparities in household income, age and types of housing available between the eastern and
western portions of the City demonstrates a need to promote greater diversity in housing choices
related to pricing and housing type within each of these geographic areas. When areas of the City
are predominated by one type of housing or tenure (owner versus renter occupied), it limits the
housing choices of residents and perpetuates the established disparities and associated socials
issues. The provision of a variety of housing types in terms of density, size, and more importantly
tenure and providing these units in appropriate locations to minimize the creation of economic
housing enclaves, will enable the City to accommodate the varied needs and desires of the
community in order to achieve more balanced residential communities and to meet underserved
housing needs of lower income households.
The provision of new housing opportunities within mixed-use areas and at higher density levels,
particularly in transit focus areas and identified town centers, is encouraged. Mixed use and compact
developments can result in easier access to goods and services, and increased employment and
business opportunities, and the creation of vibrant community places.
                                          Objective – H 4
As required by State law, preserve existing affordable housing opportunities,
when feasible and practical, to maintain an adequate supply of affordable
housing.

            expire by 2020, as identified within Appendix A of this Element, and affordable
            housing developers to evaluate the viability of continuing the affordability of such
            housing through owner participation, public subsidies or participation by
            affordable housing developers. The City will implement the
            following actions on an ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock:
                  Annually monitor the status of identified “at-risk” assisted housing
                     developments.
                  If an opportunity arises due to the pending sale of the property, establish
                     contact with public and non-profit agencies interested in purchasing
                     and/or managing units at risk. Where feasible, provide technical
                     assistance to these organizations with respect to financing.
                  Should the property owner pursue conversion of the units to market rate,
                     ensure that tenants are properly noticed and informed of their rights and
                     that they are eligible to receive special Section 8 vouchers that would
                     enable them to stay in their units. Provide tenants with information
                     regarding Section 8 rent subsidies through the San Diego County

3.3 Government Role & Process
Local Government plays a significant role in fostering the development of affordable and special
needs housing. Conversely, in its efforts to protect and enhance the overall community, local
government can implement land use controls, building codes, development standards, permit and
processing procedures, and fees and exactions, that constrain the operations of the private, nonprofit,
and public sector when introducing new housing products to market. These constraints can result in
limiting the supply of housing and increasing the costs of development (see Appendix B). Programs
aimed at mitigating these constraints and evaluating the necessity of these requirements can assist
in decreasing the overall cost of housing production while at the same time protecting the
community and the environment.
                                   OBJECTIVE – H 7
Facilitate the creation, maintenance, preservation and conservation of
affordable housing for lower and moderate-income households through
comprehensive planning documents and processes, and the provision of
financial assistance and other incentives.

                  Ordinance, Sectional Planning Area Plans, and Specific Plans, encourage a variety

                    OVERVIEW:
1.0                 QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
California Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to estimate the number of affordable housing
opportunities that will be created over the eight-year planning period. The City has two sets of
numerical housing goals; the City’s share of the SANDAG Regional Housing Needs Assessment
(regional share goals) and the Quantified Objectives for Affordable Housing Production. The total
regional share goal is to provide adequate land resources to accommodate approximately 12,861
new housing units, 5,648 of which are for low- and very low-income households. To determine the
adequacy of land for very low- and low-income households, the City must demonstrate the
availability of land zoned for 30 dwelling units per acre or greater. The analysis of adequacy of
available land resources is provided in Appendix C of the Housing Element.
This total low-income housing need is far greater than the City has available resources to facilitate.
Therefore, the City establishes a quantified objective for the actual creation of affordable housing
opportunities and the provision of other housing assistance.

                       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
2.0
Part II of the Housing Element outlines policies and programs that range from the new construction
of housing, rehabilitating housing, and other housing assistance programs such as rental assistance,
homebuyer assistance, and homeless services. These programs and policies are categorized into two
levels of priorities:
    •    Level 1 Priorities are those that the City is dedicated to addressing within the planning period
         with the expected resources.
    •    Level 2 Priorities are those that the City acknowledges as important to address should
         resources allow.
Many programs and policies reduce barriers and create opportunities for a balanced community.
These goals are essential to meeting the City’s housing needs, but are more qualitative in general.
The quantified objectives adopted by the City of Chula Vista are based upon the Level 1 goals,
policies and programs outlined within the City’s Plan of Action, as outlined in Part II. The City
reasonably expects that a total of 694 households will be assisted, as summarized in Table III-1
below.

Additionally, there are housing programs and services available to Chula Vista residents that the City
does not administer. For example, approximately 2,500 Chula Vista residents receive Section 8 rental
assistance through the County of San Diego. These households pay an affordable rental rate while
residing in market rate rental housing. These types of programs and services were not included in the
City’s Plan of Action or the quantified objectives, as the City does not directly provide support.

                    PLANNING FOR NEW
3.0                 CONSTRUCTION
Table III-2 shows the new construction goals for the City during the planning period from 2013-2020
based upon Chula Vista’s share of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). New
construction is heavily dependant on market demands, Federal, State, and County programs, and
private funding. Even with very aggressive policies and programs, given that areas in western Chula
Vista are primarily mature and built-up and the remaining large tracts of vacant land in the east are
already planned and ready for development, the previous years’ housing production record and
limited public financing for affordable housing, these objectives are likely to be unachievable.
Therefore, the City cannot guarantee these needs will be met. The availability of land suited to meet
this goal is described in Appendix C.
Previous housing production has demonstrated that new construction of housing for very low- and
low-income households falls short of the projected need. The estimated gap between the costs of
producing a unit and what a very low- or low-income household can financially support is enormous.
Capital subsidies, primarily from federal, state, and local funding programs, are necessary for the
production of housing for these income groups.
With the limited availability of public subsidies, the City assumes a significant decrease from the last
decade’s affordable housing production. The economic recession has had a devastating impact on
the housing and mortgage industries, thereby resulting in a minimal new housing stock when
compared to years prior. The City anticipates that much of the new construction will result from
building out the newly developing master planned communities in the East Planning Area, Bayfront
and mixed-use and infill development in the City’s Urban Core Specific Plan Area. However, setting
the goals to be more “realistic” and achievable” does not accurately address the need.

Pursuant to AB 2634, local jurisdictions are also required to project the housing needs of extremely low income
households (0-30% AMI). In estimating the number of extremely low income households, a jurisdiction can use 50%
of the very low income allocation or apportion the very low income figure based on Census data. Therefore, the City’s
RHNA of 3,209 very low income units can be split equally between extremely low and very low income units.
Chula Vista will use the RHNA new construction goals as a long-term target but will annually assess
its housing priorities against the reality of available resources. Each year as resources are identified,
or reasonably expected to become available, shortfalls in achieving goals and actions outlined within
Part II and the quantified objectives specified within this Part can be assessed, program targets
shifted appropriately and resources allocated effectively and efficiently.

                                NEEDS
Under State Housing Element Law, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing and future needs for all
income groups as determined by the jurisdictions Council of Government, when preparing the state-
mandated Housing Element of the General Plan.
This section presents the demographic and housing characteristics that influence the demand and
availability of housing. This analysis is necessary to form the basis for establishing programs and
goals that seek to address the identified housing needs. The focus of this section is to identify the
need for housing according to income, tenure, and special needs groups. In addition, this section
attempts to frame the discussion of creating balanced communities throughout the City. This
discussion was a recurring theme throughout the General Plan process when identifying the varying
needs between the eastern (east of Interstate I-805) and western (west of I-805) portions of the City.
Primary data sources include the 2010 Census for existing conditions and comparisons between the
eastern and west portions of the City1, the American Community Survey 1-, 3-, and 5-Year Estimates,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Regional Task Force on the
Homeless, projections published by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and the
California Department of Finance. The data used are the most reliable for assessing existing
conditions. Furthermore, such standard sources provide a basis for consistent comparison with older
data and provide the best basis for forecasts.

  Conducted every ten (10) years, the U.S. Census provides the most comprehensive data source available, but does not necessarily represent existing
conditions. Further, in the analysis of east and west, the Census tracts are generally divided by City boundaries. This presents a slight inconsistency when
trying to combine census tracts to determine statistics for a portion of the City as done in this section. While small portions of census tracts fall outside or
within the City, overall it was determined to be the best way to form detailed housing statistics to compare the eastern and western portions of the City.

The City of Chula Vista is growing at a rapid pace in comparison to the rest of the County. Between
1950 and 1960, Chula Vista more than doubled in size. Population growth slowed in the 1970s and
1990s. Between 1990 and 2000, the City experienced a 28 percent increase. With the continued
Greenfield development and growth of master planned communities in eastern Chula Vista, this
pattern continued from 2000 to 2010 and Chula Vista’s population grew by 40 percent.

As shown in Figure A-3, estimates by the California Department of Finance (DOF) show that from
2000 to 2005 Chula Vista’s population increased by 25 percent to 217,543. The population continued
to increase in Chula Vista from 2005 to 2010 by an additional 11 percent. Growth slowed in
comparison with the previous years as would be expected in a recessionary economy.
Comparatively, the County’s estimated population increased 4 percent from 2005 to 2010. The
population of Chula Vista makes up an 8 percent share of the total population in San Diego County.
Chula Vista remains the second largest city in the County behind the City of San Diego.
                                                                              Page AA-5

                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                     APPENDIX A
2.1.2         Age Composition
As of 2010, 59 percent of the City’s population was between the ages of 21 to 64. Children and teens
aged 0-20 years comprised 31 percent of the population, and seniors, 65 and over, represented 10
percent of the City’s population. The greatest population increases were in the persons 5-20, 25-44
and 45-54 years of age categories. Growth in these age categories, considered the prime home
buying age brackets, is consistent with the increase of single family residential development in the
master planned communities of eastern Chula Vista.
Over the next twenty-five (25) years the SANDAG is projecting that the San Diego region will see a
decline in the growth of age groups below 55, while all age groups above 55 will increase.
Specifically, the western portion of the City of Chula Vista is expected to see a higher increase in the
55-74 year old age group then the region and a higher increase in the 65-74 year old age group in
the western portion of the City than the City as a whole.

2.1.3       Race and Ethnicity
As shown in Figures A-6a, A-6b, and A-6c, Chula Vista is, and continues to grow as a racially and
ethnically diverse community. The City experienced rapid growth of its Hispanic population between
1990 and 2000, and again from 2000 to 2010. The Hispanic population is the largest representative
ethnic group in the City, comprising 60 percent of the total population. The percent of Asian
population increased between 1990 and 2000 to 11 percent, and continued to increase from 2000 to
2010, comprising 14 percent of the total population. The Black population has remained at about 4
percent from 1990 to 2010. The White (non-Hispanic) population, however, has seen a dramatic
decrease from 32 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2010. The percentage of American Indian &
Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian & Other Pacific Islander, has remained less than 1 percent of the
population from 1990 to 2010.

2.2 Employment Trends
Housing needs are affected by employment trends. Significant employment opportunities within the
City can lead to growth in demand for housing in proximity to jobs. The quality or pay of available
employment can determine the need for various housing types and prices.
In 2010, educational, health, and social services made up 26 percent of the labor force, followed by
retail trade (11 percent), public administration (10 percent) and professional, scientific, management,
administrative and waste management services (9 percent). Industries such as manufacturing,
construction, information, finance, insurance, real estate, and retail, each experienced declines from
2000 to 2010. As Table A-2 shows, nearly 30 percent of those Chula Vistan’s in the labor force are in
the retail or service industry where lower pay scales predominate.
                                                                   Table A-2

Employment rates are an indicator of economic trends in the City. Chula Vista’s labor force grew from
86,900 in 2005 to 91,400 in 2011. Unemployment rates remained at about 5 percent from 2005 to
2009. However, unemployment rates began to experience sharp increases to 7 percent in 2010 and
11 percent in 2011. This pattern of growing unemployment is representative of the effect that the
economic downturn has had on the San Diego region, State, and Nation.

2.3 Household Characteristics
This section provides an overview of the characteristics of Chula Vista’s households. The U.S. Census
Bureau defines a household as all persons living in a single housing unit. One person living alone
is considered a household as is a group of unrelated people living in a single housing unit. A family
is defined as related persons living within a single housing unit.
The 2010 Census and American Community Survey data revealed that Chula Vista as well as the
region is experiencing a tightening housing market. Household size in Chula Vista increased from
2.79 persons per household in 1990 to 3.21 in 2010. A rapid increase in household formation from
2000 to 2010 has also been evidenced with a 31 percent increase in the number of households.
2.3.1           Household Formation & Composition
Chula Vista has experienced a rapid increase in the number of households over the past three
decades, with the continued green field development in the master planned communities in Eastern
Chula Vista. Between 1990 and 2000 Chula Vista saw nearly a 21 percent increase in the number of
households. From 2000 to 2010, the City saw an increase of 31 percent of households. In 2010, the
City’s households were growing 21 percent faster than in the County and in the State of California.

The 2010 U.S. Census reported that Chula Vista’s average household size was 3.21 persons per
household, increasing from 2.99 persons per household in 2000. In comparison, San Diego County
had estimated household size of 2.73 in 2000 and 2.75 in 2010. This larger household size indicates
the need for housing units with more bedrooms.

As shown in Figure A-7, two-person households represented the largest group for both renters and
owners in 2010, comprising 24 percent of total households in Chula Vista. Closely following are four-
person households at 20 percent, and three-person households at 19 percent. This trend reflects the
overall pattern of growth in the number and average size of Chula Vista households. Renter-occupied
households had an average of 2.86 persons per household, compared to 3.09 persons per household
in owner-occupied households.

2.3.2         Jobs to Housing Balance
There often is a mismatch between the location of housing and jobs in Southern California. One
way of determining if Chula Vista’s households commute out of the City to work is by looking at the
jobs-to-housing balance. The jobs-to-housing balance is the number of jobs in Chula Vista divided
by the number of housing units in Chula Vista. In 2011, Chula Vista had a 1.03 jobs to household
ratio, slightly up from 2000 at 0.9. Although there was a slight increase in the jobs-to-housing ratio
from 2000 to 2010, the growing number of households, coupled with high unemployment rates in
the City, indicates that many households have to commute out of the City for their work.

2.3.3         Household Income
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) generates an annual median
income for the purpose of determining program eligibility. The City of Chula Vista is included in the
San Diego County Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), for which HUD set the 2011 median family
income (MFI) at $74,900 for a four-person household.
The State of California uses four income categories to determine housing affordability.                           These
categories are as follows:
         Very Low-income – Less than 50% of the median income;
         Low-income – 51% to 80% of the median income;
         Moderate-income – 81% to 120 % of the median income; and,
         Above Moderate-income – Greater than 120% of the median income.

Table A-8 shows the income ranges for each income category based on the 2011 HUD MFI for Chula
Vista.
Figure A-8 shows household income distribution by tenure. According to the American Community
Survey 1-year Estimates, approximately 6,108 households earned less than $20,000, which falls in the
extremely low income category. A significant number of these households are renters (73 percent).
Approximately 8 percent of owner-occupied households and 17 percent of renter-occupied
households earned less than $35,000 a year, which falls in the very low-income category (up to
$40,950). Additionally, 57 percent of total households in Chula Vista earn less than HUD’s Area
Median Income (AMI) for the County of San Diego at $74,900 (26 percent of owner-occupied
households and 31 percent of renter-occupied households). The income group containing majority of
(26 percent) of owner-occupied households was $100,000 to $149,000. The income group containing
the largest group (20 percent) of renter-occupied households was $20,000 to $34,999.

by tenure and by ethnicity. As shown in Table A-9, Chula Vista’s median income of $66,246 in 2010
was slightly higher than that of San Diego County as a whole at $59,923. When comparing income
by tenure, a large difference is seen between owner-occupied households at $84,151, and renter
occupied households at $41,527.

As shown in Figure A-9, Asians earn considerably higher incomes than all other ethnicities, although
they represent just 14 percent of the population. While Hispanics, the largest ethnic group in Chula
Vista at 60 percent of the population, earn 18 percent less than the Chula Vista median income and
12 percent less than the County median.
In addition, there is a large disparity of low-income households between the eastern and western
portions of the City, as illustrated in Figure A-10.

According to the 2005-2009 American Community Survey 5-yr Estimates, the stock of multiple family
housing was much higher in the Western portion (41 percent) of the City compared to the Eastern
portion (16 percent), as depicted in Figure A-12a & A-12-b. This diversity is attributed to the large
production of single-family households in the eastern master planned communities.

Unit Size
Figure A-13a & A-13b shows the number of bedrooms in occupied housing units by tenure. In 2010,
59 percent of renters, occupied studios, 1- and 2-bedroom units, and 38 percent occupied 3- and 4-
bedroom units. Just 16 percent of owners, occupied 1- and 2- bedroom units and 74 percent
occupied 3- and 4- bedroom units.

2.4.2      Tenure
The 2010 Census reported that 58 percent of housing units in Chula Vista were owner-occupied and
41 percent were renter-occupied. With the growth of single-family homes in the master planned
communities of the Eastern portion of the City, Chula Vista has been experiencing an increase in
home-ownership, however, has also experienced an increase in foreclosure rates during the last few
years.
As shown in Figure A-14, the United States had a higher percentage of owner-occupied housing
units than Chula Vista. 65 percent of America’s housing units were owner-occupied. In comparison,
both San Diego County and California, with a greater amount of land to develop, had a lower
percentage of owner-occupied housing units than the City.
Figure A-14 also displays a great disparity between the supply of owner-and renter-occupied housing
between the eastern and western portions of the City. While the City of Chula Vista retains an overall
balance of renter- and owner-occupied housing in line with the San Diego region, the majority of the
rental housing supply is contained in the western portion (58 percent) of the City, while owner
occupied units in the east (73 percent) is very high.
                                                                           Page AA-23

As shown in Figure A-15a & b, approximately 90 percent of the owner-occupied housing units were
single-family, detached and attached. In comparison, 42 percent of renter-occupied housing units
were single-family, detached and attached. According to the 2010 Census approximately 55 percent
of renter-occupied units were multi-family housing with more than 2 units in a building.

2.4.3        Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are an indicator of supply and demand. Low vacancy rates suggest households may
have trouble finding housing with an affordable monthly payment. A high number of vacant units
indicate an over-supply of housing units. A four to six percent vacancy rate is considered “healthy”.
As indicated in Table A-11, of the 79,416 housing units in the City, 2010 U.S. Census data shows 4.9
percent were vacant in 2010. Of the total vacant units, 39 percent were for rent, 28 percent were for
sale, and 20 percent were other vacant. Other vacant may be comprised of units that are rented or
sold, but not occupied; seasonal, recreational, or occasional use; and other unspecified uses.

2.4.4        Age of Housing Stock
The age of housing is often an indicator of housing conditions. In general, housing that is 30 years
or older may need minor repair. Housing over 50 years old is considered aged and more likely to
generate major repairs. In Chula Vista, 15 percent of the City’s housing units were built prior to 1960,
approximately 47 percent of housing units were built prior to 1980, therefore, a majority (62 percent)
of Chula Vista’s housing is at least 30 years or older, and may be in need of repairs. In contrast,
approximately 24 percent of Chula Vista’s housing stock was built from 2000 to 2005 or later, mostly
attributed to the growth of the master planned communities in the Eastern portion of the City.

When comparing the Eastern and Western portions of the City, as depicted in Figure A-16a & A-16b,
it can be seen that over 90 percent of the housing stock in Eastern Chula Vista was built recently
(1980 to 2000 or later), while 68 percent of housing in the West was built before 1980. With the
continued build out of the master planned communities in the east the current mix of housing age is
even more pronounced. This statistic indicates that substantial rehabilitation or replacement of
housing in the Western portion of the city may be needed in the next twenty-five (25) years.

2.4.5        Housing Conditions
Housing is considered substandard when it is below the minimum standard of living conditions
defined in the Uniform Housing Code, Section 1001.
In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and utilities often serves
as an indicator for substandard conditions. According to the 2010 1-year American Community
Survey, 253 units in Chula Vista lacked complete plumbing facilities. Of those units 79 percent were
owner-occupied and 21 percent were renter-occupied. Additionally, 174 units lacked complete
kitchen facilities. Of those units, 71 percent were owner-occupied and 29 percent were renter-
occupied. It should be noted that there may be some overlap in the number of substandard housing
units, as some units may lack both complete plumbing and kitchen facilities.
The City’s Code Enforcement Division of the Development Services Department performs periodic
inspections of all multi-family units. Since 2001, the City has employed a proactive multifamily rental
housing inspection program for those properties with three or more units. Within eight years of
initiating this program, staff was able to complete inspections of all properties within the program.
During the first cycle of inspections, more serious living conditions were identified and abated. The
City is currently in its second cycle of inspections. During the 2005-2010 Housing Element period,
staff inspected 5,254 rental units within 1,000 complexes. Typical issues identified through this
program are presence or functional smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. More serious
issues that arise involve raw sewage seepage. On average, four properties are identified a year that
may involve health and welfare issues needing immediate abatement.
Currently, there are 31 mobile home parks in the City with approximately 3,500 spaces. The
Development Services Department conducts inspections of the mobile home parks and mobilehomes
for compliance with Title 25 Mobilehome Parks Act. The City is currently in the process of its second
cycle of inspections. During the first cycle of inspections, more serious living conditions were
identified and abated.
Inspection staff also responds to complaints of substandard conditions in the housing stock,
including single-family homes. Due to limited staffing resources, the City does not employ a proactive
inspection program for single family homes and neighborhoods and responds only to complaints
filed. Staff provides rehabilitation and resolution for housing stock conditions through brochures and
informational handouts during inspection.
A review of the Development Service Department’s records shows that in 2012, the Department
received and opened 520 residential code enforcement complaints. Of these complaints, five Notice of

Violations were issued for building on a lot line, dilapidated fence for a swimming pool, a bbq gas
line without a permit, shipping containers in a driveway and water damage/odor issues. The
Department opened 198 cases of building without a permit for residential units, with 18 notice of
violations issued. Sixteen of these notices of violations were related to illegal units and room
additions. While complaints received were numerous, approximately 3 percent of the complaints
resulted in a Notice of Violation.
With the downturn of the economy and housing mortgage crisis, many households are looking at
alternative housing choices. The City has seen an increase in the number of illegal conversion of
housing, which may include conversion of garages into living space and the creation of rooming
houses out of one and two-family homes without the appropriate building permits.
Chula Vista’s greatest housing rehabilitation needs are primarily concentrated in the Western area of
the City where 50 percent of the housing stock was built prior to 1959 and over fifty years old. The
City can improve deteriorating housing conditions in this area by focusing its Single Family Housing
Rehabilitation and its Multifamily Acquisition and Rehabilitation programs in the area to supplement
and reinforce efforts of towards neighborhood revitalization.

This section discusses the price of new and existing housing as well as average costs of rental
housing in Chula Vista.
New and Resale Housing
The 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year estimates list the median value for all owner-occupied
housing units in Chula Vista at $358,600. Data indicates that 6 percent of Chula Vista’s owner-
occupied housing units were worth under $100,000, 6 percent were valued between $100,000 to
$199,999, 21 percent were valued between $200,000 and $299,999, and 67 percent were valued at
$300,000 or above.

Due to the rapid development in Eastern Chula Vista, it is difficult to analyze the average price of a
new home. Therefore, the available supply of resale units in the City serves as the basis for the
analysis of housing costs and its relationship to the ability to pay.
Figure A-17 shows the median price for resale housing in Chula Vista and surrounding cities. In
October 2011, the median cost of resale housing in the City of Chula Vista was $308,000, which is
slightly lower than the City of San Diego and the County as a whole. Data shows that resale housing
prices have decreased by 8 percent in the City since October 2010. This decrease in price is generally

Foreclosures
Subprime mortgages— granted to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit histories—played a major
role in the over inflation of housing prices and increase in foreclosures in Chula Vista and the rest of
the United States. This is due to the fact that initial “teaser” lending terms began to expire
simultaneously as housing prices began to decrease, or readjust. While many homebuyers and
speculators were able to make mortgage payments under initial loan terms, and banked on the
continued appreciation of their homes to insulate them from future rate increases, many
homeowners struggled to make their monthly housing payment when their mortgage payments
doubled or tripled and the housing market slowed. As a result, many homeowners were unable to
pay rising mortgage payments and were forced into the foreclosure process. This has flooded the
market with homes for sale at or below market rate. Furthermore, lenders began adjusting their
lending practices, making credit less available to those with blemished credit or little down payment.
Due to the deflation of home prices and decline in available credit, the median home sale price
dropped dramatically throughout the United States, as seen in Chula Vista (Figure A-17).
According to data provided by Data Quick News, the number of Notices of Default, (NOD) (the first
step in the foreclosure process), in San Diego County fell by 14 percent from the third quarter of 2010
to the third quarter of 2011.

The percentage of Chula Vista’s housing units in foreclosure greatly exceeds those experienced by the
San Diego region, California and the nation. Chula Vista was significantly hit by the housing crisis
due to the availability of vacant residential land and housing growth experienced in the early 2000’s.
From 2000 to 2010, Chula Vista’s housing inventory grew by 33 percent while San Diego’s grew 12
percent (see Table A-10).

Figure A-19 illustrates foreclosures by zip codes in Chula Vista. Those areas in eastern Chula Vista
experienced higher rates of foreclosure as this area saw significant growth in newly constructed
housing during the early to mid 2000’s According to Realty Trac, zip code 91911 had the highest
number of foreclosed properties at 119, followed by zip code 91909 with 112 foreclosed properties for
the month of November 2011.

Rental Prices
According to the Fall 2011 Rental Rate Survey by the San Diego County Apartment Association, the
average monthly rent for a studio apartment in Chula Vista was $661 down from $710 in the Spring
of 2011 possibly indicating a decrease in demand for studio apartments. One- and two-bedroom
apartments also experienced a slight decrease in average rent from Spring 2011 to Fall 2011 as
indicated in Table A-14. The average monthly rent in Fall 2011 for a 1-bedroom unit was $892, 2-
bedroom was $1222 and 3 or more bedroom unit was $1,563. In comparison, average monthly rents
are generally lower in Chula Vista than San Diego County.

Affordability Gap Analysis
The cost of home ownership and renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay for
housing. Housing affordability is defined as paying no more than 30 percent of the household
income on housing expenses. Based on the 2011 HUD median income of $74,900 for San Diego
County, Table A-15 identifies affordable rent payments and purchase prices for each income group.
Affordable purchase price assumes a 10 percent down payment, a 7.5 percent interest rate, and 1.25
percent tax and homeowners insurance.

Rental Affordability
In 2011, affordable rents for the Very-Low income group coincide with the average rents for studio
and one-bedroom apartments shown in Table A-14. Larger units fall in the low-, moderate-, -income
groups. This data indicates lower-income families and large households have limited options in
finding affordable housing.

Ownership Affordability
The median price of resale housing in Chula Vista, as shown in Figure A-17 and Table A-15, exceeds
the affordability range for all income categories except above-moderate income households. This
indicates that there is an affordability gap for ownership housing. Very low-, low-, and moderate
income-households may have trouble finding affordable housing that they can afford to purchase.
2.5 Summary & Conclusion
This section summarizes the demographic characteristics of Chula Vista and how they relate to the
supply and demand of the City’s housing. The major findings of this analysis are as follows:
Population and Household Growth. Between 2000 and 2010, the City experienced a 40 percent
increase in population. The numbers of households are growing just as fast as the population, with a
31 percent increase in the number of households from 2000 to 2010.
Age Distribution. 59 percent of the population was 21 to 64 years old in 2010, which is considered
the prime buying age. It is expected that over the next twenty-five (25) years, the San Diego region
will see an increase in the growth of age groups above 55. Specifically, the western portion of the City
of Chula Vista is expected to see a higher increase in the 55-74 year old age group then the region
and 65-74 year old age group is higher in the western portion of the City than the City as a whole.
Ethnicity. In 2010, the Hispanic population was the largest ethnic group in the City, representing 60
percent of the total population. The Hispanic population grew from 50 percent in 2000 to 60 percent
in 2010. During, the same time period, the Asian population increased from 11 percent to 14 percent,
while the White population declined from 32 percent to 21 percent from 2000 to 2010.
Income. Approximately 15 percent of owner-occupied households and 24 percent of renter-occupied
households earned less than $50,000 per year in 2010, which falls in the very low-income category
($65,500 or below). Additionally, the median income for owner-occupied households was significantly
higher ($84,851) than for renter-occupied households ($41,527). Western Chula Vista had a much
higher percent (57 percent) of low-income households (earning $40,000 or less) than eastern Chula
Vista (32 percent).
Tenure and unit size. The 2010 Census reported that 58 percent of the units in Chula Vista were
owner-occupied and 42 percent were renter-occupied. A large amount of renters occupied studios, 1
and 2-bedroom units, compared to owners who generally occupied larger 3-4 bedroom units. In
comparison, the United States had a higher percentage (65 percent) owner-occupied housing units
                                                                             Page AA-37

                                                                    HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                APPENDIX A
than Chula Vista. San Diego County and California both had a lower percentage of owner
households than the City. However, in 2010 western Chula Vista reported a much higher (58
percent) renter-occupied rate and multiple family (55 percent) households than eastern Chula Vista
(27 percent and 4 percent respectively).
Households. A rapid increase in household formation is evident with a 31 percent increase in the
number of households from 2000 to 2010. Household size is also increasing. According to the 2010
Census, household size increased from 2.99 in 2000 to 3.21 in 2010. This larger household size
indicates the needs for larger housing units.
Housing Affordability. Chula Vista had a median income slightly higher than the average for the
County of San Diego. However, the growing number of households, increase in household size, and
income disparity between renter-occupied households and owner-occupied households has provided
further challenges to Chula Vista households seeking affordable housing options. Data indicates
that lower-income families and large households have limited options in finding affordable rental
housing. In addition, the median price of resale housing in Chula Vista exceeds the affordability
range for all income categories except above-moderate income households. Very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households may have trouble finding affordable housing that they can afford to
purchase.

                    HOUSING NEEDS
3.0
This section provides an overview of existing housing needs in the City of Chula Vista. Housing need
can be described in four categories:
       Housing need resulting from households overpaying for housing;
       Housing need resulting in overcrowding;
       Housing need resulting from population growth and demolition of the existing housing stock;
        and,
       Housing need of “special needs groups” such as elderly persons, large households, female-
        headed households, disabled persons, homeless persons, and farm workers.
3.1 Households Overpaying for Housing
Overpayment is defined as households that pay more than 30 percent of their gross income on
housing related expenses. This includes rents or mortgage payments, electricity, and gas. The high
cost of housing eventually causes lower-income households to use a disproportionate percentage of
their income for housing. This may result in financial problems, deferred maintenance, or
inappropriately sized units that do not meet the needs of the household (i.e. overcrowding).
As shown in Table A-16, 53 percent of Chula Vista’s households overpaid for housing in 2010. 63
percent of renter-occupied households overpaid for housing and 46 percent of owners overpaid.
                                                                              Page AA-39

According to 2010 U.S Census American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, over half (53 percent)
of the total households in Chula Vista overpaid for housing. In general, more lower-income
households tend to overpay than moderate to above-moderate income households. As shown in
Table A-17, 67 percent of lower income households overpaid for housing in 2010. Approximately 79
percent of lower-income renters and 64 percent of lower-income owners overpaid.

3.2 Overcrowding
As a result of rising housing prices, lower-income households are often forced to accept smaller
housing units, which may result in overcrowding. Overcrowding is defined as households having an
average of more than 1 person per room, with households considered to be severely overcrowded
having more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding puts a strain on public facilities and services,
reduces the quality of the physical environment, and can eventually cause conditions that contribute
to deterioration of the housing stock.
As shown in Table A-18, 8 percent of Chula Vista households were considered overcrowded in 2010.
As is the case in housing overpayment, overcrowding was found in more renter households than
owner households. Of the overcrowded households, an overwhelming majority (83 percent) are
renter-occupied households.

3.3 2010-2020 Growth Needs
The State Department of Finance (DOF) is responsible for projecting the total statewide housing
demand, with the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) apportioning
this demand to each of the state’s regions. This demand represents the number of additional units
needed to accommodate the anticipated growth in the number of households, to replace expected
demolitions and conversions of housing units to non-housing uses, and to achieve a future vacancy
rate that allows for healthy functioning of the housing market.
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), the Council of Governments (COG)
representing the region, in cooperation with the local jurisdictions, is tasked with the responsibility of
allocating the region’s projected new housing demand to each jurisdiction. The allocation is further
divided into four income categories:
             Very Low-Income – 0% to 50% of the median income;
             Low-Income – 51% to 80% of the median income;
             Moderate-Income – 81% to 120% of the median income; and,
             Above Moderate-Income – more than 120% of the median income.
This process is known as the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), and the goals are
referred to as either the RHNA goals or the “regional share” goals for new housing construction. The
allocation takes into account factors such as market demand for housing, employment opportunities,
the availability of suitable sites and public facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing
need, and others. In determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income category, the
allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in any one
jurisdiction.

3.4 Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more trouble finding decent, affordable housing due to
their special needs. This section identifies the needs of specific groups, including: elderly persons,
large households, female-headed households, disabled persons, homeless persons, farmworkers, and
students.
3.4.1           Elderly Persons
Elderly persons are defined as a special needs group because most are retired and have fixed
incomes. As shown in Table A-20, 13,459 elderly householders reside in Chula Vista, which is 30
percent of the total households. Of the senior households, approximately 30 percent are renter and
70 percent are owners. Further, the U.S. Census 2010 American Community Survey 1-year Estimates
revealed that approximately 7 percent of elderly householders over the age of 65 were under the
poverty level in 2010. This data indicates a need for affordable senior rental housing, as well as
rehabilitation and retrofitting programs for those owner-occupied senior households.

Elderly persons often have additional restraints to housing in regards to location and choice of unit
type. In terms of location, elderly persons often require access to medical facilities and public transit.
Housing may need to be equipped with ramps, handrails, elevators, lower cabinets and counters to
accommodate elderly persons with self-care limitations and go-outside-home disabilities and special
security devices to allow for greater self-protection. Of Chula Vista’s elderly population in 2010, 35
percent had a self-care disability or a go-outside-home disability.

         The primary housing concerns regarding the elderly persons living in the City of Chula Vista are
         summarized as follows:
                   Income – The elderly population is generally on a fixed income;
                   Household Composition – The elderly, especially women, often live alone;
                   Transportation – The elderly population are more likely to utilize public transportation; and,
                   Health Care – The elderly have a significantly greater need for health care.
         3.4.2            Large Households
         Large households are defined as having five or more persons within the same household. The 2010
         Census reported 15,479 large households, representing 21 percent of total households in Chula Vista.
         Of these households, 59 percent were owner-occupied and 41 percent were renter-occupied. Census
         data shows the number of large households has increased from 17 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in
         2010. The increasing number of large households requires more housing units of 3-or-more
         bedrooms. Finding larger units at an affordable price is a concern primarily for households with
         lower-incomes.

3.4.3            Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households are a special needs group due to their low rate of homeownership. As
shown in Table A-23, 5,185 or 7 percent of total households were female-headed with children under
the age of 18. In addition, there were 3,757 female-headed households without children in the City
of Chula Vista.

3.4.4            Persons with Disabilities
Access and affordability are two major needs of persons with disabilities. Access is important for the
physically disabled both within their homes and to/from the site. This often requires specially
designed dwelling units. Additionally, there is also the desire to be located near public facilities and
public transit.
Table A-24 shows the number of persons between the ages of 16 to 64 with disabilities in 2010.
Persons with sensory, physical, or mental disabilities comprised 4 percent of the total population.
Persons with self-care and go-outside-home disabilities represented 2 percent of the population.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a
severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
       Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
        impairments;
       Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
       Is likely to continue indefinitely;
       Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
        life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e)
        selfdirection; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency; and
       Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
        generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
        extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not collect or report statistics for developmental disabilities and no other source is
known to have this data for Chula Vista. According to the San Diego Regional Center, as of their
demographic information report dated February 2012, they serve approximately 2,960 residents with
developmental disabilities through their South Bay satellite office located in National City,
representing 15 percent of the total population they serve. Demographics from the San Diego
Regional Center are not published at a jurisdictional level. The South Bay office serves Chula Vista
residents, along with National City, Imperial Beach and San Ysidro residents. Most of these individuals
were residing in a private home with their parent or guardian (76 percent) and 48.4 percent of
                                                                                           Page AA-47

                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                     APPENDIX A
persons with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18. Many developmentally disabled
persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely
disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most
severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and
physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first
issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
3.4.5        Homeless Population and Transitional Housing Needs
Since 2006, the San Diego Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) has conducted a point-in-
time survey (PIT) to measure the City’s homeless population, as well as to identify the needs of
persons experiencing homelessness. The 2011 PIT found 441 homeless persons in the City of Chula
Vista. The RTFH surveys those individuals living on the street, in shelters, jails, or detoxification
facilities on a particular night. Demographic characteristics of the homeless population were
generated through a more in-depth survey of a sample of unsheltered homeless persons, as well as
data from the Homeless Management Information System project (HMIS), a data warehouse with
unduplicated records of homeless clients served by the participating agencies in the region. Data
from the PIT studies have limitations. Final results were not adjusted to account for homeless persons
that were not located by the survey methodology (i.e., persons temporarily staying with friends or
family); therefore, the total homeless population is understated by PIT counts.
The 2011 PIT survey identified individuals living on the street, emergency shelters, and transitional
housing as homeless. Table A-25 shows the number of homeless individuals by their shelter status in
the City of Chula Vista.

More than half of homeless individuals were living on the street (53 percent), while almost half were
sheltered—eight percent in emergency shelters and 39 percent in transitional housing.
As part of the PIT, data is also collected to describe certain subpopulation groups of the homeless
that are unsheltered during the PIT. The survey data is not considered to be a complete
representation of all unsheltered persons. The data, however, is considered significant enough to use
such information as rough estimations of the number of unsheltered persons with similar
characteristics. Table A-26 is indicative of the proportion of the entire group of homeless persons at a
given point in time that can be described as fitting the subpopulation categories of Veterans, Severe
Mental Illness, Chronic Substance Abuse, HIV/AIDs and Domestic Violence

 The number of beds available in Chula Vista is generally consistent with the number of homeless.
 However, majority of these beds serve targeted and special needs populations.
 3.4.6           Farm Workers
 Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
 permanent or seasonal (migrant) agricultural labor. Due to the high cost of housing and low wages,
 a significant number of migrant farm workers have difficulty finding affordable, safe and sanitary
 housing. According to the State Employment Development Department, the average farm worker
 earned between $19,000 and $30,000 annually. This limited income is exacerbated by their tenuous
 and/or seasonal employment status.
 The 2010 Census shows there were only 119 persons in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and
 mining industry, making up less than 1 percent of Chula Vista’s labor force (see Table A-2). Farm
 workers are considered a special needs group due to the seasonal nature of employment. The
 limited amount of agricultural land within the City of Chula Vista makes this group a very small
 minority.

3.4.7        Students
The Land Use and Transportation Elements of the General Plan define a University Study Area within
the Otay Ranch community. Students are considered a special needs group because of their unique
requirements for housing. University students are generally on a fixed-income and live in non-family
households. The development of student housing will be an integral component of the development
of the University Study Area.

The major findings of this section are:
           Overpayment. Data shows that 53 percent of Chula Vista’s households overpaid for
            housing in 2010, which increased from 38 percent in 2000. It is estimated that of the
            households overpaying, 46 percent are owner-occupied, and 63 percent are renter-
            occupied.
           Overcrowding. In Chula Vista 8 percent of households were considered overcrowded. Of
            the overcrowded households, 17 percent were owner-occupied, while 83 percent were

4.0
Existing housing that receives governmental assistance or is generated through governmental
policies is often a significant source of affordable housing in many communities. This section
identifies the affordable housing in Chula Vista, evaluates the potential for conversion to market rate
between 2013 and 2023, and analyzes the cost to preserve the units. Resources for
preservation/replacement are described in Chapter 4, Housing Resources. Housing programs to
address preservation of these units are described in Part II, Policy & Implementation Plan.
4.1 Inventory of Affordable Housing
There are 2,453 affordable rental housing units in the City of Chula Vista as of December 2011.
During the 2005-2011 reporting period, the City permitted 628 units for lower and moderate income
households, including 146 units serving very low-income households, 182 units serving low-income
households, and 200 units serving moderate-income households. These include 305 rental units, 282
for sale units, and 41 senior units. An additional 13 units were acquired and rehabilitated to be
restricted for occupancy and use by special needs, extremely low income households.

Additionally, during the 2005-2011 period, the City assisted in the refinancing of two HUD Section
236 developments, Palomar Apartments (168 units) and Oxford Terrace Apartments (105 units). The
refinancing of these apartments with multifamily housing revenue bonds extended the period of
affordability for 55 years.
4.2 Assisted Units “At-Risk” Of Conversion
State Housing Element Law requires the analysis of government-assisted housing that is eligible to
change from low-income to market rate housing over the next 10 years. State law identifies housing
assistance as a rental subsidy, mortgage subsidy, or mortgage insurance, to an assisted housing
development. Government assisted housing might convert to market rate housing for a number of
reasons, including expiring subsidies, mortgage repayments, or expiration of affordability restrictions.
As a requirement of State law, this section will address the following:
       An inventory of assisted housing units that are at-risk of converting to market rate housing.
       An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing these units.
       Resources that could be used to preserve the at-risk units.

The State requires jurisdictions to analyze all assisted units over a ten-year period, usually connected
to the required implementation date for the Housing Element Update. During this housing cycle, the
ten-year period is from 2013 through 2023.
As shown in Table A-32, 401 affordable units are at-risk of being converted into market rate housing
over the next 10 years. At-risk units were developed under HUD Section 202 and 236, City Density
Bonus program, and the City’s Tax Exempt Financing program.

4.2.2             Preservation Strategies
The appropriate preservation options depend largely on the type of project at risk and the type of
financing used to make the units affordable. Options to preserve units could involve providing
financial incentives to the project owners to extend low-income use restrictions, purchasing
affordable housing units by a non-profit or public agency, or providing local subsidies to offset the
difference between affordable and market rate.
Local Rental Subsidy
An option for preserving the 401 units at-risk during the planning period is to provide a local rental
subsidy to residents. This method would be utilized to retain the affordability of the units via the
provision of assistance to residents when their affordable units convert to market rate. State or local
rent subsidies can be utilized to maintain the affordability of these units. Such subsidies can be a in
a form of a voucher or payment similar to the Section 8 program. To determine the need subsidy,
Fair Market Rates were compared to “affordable rents”, as defined by California Health and Safety
Code Section 50053. Table A-34 provides an estimate of the required subsidy by unit type.

4.2.3            Replacement Cost Analysis
A general rule of thumb suggests that the cost of preserving existing units is more cost effective than
replacing units through new construction. Replacement of these units with rehabilitated units may be
cost effective in some instances.

developers, replacement costs for multi-family units have been estimated. Construction cost estimates
include all hard and soft cost associated with construction in addition to per unit land costs. The
analysis assumes the replacement units are garden style apartments with parking provided on-site.
Square footage has been estimated as the average unit size per the prevailing sales in the region.
Land costs have been determined on a per unit basis. Table A-35 provides a summary of estimated
replacement costs per unit.

 Section 8 Rental Assistance Program – The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program provided
  rental assistance payment to owners of private market rate units on behalf of very low-
  income tenants. The City of Chula Vista participates in a consortium to provide assistance to
  renters based upon a subsidy that is the difference between the tenant’s affordable portion
  and fair market rent. Section 8 rental assistance is provided through the San Diego County
  Housing Authority to approximately 2,942 households from Chula Vista were assisted in FY
  2011-12. The average Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) for all Section 8 participants is
  $809.37. The estimated annual HAP payments for Chula Vista residents is approximately
  $28,574,000.

  consumer cooperatives can receive no interest capital advances from HUD for the
  construction of very low-income rental housing for seniors and disabled persons. This can be
  used in conjunction with Section 811, which can be used to develop group homes,
  independent living facilities, and intermediate care facilities. Eligible activities include
  acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance.
 HUD Low Income Housing Preservation and Residential Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA) –
  LIHPRHA was enacted in response to concern over the prepayment of Section 221(d)(3) and
  Section 236 assisted housing. Pursuant to LIHPRHA, HUD must offer a package of incentives
  to property owners to extend the low-income use restriction. HUD must guarantee an 8
  percent return on the recalculated equity of the property, provided the rents necessary to yield
  this return fall within a specified federate cost limit. The cost limits are either 120 percent of
  the FMR, or the prevailing rent in the local market. If HUD can provide the owner with this
  return, the owner must stay in the program or sell their property to a priority purchaser for a
  12-month period, or purchasers for 15 months (a “voluntary” sale). The owner is required to
  document this choice in a Plan of Action. If HUD cannot guarantee an 8 percent return, the
  owner may prepay only after offering the sale to a priority purchasers for 12 months or other
  qualified buyers for 15 months (a “mandatory” sale). Projects that are preserved under this
  method are required to maintain affordability restriction for the remaining useful life of the
  project, generally 50 years.

1.0                  CONSTRAINTS TO THE PROVISION
                     OF HOUSING
The provision of adequate and affordable housing is an important goal       One of the most
of the City. As a result, the City has proactively implemented a variety of significant         and
programs, incentives, and development standards to encourage the            difficult constraints to
development, maintenance, and improvement of affordable housing.            housing in Chula Vista
Despite these policies to encourage the development of affordable           and elsewhere in the
housing, a variety of factors including environmental, market               San Diego region is
mechanisms, and government regulations influence and occasionally           the high cost of land.
constrain the development of housing.
Actual or potential constraints on the provision of housing and the cost of housing affect the
development of new housing and the maintenance of existing units for all income levels. Governmental
and non-governmental constraints in Chula Vista are similar to those in other jurisdictions in the region
and are discussed below. One of the most significant and difficult constraints to housing in Chula Vista
and elsewhere in the San Diego region is the high cost of land.

                    GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
2.0
Governmental constraints can limit the operations of the public, private and nonprofit sectors making it
difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing and limiting supply in the region. Governmental
constraints are policies, development standards, requirements and actions imposed by the various levels
of government upon land and housing ownership and development. These constraints may include land
use controls, growth management measures, zoning and building codes, fees, processing and permit
procedures, and site improvement costs.
2.1          Land Use Controls
Land use controls take a number of forms that affect the development of residential units. These controls
include General Plan policies, zoning designations (and the resulting use restrictions, development
standards, and permit processing requirements), development fees and local growth management
programs.
2.1.1        General Plan
Each city and county is required by California Law to create a General Plan, which establishes policy
guidelines for development. The General Plan is the foundation of all land use controls in a jurisdiction.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan identifies the location, distribution and density of the land
uses within the City. General Plan densities are expressed as dwelling units per acre. The Chula Vista
General Plan identifies eleven residential land use designations, as shown in Table B-1.

Depending on land costs, to make a housing project economically feasible, certain densities are required.
The California Housing and Community Development Department has established affordability standards
based on density as follows:
                 Very Low- and Low-Income: minimum of 30 units per acre
                 Moderate-Income: minimum of 11-30 units per acre
                 Above Moderate-Income: Up to 11 units per acre (Market rate housing)
2.1.2       Zoning Code
The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is designed to protect and
promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the people. Chula Vista’s residential zoning designations,
as shown in Table B-2, controls both the use and development standards of a specific site, and
influences the housing to be developed.

             Minimum lot width shall be 30 feet for all lots developed with single-car garages and 40 feet for lots developed with two-car
           garages.

             A maximum of 45’ may be approved by the Design Review Board.
The R-E (Residential Estate), R-1 (Single-Family), R-2 (One- and Two-Family), and R-3 (Apartment
Residential) zones are the primary residential zones. Single-family uses are permitted by right in the R-E,
R-1 and R-2 zones, while duplex and multi-family developments are permitted by right in the R-2 and R-3
zones. Table B-2 shows zoning standards for each zone designed for residential uses within Chula Vista.
The majority of residential development is required to be built no higher than 2 ½ stories or 28 feet with
the exception of the MHP, P-C, and R-3-H zones. Within the R-3 zone, the Design Review Board can
approve a maximum height of 45 feet or 3 ½ stories for multi-family residential development. Review by
the Design Review Board ensures the development meets minimum design/architectural standards. The
Design Review Board cannot deny the height increase based on land use issues, only
design/architectural issues, and any denial would have to be based on requirements found in the
Zoning Ordinance and on standards found in the Design Manual, which equally apply to all such
developments. If the project is denied based on design/architectural standards, the developer has the
right to redesign or appeal. This design review process does not control land use and no operational
conditions may be attached to the project as part of the design review approval.
In addition, residential uses are conditionally allowed within the Administrative and Professional Office
(CO) zone and only for a mixed-use project in the Central Commercial, (CC) zone. Table B-3 describes
the type of residential uses that are conditionally allowed in the City.

Each SPA has a statement addressing the General Plan’s Housing Element, which includes identifying a
variety of housing opportunities and meeting State requirements. In some SPAs, developers are required
to enter into an agreement with the City to develop affordable housing.
The Urban Core Specific Plan (UCSP) was adopted in 2007. The UCSP demonstrates consistency with the
General Plan by providing a mix of compatible uses to facilitate the creation of a range of housing
opportunities and choices including commercial/residential mixed-use opportunities within an urban
setting, which adds to the traditional residential neighborhoods in and around the urban core of the City.

2.1.3 Site Improvements
Site improvements required to develop specific sites will vary depending on the location and existing
infrastructure. Possible improvements can include, but are not limited to upgraded sewer and water lines
to accommodate increased density; right-of-way dedication of the development site for arterials that do
not meet current level-of-service standards; and grading if there is excessive on-site slope. For new
developments, all improvements would have to be installed prior to occupancy or in-lieu fees paid.
Additionally, the City of Chula Vista has established standard street cross-sections and a variety of other
design standards related to public facilities, such as roadways and infrastructure facilities. As part of the
standard development review process, the City adopted the Street Design Standards Policy in October of
1989. This policy provides specific guidance and minimum street standards for the development of site
improvement as they relate to residential development. The standards established by the City are not
seen as an impediment to development, as the standards are minimum requirements to ensure health
and safety standards are met. The City does have more specific standards relative to the Master Planned
Communities, which utilize the City’s Subdivision Manual, in addition to design standards provided in the
City’s Street Design Standards Policy. Table B-4 shows residential street design standards as depicted in
the Street Design Standards Policy and the City’s Subdivision Manual. To date, no project applicant has
indicated these standards impose constraints to development feasibility.
                                                                       Table B-4

2.1.4         Parking Requirements
Table B-5 summarizes the parking requirements that exist in the City. Parking requirements do not strain
the development of housing directly. However, since parking in the City is required to be located on the
same lot or property. These requirements may reduce the amount of available lot area of residential
development. The Zoning Code allows off-site parking with an agreement between the property owner
and developer, and shared parking provisions have been implemented with process improvements in
2010,
                                                                  Table B-5

2.2 Growth Management
The following programs and plans have been adopted to guide future development of Chula Vista:
Growth Management Element: The Growth Management Element of the General Plan is designed to
guide the demands for growth and development, revitalization and environmental protection to improve
the quality for current and future residents of Chula Vista.
Growth Management Program: The Growth Management Program was adopted in 1991 as serves as
the primary mechanism for the Growth Management Element of the General Plan. The program sets the
foundation for carrying out City development policies by directing and coordinating future growth to
ensure timely provision of public facilities and services. The program establishes thresholds for eleven
areas affecting Chula Vista, including traffic, police, fire and emergency services, schools, libraries, parks
and recreation, water, sewer, drainage, air quality, and economics.
Growth Management Ordinance: This ordinance was adopted in 1991 and codifies Growth Management
intents, standards, requirements, and procedures related to the review and approval of development
projects.
2.3 Density Bonus
State law allows a developer to increase the density of a residential development by at least 25 percent if
provisions are made to allocate 20 percent of the units for low- and moderate-income housing. An
additional incentive or financial equivalent (such as modified development standards or reduction/
wavier of application or development impact fees) is granted to all residential development meeting the
20 percent density bonus requirement for low- and moderate-income housing.
2.4 Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various types
of housing for all economic segments of the population and for special housing types to meet various
needs.

                                                                                         APPENDIX B
2.4.1        Multi-Family Dwellings
Multiple-family housing makes up approximately 29 percent of the housing stock in Chula Vista
according to the 2010 U.S. Census. The Zoning Ordinance provides for multi-family developments by right
in the R-2 and R-3 zones. Multiple family are allowed by conditional use permit within the
Administrative and Professional Office (CO) zone and only for a mixed-use project in the Central
Commercial, (CC) zone.
2.4.1        Manufactured Homes and Mobilehomes
Manufactured homes and mobile homes are permitted in all residential districts, exclusive mobilehome
park zone, and mobile home parks. Manufactured homes may be located in any residential district
where a single-family dwelling is permitted and are subject to the same restrictions, provided that the
manufactured home receives a certificate of compatibility as part of the zoning approval.
2.4.2        Accessory Second Dwelling Units
In response to state mandate, an accessory second dwelling unit ordinance was originally adopted in
2003 to allow accessory dwelling units in A, R-E, R-1 and P-C zones designated for single family
residential development. In 2007, the ordinance was amended to modify a variety of development
standards such as unit size. Accessory Second Dwelling Units are a potential source of affordable
housing. These units are self-contained housing units that are secondary to primary single-family
residential dwellings on the same lot. It is the City’s intent to allow Accessory Second Dwelling Units as a
source providing a range of affordable housing through a ministerial process provided certain conditions
are met.
2.4.3        Senior Housing
Housing development for seniors may be allowed in any zone, as an Unclassified Use, (19.54.020(P))
except R-1, R-2, C-V, C-T and industrial zones. Since elderly persons require different dwelling
characteristics, developments for seniors require a conditional use permit. Additionally, the Planning
Commission and City Council can make exceptions to development standards for senior developments,
such as parking, density, and setbacks pursuant to CVMC 19.58.390.
                                                                                Page AB-11

                                                                                           APPENDIX B
2.4.4        Convalescent Hospitals, Rest Homes, and Nursing Homes
Convalescent hospitals, rest homes, and nursing homes (for the aged, crippled, or mentally disabled of all
ages) may be considered for location in any zone, as Unclassified Uses, subject to a Conditional Use
Permit. The purpose of this review is to determine that the characteristics of these uses are not
incompatible with the type of uses permitted in surrounding areas.
Specific site requirements for convalescent hospitals and nursing homes include location criteria and
parking standards. Specifically, section 19.58.110 of the Municipal Code, requires convalescent hospitals
to be located on a collector or thoroughfare one a minimum parcel of one acre in any residential zone.
Requirements for nursing homes include approval and license from proper agencies concerning health
and safety and an off-street loading area, in addition to specific requirements in an unenclosed
incinerator is provided. The City of Chula Vista regulates parking standard by designated use. One space
for every three beds is required for both a convalescent hospital and nursing home.
Further, the following findings must be made for homes for mentally disabled children:
        The size of the parcel shall provide adequate light and air in proportion to the number of
         residents;
        The location of windows and open play areas shall be situated as to not adversely impact
         adjoining uses, and;
        Spacing between facilities shall not affect that character of the surrounding neighborhood.
The City of Chula Vista does have a set of particular conditions or use restrictions for adding to facilities
with greater than six persons. Facilities with six or fewer residents do not require a business license or a
discretionary permit.
2.4.5        Residential Care Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act and Community Care Facilities Act state that
mentally, physically, developmentally disabled persons and children and adults who require supervised
care are entitled to live in normal residential settings. To that end, State law requires that licensed family
care homes, foster homes, and group homes serving six or fewer persons be treated like single-family
homes. Therefore, such facilities are allowed by right in all residential zones and are not subject to a use
permit, building standards, or regulations not otherwise required of single-family homes in the same
zone. A program to specifically update the Zoning Code to allow residential care facilities for seven or
more persons in residential zones with a conditional use permit and imposing a 300 foot spacing
requirement between residential care facilities and parking requirements for employees and per number
of beds is included in Part II of the Housing Element.

2.4.7         Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those who have difficulty performing certain
functions (seeing, hearing, talking, walking, climbing stairs, lifting or carrying), or has difficulty with certain
social functions. Persons, who are unable to perform one or more activities, use assistive devices for
mobility or who needs assistance from others to perform basic daily tasks is considered to have a severe
disability.
In Chula Vista, the following categories of disabilities occur within the following populations:
        Sensory Disability
        Physical Disability
        Mental Disability
        Self-care Disability
        Outside Home Disability
        Employment Disability
As shown in Table B-6, the City of Chula Vista has a resident capacity of 796 persons in care facilities.
There are four adult care facilities and the Veteran’s Home provides housing options for senior veterans.

Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
The City of Chula Vista, as a matter of federal and state law, complies with the requirements of the
Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to provide for reasonable
accommodation in the zoning code and other land use regulations when accommodations provide for
equal opportunity for access to dwelling units. The City does not require special building codes or
burdensome project review to construct, improve, or convert housing for persons with disabilities. Per
Chula Vista Municipal Code Chapter 1.50, persons with disabilities can make an application requesting
reasonable accommodations in the application of zoning, land use, or building laws, rules, policies and
                                                                                          Page AB-13

                                                                              HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                         APPENDIX B
procedures of the City to allow for equal access to housing under the federal Fair Housing Act and the
California Fair Employment and Housing.
The City of Chula Vista currently has an application procedure for unreasonable hardship exceptions for
accessibility issues through Application Form 4607. The application provides a formalized process for the
granting of exceptions from the requirements of State of California Title 24 accessibility. The application
is available at the public counter and via the City’s website.
Parking Standards for facilities for persons with disabilities may be waived provided the need for reduced
or modified standards can be justified, based on Title 24. Modifications to these standards include new
construction and remodel of existing residential development.
The City of Chula Vista defines “Family” as “an individual, or two or more persons, related by blood,
marriage of adoption, or a group included unrelated individuals bearing the generic character of and
living together as a relatively permanent bona fide housekeeping unit sharing such needs as cooking
facilities” (CVMC 19.04.092). Therefore, the occupancy standards for unrelated individuals residing in the
same unit are not considered differently than related individuals.
There is no established standard for the location requirements of facilities tailored for persons with
disabilities. The Municipal Code states that facilities shall be sited in a manner that does not negatively
impact the character of a neighborhood. The City of Chula Vista believes this general requirement does
not have a demonstrable negative impact on the development or cost of providing facilities for the
disabled.
Building Codes
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates the access and adaptability
of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. The Plan Review and Inspection Sections of the
Development Services Department conduct thorough reviews of all new construction projects to confirm
the work meets the appropriate State of California accessibility standards. In the case of residential
construction, there are very few accessibility requirements for single-family dwellings and the
requirements for multi-family structures only apply when the building is newly constructed. However, the
City does have a program to encourage the implementation of enhanced accessibility features in
residential construction. The City has adopted a program to conduct comprehensive field investigations
in response to inquiries about the potential lack of accessibility features that should have been included
during original construction. A formal enforcement process is in place to insure any detected violations
are corrected in a timely manner.

                                                                                        APPENDIX B
2.4.8       Farm Employee Housing
The City does have land within a designated agricultural zone. Additionally, agricultural uses are
permitted by right within the Public/Quasi Public (P-Q) zone and crop and tree farming is allowed within
the Residential-Estate (R-E) zone. As an urbanized community, very little land within the City of Chula
Vista has been used for agricultural uses.
The 2010 Census shows there were only 119 persons in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and
mining industry, making up less than 1 percent of Chula Vista’s labor force (see Table A-2). Given the
extremely limited presence of farmworkers in the community, the City has not identified a need for
specialized farmworker housing beyond overall programs for housing affordability. Included within Part II
of the Housing Element is a program to specifically update the City’s Zoning Ordinance, within one year
of adoption of the Housing Element, to comply with Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the State Health and
Safety Code regarding employee housing.
2.4.9       Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one room units (generally 100-250 sq. ft.) occupied
by a single individual, and may either have shared or private kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs are
rented on a weekly to monthly basis typically without rental deposit, and can provide an entry point into
the housing market for extremely low income individuals, formerly homeless and disabled persons. While
Chula Vista’s Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly address Single Room Occupancy uses, they would be
treated the same as motels and hotels, which are permitted in the C-T (Commercial Thoroughfare) and
conditionally permitted in the I (Industrial) zones. Hotels and timeshares are also permitted within Urban
Core Districts 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 and Corridor Districts 1, 3 and 4 and
conditionally permitted in Village Districts 2, 3, and 4. A program has been added to the Housing Element
to revise the Zoning Ordinance to explicitly specify SROs as a conditionally permitted use within these
zones, accommodating SROs both as new development and adaptive reuse of existing structures. The city
will ensure zoning standards facilitate the provision of SROs, with conditions of approval limited to
ensuring compatibility, focusing on the SRO use and not the users of the facility.

                                                                                         APPENDIX B
2.4.10           Transitional and Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters
State Housing Law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for the placement of
homeless shelters and transitional housing. Additionally, they must not unduly discourage or deter these
uses. Currently, the City would classify a homeless shelter as a facility that provides supportive services
and housing needs, including emergency shelter, transitional housing, social services, mental health
services and general health services.
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50675.2) defines "transitional housing" and "transitional
housing development" as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to
another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less
than six months.
Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the
homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living situation.
Transitional housing can take several forms, including single-family homes, and multi-family apartments
and typically offers case management and support services to help return people to independent living
(often six months to two years).
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless, people with
disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. California Health and Safety Code (Section
50675.2) defines “supportive housing” as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
low income adults with disabilities, and that is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the
supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing
his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. Target population includes adults
with low incomes having one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse,
or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5, commencing with Section 4500, of the Welfare and
Institutions Code) and may, among other populations, include families with children, elderly persons,
young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans,
or homeless people.
Similar to transitional housing, supportive housing can take several forms, including group quarters with
beds, single-family homes, and multi-family apartments. Supportive housing usually includes a service
component either on- or off-site to assist the tenants in retaining the housing, improving his or her
health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.

                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                           APPENDIX B
Currently, transitional housing facilities and supportive housing are not included in the Chula Vista
Zoning Code. Historically, the City has treated transitional and supportive housing as an “unclassified”
use similar to convalescent homes, rest homes, nursing homes, and senior housing in the Chula Vista
Zoning Ordinance, which allows such uses in any zone subject to a conditional use permit.
The City will amend its Zoning Code, within one year of adoption of the Housing Element, to define
transitional and supportive housing. For transitional or supportive housing facilities that operate as
regular housing developments, such uses may be permitted where housing is otherwise permitted. For
transitional or supportive housing facilities that operate similar to group quarters, such facilities will be
permitted similar to large residential care facilities. Potential conditions for approval of large residential
care facilities (for more than six persons) as transitional or supportive housing may include hours of
operation, security, loading requirements, noise regulations, and restrictions on loitering. Conditions would
be similar to those for other similar uses and would not serve to constrain the development of such
facilities.
Senate Bill 2, enacted in October 2007, requires local governments to identify one or more zoning
categories that allow emergency shelters (year-round shelters for the homeless) without discretionary
review. Emergency shelters are intended to provide temporary overnight accommodations with a
limitation on stay. Case management is sometimes offered.
The statute permits the City to apply limited conditions to the approval of ministerial permits for
emergency shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-
round shelter and accommodate the City’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population. Chula
Vista’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population is estimated to be 234 individuals.
Historically, the City has treated emergency shelters for the homeless as an “unclassified” use similar to
convalescent homes, rest homes, nursing homes, and senior housing in the Chula Vista Zoning
Ordinance, which allows such use in any zone subject to a conditional use permit. Another similar use
to emergency shelters are large residential care facilities (7 or more persons) which are also allowed
within all land use districts within the Urban Core Specific plan (UCSP) by conditional use permit.
However, the Zoning Ordinance does not specifically address the provision of year-round shelters
pursuant to State law.
The Zoning Ordinance does allow for the development of homeless shelters on church facilities to aid in
the provision of homeless facilities. Specifically, Chula Vista Municipal Code (CVMC) Section 19.58.110
establishes provisions for the development of temporary homeless shelters as an accessory to church
use.
Services for the homeless are conditionally permitted uses on CPF (Community Purpose Facility)
designated land in planned communities (CVMC §19.48.025.C.3). Accordingly, the City requires 1.39
acres of net usable land (including setbacks) to be designated for a CPF site per 1,000 population in any
                                                                                Page AB-17

                                                                                           APPENDIX B
new master planned community. Many CPF sites have already been established and developed with
uses, such as churches. There are currently 34.4 acres of land within eastern Chula Vista designated as
CPF and vacant. These properties would potentially be available for emergency shelters for the homeless
but would require a conditional use permit. As sectional planning area (SPA) plan(s) and planned
community district regulations for new planned communities are developed and adopted, CPF sites will
continue to be designated per CVMC §19.48.025.C.3. There are still four planning areas, with a total
residential capacity of over 7,500 units, remaining within eastern Chula Vista to adopt its SPA. The City
will look at revising this section to allow for homeless shelter services by right rather than a conditional
use permit.
Included within Part II of the Housing Element are programs to specifically update the City’s Zoning
Ordinance, within one year of adoption of the Housing Element, to identify zone(s) where emergency
shelters are a permitted use, without a CUP or any discretionary permit requirements and to define
transitional and supportive housing within the zoning ordinance. More specifically, the City will amend
its Zoning Code within one year of adoption of the Housing Element to explicitly address emergency
shelters. The City will examine and establish objective development and management standards such
as:
        The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the facility.
        Off-street parking based on demonstrated need.
        The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas.
        The provision of on-site management.
        The length of stay.
        Lighting.
        Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
The City has identified the General Industrial (I-G) and Research and Limited Industrial (I-R) zones within
the Bayfront Local Coastal Plan (“Bayfront Specific Plan”) as appropriate zones to permit homeless
shelters by right, without discretionary review. While designated as industrial zones, permitted uses are
more commercial, administrative and office use in nature due to the location of the properties along
Chula Vista’s bayfront and the protection of local coastal resources. With the exception of United
Technologies (formerly Goodrich Aerostructures), properties zoned I-G and I-R within the Bayfront Local
Coastal Plan consist of 7 acres of vacant properties and 46 acres of developed and underused
multitenant commercial and office buildings. Recently in 2012, the City and the California Coastal
Commission approved the Bayfront Master Plan that will transform Chula Vista’s 556 acres of
underused industrial bayfront into a thriving residential, employment and resort
destination on San Diego Bay.
More specifically, properties zoned I-G and I-R are located along Chula Vista’s along major transportation
corridors (I-5 freeway and the San Diego Trolley Blue Line- the most heavily used trolley line in San
Diego) and the Bayshore Bike Way and provides direct access to appropriate services. Approximately 53

acres in the Bayrfont are designated as I-R and I-G. The average size of parcels under the I-G
designation is 4 acres and 5 acres for I-R parcels. Properties designated I-G along Bay Boulevard, south
of I Street and north of Palomar Street have the most realistic potential for adaptation for reuse as
emergency housing offering overnight accommodations for the 234 unsheltered persons in Chula Vista.
These properties are currently developed with older and underutilized multitenant office and commercial
buildings totaling 30 acres. These areas are within 2,000 to 3,000 feet from the City’s two major
transportation hubs at the H Street Trolley and Palomar Street Trolley stops, Both trolley areas are
surrounded by commercial centers offering local grocery stores and other major retail uses. Those
properties just north of Palomar Street are also within 3,000 feet of the County of San Diego’s Health and
Human Services South Bay office, offering public health services and other social services. The South
County Career Center is directly located within the properties themselves. These sites offer adequate
capacity for at least one emergency shelter, as required by State law and provide a realistic opportunity
for such uses.
2.5 Building Codes and Enforcement
Building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and ensure the construction
of safe and decent housing. They also have the potential to increase the cost of housing construction or
maintenance.
Building Codes: The City of Chula Vista has adopted the 2010 edition of the California Building Code,
which establishes certain construction standards for all residential buildings. These codes are designed to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare of Chula Vista’s residents. Code enforcement in the City is
performed on a complaint basis through the Code Enforcement Section of the Development Services
Department. The City has made local amendments to the California Building Code, as contained in
Chapter 15.08 of the City’s Municipal Code for the purpose of further defining administrative procedures
and addressing health and safety concerns. No local amendments are perceived as creating a
demonstrable constraint to housing development.
Americans with Disabilities Act: The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) are federal laws that are intended to assist in providing safe and accessible
housing. The City of Chula Vista has the authority to enforce laws and regulations (California Code of
Regulations (CCR) Title 24) when evaluating construction projects. Compliance with these codes may
increase the cost of housing construction as well as the cost of rehabilitating older units, which may be
required to comply with current codes.
Uniform Housing Code: The Uniform Housing Code provides complete requirements affecting
conservation and rehabilitation of housing. It is compatible with the Uniform Building Code.
                                                                              Page AB-19

                                                                                             HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                          APPENDIX B
Implementation of the requirements contained in the Uniform Housing Code may influence the feasibility
of conservation and rehabilitation efforts of existing housing units in the City.
2.6 Development Fees
Various development and permit fees are charged by the City and other agencies to cover administrative
processing costs associated with development. These fees ensure quality development and the provision
of adequate public services. However, often times, these fees are often passed down to renters and
homeowners in the rent/purchase price of the unit and therefore, affect the affordability of housing.
Table B-7 summarizes the findings of the development fees for the City of Chula Vista and three other
cities in San Diego County.

Overall, planning and development impact fees in the City represent 8-13 percent of the overall value.
The City has waived and deferred impact fees for affordable housing projects and will review the
appropriateness of reducing, waiving, and/or deferring impact and/or processing fees for units affordable
to very low and low income households, including senior housing, and apartment units, and housing for
special needs groups, including agricultural employees, emergency /transitional housing, and housing for
persons with disabilities, to make the development of such units more financially feasible.
2.7 Local Processing and Permit Procedures
Considerable holding costs are associated with delays in processing development applications and plans.
The City of Chula Vista’s development process is designed to accommodate applicants.
In 2009, the Development Services Department launched a comprehensive review of the City’s
development review process to determine improvements that could streamline processes, make them
more predictable by increased transparency, improve public access and reduce processing costs. The

                                                                                          APPENDIX B
Department worked with an Oversight Committee comprised of developers, business owners, community
organizations, engineers, architects, and contractors to develop process improvement recommendations.
The City implemented the improvements, which include modifications to the administrative procedures for
planning entitlements including changes to the development permit intake process; delegating permit
decision levels; consolidating hearings for projects with multiple permits; streamlining the appeal process;
modifying regulations to parking regulations; reducing review authority redundancies between the
Planning Commission and the Chula Vista Redevelopment Corporation; and improving public
participation.
Additionally, amendments were made to various sections of the Chula Vista Municipal Code related to
development review administration procedures; parking regulations, non conforming uses/structures;
administrative procedures for the subdivision of land; and a new comprehensive citywide approach for
public participation.
Three levels of decision-making bodies govern the review process in Chula Vista: the City Council,
Planning Commission, and Design Review Board. Smaller, less complex projects do not require a public
hearing and may be approved through the Zoning Administrator.
The R-E (Residential Estate), R-1 (Single-Family), R-2 (One- and Two-Family), and R-3 (Apartment
Residential) zones are the primary residential zones in the City of Chula Vista. Single-family uses are
permitted by right in the R-E, R-1 and R-2 zones, while duplex and multi-family developments are
permitted by right in the R-2 and R-3 zones.
Multi-family and/or mixed-use developments are allowed in the Administrative and Professional Office
and Central Commercial zones. The Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator may grant a
conditional use permit if these decision makers find evidence that meets the following under Section
19.14.080 of the Municipal Code:
    •   That the proposed use at the particular location is necessary or desirable to provide a service or
        facility which will contribute to the general well-being of the neighborhood or the community;
    •   That such use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the
        health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to
        property or improvements in the vicinity;
    •   That the proposed use will comply with the regulations and conditions specified in Section
        19.14.080 of the Municipal Code for such use;
    •   That the granting of a conditional use will not adversely affect the general plan of the City or the
        adopted plan of any governmental agency;
                                                                                Page AB-23

                                                                                       APPENDIX B
    •  That the proposed conditional use, if located in the coastal zone, is consistent with the certified
       local coastal program and is consistent with the intent of the zoning district.
Mixed commercial-residential projects may be allowed in the C-C zone either by right or upon the
issuance of a conditional use permit depending upon the land use designation of the Chula Vista
General Plan. Any mixed commercial-residential project shall be subject to the following additional
standards and guidelines:
    •  The commercial and residential components shall be planned and implemented together;
    •  Mixed use projects shall be developed to be internally compatible between the different land
       uses, and may include restrictions on commercial uses and/or business hours in order to avoid
       conflicts with residential uses. Mixed use projects shall comply with the performance standards
       set forth in Chapters 19.66 (Performance Standards) and 19.68 (Performance Standards and
       Noise Control) CVMC;
    •  The maximum allowable residential density shall be governed by the provisions of the R-3 zone
       based on the total project area, less any area devoted exclusively to commercial use, including
       commercial parking and circulation areas. The approved density may be significantly less than
       the maximum allowable density depending on site-specific factors, including the density and
       relationship of surrounding residential areas, if any;
    •  Parking, access and circulation shall be largely independent for the commercial and residential
       components of the project. Each use component shall provide off-street parking in accordance
       with City standards, as provided in Chapter 19.62 CVMC;
    •  The residential component shall at a minimum meet the private and common usable open space
       requirements of the R-3 H zone. For residential developments with studio and/or one-bedroom
       units (only), the usable open space or courtyards in commercial areas which are fully accessible
       to residents may be used by the residents and counted towards the open space requirements;
       however, open space intended for use by the residents shall not be accessible to the commercial
       area;
    •  Front yard setbacks may be reduced from the minimum standard provided in CVMC 19.36.060 to
       allow storefronts along street frontages to maintain a pedestrian orientation at the street level
       and/or reduce effects on adjacent residential uses. The reduction in front yard setback will be
       determined through evaluation of the site design and approved by the decision making body for
       the permit;

                                                                                HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                             APPENDIX B
     •   Side and rear yard setbacks shall be a minimum of 10 feet and may be increased to provide a
         sensitive transition where adjacent to single-family residential neighborhoods. The increase in
         side and/or rear yard setback will be determined through evaluation of the site design and
         approved by the decision making body for the permit. Where such yard is contiguous and
         parallel with an alley, one-half the width of such alley shall be assumed to be a portion of such
         yard;
     •   Additional design standards may be required to mitigate adjacency issues, and may include:
             1. A six-foot-high solid or decorative metal fence may be required pursuant to CVMC
             19.58.150 and 19.58.360, as may be applicable. If the fence is solid, it shall have design
             treatment and be articulated every six to eight feet to avoid presenting a blank wall to the
             street or adjacent property.
             2. All exterior lighting shall focus internally and shall be kept within the property lines to
             decrease the light pollution onto the neighboring properties.
             3. Screening and/or buffers shall be required to obscure features such as dumpsters, rear
             entrances, utility and maintenance structures and loading facilities.
             4. Building orientation and design shall be cognizant of adjacent low-density uses, i.e.,
             balconies shall step back a minimum of 10 feet to avoid overlooking rear yards of adjacent
             residential uses.
Additionally caretaker units are conditionally allowed within the Research Industrial, Limited Industrial,
General Industrial, and Public/ Quasi Public zones.
All new or redesigned multi-family development is subject to the design review process, either as a public
hearing or through an administrative process (with no public hearing). Section 19.14.582 describes the
responsibilities of the Design Review Board as follows:
“The responsibility of the Design Review Board shall be limited to the review of site plans, landscaping,
and the exterior design of buildings, for consistency with City-approved design guidelines. In reviewing a
residential project, the DRB shall consider the costs/benefits of any recommended improvement as

As shown in Table B-8, processing times vary considerably depending on the complexity of the project.
Other more complex projects, like subdivisions, rezoning applications, and other discretionary projects
necessitate a higher level of review and thus have a longer processing timeline. Single-family homes
and tenant improvements are reviewed by a ministerial process.
2.8 Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Due to Chula Vista’s natural resources, sensitive habitats and coastal location, there are areas within the
City that may be exposed to a variety of environmental hazards and resources which constrain
development. Additionally, with many lands east of I-805 vacant and undeveloped and proposed
increased densities in the older western Chula Vista, providing adequate levels of service for the
infrastructure needs of the community can pose a challenge.

                                                                                         APPENDIX B
2.8.1        Environmental Constraints
The City of Chula Vista has identified areas where land development should be carefully controlled. The
following hazards may impact future development of residential units in Chula Vista.
Seismic Hazards: No known Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones, or active faults traverse Chula Vista,
traces of the potentially active La Nacion fault zone cross the City in a generally north-south direction
through the central portion of the City. The nearest active fault is located 14 miles northwest of the City.
Seismic activity within the region can cause strong ground motion, seismically-induced liquefaction,
ground surface rupture, landslides, and seismically induced settlement.
Flooding: The floodplains of the Sweetwater and Otay Rivers and several of their tributaries have the
potential to flood during a 100-year storm. Portions of the City are also subject to flood inundation in the
event of failure of the Sweetwater, Upper Otay, or Savage (Lower Otay) dams. The potential for significant
wave damage (i.e. tsunamis) is considered low due to the City’s relatively protected part of the San Diego
Bay.
Fire Hazards: A large portion of the City of Chula Vista is located within a High and Very High hazard
area for wildfires. Implementing appropriate techniques, consistent with the Chula Vista MSCP Subarea
Plan and the City’s UWIC can reduce such hazards.
Hazardous Materials and Waste: Hazardous materials are used, transported, produced, and stored for a
variety of purposes in Chula Vista. Federal, state, and county agencies closely regulate hazardous
materials to protect health and the environment. In addition, the City uses zoning regulations,
environmental review of proposed projects in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act,
and the issuance of business licenses to regulate facilities that use, store, and handle hazardous
materials and waste.
Contaminated sites are also identified as an environmental hazard. The majority of the known and
potentially contaminated sites in Chula Vista are located in older industrial and commercial areas west of
Interstate 805 and along Main Street east of Interstate 805.
Noise: Residential land uses are considered the most sensitive to loud noise. In Chula Vista the most
prevalent source of noise is from the transportation system, including the freeways, the San Diego Trolley,
and freight service.
                                                                               Page AB-27

                                                                             HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                          APPENDIX B
Environmental constraints have been reviewed as part of the Multiple Species Conservation Program
(MSCP). The development sites within master planned communities within eastern Chula Vista have
been determined by the MSCP as developable. Those areas with environmental constraints have been
designated as Open Space.
Development in Western Chula Vista, specifically within the Urban Core Specific Plan has been evaluated
for potential environmental constraints. Through the Urban Core Specific Plan’s Environmental Impact
Report, all potential environmentally sensitive sites have been identified, mapped and the specific actions
to mitigate these sites are a component to the Environmental Impact Report’s Mitigation Program. No
site may be developed without prior clearance from local, state, and/or federal agencies and specific
mitigations completed. These constraints were a factor in evaluating future development potential of
infill and vacant sites, as discussed in Appendix C of this document.
2.8.2        Infrastructure Constraints
Chula Vista strives to maintain existing infrastructure and meet future demands. Challenges posed by
new development include extending service to unserved areas, keeping pace with construction, and
adjusting for changes in designated density. Challenges posed by density increases in older parts of the
City include repairing existing deficiencies and maintaining and possible upsizing older infrastructure.
Water: The majority of the region’s water supply must be imported in order to meet demands. Chula Vista
has historically received the majority of its water supply from the San Diego Water Authority (CWA). The
CWA generally imports from 75 to 95 percent of its water from the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) of
Southern California. Imported water comes from the Colorado River and the State Water Project. Chula
Vista’s primary water agencies are the Otay Water District and the Sweetwater Authority. A third water
agency, the California American Water Company, also provides water to a small portion of Chula Vista.
The Sweetwater Authority provides water service to the western Chula Vista area. Future demand for
capital improvements are addressed by the Sweetwater Authority and paid through its development
impact fee structure. Based upon this analysis, future water demands can be met through existing and
planned water facilities to accommodate the City’s regional housing need of 12,861 units.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies that grant priority
to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower income households. The legislation
also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the approval of development that includes
housing affordable to lower-income households, unless specific written findings are made. The City will
provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to the Otay Water District and Sweetwater Authority
within 30 days of adoption. The City will also continue to coordinate with the District to ensure affordable
housing developments receive priority water service provision.

Sewer: The City maintains and operates sewer facilities that feed into a larger regional City of San Diego
Metropolitan Sewage System for treatment and disposal. Chula Vista currently operates and maintains
approximately 400 miles of sewer pipelines. In addition the City must also address system upgrades and
expansion to accommodate new sewer connections, especially in the Eastern Chula Vista. The City has
purchased 19.8 million gallons per day of capacity rights from the Metropolitan Sewage System. This
capacity is sufficient to accommodate existing housing and the City’s share of the regional housing need
for 12,861 housing units. To evaluate future demand beyond the Housing Element’s planning period the
City is currently working on acquiring additional treatment capacity to meet future demands, based on
2030 estimates.
Drainage: Chula Vista is part of the San Diego watershed area. The City maintains a system of storm
water pipelines, box culverts, lined and natural channels, and water detention facilities. Current facilities
have adequate capacity for projected short and mid-term development, although drainage infrastructure
may need to be constructed or modified to meet the San Diego watershed area’s National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements. Long-term build-out includes major
development in the eastern portion of the City that will add significant amounts of storm water to the
existing system.

                    NON-GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
3.0
A number of private sector factors contribute to the cost of housing. The primary market constraints to
the development of new housing are the costs of constructing and purchasing new housing. The
following is a discussion of the primary factors that impact affordable housing development.
3.1 Economy
Overall economic conditions in the last five years have had a tremendous impact on the housing
construction industry. California’s housing market peaked in the summer of 2005 with a dramatic
increase in the State’s housing supply coupled with low interest rates. The period between 2007 and
2009, however, reflects a time of significant change.
By December 2007, according to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research, the US was in a
recession. The emergence of Sub-Prime mortgage loan losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed
other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. The financial crisis is linked to declining underwriting
standards and risky lending practices by financial institutions and the growing trend of securitization of
real estate mortgages. With loan losses mounting and the fall of major financial institutions, the lending
market collapsed and home prices decreased and continue to fall.
Double-digit decreases in median sale prices were recorded throughout the State. These relatively lower
home prices initially allowed for an increase homes sold due to greater affordability. However, as a result
of the home mortgage industry collapse, more stringent loan underwriting was put in place, with lenders
closely scrutinize household income, credit history, and the overall risk of the loan. While interest rates
have not climbed dramatically, the supply of available housing has risen, and sales prices have
decreased, the limited access to home financing and available credit has reduced the pool of buyers able
to purchase a home, particularly lower income buyers. Furthermore, the lack of credit not only affects
home buyers and homeowners but also developers and rental property owners who want to improve
their properties.
                                                                              Page AB-31

                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                               APPENDIX B
Under these current economic times, with high unemployment rates and increasing foreclosures, has
made even greater the need for affordable housing. Despite the need, the tightening of capital for
construction and permanent financing and available credit has made it difficult for home builders to get
construction loans, would-be buyers are struggling to obtain mortgages, and home sellers can't find
qualified buyers. The City has in turn has seen a dramatic decrease in housing production.

3.2 Vacant and Underutilized Land
Chula Vista’s eastern area provides an extensive stock of developable land. Most of the development
occurring within the eastern area is contained within master planned developments. Additionally, vacant
land in the western area of the City is minimal due to its built out conditions. Therefore, the limited
availability of raw vacant land has a direct affect on land prices. A thorough analysis of vacant and
underutilized land is conducted in Appendix C of this Housing Element.

3.3 Housing Costs and Land Prices
The cost of land directly influences the cost of housing. Land prices are determined by a number of
factors, most important of which are land availability and permitted development density. As land
becomes scarcer, the prices of land increase. In terms of development, land prices have a positive
correlation with the number of units permitted on each lot. In recent years, land prices have increased
due to the success of the housing market in Southern California.
Housing prices in the San Diego region experienced expansive growth in the early 2000’s. With the
relatively low employment rate and job creation trends in the region at that time, demand for housing
was high. Since much of the region was not been able to keep up with the rate of demand for housing,
available supply has been limited. This limited supply has had a direct influence on the cost of housing
and the median price of homes peaked in 2005.
Housing price appreciation has since cooled with the recession. This trend is predicted to continue as
unemployment and foreclosures also continue to rise and limited financing available. Tables B-10
through B-12 provide a summary of housing price trends in Chula Vista.

3.3 Construction and Land Costs
Construction costs are primarily determined by the cost of materials and labor, but are also influenced by
market demands and market-based changes in the cost of materials. Costs of materials rose
dramatically between 2004-2006. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
the overall cost of residential construction materials rose 22 percent between 2005-206, with steel costs
increasing 63 percent and the cost of cement increasing 27 percent. With the economic downturn, the
price of construction materials began to decrease and then leveling out in the last year.
Seventeen residential lots were listed in MLS for sale in Chula Vista as of January 2013. The majority of
these lots (ten of the seventeen) were custom home lots within a gated community in the master
planned communities of eastern Chula Vista. Average cost for lots within the gated community was $18
per square foot. Three other single family lots in the south west area of Chula Vista were listed for an

                                                                             HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                         APPENDIX B
average of $10 per square foot. The MLS listed three commercial/multifamily lots that could
accommodate mixed use or multi-family residential ranging from $32 – 48 per square foot, with an
average cost of $39 per square foot.
The cost of construction depends on the type of unit being built and on the quality of the product being
produced. Garden style apartments typically provide significant housing supply for low and moderate
income families. Based upon pro-forma modeling, the new construction of a 50 unit garden apartment
development in San Diego County would cost approximately $12.9 million ($258,000 per unit or
approximately $275 a square foot) in 2011 dollars.
At these costs, it would require a monthly rent of $1,960 per unit to break even with the costs of
development. Affordable rent at 50-60 percent of the area median income would be approximately $850
a month. The difference in what a very low and low income household could afford to pay and what it
would cost support the development is $1,110 a month. Given the financing gap, it is infeasible to
produce such housing for very low and low income families without significant subsidies. Most new
apartments are therefore, beyond the affordability of low income households without doubling up in
units or overpaying in rent.
3.4 Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher interest rates
increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decreases the range of housing that a household can
afford. Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and lower payments for the homebuyer.
Typically when interest rates rise the market compensates by decreasing housing prices. Similarly, when
interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. Often times, there is a lag in the market. So when
interest rates rise, housing prices continue to stay high until the market can catch up. It is this period
when it is the most difficult for lower-income households to purchase a home.
Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is little that local
governments can do to affect these rates. Figure B-2 shows interest rates have generally fallen since the
1980s and hitting all time lows in 2011.
In the 1980s, mortgage rates were in the double-digits, hitting a high of 16.63%. Mortgage rates started
to see a drop in the 1990’s, where it started at approximately 10 percent in 1990 and then hovered at
7.5% from 1993 to 1999. By the new century, the average mortgage rate began to decrease even more,
with rates falling below 6 percent in 2003. Rates continued to decline and averaged 4.6 percent in 2011.

In looking at homeownership rates, they are consistent with the rise and fall of interest rates. From 1990
through the mid 1990’s, the overall U.S. homeownership rate has remained at 64 percent. Since the
1990’s, homeownership rates have increased to a peak in 2004 at 69.2 percent.
As would be expected, as interest rates have decreased, Chula Vista and the nation saw an
unprecedented increase in housing prices between 1997 and 2005. Given federal tax policy (exemption
of housing from capital gains) favoring housing as an investment, historically low interest rates, lax
lending standards resulting from the deregulation of banking, and speculative fever, enthusiasm for
homeownership remained high despite the escalating price.
In the early 2000’s, the trend of lowered lending standards and low mortgage interest rates made loans
more readily available to a larger pool of potential buyers. With low interest rates, “creative” financing (for
example, zero down, interest payment only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (for
example, aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many households nationwide were
able to purchase homes. Assuming interest rates would remain low and home values would continue to
rise, many households took on riskier loans thinking that they would be able to refinance at a future
point in time. As a result of an increase in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates, and decline
in sales prices that started in 2006, many homeowners were unable to refinance and make payments on
their home mortgages. By 2007, the nation saw an emergence of Sub-Prime mortgage loan losses. With
foreclosures mounting, housing prices have dropped but yet financing remains limited due to more
conservative underwriting standards.

To address the impacts on communities from the increase on foreclosed and abandoned properties, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Program
(NSP). The City of Chula Vista has received NSP funds to assist low and moderate income households
purchase foreclosed or abandoned properties. Through a revolving loan fund of $1.5 million in NSP
funds, approximately $800,000 in HOME funds, and a transfer of an inclusionary household, in 2010,
forty seven (47) households were pre-committed in funds with eight (8) of these households becoming
first-time homebuyers.
With lower housing prices and low interest rates, homeownership is still attainable for some. As shown
in Table B-13, Chula Vista home loan approval percentage (66 percent) was on par with the County (67
percent). The percentage of denied home improvement loans was slightly higher in Chula Vista (31
percent) than for the County (19 percent).

2.0
State Housing Element Law mandates that a jurisdiction must show that it has adequate sites that
will be made available through appropriate zoning and development standards and with the
required public services and facilities for a variety of housing types and incomes. This evaluation of
adequate sites represents a planning goal and not a goal for the actual production of housing within
the five-year period. The City must demonstrate that it has the capacity, or adequate sites, to
accommodate the projected need for housing. The projected need for housing used for this
evaluation is defined as the City’s share of the region’s housing needs for 2005-2010.
2.1 Regional Housing Needs Assessment 2010-2020
State Housing Element Law requires that each jurisdiction, in preparing its Housing Element, develop
local housing programs designed to meet its share of existing and future regional housing needs for
all income groups. This requirement ensures that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the
housing needs of its current and anticipated future residents, particularly lower-income households,
and plans for a variety of housing choices.
A Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) prepared by SANDAG in October 2011 for the period
beginning January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020 (an 11 year period) identifies Chula Vista’s share of
the region’s housing needs as 12,861 new housing units. To determine the regional housing needs
for the 2013-2020 planning period, the needs are adjusted by the actual number of units constructed
from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012, a total of housing units. Based upon this adjustment,
the regional housing needs for the 2013-2020 period is 11,614 housing units, with 47 percent
allocated for lower income households.

As required by State Housing Law, the City must plan for its share of the region’s new housing needs
in all four income categories by identifying an adequate supply of land zoned at the appropriate
density levels to accommodate each income category. The RHNA goals do not represent a
requirement for actual housing production, but rather seek to ensure the City has, or plans to add,
zoning capacity to accommodate new housing growth.
To address the City’s needs for very low-and low-income housing, Chula Vista must demonstrate that
it has an adequate supply of land for higher density housing (30 or more dwelling units per acre).
Although zoning land for higher density development does not guarantee the construction of
housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-income families, without such higher density zoning,
the opportunity to use subsidies and implement affordable housing programs for such families is
diminished.

2.2 Capacity to Meet Regional Share Goals
Due to the diverse nature of eastern and western Chula Vista, the analysis of available sites for
housing has been customized to each area.
Most of the vacant land is located in eastern Chula Vista, within Master Planned communities and
will be developed under the Planned Community (PC) Zone. These Master Planned communities
have the capacity to accommodate 14,930 dwelling units as shown in Table C-4.
The City of Chula Vista General Plan Land Use and Transportation Element identifies six residential
land use designations. The availability of land suited to accommodate the various income levels is
based upon the allowed density.
                                                      Table C-2
                                                   GENERAL PLAN
                                     RESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
                  Income Level              Land Use Designations                   Density
            Very Low & Low              Urban Core Residential        27.1 to 60 units per acre
                                        High Residential              18.1 to 27 units per acre
            Moderate
                                        Medium High Residential       11.1 to 18 units per acre
                                        Medium Residential            6.1 to 11 units per acre
            Above Moderate              Low-Medium Residential        3.1 to 6 units per acre
                                        Low Residential               0 to 3 units per acre
Opportunities outside of Master Planned Communities are primarily in western Chula Vista which
encompasses the older, mostly developed portion of the City. While there is significant capacity
throughout western Chula Vista, infill capacity is focused on areas of change within the Urban Core
Specific Plan, Bayfront and Southwest.
Chula Vista has significant development capacity of residential land to meet the projected regional
housing needs of the various income categories over the 2010-2020 planning period. Consistent
with HCD’s guidelines, appropriate densities based on RHNA affordability levels area as follows:
       Very Low- and low-income: Minimum of 30 dwelling units/acre
       Moderate-income:                      11 to 30 dwelling units/acre
       Above moderate-income:                Market Rate Units
Table C-3 provides a summary of development capacity, based on affordability levels.

2.2.1             Availability of Sites in Eastern Chula Vista
Table C-4 lists the currently remaining residential development capacity on available vacant land
sites within eastern Chula Vista master planned communities in accordance with the associated
General Plan gross density classifications. As can be seen, approximately half (48%) of the 14,930
total units will be high density, followed by 18 percent medium-high, 8 percent medium, 21 percent
low-medium, and 5 percent low density residential. As discussed below, since all of these areas have
been subject to varying levels of subsequent planning, these gross densities have been refined, and
actual development on individual sites is occurring at somewhat higher net density levels. Figure C-1
presents a key map showing the location of each of the master planned communities listed on Table
C-4, and Figures C-2 through C-10 present the Site Utilization Plans from the associated General Plan
Development Plan (GDP) or Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plans that depict the specific residential
development sites and their new densities.
Table C-4 has been divided into the following three subsets to reflect the level of entitlements and
status of implementation:
           Approved General Development Plan (GDP) – The GDP reflects a refinement of the City’s
            General Plan, and is the first tier zoning plan for lands within the City’s Planned Community
                                                                                                                    Page AC-7

                                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                  APPENDIX C
      (P-C) zone classification. The GDP is essentially a bubble-type land use plan indicating the
      intended locations, acreages and densities for various land use types, along with primary
      circulation routes. In order to be implemented, a SPA Plan must be processed followed by
      subdivision maps, design review and ultimately building permits. Based on typical processing
      time frames, projects with approved GDP status have the potential to commence construction
      within a 3 to 4-year time frame.
     Approved or in-process Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plan – The SPA Plan effectively serves
      as the tailored zoning document for the particular master planned project. It identifies
      specific development sites, land use types and densities, and associated property
      development standards. Typically, a subdivision map and/or design review are necessary
      prior to building permits. Projects with approved SPA Plans will typically commence
      construction within an 18-month to 3-year window, and these projects will complete housing
      units within the timeframe of this Housing Element.
     Developments Being Implemented – This includes projects that have achieved SPA and
      subdivision map approvals, and are actively under construction. Building permit activity
      changes daily, and these projects will be fully completed within the timeframe of this Housing
      Element.

The eastern Chula Vista area provides for significant development potential for market rate units, as
indicated by the density standards indicated in Table C-4. Although a significant level of market rate
units can be accommodated in the eastern area, the City of Chula Vista desires an equitable
distribution of affordable housing throughout the City. To provide for this, the City initiated an
inclusionary requirement for all development exceeding 50 dwelling units, Housing Element Policy H
5.1. The City requires all projects of 50 or more units to provide ten percent of the housing for low-
and moderate-income household, with five percent affordable to low-income households. It is the
master planned communities, as shown in Table C-4, which are primarily affected by this
requirement.

2.2.2         Availability of Sites Outside of Master Planned Communities
Future intensification opportunities are primarily in the eastern portion of the City within the Master
Planned Communities. Opportunities outside of Master Planned Communities are primarily in
western Chula Vista which encompasses the older, mostly developed portion of the City. When
looking at Western Chula Vista, the discussion is segmented into three parts: vacant land capacity,
infill/ intensification of developed properties under current zoning, and the “focused areas of change”
whose development capacities were increased in the 2005 General Plan Update.
Vacant Lands
Vacant residential land that is not within a master planned community comprises 57.22 acres. A
development potential of 366 dwelling units is estimated for these vacant lands.
Figures C-12 and C-13 indicate the location of vacant or underutilized residential land within the City
that are more specifically listed in Attachment A to this Appendix.
Any of the properties zoned for single-family development could be processed at any time through a
building permit. Those zoned for multi-family could be processed similarly, along with a design
review application.

Infill/ Intensification Under Existing Zoning
In addition to vacant lands, there are also a number of properties within the western Chula Vista that
are zoned today for higher residential densities but are under-built, with an additional development
capacity of up to 3,712 units. To determine the infill capacity of these units, each parcel was
evaluated based on existing built units, compared to allowable zoning capacity per the Zoning Code.
The net difference reflects the infill capacity potential based on existing land entitlements. However,
many of these areas are within existing stable single family neighborhoods that are unlikely to
redevelop at their maximum density during the time period covered by this Housing Element.
Therefore, this potential is therefore not reflected in the capacity analysis shown in Table C-3. A
comprehensive summary of these potential infill/intensification units is provided in Appendix H.
                                                                               Page AC-25

                                                                                      APPENDIX C
Focused Areas of Change
The Land Use Element of the General Plan identifies the City’s desire to increase urban vitality and
pursue infill/redevelopment for the western Chula Vista Area to enhance its emergence as a dynamic
hub of south San Diego County. To this end, the City has made significant revisions to the General
Plan Land Use Element to allow for residential and mixed use development in the City’s key corridor
and activity centers, identified as “focused areas of change.”
The Land Use Element distributes more intensive residential and mixed use development to these
designated areas where higher density and higher intensity development will establish mixed use
urban environments that are oriented to transit and pedestrian activity.
       General Plan Update – One of the major General Plan Land Use Element changes was to
        add new land use classifications including Mixed-Use Residential and Urban Core
        Residential, whose allowable gross densities range from 28-60 dwelling units/acre in order to
        promote compact development and aid future affordability.
        Given the broad nature of General Plans, the identification and analysis of associated future
        residential and other development capacity was conducted at a “district” level. Figures C-14
        and C-15 show the names and locations of each of those districts (within the Northwest and
        Southwest Planning Areas respectively), along with the net additional residential capacities
        within each. Table C-7 identifies the densities associated with that capacity.
        Given that the street grid is already established in western Chula Vista, the capacities in Table
        C-7 were based largely on new land area, and multiplied by maximum densities of 28, 40 or
        60 dwelling units per acre dependant upon the district. This approach also enabled better
        identification of cumulative potential public facility and service demands and environmental
        impacts. In the case of Mixed-Use areas, yields were calculated using only that portion of the
        area assumed for residential development. As General Plan level densities, these are
        assumed as an average across the district, and it is possible through subsequent zoning that
        individual projects on particular sites may exceed these.
       Urban Core Specific Plan (UCSP)– Consistent with the vision and densities of the 2005
        General Plan, the City has adopted the Urban Core Specific Plan (UCSP) that establishes the
        zoning, development standards, and design guidelines necessary for development to proceed
        within the Urban Core area. Figure C-16 shows the zoning districts affecting properties
        within the Urban Core. Table C-7 summarizes the more intensive zoning standards what will
        allow the General Plan densities to be realized.

        Palomar Gateway Specific Plan (PGSP) –Currently the City is sponsoring the development of
        the Palomar Gateway Specific Plan (PGSP) (Figure C-17) that includes a Mixed-Use Transit
        Focus Area (TFA) directly west of the Palomar Trolley Station, higher residential intensity, a
        neighborhood park and retail to the south of the TFA. The goal of the PGSP is to provide for
        additional housing and mixed-uses that take advantage of a major transit station within
        walking distance of residents.
With regard to estimated housing production in western Chula Vista within this Element’s timeframe,
a thorough land use analysis was conducted as part of the General Plan Update process to evaluate
the development potential for these focus areas of change. The methodology utilized to conduct this
analysis included a detailed site analysis of the properties within the City’s UCSP and PGSP. The
UCSP and PGSP were identified as the areas within Chula Vista with the greatest potential for growth.
The methodology evaluated infrastructure availability, current market interest in high-density
residential development, recent development applications and the existence of older commercial
developments that currently are inconsistent with market demands.

2.3 Availability of Public Services and Facilities
At the core of the City of Chula Vista’s Growth Management Program, lie Threshold Standards
imposed to assure adequate infrastructure and services are in place as development occurs, and to
control the rate of growth.       Therefore, prior to the approval of future residential development, the
provision of adequate infrastructure is a required finding. Chula Vista currently has adequate public
services and facilities to serve all new residential development that may occur throughout the City.
Additionally, fees are collected for new and infill development to maintain Threshold Standards.

                     FINANCIAL RESOURCES
3.0
Chula Vista has access to a variety of existing and potential funding sources available for affordable
housing activities. The following section describes the key local, state, County and federal resources
currently used in Chula Vista to fund affordable housing programs as well as social and community
development activities within the city.
3.1 Federal Resources
Federal resources available to support development, rehabilitation, and subsidy of affordable and
foreclosed housing in Chula Vista include:
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
The CDBG program provides funds for community development activities. The program is flexible in
that the funds can be used for a range of activities. The eligible activities include, but are not limited
to, acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities and improvements,
relocation, rehabilitation of housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance activities.
Approximately $1,813,779 in CDBG funds was approved for the 2010-2011 fiscal year for housing
and community development activities. Current programs and activities supported that provide
assistance to households needing affordable housing, specifically households with special needs,
include:
        Shared housing services;
        Landlord tenant assistance;
        Fair housing services; and,
        Street improvements in low income residential neighborhoods.
HOME Funds
The HOME Investment Partnerships Act (HOME) program is a flexible grant program, which is
awarded to the City on a formula basis for housing activities and takes into account local market
conditions, inadequate housing, poverty, and housing production costs. Its purpose is to expand the
supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing for very-low and low-income families and
households. Eligible activities include acquisition, construction, reconstruction and/or rehabilitation of
affordable rental or for-sale housing. Tenant based rental assistance, property acquisition, site
improvements, and other expenses relation to the provision of affordable housing and/or special
needs housing may also qualify under the HOME program. The City of Chula Vista has
                                                                                Page AC-33

                                                                              HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                        APPENDIX C
 approximately $877,482 available during FY2011-12 through the HOME program.
 In the recent past, HOME funds have been used to fund the following services:
           New construction of rental housing;
           Down payment assistance; and,
           Tenant based rental assistance.
 Emergency Shelter Grants.
 This federally funded program is for use by states, metropolitan cities, and urban counties for the
 rehabilitation or conversion of buildings for use as emergency shelters and for homeless prevention
 activities. The City of Chula Vista received approximately $87,827 for the FY2010-11. The City provides
 funding to South Bay Community Services and its operation and services of emergency housing.
 Neighborhood Stabilization Act
 The federal Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized the Department of Housing and
 Urban Development (HUD) to issue $7.5 billion in grants and $7.5 billion in no-interest loans to
 states for the purchase, sale, and rehabilitation of vacant foreclosed homes. Of the total allocation,
 $20 to 50 million will be available for disbursement throughout California by the State Department of
 Housing and Community Development. Approximately $2,830,000 million was allocated to Chula
 Vista.
 The table below identifies the distribution of original allocation of NSP funds, and the intended use of
 an approximate amount of $2,000,000 in projected revenue:

Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, authorized by Congress in the Tax Reform Act of 1984,
provides financial assistance to "First time homebuyers" for the purchase of new or existing
singlefamily home. In 1985, the State adopted legislation authorizing local agencies, such as San
Diego County, to make Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCCs) available. San Diego County MCC
authority can be used in all cities as well as the unincorporated areas of the county.
Chula Vista continues to participate with the County of San Diego and other cities to issue and renew
Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) to qualified first-time low-and moderate-income homebuyers. First-
time homebuyers are referred by the City’s Housing Division to the County. During the 2005-2010
Housing Element period 62 households became new homeowners in Chula Vista utilizing the MCC
program which entitled them to take a federal income tax credit of fifteen to twenty percent (15% to
20%) of the annual interest they pay on their home mortgage and increasing their qualified
maximum loan amount.
3.2 State and Local Resources
There are a variety of state and local resources that have been used for housing development and
rehabilitation for homeowners and renters as well as community development programs. Some of the
resources detailed in Table C-10, Financial Resources for Housing Activities, have been used by the
City of Chula Vista to expand affordable housing opportunities in the City. With the dissolution of
redevelopment in February 2012 and shrinking of governmental funds, fewer resources will be
available in the future to accomplish the Housing goals, policies and programs set forth in this
Housing Element. Two of those resources are described in more detail below.
Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds
Previously, Redevelopment Agencies were required to direct a minimum of 20 percent of all gross tax
increment revenues generated within its Project Areas to a separate fund to be used exclusively for
the preservation, improvement, and expansion of the low and moderate income housing supply
within the community. Redevelopment Set-Aside funds represented the primary funding source for
local jurisdictions to provide for affordable housing for low and moderate income households within
their community. On an annual basis, approximately $3 million was deposited by Chula Vista’s
Redevelopment Agency into the Low-Moderate Income Housing Fund for eligible housing activities.
In accordance with AB X1 26, as of February 1, 2012, redevelopments agencies in California are
dissolved and revenues were returned to the State of California through successor agencies. Any
unencumbered funds in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund as of February 1, 2012,
approximately $5 million, were provided to the County for distribution to the taxing agencies as
                                                                              Page AC-35

                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                       APPENDIX C
property tax in accordance with State Law (Section 34176).
The Housing Authority, as a successor housing agency, anticipates receiving repayment on any loans
outstanding from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Set-Aside funds. Loan repayments total
approximately $5 million. Loans provided for the development of the affordable housing
developments will be repaid as stipulated within the associated loan agreements and are expected to
be paid over the life of the loans, typically 55 years. Loan repayments will be used by the Housing
Authority to enforce and monitor existing terms and conditions associated with the loan and to
create new housing opportunities as funds allow.

                     SUSTAINABILITY & CONSERVATION
4.0
The City of Chula Vista has been a nationally-recognized local government leader in promoting
environmental sustainability within its municipal operations and throughout the community. The City’s
diverse sustainability initiatives include policies and programs focusing on energy and water
conservation, materials management and recycling, storm water pollution prevention, alternative
transportation, habitat preservation, environmental education, and “green” economic development.
These sustainability initiatives, developed in partnership with other public agencies and local
stakeholder groups, provide numerous community co-benefits such as utility savings, better air and
water quality, reduced traffic congestion, local job creation, and improved quality of life. The City’s
Resource Conservation Commission provides a forum for ongoing public input and transparency for
the sustainability initiatives’ implementation as well.
In particular, Chula Vista has been successfully implementing a Climate Action Plan since the late
1990s to address the threat of climate change to the local community. The Climate Action Plan, which
originally was adopted by City Council in 2000, was updated in 2008 to include 7 additional climate
“mitigation” measures designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2011, these measures were
complemented by 11 new climate “adaptation” strategies designed to reduce Chula Vista’s vulnerability
to expected local climate change impacts. The 18 total climate actions, which are outlined below,
include measures to improve energy and water efficiency, expand renewable energy systems, mitigate
urban heat island effects, convert to more fuel efficient and alternative fuel vehicles, and design
transit-friendly, walkable communities. These efforts also align with new state legislation such as
Assembly Bill 32 (Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) and its companion bill, Senate Bill 375.

Energy and water conservation are a core component to the City’s Climate Action Plan. Both
resources are vital to maintaining and improving the community’s quality of life and economic
development. As outlined within the Housing Element, the City promotes the efficient use of energy
and water to reduce long term operational costs of housing (see HE Objective H-2). By reducing
operational costs, housing becomes more affordable to the property owner and/or residents.
The following programs are implemented by the City and/or its regional partners to support the
Housing Element’s sustainability goals:
California Solar Initiative
The California Public Utilities Commission is providing incentives to businesses, nonprofit
organizations, public agencies, and homeowners to help lower their energy costs, reduce their
reliance on fossil fuel-fed power plants, and create a sustainable energy future through the use of
solar technology. This program funds both solar photovoltaics (PV), as well as solar thermal
generating technologies.
        California Solar Initiative (CSI) – Solar Photovoltaic
        The CSI-PV program offers incentives to San Diego Gas & Electric customers for installing
        solar photovoltaic systems on residential and commercial buildings. While the incentive
        varies by building type and enrollment levels, the CSI-PV Program is designed to cover
        approximately 13 percent of the cost for a residential solar energy system. The CSI-PV
        program is administered in the San Diego area by the California Center for Sustainable
        Energy.
        California Solar Initiative (CSI) - Thermal-Solar Water Heating
        The CSI-Thermal program offers cash rebates to San Diego Gas and Electric customers of up
        to $1,875 for installing solar water heating systems on single-family homes and up to
        $500,000 on multi-family homes. Systems can offset up to 75 percent of the natural gas,
        electricity, or propane used by most current water heaters. The CSI-Thermal program is
        administered in the San Diego area by the California Center for Sustainable Energy.
        Multifamily Affordable Solar Homes (MASH)
        The Multifamily Affordable Solar Homes program provides higher incentives ($1.90 to $2.80
        per watt) to offset the project costs of installing photovoltaic systems on multifamily affordable
        housing buildings in California. The MASH program is administered in the San Diego area by
        the California Center for Sustainable Energy.

                                                                                        APPENDIX C
          Single family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH)
          The Single-family Affordable Solar Homes program provides low income families with free or
          low-cost solar photovoltaic systems, which significantly reduces household energy expenses
          and allows families to direct those savings toward other basic needs. The SASH program is
          administered statewide by GRID Alternatives. In addition to being the primary system installer
          GRID Alternatives also provides education and access to energy efficiency programs, which
          further reduces a household’s energy consumption and expenses.
Chula Vista Local Government Partnership
The Chula Vista Local Government Partnership is a collaboration between the City, San Diego Gas &
Electric, and the California Public Utilities Commission to “institutionalize” energy efficiency into
municipal programs, policies, and projects. The Local Government Partnership provides funding for
the following housing-related components:
          Home Upgrade, Carbon Downgrade
          A program to facilitate home energy and water upgrades within existing building stock
          through community outreach, home energy assessments, contractor trainings, and financing
          tools. The program complements the statewide Energy Upgrade California program (see
          below).
          Sustainable Communities
          A program to promote sustainable building construction and community planning initiatives
          through municipal code revisions, development-related policy changes, permit process
          streamlining, and education of contractors and permit applicants.
Chula Vista NatureScape Program
The NatureScape program, administered by the City of Chula Vista, assists residents and businesses
in creating water-efficient, nature-friendly landscaping through free technical assistance and
community workshops. The program also certifies properties that have incorporated certain
sustainability practices into their landscaping as “Backyard Wildlife Habitat” through the National
Wildlife Federation.
Energy Upgrade California
The statewide program is being led locally by San Diego Gas & Electric, the California Center for
Sustainable Energy, and the City of Chula Vista to promote whole house energy efficiency retrofits to
improve occupant comfort and health and to reduce home energy use. The program helps to train
contractors on building performance principles and offers local homeowners incentives up to $4,000
for upgrades .

                                                                                    APPENDIX C
SDG&E Energy Savings Assistance Program
This program, administered by SDG&E, provides special assistance for low-income residents to help
lower their utility costs. Regardless of whether the resident rents or owns their home, the program
provides free (1) energy-efficient lighting, (2) repair or replacement of doors and windows,
microwaves, water heaters, refrigerators and clothes washers, and (3) installation of insulation,
weatherstripping, and caulking. Eligibility is determined by household income and size.
SDG&E Savings By Design & Sustainable Communities
These two incentive programs, both administered by SDG&E, encourage the design and construction

                     OVERVIEW:
1.0                  EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE
State Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to review the progress and performance of past
housing elements goals and objectives. The evaluation should be quantified where possible (e.g. the
number of units rehabilitated), but may be qualitative as necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental
constraints). Where significant shortfalls between the targeted objective and the City’s achievement
are identified, the reasons should be discussed. This section discusses the progress of the goals and
objectives defined in the 2005-2010 Housing Element.
Reviewing the progress of the implemented Housing Element is necessary to develop a
comprehensive housing program strategy and to identify programs that have been valuable to in
reaching goals set.

                    OVERVIEW:
2.0                 PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE
                    2005-2010 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The 2005-2010 Housing Element contained three policy focus areas:
     1. Maintain and Enhance Housing and Neighborhoods;
     2. Balanced and Diverse Housing Opportunities; and,
     3. Government Role and Process.
Each policy focus area was associated with specific programs and objectives.
This section reviews the city’s progress to date in implementing these housing programs and their
continued appropriateness for the 2013-2020 Housing Element. Table D-1 summarizes the City’s
housing program accomplishments, followed by a review of its quantified objectives. The results of
this analysis will provide the basis for developing the comprehensive housing program strategy
presented in Part C of this Element.
The following paragraphs reviews the significant accomplishments for the prior planning period for
the three policy focus areas.
Policy Focus 1: Maintain and Enhance Housing And Residential Neighborhoods
Rehabilitation of the City’s housing stock and preserving the integrity of residential neighborhoods by
preventing deterioration and providing necessary capital improvements. Utilize community-based
rehabilitation programs such as CHIP to encourage the maintenance and enhancement of residential
quality.
Discussion:
With a majority of the existing housing citywide being 30 years or older (63 percent) by year 2010,
there is a potential loss in value and quality as a result of deterioration. Within the West (area west
of I-805), 33 percent of the housing stock is already 50 years old. The particular focus of the 2005-
2010 Policy and Implementation Plan was enforcement of building, health, and housing codes and
funding minor repairs and rehabilitation of housing in the City’s Northwest and Southwest Planning
                                                                                Page AD-3

                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                     APPENDIX D
Areas to encourage the provision of decent, safe and sanitary housing and preserve neighborhood
quality.
Policy Focus 2:            Support Housing Opportunities to Meet the City’s Diverse
Needs
Utilizing available resources, seek to preserve and provide sufficient, suitable, and varied housing by
small and large family size, type of unit, and cost, particularly permanent affordable housing that
meets the diverse housing needs of existing and future residents of Chula Vista.
Discussion:
Chula Vista is a community with a diverse population and housing stock, particularly in the western
area of the City. Housing should be preserved and created to maximize housing opportunities for
larger households, a growing senior population, special needs groups, and very low-and low-income
families.
The disparities in household income, age and types of housing available between the eastern and
western portions of the City demonstrates a need to promote greater diversity in housing choices
related to pricing and housing type within each of these geographic areas.
Policy Focus 3: Fund and Implement Services that Provide Vital Community
Resources for Lower Income Residents
Utilizing available resources, fund and implement services and programs that improve residents’
ability to secure and maintain quality housing.
Discussion:
Local Government plays a significant role in fostering the development of affordable and special
needs housing. Conversely, in its efforts to protect and enhance the overall community, local
government can implement land use controls, building codes, development standards, permit and
processing procedures, and fees and exactions, that constrain the operations of the private, nonprofit,
and public sector when introducing new housing products to market.

                   GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
1.0                ANALYSIS
California State law requires General Plans to be internally consistent. Therefore, the goals and
policies of each Element must provide a level of consistency so that specific goals and policies
contained in one element are not in conflict with those contained in another.
Chula Vista’s General Plan consists of seven elements required by State Law. An analysis of internal
consistency summarized in Table E-1. Through this analysis, it has been determined that the Housing
Element provides consistency with the policies set forth in the General Plan and its associated
elements.

1.0
The Housing Element is representative of the desires of the local residents and addresses the
concerns most important to the community both now and in the future. Additionally, the State of
California requires local governments make diligent efforts to involve all economic segments of the
population in the development of the Housing Element. The public’s input and participation in the
Housing Element Update process is key to ensuring a shared vision and strategy for the City.
During the preparation of the Housing Element, community involvement included a presentation
before the City’s Housing Advisory Commission, a housing stakeholder meeting, three community
workshops, and implementation of a Housing Needs Survey. Meetings and presentations focused on
(1) informing the community of past and existing efforts to address previously identified housing
needs, identified housing needs based on current demographics and anticipated resources and (2)
hearing from the community their top priorities in terms of housing needs by income group or
targeted population and to identify/refine possible housing policies/programs to address the specific
needs and any geographical/locational considerations. A Housing Needs Survey was made available
in both English and Spanish to identify types of affordable housing needed, priorities for special
needs groups, priority housing programs to address affordable housing needs in the community,
location of emergency housing, and any perceived constraints to housing.        Responses from the
community guided the Needs Assessment portion of the Housing Element, as well as the Housing
Policy and Implementation Plan (Part II of this Element).
This appendix provides for a summary of the City’s efforts community outreach efforts and the
responses received.

Overview
The State of California requires local
governments make diligent efforts to
involve all economic segments of the
population in the development of the
Housing Element. The public’s input and
participation in the Housing Element
Update process is key to ensuring a
shared vision and strategy for the City. It
is the goal to ensure that the Housing
Element is representative of the desires of
the local residents and addresses the
concerns most important to the
community both now and in the future.
During the preparation of the Housing
Element, community involvement included
a presentation before the City’s Housing
Advisory      Commission,       a   housing
stakeholder meeting, three community
workshops, and implementation of a
Housing Needs Survey available from
March through April 2012 in both English
and Spanish.
This document provides a summary of the
comments received through the public
participation process. Responses from the
community guided the Needs Assessment
portion of the Housing Element, as well as
the Housing Policy and Implementation
Plan (Part II of this Element).
Noticing for the community workshops
and the availability of the Housing Needs
Survey was extensive and included direct
mailings, distribution of notices via
electronic mail and Nixle, distribution of
flyers, information on the City’s website,
Facebook page, and posting of flyers at
key City facilities (libraries and City Hall)
within the city. Despite the City’s noticing efforts, attendance at the community meetings was low,
with an average of 3 participants per meeting. The City received a total of 72 responses to its
Housing Needs Survey.
                                                                             Page AF-5

                                                                                  APPENDIX F
Workshop Agendas
Several opportunities were provided for the community to participate in the Housing Element process
and included:
     Housing Advisory Commission on January 25, 2012;
     Stakeholders meeting on March 8, 2012; and,
     Community meetings held on March 21, 28, and 29, 2012.
Meetings and presentations focused on (1) informing the community of past and existing efforts to
address previously identified housing needs, identified housing needs based on current
demographics and anticipated resources and (2) hearing from the community their top priorities in
terms of housing needs by income group or targeted population and to identify/refine possible
housing policies/programs to address the specific needs and any geographical/locational
considerations.
Staff provided a power point presentation which included an
overview of the City’s Housing Element Update process, a review
of the current City of Chula Vista Housing Element, and identified
housing needs and key findings, and important trends in housing
affecting Chula Vista.          Opportunity was provided for the
community to ask questions and provide comments to staff.
Given the current economic conditions and an anticipated lack of
financial resources available to the City for affordable housing,
the remainder of the meeting was devoted to community
discussion and comments on their top three (3) priorities in terms
of housing needs by income group or targeted population and to
identify/refine possible housing policies/programs to address the
specific needs and any geographical/locational considerations.
Workshop participants’ comments were recorded on
a wall graphic. In addition, the Housing Needs
Survey was provided for participants to also provide
comments and any additional comments.              A
prioritization exercise was completed. Participants
were provided with three (3) dot stickers to identify
their top priorities for targeted populations and a
corresponding program to address the housing
needs of the population group.

Workshop Summary of Comments and Themes
Housing Issues
     Increase in social issues and their complexity. Social service providers can give a box of food
         but aren’t in the business of providing the roof over their heads.
     Current economy sees many struggling.
             o Seeing more younger aged and families in need of assistance.
             o Homeless families are increasing. Percentage of those attributed to domestic violence
                 has decreased. Financial circumstances play more of a factor for homeless families.
             o More people living in their cars, rvs or “couch surfing” but they are staying in the area.
             o Doubling up and sharing of homes.
             o Even the moderate income households are affected
                       Trying to keep their homes but have little resources to help them.
                       Paying a greater percentage of their income for their housing costs
                       Seeing them in food distribution lines
Priority Targeted Population
     Ninety-eight percent (98%) of clients seen by Family Resource Centers are extremely low and
         very low income households and are in need of housing.
     Homeless, particularly families, are the neediest group. There are limited dollars to assist this
         population group.
     Extremely low income
     Seniors
     Families
Priority Housing Programs
     Transitional housing, emergency shelters and acquisition and rehabilitation of existing
         housing for the homeless.
     Transitional housing for extremely low income households.
     Emergency assistance needs to be provided immediately when it is needed not a week later
         or on a waiting list basis.
     Rental assistance for extremely low and low income households.
     Second dwelling units could be a good alternative for seniors.
     Community land trust model should be looked at for homeownership opportunities.
     Prefabricated/manufactured homes.
     Provide incentives and concessions for those who have their own financial resources to
         provide housing.
     Revisit the City’s Inclusionary Housing policy
     More housing in the form of new construction - Chula Vista Community Collaborative.
     Acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units when it results in a use converting to more
         affordable housing. – Chula Vista Community Collaborative.
     Preserve what we have and look for opportunities with our existing housing stock. Less
                                                                                Page AF-7

                                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                        APPENDIX F
        priority on construction of new residential units.
             o Rehabilitation of housing
             o Keep people in their homes
             o Re-use
       Maintain existing rent review regulations for mobilehome owners.
       With shrinking $, we need to be more creative and innovative
             o Business community (e.g. Chamber of Commerce) teaming up to offer discounts or
                 programs to work off security deposits, first and last month’s rent, etc.
             o Collaborate – take abandoned properties to rehab and provide training and
                 contracting opportunities for the work needed
       Preventative Programs
             o Financial fitness
             o Training
       Housing assistance with purpose and responsibility
             o Should be looked at as a ladder and a way to step up. Look at providing
                 programs/services that are aimed to help families get in to improve their
                 circumstances and then move on to a little better living situation.
             o Should go both ways. Recipients should be required to give back to receive benefits.
Geographic Considerations
     The area of the City west of I-805 is already saturated with low cost housing particularly in
        the southwest area. This area needs to increase the income levels of residents.
     Western Chula Vista has many vacant buildings and lots and is blighted. Zoning must be
        revisited to promote financial feasibility and revitalization of the area. More density is needed
        for revitalization.
     Western Chula Vista has infrastructure needs. By redeveloping and revitalizing the area, it
        could bring change.
Barriers to Housing
     Fees for second dwelling units are too high and cost prohibitive
     Parking requirements for second dwelling units are too much. Homeowners could build
        bigger units or another unit if it were not for the parking requirements.

Housing Needs Survey
A Housing Needs Survey was made available in both English and Spanish to identify types of
affordable housing needed, priorities for special needs groups, priority housing programs to address
affordable housing needs in the community, location of emergency housing, and any perceived
constraints to housing.
The City received a total of 72 responses to its Housing Needs Survey, with 3 responses received in
Spanish. A significant number of the surveys (85%) were received from persons who were notified of
the availability of the survey but did not attend one of the community meetings. Survey respondents
were primarily those who own and live within Chula Vista (61%) with 30% who rent and live in
Chula Vista. Six surveys were received from respondents identifying themselves as housing
stakeholders, with only 1 survey received from a business owner.
Following is a copy of the survey provided in written format and available on-line and the responses
received.

                      SITES INVENTORY – INFILL AND
1.0                   INTENSIFCATION OPPORTUNITIES
This Appendix provides a summary of sites which have been determined to provide the potential for
infill and intensification. To determine the potential capacity of these parcels, a site specific
evaluation was conducted. The analysis utilized the following criteria when determining the potential
unit yield:
        Parcel size – Parcel size was evaluated based on the actual gross and net developable land,
         based on existing general plan/zoning standards. Those parcels with sufficient land area to
         meet the gross and net development minimum standards were deemed as providing
         development potential
        Existing Development vs. Zoning Potential – For each parcel, the actual development units on
         the site were determined. The net existing development was compared with the existing
         zoning standards and a net difference was calculated as development potential. Only those
         sites showing likelihood of yielding in excess of 20 dwelling units per parcel have been
         evaluated.
        Infrastructure – As Chula Vista is an urbanized City and the majority of infill opportunities are
         located in the areas served by established infrastructure facilities, it has been determined that
         the provision of infrastructure is not a constraint to development.
        UC Berkley Infill Analysis – As an initial tool to evaluate the likelihood for infill development,
         the City of Chula Vista has utilized the University of California Berkley’s Pilot Infill Locator to
         identify those sites with the highest potential for redevelopment. The City understands these
         sites are not necessarily candidates for infill, but the analysis provides a baseline for the
         evaluation of trends and market-feasibility of potential infill units.
A listing of identified parcels, detailed by Assessor’s Parcel Number, General Plan designation, Zoning,
site acreage, existing use and dwelling unit potential is provided in this Appendix.

                                                                                        APPENDIX H
Summary of Existing Projects – Current Market Interest
The following is a summary of existing, or planned development projects that provide an example of
existing market trends that contribute to the likelihood the infill projects are feasible within the City of
Chula Vista. There are an estimated privately initiated development projects in the pipeline or under
discussions with the City for the reuse of existing development sites. Most of the target sites
identified in this Appendix have uses on site that are underperforming, recently vacated or are
anticipated to not reflect current market demands for the types of uses currently on site during the
planning period of this Housing Element. Examples of these projects include:
335 H Street. This site is currently underutilized existing residential development and vacant property
totaling 2.82 acres. The proposed development would develop higher density dwelling units. The
proposed Urbana Apartments will consist of a six story (84 foot-high), 266 unit apartment complex,
with 380 parking stalls.

1.0           INTRODUCTION
 1.1 Purpose and Scope
 State planning law requires California cities to adopt specific
 elements in their general plans. The City of Chula Vista Land Use         The Land Use and
 and Transportation (LUT) Element fulfills the state requirements
 for two elements: Land Use, as defined in Section 65302(a) of the
                                                                           Transportation (LUT)
 Government Code; and Circulation, as defined in Section                   Element fulfills state
 65302(b) of the Government Code. By combining these elements              General Plan
 into one, the Chula Vista General Plan recognizes and                     requirements and is
 emphasizes the important link between land use designations,              atop the hierarchy of
 intensity of development, mobility and health. The LUT Element            local land use law.
 reflects anticipated levels of development, the road system
 necessary to serve that development, and alternative forms of
 transportation available to move people and goods and to
 provide facilities that complement and enhance the nature of the
 surrounding neighborhood.
 To fulfill the legal requirements for land use, the LUT Element establishes plans and policies to
 identify the general distribution of housing, businesses, industry, open space (including parks),
 education facilities, and public buildings. Standards for population density and building intensity
 in each land use classification are also provided.
  Also included are topics not legally required that relate to the City's physical development,
  including community design and aesthetics and planning and building for a healthy and
  sustainable community. A more detailed description of character and intensity of development is
  identified for Focus Areas throughout the City.
 To fulfill the legal requirements for circulation, the LUT Element establishes policies and standards
 for the system of roadways, transit service, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Also, it
 establishes plans and policies to:
           · Coordinate the circulation system with planned land uses;
           · Provide a balanced transportation system where the needs of all users, vehicles, pedestrains,
               bicyclists, and the disabled are considered.
           · Promote the efficient transport of goods, people and services;
           · Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and
           · Protect environmental quality and promote wise, equitable use of economic and
               natural resources.
 Sections 1.0. - 6.0 of the LUT Element discuss the relationship between the element and state
 planning requirements, the General Plan Vision and Themes, and related plans and programs.
 Pertinent background information is presented on various topics covered by the element, with
 additional reports and plans referenced if the user needs further detail. The element also
                                                                                 Page LUT-1

   Section 7.0, Planning Factors, Objectives, and Policies, specific       community
   topic areas are identified, followed by a focused objective(s) and      enhancement, and
   supporting policies. An objective identifies the desired end point      provides the guidance
   or direction in which the City is trying to move, while a policy
   provides guidance to achieve the objective. Chula Vista's
                                                                           to realize the City’s
   objectives and policies are extensions of the Vision and Themes         vision.
   established in this General Plan.
   Users of this document should first refer to this element's general policies for guidance, but
   should also refer to the four Area Plans, in Sections 8.0 - 11.0, which contain more detailed
   discussion and policies applicable to development in those geographical areas.
    1.2         Implementing the Vision and Themes
   Chula Vista’s Vision and Themes reflect the desire of the City to preserve and enhance the unique
   features that give Chula Vista its identity, while at the same time improving our community and
   meeting the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Our envisioned future city offers
   opportunities to live in safe, healthy and attractive neighborhoods; share in vibrant urban activities;
   work in healthy business and industrial environments; and enjoy bountiful natural resources and
   recreational facilities. The LUT Element establishes direction for new development, redevelopment,
   and community enhancement; and provides the guidance to realize the City's vision.
   A full discussion of our vision and eight themes is found in Chapter 4 of this General Plan. This Land
   Use and Transportation Element focuses on and develops three vision and theme components:
       Theme 1:          Strong Community Character and Image
                         Chula Vista continues to develop as a city with a distinct identity that
                         its citizens are proud to call home.
       Theme :          Strong and Safe Neighborhoods
                         Chula Vista is a diverse, yet integrated, community that celebrates its
                         neighborhoods as the building blocks that make it a great place to live.
       Theme :          Improved Mobility
                         Chula Vista provides a balanced transportation system witth a wide range of
                         convenient and affordable mobility options that allow people to go from
                         where they are to where they want to be in a safe; pleasant; rapid; cost-
                         effective; and environmentally friendly manner.

                      Chula Vista is committed to the health and well-being of all Chula
                      Vistans. Policies and objectives that provide for convenient access to
                      healthy food, provision of safe routes and a balanced transportation
                      system for all users are included throughout the LUT Element.
    Theme :          Shaping the Future Through the Present and the Past
                      Preserving and enhancing stable residential neighborhoods; enhancing
                      community image; creating a healthy place to live, work and play, and
                      protecting cultural and historical resources; and implementing compatible
                      land uses and edge transition.
1.3 Relation to Other General Plan Elements and
        Policies
The LUT Element is intricately related to the other five elements
of this General Plan. By describing existing and future                   The LUT Element
development in the City, the LUT Element sets the framework
for development of housing; the delivery of roads, public
                                                                          integrates policies
services, facilities, and infrastructure; the protection of               from other elements
environmental resources; and the economic growth of the City.             of the 2030 General
The LUT Element serves as the primary means to integrate                  Plan, serving as the
policies from other elements of the 2030 General Plan with the “constitution” for all
proposed pattern of land use designated on the General Plan               future development.
Land Use Diagram. The Housing Element contains policies for
residential development, which are also considered in the LUT
Element. The Environmental Element identifies environmental resources and hazards that need
to be considered in land use planning. The Public Facilities and Services Element identifies
infrastructure and community parks and recreation needs, which are coordinated with the
development-oriented policies of the LUT Element.
1.4 Relation to Other City Plans and Policies
The Land Use and Transportation Element provides land use designations, roadway designations,
and generalized land use patterns for the City's development. Several planning tools are used to
implement the land use and transportation policies set forth in this document. These are briefly
described below (see Figure 5-1), and include the Chula Vista Municipal Code; specific plans;
general development plans; sectional planning area plans; precise plans; redevelopment plans;
and the local coastal program plan.
                                                                                  Page LUT-3

1.4.1          Chula Vista Municipal Code
The Chula Vista Municipal Code (CVMC) consists of all the regulatory and penal ordinances and
certain administrative ordinances of the City, codified pursuant to the provisions of Sections
50022.1 through 50022.8 and 50022.10 of the Government Code. The CVMC includes the City's
Subdivision Ordinance and Zoning Ordinance, including the Growth Management Ordinance.
Subdivision Ordinance
The Subdivision Ordinance regulates the design, development
and implementation of land division. It applies when a parcel             The Zoning
is split into two or more parcels; a parcel is consolidated with          Ordinance is the
one or more parcels; or the boundaries of two or more parcels             primary tool for
are adjusted to change the size and/or configuration of the               implementing the
parcels.                                                                  General Plan.
Subdivision Manual
The purpose of the Subdivision Manual is to provide engineers and developers with a guide to
 land development processing in the City of Chula Vista. In addition to processing procedures, the
 Subdivision Manual contains general guidelines and standards for design of parcel maps and
 subdivisions, including street cross-sections and other related improvements.
Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan, and is designed to
 protect and promote the public health; safety; comfort; convenience; prosperity; and general
 welfare of the people. It includes a zoning map designating various districts that are described
 in the text of the document, and outlines the permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited
 uses for each zone district. Finally, the Zoning Ordinance provides property development
 standards for each zone district and overall administrative and legislative procedures.
1.4.2         Redevelopment Plans
The adoption of redevelopment plans by cities is allowed by the State Legislature under
California's Community Redevelopment Law. The redevelopment plans are intended to reverse
deteriorating economic and physical conditions; redevelop blighted, underutilized, and vacant
properties; improve infrastructure and public facilities; and produce revenues through the
development of job generating properties. Because redevelopment projects must be in
conformance with the General Plan, redevelopment plans are one of the more powerful means
cities have to implement the goals and policies set forth in their General Plans. The City of Chula
Vista has three Redevelopment Plans encompassing the redevelopment areas listed below and
outlined on Figure 5-2, Redevelopment Project Areas. Redevelopment Plans are implemented
through a variety of means, including large-small scale projects, as well as focused strategic
plans, such as the Broadway Strategy (December 2003).
                                                                               Page LUT-5

   1.4.3        Specific Plans
   Specific Plans are customized regulatory documents that provide more focused guidance and
   regulation for particular areas. They generally include a land use plan; circulation plan;
   infrastructure plan; zoning designations; development standards; design guidelines; phasing plan;
   financing plan; and implementation plan. Chula Vista has eight approved Specific Plans, which
   are listed below, and their locations are shown on Figure 5-3. Additionally, a Specific Plan is
   being prepared for northwestern Chula Vista's Urban Core.

   1.4.4        General Development Plans
   A General Development Plan (GDP) is a smaller scale version of a General Plan that typically
   addresses large, previously undeveloped areas of the City, such as those in East Chula Vista. It
   establishes general development parameters, including the distribution of land uses, vehicular
   circulation patterns, development densities, and an overall master planned community urban
   structure. A GDP is implemented by the adoption of a Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plan. The
   City has six GDPs, which are discussed further in Section 10.0, East Area Plan, of this element.
   GDPs must be in conformance with the General Plan.

   1.4.5        Sectional Planning Area Plans
       A Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plan is a comprehensive master plan that addresses a
   portion of a planned community area. It is intended to implement the goals, objectives, and
   development parameters prescribed in the GDP. A SPA and GDP must be adopted as a
   prerequisite to develop land in a Planned Community (PC) Zone.
   A SPA consists of integrated guidelines and development standards that provide detail on the
   land use mix; design criteria; pedestrian and vehicular circulation pattern; open space; recreation;
   infrastructure requirements; and other components for the entire or portion of an adopted GDP. It
   is based on existing City regulations, guidelines, and policies; but, once adopted, a SPA
   supersedes those documents, except where incorporated by reference.
   1.4.6        Precise Plans
   A Precise Plan is a zoning implementation tool that creates specific property development
   standards and design guidelines in combination with underlying zone standards to allow site
   design flexibility within areas zoned with a Precise Plan modifying district. Precise Plan
   development standards and guidelines, adopted by ordinance, can be tailored for a particular
   area through a rezoning action. The Precise Plan is adopted through a discretionary review
   process that establishes standards and guidelines affecting the property.
   1.4.7        Local Coastal Program
   A Local Coastal Program (LCP) is the planning tool used to carry out the shared partnership
   between the California Coastal Commission's (CCC) mandate to protect coastal resources, and
   local government's regulation of land use through its General Plan. An LCP includes a land use
   plan with land use classifications, types and densities of allowable development, plus goals,
   objectives, and policies concerning development and use of coastal resources. After an LCP is
   approved by the CCC, the CCC’s permitting authority is delegated to the local government. It is
   not intended that the CCC and their permitting authority usurp local government.
   Chula Vista's Bayfront has an LCP, which contains goals and objectives relating to coastal
   development. It is provided in a separate document that describes the associated goals, objectives
   and policies that relate to coastal areas.

1.5 Relationship to Regional & Multi-Jurisdictional
          Plans
1.5.1         San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG)
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), with
representatives from County government and eighteen cities in              The City is a member
the County, conducts research and serves as the forum for                  of SANDAG and
decision-making on regional issues, such as growth,                        participates in the
transportation and land use in San Diego County. The City of               research and
Chula Vista is a member of SANDAG and participates in the                  programs conducted
research and programs conducted by the agency. As described
below, several region-wide plans and programs influence land
                                                                           by the agency.
use and transportation decisions in the City of Chula Vista.
Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP) for the San Diego Region
The Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP) addresses San Diego's regional growth, while preserving
natural resources and limiting urban sprawl. The RCP sets out the region's vision and core values,
establishes policies to address key regional issues, and creates a public investment strategy for
regionally significant infrastructure.
The RCP (SANDAG, July 2004) indicates that, based on current local General Plans, the region
would continue to build homes at a slower pace than needed to support forecast population
growth that would be added largely through natural increase (the number of births less the
number of deaths), and is collectively about 93,000 housing units short of needed capacity. Chula
Vista's role and efforts to address this are presented further in LUT Element Section 4.10, and
through land use policies throughout LUT Section 7.0.
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
The current Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), will implement a long-range vision for highways;
major bus routes; Bus Rapid Transit (BRT); the trolley; rail lines; streets; bicycle travel; pedestrian
traffic; and goods movement.
The RTP contains an integrated set of public policies, strategies, and investments to maintain,
manage, and improve the transportation system in the San Diego region. Within the South Bay
and Chula Vista, the City and other jurisdictions worked with SANDAG to create the South Bay
Transit First Study (2003), which identifies the proposed future transit system. This network is
incorporated into this General Plan, and presented further in LUT Section 5.6, and through policies
under section LUT 7.0.
Sustainable Communities Strategy
A part of the RTP, the Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), lays out how the region will meet
                                                                                   Page LUT-9

greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). CARB’s
targets call for the region to reduce per capita emissions seven percent by 2020 and thirteen
percent by 2035.
Healthy Works
SANDAG and the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency have partnered on
projects related to regional planning to increase levels of physical activity and access to healthy
food and nutrition. SANDAG is working with local agencies to develop guidelines that integrate
public health principles, such as the Centers for Disease Control Healthy Communities Program,
into local and regional projects and programs.
Regional Housing Program
The Regional Housing Program promotes strategies to increase housing supply and ensure access
for all income groups, and provide a variety of housing choices for regional residents.
Employment Lands Inventory
SANDAG analyzes the region's supply of non-retail land and compares it to market demand over
the past five years. In 2003, there were nearly 15,000 acres of designated employment land in the
region, but only 1,420 acres, located mostly in the growing commercial and residential areas of
south San Diego County, were immediately available. The Employment Lands Inventory in Chula
Vista includes acreage along the Bayfront, along Main Street, in the Eastern Urban Center, and
surrounding the Otay Landfill.
Transit First!
SANDAG's adopted Transit First! Strategy seeks to develop a network of transit services; integrate
transit with land use planning; enhance operating speed; and improve the rider's experience.
Transit First! projects will provide high-quality, rubber-tired vehicles offering the speed, comfort and
amenities of a trolley, with the flexibility of non-fixed modes of transportation. Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) vehicles will travel in their own lanes, as well as in mixed flow lanes where they may receive
priority at signalized intersections. Upgraded stations will have shelters, next bus passenger
information, and other features.
Working with SANDAG, Chula Vista has completed a South Bay Transit First! Study to identify
transit alignments, station locations, and other improvements as part of the overall transit network.
Projects programmed for the near future include transit improvements from downtown San Diego
to Otay Ranch via Interstate 805, Olympic Parkway and East Palomar Street. Major stations in the
South Bay include: Sunbow; Heritage; Lomas Verde/Santa Venetia; Freeway Commercial; Eastern
Urban Center; and University (Village 9).
Congestion Management Program (CMP)
SANDAG is the designated congestion management agency for the San Diego region. The
Congestion Management Program (CMP) is a state-mandated program that helps cities and
                                                                                      Page LUT-11

           2020
   communities monitor transportation system performance, develop programs to address near- and
   long-term congestion, and better integrate land use and transportation planning decisions. By
   addressing congestion early through the CMP, we can avoid larger problems in the future that will
   require more expensive solutions. In the short-term, the CMP serves as an element of the Regional
   Transportation Plan (RTP), focusing on congestion management strategies that can be implemented
   in advance of the long- range transportation solutions contained within the RTP.
    1.5.2        Otay Valley Regional Park Concept Plan
    The Otay Valley Regional Park (OVRP) Concept Plan, adopted in May 2001, establishes a plan for
    multi-jurisdictional regional open space of 8,700 acres that will contain a substantial preserve
    area, active recreation, and passive park opportunities. Equestrian, hiking and biking trails are
    anticipated. The park will extend through the Otay River Valley, from San Diego Bay to the Upper
    and Lower Otay Lakes. While the park is regional in scope, the provision of certain park and
    recreational facilities will effectively serve as local neighborhood and/or community parks for
    Chula Vista residents.
    1.5.3        Port of San Diego’s Marine Activities
    San Diego County enjoys broad access to coastal waters that
    provide opportunities for maritime commerce, navigation,
    fisheries and recreation. The Port of San Diego oversees and
    plans for development of these activities within San Diego
    waters. The Port of San Diego's master and strategic plans also
    include development for Chula Vista's Bayfront. See Section 11.0
    of this element regarding the Bayfront Area Plan.
    1.5.4        Regional Airport Authority
    The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority (SDCRAA) is responsible for airport planning in
    the region and is working to site a new regional airport facility. San Diego's Lindbergh Field
    cannot meet the projected demand for passenger and air cargo services, even with an additional
    runway included in the maximum expansion scenario considered in the Airport Master Plan.
    Therefore, alternative sites and options are being explored.
    The Regional Airport Authority also serves as the San Diego County Airport Land Use Commission
    (ALUC), with responsibility for airport land use compatibility planning in the vicinity of 16 public-
    use and military airports in San Diego County, including Brown Field, which is located just south
    of the City of Chula Vista.

2.0           EXISTING LAND USE
 The City's General Plan area covers nearly 58,421 acres, of which
 33,366 acres are located within the City limits. Surrounding                             The Bayfront
 jurisdictions include National City to the north and west; San                           Planning Area, west
 Diego County to the north, east, and south; and the City of San
 Diego to the south. Table 5-1 provides a breakdown of existing                           of Interstate 5, has
 land uses by acreage and percentage of the total, including all                          approximately 2,620
 uses within the City. Presently, 34% of the City is made up of                           acres.
 actual developed land uses, excluding water, open space, vacant
 land and streets. Approximately 74% of the developed land
 uses constitute residential of various densities. Commercial uses
 make up 9% of the developed acreage, including 6% for retail, 2% for office, and less than 1% for
 visitor serving commercial. An additional 7% of developed land is used for industrial purposes,
 with 7% in educational and institutional uses, and 3% in parks and recreation.
 The City of Chula Vista takes pride in maintaining a rich mixture of communities. Between
 Interstate 805 and Interstate 5, western Chula Vista's 8,809 acres, which includes the Northwest
 and Southwest Planning Areas (see Figure 5-7), have a traditional street grid, with large single-
 use residential neighborhoods separated by commercial corridors. The Bayfront Planning Area,
 west of Interstate 5, has approximately 2,620 acres including water. The East Planning Area,
 where master planned development began in the 1970s, has approximately 22,651 acres in the
 City's incorporated area. Although most of the East Planning Area's developments are suburban
 in nature, characterized by single-use residential areas, curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, and
 commercial malls, villages in the Otay Ranch Master Planned Community have higher density
 central cores of multi-family residential, neighborhood serving shops, and community facilities.

3.0            COMMUNITY IMAGE AND CHARACTER
   Chula Vista’s community image is the impression that its
   residents and visitors have of the City. Such impressions           Acknowledging the existing
   are formed by the City's natural geological features and            character and scale of the
   scenic resources, and by physical or built features, such           City when new development
   as gateways; streetscapes; neighborhoods; activity nodes;           and other physical
   landmarks; buildings; signs; and outdoor urban spaces.              alterations occur is essential
                                                                       if we are to be successful in
   Unlike many cities in the region, Chula Vista has a
                                                                       achieving the desired
   diversity of built environments urban, suburban, and rural
   areas in addition to large, natural areas that are intended balance.
   to remain undeveloped. Each type of built environment
   has its own set of particular characteristics, such as views; landscaping; types of streets and
   housing; commercial activity; parks; and civic buildings that combine together to create a unique
   community character.
   Chula Vista's community character is comprised of different traits attributable to different areas
   that developed at different times. This is true of many California cities that have older, built-up
   portions of the community developed over the last 60 years or more, contrasted by more recent,
                                        new development in vacant land areas. Many Chula Vista
                                        citizens recognize what has been characterized as two cities;
                                        older Chula Vista (west of Interstate 805), and eastern Chula
                                        Vista (east of Interstate 805). The east, built under more
                                        contemporary development and design standards, is often seen
                                        as having more and better amenities than western Chula Vista.
                                        Western Chula Vista residents desire revitalization and
                                        amenitization of the older areas, but at the same time value the
                                        quiet, suburban village character that has existed to-date.
   As the City and the community, through this General Plan and other efforts, focus their attention
   on the revitalization and redevelopment of western Chula Vista, the issue of community
   character will be of key importance as we work to strike an acceptable balance between the new
   projects and activities that will shepherd in the needed and desired changes, and the shaping of
   those in a manner that retains key, desirable character elements. Acknowledging the existing
   character and scale of the City when new development and other physical alterations occur is
   essential if we are to be successful in achieving the desired balance. It means being aware of
   how surrounding areas and neighborhoods relate to and interact with new development; it
   means being in touch with how physical changes will affect the buildings next door or across
   the street; and it means protecting the City's cultural and historical “personality”.

historic resources; and the City’s urban design and form. While discussions and policies
addressing these and additional factors are found throughout the Land Use and Transportation
Element, particular attention is given in Sections 4.3, 4.5, 4.7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.6, of this element.
3.1 Scenic Resources and Open Space Network
Scenic resources and open space help to relieve the stress of living in a fast paced urban
environment and also help to define an area's visual and community character, the image that
stays in the minds of the people who visit and live in the community. Scenic views and open
space contribute positively to a city's image and foster community pride, which are important
factors that attract people to live in or visit an area. Chula Vista has valued scenic vistas and
open space that include the Otay River and Sweetwater River Valleys; Upper and Lower Otay
Lakes; Sweetwater Reservoir; San Miguel/Mother Miguel Mountains; and the San Diego Bay.
These open space areas make up the majority of the Chula Vista Greenbelt, the backbone of the
                                    City's open space and park system, which consists of a 28-mile
                                    open space system encircling the City. The Greenbelt includes
                                    Multiple Species Conservation Program preserve lands; general
                                    open space; existing and future trails; and connects several of
                                    the City's existing and future public parks. Additional natural
                                    open space exists within master planned communities in the
                                    East Planning Area, including Rice Canyon and Long Canyon.
                                    Figure 5-5, Open Space Network, depicts the General Plan area
                                    open space network in its entirety, including parks and
                                    recreation facilities.
Chula Vista has several designated Scenic Roadways, where views of unique natural features
and roadway characteristics, including enhanced landscaping, adjoining natural slopes, or
special design features make traveling a pleasant visual experience. The designated Scenic
Roadways are listed below and are shown on Figure 5-4, Designated Scenic Roadways.

   element.
   3.2 Gateways
   The appearance of a community is a good indicator of how well a community functions, and says
   a lot about the sense of community pride that its residents have. A visually attractive city is
   desirable, as it conveys a positive image and inspires community pride. Chula Vista's organized
   system of entryways and gateways offers opportunities to
   improve the City's appearance, establish a stronger community           An individual’s
   image, and enhance community pride amongst residents.                   perception of Chula
                                                                           Vista can be a strong
   Special design treatments, which may include themed signage,
   landscape and architectural design enhancements, and other              contributing factor in
   elements should be used to signify arrival into the City and            making economic
   progression to key destinations along gateway streets. The              decisions.
   special design treatments should consider topographic
   conditions and roadway configuration. Discussion of entryways,
   gateways, and gateway streets is also closely related to Section 3.1, Scenic Resources and Open
   Space Network of this element. In addition to entryways, gateways and gateway streets, special
   attention should be given to providing an enhanced pedestrian linkage (“F Street Promenade”)
   between the Urban Core Subarea and the Bayfront along F Street. For policies regarding
                                        entryways, gateways, and gateway streets, refer to Section 7.6,
                                        Enhancing Community Image, of this element.
                                        Entryways and gateways are divided into three categories, which
                                        are defined below and shown on Figure 5-6, Entryways and
                                        Gateways. Discussion of the categories and their design
                                        treatments follow.

                                                                                   CHAPTER 5
          !   Overall Entryway -- Where a major approach route enters the City and extends along
              that route for some distance into the City
          !   Primary Gateway -- Where an entry into an important district of the City occurs off a
              major approach route or off an Overall Entryway
          !   Secondary Gateway -- Where a significant entry into the City occurs from an adjacent
              community.
Overall Entryways
A significant number of vehicles pass through Chula Vista on Interstates 5 and 805, and many
more will pass through on State Route 125, in the East Planning Area, upon its completion. To a
substantial degree, travelers' views from these highways is what determines their perception and
image of the City. This is especially true for those people who have never visited Chula Vista or
visit infrequently. An individual's perception of Chula Vista can be a strong contributing factor in
making economic decisions, including:
          !  Whether to shop, dine or recreate in Chula Vista
          !  Whether to locate a business, retail store, or other employment-generating use in
             Chula Vista
          !  Whether to invest in projects in Chula Vista
Given these considerations, it is important that Chula Vista provide travelers with a positive
impression along the City's highways. This involves identifying the City effectively; directing
visitors to key uses; making key entrances more attractive; improving or screening unattractive
areas; and ensuring that new uses meet appropriate design standards. These measures will help
convey a consistent, positive message about the merits of our well-functioning city.
Additionally, consistent special design treatment should be used to identify arrival into the City at
its six overall Entryways, as shown on Figure 5-6, Entryways and Gateways, the regional accesses
that constitute the six Overall Entryways into the City are almost exclusively from the region-
serving highways of Interstates 5 and 805, and State Route 125. From either the north or south,
the perceived City boundary or entry to the City is created by a dominant urban or natural form,
rather than the City's precise corporate limits. From the north, State Route 54 and the Sweetwater
River mark the boundary; from the south it is the Otay River Valley. Additionally, consistent special
design treatment should be used to identify arrival into the City at its six overall Entryways.
Primary Gateways
A Primary Gateway into the City from a freeway should appear visually inviting, provide adequate
direction to key community places of interest, and have high quality architectural design. At each
Primary Gateway a consistent design treatment should be used to create a unique environment
that announces arrival into the City. As shown on Figure 5-6, Entryways and Gateways, there are
ten freeway entrances into the City that are designated as Primary Gateways -- five into the Urban
Core Subarea, Bayfront Planning Area, and Bonita; one into the Southwest Planning Area; one
                                                                                Page LUT-21

                Area.
   Secondary Gateways
   Secondary Gateways are significant roadways that link Chula Vista from adjacent communities
   and should provide travelers with a clear impression that they are entering the City of Chula
   Vista. Enhanced landscaping and appropriate signage should occur at Secondary Gateways,
   including Broadway from National City to the north, and Beyer Way and Beyer Boulevard from
   San Diego to the south. See Section 7.6, Enhancing Community Image, for secondary gateway
   policies.
   3.3 Neighborhood Identity
   The quality, physical form, and arrangement of urban design contribute to neighborhood identity
   and overall livability. Urban design refers to the various physical design elements that make up
   the City's built environment, including buildings; public spaces; streetscapes; and landscaping.
   One example of urban design is the Downtown Third Avenue District, with a distinctive row of
   palm trees in the street medians; neighborhood signage; modern
   and well-landscaped civic buildings; Friendship and Memorial Parks;
   and unique retail shops along Third Avenue.
   Another example is Otay Ranch Village One's Heritage Park and
   Village Core. Chula Vista has several good urban design elements,
   such as the urban parks and plazas in the Urban Core Subarea,
   and Bayfront access west of Interstate 5; however, these elements
   need to be better connected to improve people's access and to
   increase vitality in adjacent commercial areas.
   3.4 Historic Preservation
   The most effective way to protect the resources that represent the history of a community is
   through the adoption and implementation of a local historic preservation ordinance. Beginning
   in 2002, the Chula Vista Ad Hoc Historic Preservation Committee evaluated the City's historic
   preservation policies and programs and developed recommendations for historic preservation
   efforts. Their report, “An Evaluation of Historic Preservation in Chula Vista,” was accepted by the
   City Council on September 30, 2003. Key recommendations for City action are included below,
   and as policies in Section 7.6, Enhancing Community Image, of this element.

                                                                                            CHAPTER 5
             !     Develop a historic preservation program based upon the standards established by the
                   State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).
             !     Obtain Certified Local Government (CLG) status for the City, which integrates local
                   government decision-making with the national historic preservation program.
             !     Pursue federal funding and technical assistance for preservation activities; adopt
                   criteria specific to local needs, based upon the National Register of Historic Places
                   criteria, as required for CLG status; and provide more incentives for historic
                   preservation.
    Prior to 1985, the City of Chula Vista did not have an official local register of historical resources
    and only a small number of houses were recognized as historic. A 1985 historical resources
    inventory conducted in a limited portion of the Northwest Planning Area surveyed approximately
    258 homes. Forty-two homes were subsequently put on Chula Vista's List of Designated Historic
                                          Sites. Chula Vista's 2001 adoption of the State Mills Act Program,
                                          which provides tax incentives for owners of historic sites, helped
                                          to add more historic sites. Chula Vista's List of Designated
                                          Historic Sites has at least 65 designated historic properties.
                                          The State Historical Building Code is a tool that is available to the
                                          City to ensure reasonable safety of historically significant
                                          buildings from geologic hazards while facilitating the
                                          maintenance of the historical integrity of such buildings.
    3.5 Urban Design and Form
    In its basic essence, “urban design and form” most accurately describes the collective parts of our
    natural and built environment that combine to create a pattern of development and a sense of
    place. Various factors, including: land use arrangement; building design; landscape; open space;
    and transportation create a system of relationships that is larger and more comprehensive than
    the design of an individual building or space, and must be considered together for best results.
    Urban design and form is intended to bring order, clarity, and harmony to human settlements.
    “Form” is typically expressed by one of three terms: urban, suburban, or rural. In contrast to
    suburban and rural areas, the urban form is typified by denser arrangements of buildings;
    by overlapping patterns of use and activities; and clearly defined, humanly-scaled external
    spaces, where citizens can conduct business and meet and mingle freely with others.
    By its nature, urban form often evolves as communities grow and change over time. This
    evolution is a natural trend, and is not necessarily a reflection of a loss of character, but rather an

   acknowledgement that factors such as population, demographics, and economics change both
   within and outside of external to the community. This change is often referred to as a city's
   “lifecycle”, with many parallels to our own human lifecycle.
   For many years, Chula Vista grew in a fairly traditional pattern around a central downtown
   generally located in the area around Third Avenue, H Street, Broadway and E Street. Early
   planners laid out the transportation infrastructure on the western side of the City in a grid street
   pattern, providing the ability for people to move freely and establishing the opportunity for future
   infill development. In the traditional “ring” pattern, less intense development is further away from
   downtown. Generally speaking, Chula Vista's current urban form is primarily low density,
   suburban development, heavily dependent on the automobile for transportation. The quiet single-
   family neighborhood, with tree-lined streets has been recognized through surveys and public
   input as an important characteristic of the City.
   Urban Design is also important for creating a healthy community because it addresses the
   form and character of the community, which in turn can promote walking, biking and reduced
   dependence on driving.
   As discussed in previous pages, the City is at a key point in its lifecycle, particularly regarding the
   revitalization and redevelopment of western Chula Vista. Although the existing low density
   development pattern there is comfortable and familiar, it has, and will continue to be, increasingly
   difficult and expensive to maintain or supply the quantities of land, roadways, and other
   infrastructure that are necessary to continue this pattern of development or redevelopment in
   western Chula Vista. Factors such as limited land availability; escalating land and housing prices;
   declining public health; long commutes; and ailing commercial districts suggest a need for a
   more urban development pattern in select areas of the City. However, increased developed
   intensity is seen by some as a threat to the lower intensity suburban lifestyle.
   One of the primary focuses of this General Plan is to address the need for revitalization and
   redevelopment in western Chula Vista. Shaping the evolution from a suburban to a more urban
   form would be a means of providing for the community's future needs for health and
   sustainability affordable housing; jobs; transportation; expanded commercial opportunities; and
   improved facilities and amenities. “Shaping the Future Through the Present and Past” (Theme 8
   of Chapter 4, Vision and Themes) assures that such revitalization and redevelopment will be
   done in a manner that respects the City's character, scale, and historical value, creating changes
   that blend in with and enhance the City's identity. LUT Section 4.4, Redevelopment and
   Community Benefits, further explains these relationships. Discussions and policies regarding
   urban design and form can be found in LUT Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, and 7.2, as well as within
   individual Area Plans (see Sections 8.0 -11.0).

 additional housing and jobs; improve our City's image; and add
 cultural and recreational amenities for our residents.
 4.2 Area Plans and Planning Hierarchy
 4.2.1        Area Plans
 This General Plan organizes our City into four Planning Areas: Southwest: Northwest; East; and
 Bayfront, as shown on Figure 5-7. Each Planning Area has an Area Plan, which is incorporated
 within this Land Use and Transportation Element. Supplementing sections that address City-wide
 issues and policies, the four Area Plans discuss issues unique to their particular area and present
 the planning policies to address those issues. Area Plans are found in Sections 8.0 - 11.0 of this
 element.
 Chula Vista’s previous General Plan had five Planning Areas, each with its own Area Plan.
 However, this General Plan combines some of the previous Planning Areas. The former
 Sweetwater and Eastern Territories have been integrated into the East Planning Area and the
 former Montgomery Planning Area is now a part of the Southwest Planning Area.
 4.2.2        Planning Hierarchy
 Several terms are used throughout this General Plan that organize the City into a hierarchy of
 geographic areas for discussion and policy purposes. From the largest to smallest areas, they
 are: Planning Area, Subarea, District, and Focus Area. A diagram of this planning hierarchy is
 shown on Figure 5-8.
                                                                                Page LUT-27

4.3 Smart Growth Principles
This General Plan provides guidance to citizens, developers, City staff, and decision-makers over
the next 25 years, through the Year 2030. It pays particular attention to Smart Growth principles
being promoted throughout the country, California, and our region. While there is no single
definition of Smart Growth that everyone embraces, there are certain common elements.
The basic Smart Growth principles are summarized as follows:
         !   Provide a mix of compatible land uses
         !   Take advantage of compact building design
         !   Create a range of housing opportunities and choices
         !   Create walkable neighborhoods
         !   Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place
         !   Preserve open space, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas
         !   Strengthen and direct development towards existing communities
         !   Provide a variety of transportation choices
         !   Make development decisions predictable, fair and cost effective
         !   Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions
Many of the elements of Smart Growth not only make communities more attractive and
affordable places to live but also make them healthier places. Streets that are safe and
comfortable for walkers and bikers encourage people to get more exercise as part of their daily
routines. Having transportation options helps reduce traffic and air pollution, and preserving
green space helps protect water quality while making communities more attractive. Smart
growth strategies help ensure communities develop in ways that keep our children and families
healthy, with clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and safe places to exercise outside.
The City of Chula Vista has already undertaken planning efforts that serve to implement Smart
Growth principles, such as the village concept for Otay Ranch, and the incorporation of healthy
community and complete street programs and policies. Smart Growth principles are
incorporated into this General Plan's Vision and Themes, which guide the Land Use Plan and
provide the basis for many of the Land Use and Transportation Element's policies, including
the Area Plans.
                                                                                 Page LUT-31

          2020
   4.4 Redevelopment and Community Benefits
   Sections 4.4.1-4.4.4, below, will:
            !    Describe this General Plan’s increasing emphasis on western Chula Vista;
            !    Explain how revitalization and redevelopment can help address some of the
                opportunities and constraints presented in already developed areas;
            !    Present summary information on the benefits of revitalization and redevelopment;
                and
            !    Outline how revitalization and redevelopment themes are reflected throughout this
                 General Plan.
   4.5 Urban Framework - Present and Future
   Chula Vista's urban framework is comprised of its circulation network; its pattern of unique and
   complementary neighborhoods and districts; and its open space system. Specifically, it includes:
   the Bayfront Planning Area; the Northwest Planning Area, which includes the Urban Core
   Subarea; the Southwest Planning Area, including the Southwest Town Focus Area; the East
   Planning Area's Olympic Training Center; master planned communities; and the future Eastern
   Urban Center, university, and Regional Technology Park. In addition, the urban framework
   includes other activity centers with city-serving land uses that tie the community together. The
   activity centers include areas with a high concentration of jobs; shopping centers that serve local
   and/or regional needs; significant community gathering places; and major commercial and
   transit corridors. Figure 5-9 shows activity center locations, the Urban Core Subarea, and
   commercial corridors.
   Residential areas and a substantial open space network, including the Chula Vista Greenbelt, a
   28-mile open space system that encircles the community, helps to physically define the City;
   provides a sense of place and unique identity; provides for the conservation of sensitive plants
   and animals; and provides a break in the urban development pattern with scenic views and
   recreational open space.
   All of Chula Vista’s urban framework components direct future growth patterns, while preserving
   the natural environment. Commercial and/or transit corridors, as depicted on Figure 5-9, Activity
   Centers, help to link or connect the community, and include:

  4.6 Land Available for Development
  This General Plan takes two approaches towards accommodating future growth.
  Infill development and redevelopment is directed to the Northwest, Bayfront and Southwest
  Planning Areas, west of Interstate 805, to efficiently use existing infrastructure; increase residential
  densities; take advantage of existing and future transit; and revitalize existing commercial areas.
  In the East Planning Area, east of Interstate 805, development will continue to occur in master
  planned communities that are designed to support regional transit service; provide neighborhood
  and regional commercial areas; offer a variety of housing opportunities; provide a Regional
  Technology Park and university; and will require new infrastructure, including roads, utilities, and
  community parks.
  4.7 Focused Areas of Change and Preservation of
           Stable Residential Neighborhoods
  Shaping Chula Vista's future involves designating areas
  considered appropriate for increased development, while
  balancing those against areas where limited change and
  preservation should occur.
  Recognizing the importance of preserving and protecting Chula
  Vista's stable residential neighborhoods and overall community
  character, this General Plan uses three terms and approaches
  for directing future growth and development:
  Focused Areas of Change
  Focused Areas of Change are those areas where more intensive development, revitalization
  and/or redevelopment are proposed to occur. As shown on Figure 5-10, these select Focus Areas
  are strategically located in portions of the Northwest, Bayfront and Southwest Planning Areas,
  along major activity corridors, including Interstate 5; Broadway; E Street; H Street; Third Avenue;
  and Main Street. In the East Planning Area, they cover future development areas within Otay
  Ranch. These are parts of our City where new growth and redevelopment can best be
  accommodated because of current or future transportation choices, and opportunities for mixed
  use development and higher housing densities. Area Plans in Sections 8.0 - 11.0 of this element
  include discussion, diagrams, and detailed policies regarding development of these Focus Areas.

                                                                                       CHAPTER 5
Transitional Areas
Transitional Areas are where significant General Plan changes are not proposed, but where infill,
redevelopment, and/or revitalization activities may still occur. This is not intended to indicate that
those areas are undesireable, problematic, or necessarily unstable, but rather that some change
is likely to occur. These can include commercial and industrial areas, mixed residential and
commercial areas, and residential neighborhoods consisting of a mix of single- and multiple-
family dwellings. They may also include small areas where revitalization could enhance the
surrounding neighborhood, such as a stagnant commercial center where reinvestment is
desirable to make the area an asset to, and supportive of, the surrounding neighborhood. These
areas are often near or between Focus Areas of Change, and may include both vacant and
underutilized lands.
Stable Residential Neighborhoods
Stable Residential Neighborhoods are those neighborhood areas designated, zoned, and
completely developed with single-family dwellings, except for the school, park, fire station, or other
public or quasi-public facility that may be located within them. They may also include new or
older stable, multi-family neighborhoods. Home additions, reconstruction, revitalization and
rehabilitation, activities will still occur; however, the type of use and intensity will not change.
Much of western Chula Vista is comprised of these stable neighborhoods, as is the vast majority
of the development in eastern Chula Vista. Overall, the General Plan Land Use Plan targets
higher density and higher intensity development into specific Focus Areas in order to protect
stable residential neighborhoods, and to create vibrant mixed use urban environments that are
oriented to transit and pedestrian activity. Development is directed primarily to transit or
commercial corridors, multi-family areas, vacant lands, and underutilized areas. This targeted
development will be well-designed, compatible with adjacent areas, and will contribute to the
continued vitality of Chula Vista's economy.
4.8 Density/Intensity
State General Plan law requires the Land Use Element to indicate the standards for building
intensity (i.e., residential densities and non-residential building intensities) allowed in the City.
This Land Use and Transportation Element has 24 land use designations. Each designation
allows certain land uses and establishes corresponding density/intensity levels, as applicable
(refer to Table 5-4, General Plan Land Use Designations and Zoning). For certain land use
designations, such as those in the mixed use category, guidance on density and intensity is
found in the policies of each Area Plan.
                                                                                     Page LUT-35

           2020
  The Area Plans in Sections 8.0 - 11.0 of this element include Focus Area discussion, diagrams,
  and detailed policies regarding development of the Focus Areas. Where General Plan changes
  are not proposed, infill and revitialization activities may still occur.
  4.8.1        Residential “Density”
  The term “density,” in a land use context, is a measure of the desired population or residential
  development capacity of the land. Residential density is described in terms of dwelling units per
  gross acre (dwelling units per acre); thus, the density of a residential development of 100 dwelling
  units occupying 20 gross acres of land is 5.0 dwelling units per acre. A dwelling unit is a
  building or a portion of a building used for human habitation and may vary considerably in
  square footage size, from small apartments, such as 600 square feet, to large single-family homes
  exceeding 5,000 square feet. Gross residential density is defined as the area devoted to
  residential use, including dedicated neighborhood parks, plus local serving streets and alleys, but
  exclusive of arterials having more than four lanes. For purposes of calculating population, an
  average number of persons per acre is calculated for the residential designations, and is based
  on Chula Vista's average household size of 3.33 persons per single-family unit; 2.58 persons per
  multi-family unit; and 1.99 persons per mobile home dwelling unit. This factor is revised from
  time to time to reflect regional housing habitation trends
  .
  4.8.2        Non-Residential “Intensity”
  The term “intensity” refers to the degree of non-residential development based on building
  characteristics, such as height; bulk; floor area ratio; and percentage of lot coverage.
  Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is a common expression of non-residential land use intensity. The FAR
  results from dividing the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the total area of that lot.
  For example, a building with 5,000 square feet of gross floor area on a 10,000 square foot lot
  would have a FAR of 0.5, while a building with 20,000 square feet of floor area on the same lot
  would have a FAR of 2.0. Higher FARs generally indicate larger buildings and/or more stories.
  See Figure 5-11 for examples of various FARs and their potential site arrangement.
    The General Plan’s intention regarding intensity is to reflect a maximum development envelope
  or density range under appropriate conditions, and in accordance with applicable more detailed
  zoning regulations; not to allow the maximum FAR or density allowed within a density range on
  a particular parcel. There are many factors that may limit, or affect a development achieving the
  maximum density or FAR on a specific parcel, resulting from a parcel's physical limitations, the
  City's zoning requirements, and how a developer chooses to address the function and design of
  the development. These factors may include, but are not limited to the following:

         !   Type of parking provided: surface, below grade, or structured
         !   Adjacency to sensitive land uses, such as single-family neighborhoods
Actual FARs on a parcel by parcel basis may vary from the area-wide FARs referenced by policies
for various Focus Areas, provided that the predominant building height intents are not exceeded.
There are also opportunities for property owners/developers to achieve increased density and/or
FAR within a particular General Plan range through use of an incentive program that would be
implemented by the City. This topic is further discussed in Section 7.13, Relationship of
Density/Intensity to Amenities, of this element.
4.8.3        Height
This General Plan uses three terms to define basic categories of building heights:
        !    Low-rise: 1 to 3 stories
        !    Mid-rise: 4 to 7 stories
        !    High-rise: 8 or more stories
These height ranges identify the general building heights intended within a particular area. As
presented through policies in the Area Plans in Sections 8.0 - 11.0 of this element, one category,
such as low-rise, may be stated to be the predominant, intended building height, with another
category, such as mid-rise, allowed for some of the buildings. The categories are generalized in
this manner to allow some discretion in the establishment of more detailed zoning regulations in
a particular context.
Height variations of one to two stories may occur within a particular area's identified height
range, provided the predominant height character is maintained. Within areas identified as
allowing for some “high-rise” building heights, extra care and consideration shall be given to
allowing for such structures as further discussed in LUT Section 7.2, Urban Design and Form.
High-rise building heights are not considered to be unlimited, but rather are intended to be
evaluated and moderated through the criteria presented in Section 7.2.
Consistent with these General Plan intentions, actual allowable building heights and the extent
of any variations within particular areas will be governed by the applicable zoning regulations
and/or design guidelines for such areas.
                                                                                Page LUT-37

          2020
   4.9 Land Use Designations
   General Plan land use designations are for general planning purposes. They describe a range of
   land uses that reflect different General Plan policies related to the type, location, density and
   intensity of development. In addition to the density or intensity included in the Land Use
   Designations of this element, the Area Plans for Chula Vista in Sections 8.0 - 11.0 of this element
   include policies that further address the density or intensity (dwelling units per acre or floor area
   ratio) that is envisioned for each Planning District and their Focus Areas.
   Property owners who have achieved a vested rights status retain the ability to develop in
   accordance with the land use designations in effect at the time of vesting prior to adoption of
   this General Plan Update.
   The Land Use Diagram for Chula Vista illustrates the general pattern and relationship of the
   various land uses in the year 2030 (Figure 5-12). The Land Use Diagram illustrates six broad
   categories of land use, encompassing a wide range of residential, business, and public uses. The
   land uses are broad enough to provide flexibility when implementing the General Plan, and
   sufficiently clear in providing direction to apply subsequent, more detailed zoning designations.
   Table 5-4, General Plan Land Use Designations and Zoning, summarizes the land use categories,
   along with their allowable ranges of density and intensity. Typical uses associated with each
   broad category are summarized below.
   The relationship between the General Plan land use
   designations and zoning districts is also shown on Table 5-4.           Mixed use
   This table indicates how properties should be zoned to be               development brings
   consistent with the General Plan Land Use Diagram. An                   people closer to what
   amendment to the Zoning Ordinance will be needed to revise              they need on a daily
   zoning districts or to add new ones. Any land use designations          basis and provides
   inconsistent with existing zoning will require rezonings,               more choices to both
   subsequent to adoption of this General Plan. The Urban Core             residents and workers.
   Specific Plan will be the vehicle for some of the rezonings.
   This General Plan introduces a new type of land use to the City -- mixed use, which is actually
   the return of a traditional type of development that was common until the 1950s. The basic
   premise behind mixed use is to combine complementary uses to create beneficial results. Mixed
   use development brings people closer to what they need on a daily basis and provides more
   choices to both residents and workers, so driving is not the only option to get to a grocery or
   video store, or to work. It allows an area to be useful for a longer portion of the day than single-
   use developments. Additionally, mixed use areas are a more efficient use of land and public
   infrastructure.

                                 LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
                                                                                     CHAPTER 5
Major benefits of mixed use development is that people can drive less (which reduces traffic
congestion and improves air quality) and walk more (which creates increased health benefits,
safer streets, and allows greater social interaction). Economic benefits are realized by residents
who have lower commute costs, employees who can easily run errands during lunch or after
work, and the small businesses and restaurants who serve both area residents and employees.
When mixed use development is located within a short walking distance of public transit service,
there is a larger potential ridership base so more frequent service can be provided.
There are three new mixed use designations: Mixed Use Commercial, Mixed Use Residential,
and Mixed Use Transit Focus Area, all of which are defined in Section 4.9.4, Mixed Use Category,
below.
4.9.1        Interpreting the Land Use Diagram
Boundaries
The Land Use Diagram is a graphic expression of the General Plan's land use objectives and
plan proposals. The diagram is not intended to be a precise map of the City, but a generalized
expression of patterns of land use, circulation, and public services. In particular, the Land Use
Diagram should not be relied upon to resolve issues of exact scale and distance. The
boundaries of specific areas of land use require interpretation with respect to underlying
topographic features, environmental characteristics, and existing land use.
Density/Intensity
Because the General Plan land use designations describe a range of land uses and development
intensities in a relatively large area, such as within a District, they are not intended to be used as
standards to determine the allowable density or intensity on a specific parcel. Allowable
densities, intensities and land uses in each area at a parcel-specific level are established in the
more detailed and specific zoning ordinance, or other planning regulatory documents, such as
Specific Plans, General Development Plans, Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plans and/or Precise
Plans.
Guidance for the establishment of regulatory densities, intensities and character of land uses is
further defined through objectives and policies in Section 7 of this element, and for particular
geographic areas, through further objectives and policies listed in each Area Plan in Sections 8.0
- 11.0 of this element. Specific policies address topics such as Uses; Intensity/Height
Compatibility and Edges; Design; and Amenities, among other things.

Non-sited Uses
The use of a “floating symbol” on the Land Use Diagram, which is represented by a round dot
colored with a specific land use, indicates that a future type of land use or public facility is
planned in the approximate area but has not yet been sited. Examples include a park or school,
in the case of public facilities, or a visitor commercial area for a resort, in the case of land uses.
4.9.2         Residential Category
There are seven residential designations that provide for a full
range of housing types. Residential designations are based on               Any assumed
density (as defined in Section 4.8.1) Densities below eight units          density would begin
per acre usually consist of detached, single-family homes, while           at the minimum and
higher densities usually consist of attached units, such as
duplexes; townhouses; row homes; apartments; condominiums;
                                                                           may move toward
co-ops; and co-housing.                                                    the maximum, based
                                                                           on a project's on-
Each residential land use designation is based on “gross density,”         and off-site
which is the area devoted to residential use, including dedicated          considerations and
neighborhood parks, local serving streets and alleys, and                  context.
excluding arterials having more than four lanes.
Development within each designation is expressed as a density range (both minimum and
maximum), but this General Plan does not assume a preferred density within the range.
Generally stated, any assumed density would begin at the minimum and may move toward the
maximum, based on a project's on- and off-site considerations and context. Development
standards established in the Zoning Code or other regulatory documents, such as Specific Plans,
will further identify where, within each range, a particular project density will be determined, and
pursuant to what standards and requirements.
Provisions for the potential clustering of residential development under certain circumstances are
provided in Section 7.14 of this element.
Low Residential
The Low Residential designation is intended for single-family detached dwellings on large, rural,
estate-type lots, with densities ranging from 0 to 3 dwelling units per gross acre. This character
predominates in existing residential neighborhoods within and adjacent to Sweetwater Valley.
This is also the appropriate residential land use for areas with relatively steep slopes. At an
average of 3.25 persons per unit, population density in this designation would be up to 9.8
persons per acre.
                                                                                     Page LUT-43

           2020
  Low-Medium Residential
  The Low-Medium Residential designation includes single-family detached dwelling units on
  medium-sized lots, as typically found in Chula Vista's existing single-family areas west of
  Interstate 805. Density for this designation ranges from 3.1 to 6 dwellings per gross acre.
  Using a cluster development concept, other housing types could also be consistent with this
  designation, such as single-family attached units (townhouses, row homes, and patio homes) or
  smaller lot and zero-lot-line detached single-family dwellings. At an average of 3.3 persons per
  unit, population density in this designation would range from 10.2 to 19.8 persons per acre.
  Medium Residential
  The Medium Residential designation is intended for single-family detached homes on smaller
  lots; zero-lot-line homes; patio homes; and attached units, such as duplexes and townhouses,
  with densities ranging from 6.1 to 11 dwelling units per gross acre. This category also includes
  mobile home parks. At an average of 2.5 persons per unit, population density in this designation
  would range from 15 to 27.5 persons per acre.
  Medium-High Residential
  The Medium-High Residential designation is intended for multi-
  family units such as townhouses and garden apartments, with
  densities ranging from 11.1 to 18 dwelling units per gross acre.
  This category also includes mobile home parks. At an average
  of 2.52 persons per unit, population density in this designation
  would range from 27.5 to 45 persons per acre.
  High Residential
  The High Residential designation is intended for multi-family units, such as apartment and
  condominium-type dwellings in multiple-story buildings, with densities ranging from 18.1 to 27
  dwelling units per gross acre. At an average of 2.52 persons per unit, population density in this
  designation would range from 45.3 to 67.5 persons per acre.
  Urban Core Residential
  The Urban Core Residential designation is intended for high density, multi-family dwellings in an
  urban environment, with densities ranging from 27.1 to 60 dwelling units per gross acre.

           2020
   Development at the higher end of this designation is intended to expand the potential for
   residential development near to public transit, particularly along existing and planned transit
   corridors. Developments in this category should reflect high-quality design, with integrated transit
   access, and urban amenities, such as recreational or cultural features, Structured parking may be
   necessary. At an average of 2.5 persons per unit, population density in this designation would
   range from 67.8 to 150 persons per acre.
   Bayfront High Residential.
   The Bayfront High Residential designation is intended as the highest residential density in the
   city to contribute to the vibrancy of a world class Bayfront. As a focal point of the City,
   developments in this category should reflect the highest-quality design with well integrated
   urban amenities and access to transit. Structured parking may be necessary. Residential
   developments may include apartment and condominuim-type dwellings in multiple-story
   buildings, with densities ranging from 60 to 115 dwellings units per gross acre. At an average of
   2.52 persons per unit, population density in this designation would range from 151.2 to 289.8
   persons per acre. Ancillary commercial uses are allowed within this designation to create vitality
   and pedestrian orientation at the street level.
   The intended densities within this designation are outlined in the Bayfront Area Plan in section
   11.0 of this Element. The allowable density of Bayfront High Residential development is linked to
   the provision of the amenities in order to establish a well-balanced urban environment
   4.9.3        Commercial Category
   Three commercial designations allow for a variety of retail and professional uses. The intensity of
   development is measured using Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is defined in the previous Section
   4.8.2. Higher FARs generally indicate larger buildings and/or more stories, as shown on Figure 5-
   11.
   Retail Commercial
   The Retail Commercial designation is intended to allow a range of retail shopping and services,
   including neighborhood, community and regional shopping areas. This category may include
   limited thoroughfare retail and automobile-oriented services. The FAR for this category ranges
   from 0.25 to 0.75.

Visitor Commercial
The Visitor Commercial designation includes transient lodging, such as hotels and motels;
restaurants; commercial recreation; and retail establishments. The FAR for this category ranges
from 0.25 to 1.5.
Professional and Office Commercial
The Professional and Office Commercial designation is intended for business, professional and
public office uses. Limited retail uses that support the nearby office employees are also
permitted. Retail uses that predominantly serve residential neighborhoods or shoppers from
outside the immediate area are excluded from this category. The FAR for this category ranges
from 0.35 to 1.5.
4.9.4         Mixed Use Category
There are three mixed use designations in the mixed use category: one for commercial mixed
use, and two for residential mixed use. Areas designated as mixed use are intended to function
differently from typical patterns of single-zone land uses, such as an area of only office buildings.
In mixed use areas, a variety of compatible land uses and activities are integrated to create a
dynamic urban environment that serves as the activity center for the surrounding area.
There is variation in the intensity and density of mixed use designations for specific parts of the
City, with residential densities ranging from 28 to 60 dwelling units per acre, and Floor Area
Ratios ranging from FAR 1.0 to 4.0.
The allowable density and intensity of development in the mixed use is tied to the provision of
necessary amenities to achieve the community's vision for a well-balanced urban environment.
Further guidance regarding the desired character, density, and intensity of mixed use designated
areas are provided in the Area Plans, Sections 8.0 - 11.0 of this element. Those Sections also
provide guidance regarding the general mix of uses envisioned for a particular area through a
simple pie chart. The purpose of the pie chart is to express the broad, general apportionment of
uses, including residential, retail and office. The pie charts are not intended to be literally
interpreted or measured, but rather to guide the overall emphasis of uses desired for a particular
area. For example, the following pie chart indicates that an area should be largely residential,
with a small supportive retail component:
                                                     Residential
                                                     Retail

          2020
  By comparative example, the following pie chart indicates that an area should be largely retail
  and office commercial, with a limited residential component:
                                                      Residential

                                                      Offices
  The Mixed Use Residential and Mixed Use Transit Focus Area (TFA) designations are intended to
  expand the potential for residential development with convenient access to major activity centers
  and to create new consumer markets in appropriate areas of the City. Both these designations
  allow residential to be mixed with office and/or retail uses.
  Mixed Use Commercial
  The Mixed Use Commercial designation allows for a mix of retail, business services, and office
  uses, but excludes residential. Ground floor uses are predominantly retail in order to promote
  pedestrian activity.
  Mixed Use Residential
  The Mixed Use Residential designation allows a mix of multi-family residential; retail shops;
  financial; business and personal services; restaurants; entertainment; and office opportunities in a
  pedestrian-friendly environment. Ground floor uses are predominantly non-residential in order to
  promote pedestrian activity. Plan policies or the City's Zoning Ordinance may require certain
  uses, such as ground floor retail, in areas with this designation. Due to the more intense,
  compact nature of Mixed Use Residential development, these areas are typically served by transit
  service and other forms of transportation, including enhanced pedestrian and bicycle travel. The
  Mixed Use Residential designation is intended to be less intense than development in the Mixed
  Use Transit Focus Area.
  Mixed Use Transit Focus Area
  The Mixed Use Transit Focus Area (TFA) designation is intended within approximately ¼ mile of
  existing and planned transit stations, and is intended for the highest intensity mixed use
  residential environment. This designation allows a mix of residential, office, and retail uses in an
  area that is pedestrian-friendly and has a strong linkage to provision of transit.
  4.9.5        Industrial Category
  Three industrial land use designations provide opportunities in the City to conduct research and
  development: manufacturing; warehousing; and limited automotive-related endeavors.

“Limited Industrial” categories, plus heavier manufacturing, large-scale warehousing,
transportation centers and public utilities. This category also includes auto salvage yards. The
FAR for this category ranges from 0.25 to 0.5.
4.9.6        Public and Quasi-Public, Parks, and Open Space
The following land use designations are provided to identify various lands used for public, quasi-
public, recreation/parks, and open space uses.
                           Public and Quasi-Public
                           The Public and Quasi-Public designation is intended for schools;
                           churches; hospitals; civic centers; fire stations; libraries, landfills; public
                           utilities and other similar public uses. When PQ or other Public
                           Facilities symbol is used alone or within a floating bubble on the Land
                           Use Diagram, it indicates the possible location of a future facility.
Parks and Recreation
The Parks and Recreation designation is intended for parks; sports fields; playgrounds; golf
courses; and other passive and active recreation uses. The designation may also include
community centers and urban parks.
                                                                                    Page LUT-51

          2020
  Open Space
  The Open Space designation is intended for lands to be protected from urban development,
  including floodplains; canyon; mountain; and agricultural uses. These lands may include unique
  natural conditions; provide scenic vistas; or are areas to be set aside that have potential exposure
  to hazards such as earthquakes; landslides; fires; floods; erosion; or even high levels of roadway
  noise. Passive recreation uses, such as trails; staging areas; scenic overlooks; and picnic areas,
  may occur within these areas.
  Open Space Preserve
  The Open Space Preserve designation is intended for areas designated within the Chula Vista
  Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) Subarea Plan for the permanent conservation of
  biological resources. The various Preserve categories and locations of these lands are provided
  in the Chula Vista MSCP Subarea Plan.
  Open Space -- Active Recreation
  The Open Space Active Recreation designation is intended for
  areas that are largely undeveloped and adjacent to or near other
  open space areas; do not contain significant sensitive plant or
  animal species or habitat; and, due to locational characteristics,
  provide opportunities for public or private recreational activities,
  including but not limited to ball fields; tennis courts; outdoor
  campgrounds; golf driving ranges; and limited commercially-
  related active recreation uses. Lands designated in the Chula
  Vista MSCP Subarea Plan for active and passive recreation uses
  are also included in this designation; however, at the time that
  specific recreational uses are planned and developed, final hard-line active recreation areas will
  be determined based on updated biological data and application of the siting criteria found in
  the Otay Ranch Resource Management Plan (RMP); the Otay Valley Regional Park (OVRP)
  Concept Plan; and the Chula Vista MSCP Subarea Plan.
  Water
  The Water designation is applied to bodies of water within the General Plan area, including San
  Diego Bay and the Otay Lakes.

4.9.7        Special Designations
Resort
The Resort designation identifies existing and potential locations for large-scale, destination-
oriented resort facilities with a full range of resort-related services. Uses may include, but are not
limited to: hotels and motels; resort-oriented commercial services; restaurants and retail shops;
cultural arts centers; recreational uses; time-share residences; conference centers; and permanent
residences. The specific density of use for resorts within this category shall be determined at the
Sectional Planning Area Plan level, with consideration given to General Plan consistency,
environmental impacts and other relevant factors.
Eastern Urban Center
This designation is applied to an area generally bounded by State Route 125, Birch Road,
EastLake Parkway and the extension of Main Steet from State Route 125 to Eastlake Parkway,
within the East Area Plan. The Eastern Urban Center (EUC) is a high-intensity, mixed use urban
center that will serve eastern Chula Vista and the broader south county area, and will also
function as the urban core for the Otay Ranch. It will contain residential densities that range
from Medium-High to Urban Core residential, and a variety of integrated mixed use; commercial;
cultural; public; and office uses. Standards unique to the EUC, for both public and private uses,
will be developed to create its distinct urban character.
Town Center
The Town Center designation is intended to provide a pedestrian-oriented environment that
includes a mix of multi-family residential; retail shops; restaurants; professional office; or other
commercial use opportunities. Higher residential densities and commercial services are provided
within approximately ¼-mile of transit facilities. A residential density range of 18 to 45 dwelling
units per acre is permitted, although the higher densities may be approved only where necessary
to support special housing needs, such as student and faculty housing for the future university or
transit oriented development Town Centers should typically provide a more extensive grid street
system and may include specially designed arterial roadway(s) that encourage increased
pedestrian activity, while providing for efficient traffic circulation.
H Street Transit Corridor Special Study Area
This study area is generally defined as covering properties along both sides of H Street, extending
from Interstate 5 to Fourth Avenue. The purpose of the H Street Transit Corridor Special Study
Area is to evaluate potential modifications to land uses; densities; intensities; building mass; and
the potential for high-rise buildings. While the special study is to be focused on the H Street
corridor, as generally depicted on Figure 5-18, Urban Form, the precise boundaries will be
established at the time of the study. The study is further described in LUT Section 7.2

 4.10 Projected Population and Projected Land Use
 4.10.1 Projected Population
 At build-out in 2030, the overall Chula Vista Planning Area will accommodate a population of
 approximately 401,544, an increase of about 80% percent over the 2004 estimated population of
 222,300. The Planning Area also includes lands outside the City's 2004 corporate boundary. This
 reflects an overall annual growth rate of about 2.7 percent over the next 26 years. The City's
 annual growth rate over the past 30 years was about 4.6 percent, not including the annexation of
 the inhabited Montgomery community in 1985, which included approximately 26,000 residents.
 Table 5.5, Chula Vista Projected Population in 2030, below, shows the current estimated and
 projected populations for Chula Vista by Planning Area. Additional historic population growth
 information can be found in Chapter 3, Section 3.1, Chula Vista in Perspective.

Chula Vista's projected population in Table 5-5 exceeds SANDAG's current 2030 Regional
Forecast (Dec. 2003) for two main reasons. First, the overall Chula Vista Planning Area population
shown includes some areas outside of existing City boundaries. Secondly, the current SANDAG
2030 Forecast is based upon existing local plans, and does not reflect the 93,000 housing unit
shortfall in the amount of additional regional housing capacity needed to support forecasted
population growth. In response, and to avoid simply “exporting” that demand to neighboring
regions, and increasing long-distance commuting and congestion, SANDAG's Regional
Comprehensive Plan (RCP) stresses the importance of local jurisdictions adding housing capacity
in their General Plans. SANDAG regional forecasts are generally updated every few years, and
will be revised several times over the life of this General Plan.
Chula Vista's efforts through this General Plan to pursue infill development; add mixed use and
higher residential densities in selected areas; improve jobs/housing balance; and provide more
transportation options are in keeping with the principles of the RCP. The additional housing
capacity and associated population represents the City's commitment to address its share of
regional needs, and to work cooperatively with the region in securing funding for local and
regional projects that support smart growth.
4.10.2        Projected Land Use
For the purpose of analyzing potential traffic and other effects of development, 2030 is the
“horizon year” or limit of analysis for this General Plan. The acreages of the various land uses on
the General Plan Land Use Diagram are presented in Table 5-6, General Plan Land Use
Distribution in 2030. Table 5-7, General Plan Land Use in 2030, shows the 2030 projections for
number of dwelling units. For the purpose of projecting the 2030 development, this General Plan
assumes a uniform FAR across areas containing multiple parcels; however, it is recognized that
some parcels will be developed or redeveloped at higher FARs, while other parcels are already
built out and will not be developed further. There may be some shifting of overall building
intensity and residential density within Planning Districts. A monitoring program will be used to
effectively track development as it occurs within each Planning District to ensure that the
projected overall building intensity and residential density are not exceeded.

5.0            TRANSPORTATION
   5.1 Introduction
   Chula Vista's transportation system connects our different land
   uses with various types of roads and paths, providing access to
   where we live, work, shop, and spend our leisure time. The
   system plays an important role in shaping the overall structure
   and form of the City, in that it simultaneously divides and
   connects land uses. As Chula Vista and surrounding areas
   continue to grow, the transportation system must be able to
   accommodate future traffic and provide the means to move
   people and goods within and throughout Chula Vista.
   This section of the Land Use and Transportation Element discusses Chula Vista's Circulation
   Plan; Complete Streets, Measurements of Traffic; Urban Core Circulation Element; Public Transit
   Plan; Bikeway System; Pedestrian Sidewalks, Paths and Trails; Movement of Goods; and Noise (as
   it relates to traffic). Trails and bikeways are further discussed in Chapter 9, Environmental
   Element.
   A Transportation Study was completed for this General Plan and is summarized in the
   Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The EIR examines existing roadway conditions (Year 2004), as
   well as a variety of future traffic conditions (Year 2030 and Build-out Scenario). Although long-
   term CEQA-level analysis was performed in the EIR, the City performs additional growth
   management analysis on specific circulation roadways throughout the City, as described below.
   This growth management analysis is in the very short term, and is not applicable to the future
   scenarios.
   5.2 Circulation Plan
   Chula Vista's Circulation Plan (Figures 5-13W and 5-13E) consists of the physical transportation
   system, such as streets; highways; bicycle routes; paths and sidewalks; and of various modes of
   transportation, such as cars; buses; Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles; trucks (for goods movement);
   rail; bicycles; ridesharing; and walking. It is designed to serve the land use patterns and densities
   described in this General Plan, and depicts the roadway classifications that will serve
   transportation demand resulting from the complete build-out of the City of Chula Vista.
   For additional information and policies regarding transportation and transit, refer to Sections 8.0 -
   11.0 of this element.

 The Circulation Plan was analyzed using the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG)
 regional transportation demand model (TRANPLAN Series 10 population and employment
 forecasts). Technical evaluation was performed to confirm that the system will have sufficient
 capacity to provide acceptable Levels of Service (LOS).

Creating a safe, healthy, and vibrant community as well as a sustainable transportation
circulation system that provides transportation choices is integral to a healthy and connected
community. Complete Streets are balanced, multimodal roadways which enable safe,
convenient, and comfortable travel and access for users of all ages and abilities regardless of
their mode of transportation. Transportation modes can include walking, bicycling, driving
automobiles, riding public transportation, or delivering goods.. The transportation sector is the
largest contributor of greenhouse gases in the State of California and the San Diego region, and
therefore better coordination between transportation and land uses is also essential to a healthy
community.
Chula Vista is committed to plan, design, operate and maintain Complete Street design
considerations and best practices into community planning and municipal operations to create
a multi-modal transportation system that adequately provides for bicyclists, pedestrains,
transitriders, equestrians (where appropriate), and motorists. Complete streets promote healthy
communities and reductions in traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions by offering
viable alternatives to driving.
5.3 Measurements of Traffic
The measurements and standards for movement of traffic within the San Diego region are
currently vetted in the San Diego Regional Traffic Engineer’s Council, SANDAG’s technical
advisory committee. The City of Chula Vista is committed to implementing industry best
management practices for evaluating impacts of various transportation modes and the
perception of such conditions by all users. Several measures may be used to evaluate
performance, gaps or deficiencies in the network to help balance the needs of all users.
                                                                                Page LUT-59

          2020
    Level of Service (LOS) is a measure of actual traffic conditions and the perception of such
    conditions by motorists. It is used to describe the average daily number of vehicles on a street
    relative to the street's vehicular capacity and the resulting effect on traffic. There are six defined
    Levels of Service, A through F, which describe conditions ranging from “ideal” to “worst”, as
    defined in Table 5-8, Level of Service (LOS) Descriptions, below.
                                                      TABLE 5-8

                   (LOS)
                               Traffic is typically free-flowing at average travel speeds, with very
                      A        little delay. Vehicles are seldom impeded in their ability to maneuver
                               in the traffic stream. Delays at intersections are minimal.
                               Represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds.
                      B        The ability to maneuver in the traffic stream is slightly restricted but
                               the majority of vehicles do not stop and it is not bothersome.
                               Represents stable operations with acceptable delays; if an intersection
                      C        is signalized, a few drivers may have to wait through one signal cycle.
                               The ability to change lanes and maneuver may be more restricted than
                               LOS B.
                      D        Congestion occurs and a small change in volume increases delays
                               substantially during short periods, but excessive backups do not occur.
                      E        Congestion occurs with extensive delays on one or more signal cycles
                               and low travel speeds occur.
                               Arterial traffic flows at extremely low speeds, intersection congestion
                      F        occurs with excessive delays; and back ups from other locations
                               restrict or prevent movement.
   In order to determine the LOS for a designated point along a street or at an intersection on a
   daily basis, the Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volume is compared to the street's intended capacity.
   This type of LOS analysis is a general indicator of roadway segment performance, and does not
   take into account intersection operations during peak commuting hours. Table 5-9, Street
   Segment Performance Standards and Volumes, shows acceptable LOS and volume for various
   street classfications. The acceptable LOS is C for all street classifications, except for select streets in
   the Urban Core and Otay Ranch Subareas, which have an acceptable LOS of D. This is discussed
   fully in Section 5.4, Urban Circulation Element.

         STREET SEGMENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND VOLUMES
A roadway's capacity is primarily a function of the number of lanes provided to carry traffic
volumes, and whether or not the roadway is divided with a median or center turn lane. Typically,
the more lanes provided, the more capacity the roadway has to accommodate traffic demand.
The peak hour capacity of a roadway is influenced by a number of variables, including: the type
of intersection controls; signal timing; the presence and frequency of driveways; on-street parking;
the percentage of the daily traffic in the peak hour; the direction of traffic in the peak hour; and
other factors.
5.3.1        Analyzing and Measuring Traffic Impacts
The City of Chula Vista conducts traffic analyses and planning through a three-tiered system that
allows the City to cover a broad range of time frames and conditions spanning from 20-year
future forecasts, to near-term project evaluations, to actually driving the roadways to determine
real-time current performance. These three analyses have different degrees of precision in
determining impacts based on several considerations which include: the type of project being
considered; the study years chosen; whether the analysis will consider short-term impacts, long-
term impacts or both; and whether the analysis is being conducted to satisfy a CEQA
requirement or is strictly a City traffic review. Further, the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE) guidelines to encourage the design of multi modal traffic.
                                                                                    Page LUT-63

         2020
   Long Term Forecasts
   Long-term forecasts are utilized for determining theoretical traffic impacts in the distant future,
   and are typically applied in analyzing timeframes 15 years or more into the future, and/or at
   build-out of an area when all land use capacity is assumed to be developed. These are the
   types of forecasts used in conjunction with General Plan evaluations that are typically based on
   build-out conditions for the area under study. Long term forecast for the San DIego region utilize
   SANDAG forecasts such as RTP.
   Table 5-9, Street Segment Performance Standards and Volumes, identifies those roadway
   classifications that comprise the City Circulation Plan. The Circulation Plan developed for the
   General Plan was based on forecasted ADT volumes resulting from build-out of the proposed
   General Plan land uses, as described above.
   Mid- to Short-term Analyses
   Mid- to short-term horizon analyses typically review projected conditions looking out more than
   five years. Both mid- and short-term traffic analyses are usually conducted in conjunction with
   individual project-level evaluations through a Traffic Impact Report in order to determine project
   specific or project cumulative impacts. The mid-term analysis is typically done in five-year
   increments.
   Traffic Monitoring Program (TMP)
   Under this third tier of traffic analysis, Traffic Monitoring Program (TMP), the City of Chula Vista
   monitors the actual performance of the street system by conducting roadway segment travel time
   studies annually in accordance with the City's Growth Management program and Traffic
   Threshold Standards. The standards generally require that arterial roadway segments throughout
   the City maintain operating conditions of LOS C or better, with the exception that LOS D may
   occur for not more than two hours per day, typically in the peak travel periods. This periodic
   review of roadway operations and volume levels also provides the opportunity to consider
   geometric modifications that may provide additional capacity necessary to maintain an
   acceptable LOS.

5.4 Urban Circulation Element
Traditional LOS methodologies and traffic study guidelines often favor improved automobile flow,
which may have a negative impact on pedestrian and transit mobility, and have the unintended
effect of limiting development opportunities in more developed areas. The Urban Circulation
Element, however, recognizes that the automobile is just one of several modes of travel that can
move people in urbanized environments, and that more intensive developments in built-up areas
should not be constrained by policies that focus exclusively on moving vehicular traffic.
The overall goal of the Urban Circulation Element is to support the development of great places
and neighborhoods by providing transportation choices and supporting those choices with
attractive, safe, convenient, and functional infrastructure for all modes of travel. The Urban
Circulation Element provides opportunities to make policies and standards sufficiently flexible to
support Transit Oriented Development (TOD) in select transit corridors and town centers while
maintaining the commitment of new development to mitigate impacts of new travel demand, and
to improve the transit, pedestrian and bicycle environment.
The Urban Circulation Element recognizes that in certain corridors and centers served by transit,
it is acceptable to reduce the vehicle level of service standards that are applied to suburban
areas of the City under certain circumstances. These circumstances would include ensuring that
the area's transportation system is able to move people effectively by a combination of modes
and providing a sound analytical approach for evaluating traffic LOS. The Urban Circulation
Element promotes the use of revised level of service standards, alternative ways of measuring
level of service for vehicles, and possibly establishing level of service criteria and performance
measures for other modes of travel. The following steps were taken to develop the Urban
Circulation Element, which applies to the Uban Core Subarea in western Chula Vista and
portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea in the East Planning Area.
                                                                                    Page LUT-65

          2020
        1. Identification of context-specific street classifications
   The following Urban Street classifications are proposed within the Urban Core, its immediate
   environs, and portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea:
   ·        Gateway Street
            Urban Arterial
            Commercial Boulevard
            Downtown Promenade
            Town Center Arterial
   See Section 5.5.6 for a more detailed discussion of the above-described Urban Street classifications.
        2. Development of capacity standards for the Urban Core Circulation
            Element.
   The capacities for the Urban Circulation Element were developed based on Highway Capacity
   Manual (HCM) procedures. The values presented in Table 5-9, Street Segment Performance
   Standards and Volumes, were obtained from the Generalized Planning Analysis method, which
   provides a method for estimating 24-hour street segment capacity using HCM 2000 procedures.
   Whereas, ADT-based thresholds in the City of Chula Vista and many other communities, have
   evolved over time as a general practice, the Generalized Planning Analysis method provides a
   scientific method to relate peak hour HCM-calculated results to acceptable ADT volumes on
   certain classes of roads. The acceptable 24-hour volume is adjusted to account for design
   elements that move traffic efficiently. These include traffic signal spacing and timing. The results
   provided by the method were tailored to the Urban Streets classification to account for peak
   hour spreading. Because the Urban Core and portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea will become
   destinations rather than waypoints, the 24-hour volume will be less concentrated in peak
   commuting hours. The maximum capacities shown in this table assume implementation of
   traffic and multi-modal improvements.
        3. Identification of appropriate performance standards for the Urban Core
            Circulation Element.
   The Urban Circulation Element will accommodate all modes of travel (vehicular; transit; bicycling;
   and walking) and a variety of different trip types (shopping; entertainment; dining; as well as
   commuting). As discussed above, the existing capacities and performance standards used for
   streets throughout the City of Chula Vista emphasize vehicular commuting trips, and have the
   unintended effect of limiting the potential for a more urbanized downtown environment.
   Accordingly, within the Urban Core its immediate environs, and portions of the Otay Ranch
   Subarea, the minimum performance standard for the Urban Circulation Element is LOS D.
   Previously referenced Table 5-9 presents the proposed LOS criteria for the related Urban Street
   classifications.
Page LUT-66      City of Chula Vista General Plan

                               LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
                                                                                       CHAPTER 5
The approach of using a performance standard of LOS D for more urbanized areas is not unique
to Chula Vista. Both the City of San Diego and San Diego County use LOS D as their
performance standard in urbanized and built-out communities. The City of San Diego uses LOS
C as the minimum performance standard in newly developing areas. The City of Chula Vista will
have the same two-tiered performance standards that are tailored to the context of surrounding
development. Further, the Urban Circulation Element follows the precedent of California Senate
Bill 1636 (which allows for relaxing of LOS standards in “infill opportunity areas”) and the City of
San Diego, which has established a performance standard of LOS E for streets in their Centre City
District. Continuing to use existing procedures and suburban-based performance standards
would effectively discourage development in the Urban Core Subarea and portions of the Otay
Ranch Subarea, hindering implementation of two of the primary themes of this General Plan.
As discussed above, because of existing and projected future land use patterns in the City, there
is a strong distinction between the operating characteristics of the street systems within and
outside of the Urban Core Subarea and portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea. The LOS and
volume standards in the City's Circulation Plan will be applied throughout Chula Vista, with
special considerations in the Urban Core Subarea, where LOS D will be acceptable. LOS D is
appropriate in the Urban Core Subarea and portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea because
development will have a more urbanized character, and physical constraints exist, such as limited
area to expand rights-of-way. Also, the change in performance standards will help balance and
serve all transportation modes (i.e., Transit, pedestrian, bicycling, etc.) and will avoid the disruptive
effects of widening streets in a built environment or oversizing roadways during the planning
process. In accordance with that urban character, projects within the Urban Core Subarea and
portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea will need to comply with urban development standards, as
presented in Section 7.2 of this element.
5.5 Roadway Classifications
Roadway classifications for the City of Chula Vista are described below. The roadway volume and
acceptable LOS for each roadway classification is summarized in Table 5-9, Street Segment
Performance Standards and Volumes, Detailed information regarding roadway design and
roadway sections are found in the City of Chula Vista Subdivision Manual, which contains
general guidelines for roadway design, including street cross-sections and other related
improvements. Urban Core streets are described below and are addressed in more detail in
Section 9.3.5, Urban Core Street Network.
5.5.1         Freeways
Freeways are an important part of the overall circulation system, serving as a means of bypassing
regional through traffic, as well as supplementing the local thoroughfare system. Capable of
carrying large volumes of unimpeded traffic at high speeds, freeways serve as the primary
corridors between communities and other major traffic generators, such as large commercial;
industrial; recreational; and residential centers.
                                                                                     Page LUT-67

           2020
   The freeway system serving Chula Vista consists of the following:
         !   Interstate 5, running north-south through the General Plan area, will continue to link
             Chula Vista with central San Diego to the north and Otay Mesa and Mexico to the
             south.
         !   Interstate 805 provides access to the center of the Chula Vista residential and
             commercial areas. This north-south freeway connects the inland portions of Chula
             Vista with communities to the north and south.
         !   State Route 54 (South Bay Freeway) provides access to and from the northeast
             communities of La Mesa and El Cajon. This east-west freeway also serves as the
             most efficient route between the coastal area and areas to the east and northeast.
         !   State Route 125 Tollway, a north-south route, will provide access from the eastern part
             of the City north to La Mesa and eastern San Diego, and south to Otay Mesa and
             Mexico.
   5.5.2          Expressways
   Expressways are essentially enhanced prime arterials whose principal function is to
   accommodate immediate access to the freeway system for regional travel patterns. The design of
   expressways, therefore, emphasizes design features to increase capacity and speed, while limiting
   “friction” associated with driveway access and parking maneuvers. The predominant design
   feature of this roadway is the number of lanes it has, eight lanes total with four in each direction.
   A raised median is required to separate the two directions of travel and to provide for
   landscaping or other visual enhancements.
   5.5.3          Six-Lane Prime Arterials
   This facility is designed to carry high volumes of traffic and serves to distribute traffic to and from
   the freeway system. The prime arterial facility proposed in the City’s Circulation Plan is designed
   to move traffic between major generators.
   5.5.4          Six- and Four-Lane Major Streets
   The major street facility proposed in the City’s Circulation Plan accommodates either six or four
   lanes of traffic. These facilities are designed to carry high volumes of traffic and serve to
   distribute traffic to and from the freeway system and arterials. Major streets are designed to
   distribute more localized (rather than regional) trips. Varying or hybrid configurations (such as 5
   or 3 lanes) may be permissible on a case by case basis subject to discretion of the city engineer,
   provided that functional capacity needs are met.

5.5.5        Class 1 Collector Streets
Collector streets allow access to residential areas by relieving traffic pressure on arterials and
major streets by providing alternate routes for short trips. Class I collector streets primarily
circulate localized traffic, and distribute traffic to and from prime arterials and major streets. Class
I collectors are designed to accommodate four lanes of traffic; however, they carry lower traffic
volumes at slower speeds than major arterials.
5.5.6        Urban Streets
The following five roadway classifications found in Chula Vista's Urban Core Subarea and
portions of the Otay Ranch Subarea, have a different acceptable LOS standard than the City's
other roadway classifications. Their acceptable LOS D is in accordance with the concepts
described above in Section 5.4 of this element.
Gateway Street
These roadways include segments of Broadway, Fourth Avenue, E Street, H Street, I Street, and L
Street, which connect the Urban Core to State Route 54, Interstate 805 and Interstate 5; and the
segment of Main Street between SR-125 and Eastlake Parkway, which connects the Eastern Uban
Center and Eastern University District to State Route 125. These facilities are analogous to six- or
four-lane major roads in other parts of the City, but will provide special design features and
amenities to encourage access for the full spectrum of travel modes. These streets will be the
major entry points to and from these areas, and special landscape and entry treatments will be
incorporated into the design.
Urban Arterial
These roads include portions of E Street; H Street, and Fourth Avenue. Urban arterial cross-
sections are similar to four-lane major roads in other areas of Chula Vista, but with special
features to support multi-modal trip-making, such as wider sidewalks, transit station curb “bulb
outs”, and pedestrian amenities.
Commercial Boulevard
These streets include segments of Broadway and Third Avenue (north of E Street and South of H
Street) and will serve existing and future shopping districts. Design will be generally consistent
with four-lane majors in other areas, but with special design features reflecting the multi-modal
nature of streets in more urban areas.

   Downtown Promenade
   These roads (including portions of F Street and Third Avenue) will provide access to retail
   establishments in the heart of the Urban Core. Cross-sections will be similar to a two-lane or four-
   lane collector, but with multi-modal features and amenities that accommodate the surrounding
   urban context.
   Furthermore, and in order to help promote pedestrian friendliness, these streets will provide, in
   varying amounts, the following generalized amenities:
        !   Way finding maps; grated planters; trash receptacles; and benches strategically located
            throughout the Urban Core Subarea. Streetscapes should be designed with inviting wider
            sidewalks that should be passable without having to maneuver around hedges or other
            obstacles.
        !   On-street parking, limited driveway cuts, and landscaping or planting strips, that create
            a buffer between traffic and pedestrians and provide canopy shade. A well-designed
            streetscape makes people feel comfortable and invites and motivates residents to walk or
            bike to destinations, such as shopping or work. Urban Core Subarea street design should
            include mid-block crosswalks and neighborhood pass-throughs to future open space
            areas and common areas. This helps to create a human scale.
   ·
        !   Behind the sidewalk, easily accessible building entrances with minimum building
            setbacks, windows at street level, and no blank walls on adjacent buildings.
        ! Distinctive public transit amenities to increase ease of use and attractiveness of
     neighborhoods. Transit amenities should include next-bus information
     kiosks, bicycle facilities, and interconnections to other routes and
     bikeways; bike racks; lockers; and shower facilities. The objective of
     this design is to provide convenient public access by reinforcing bikes
     as a mode of transportation connected to and coordinated with other
     modes and bus lines, connecting people and places through a
     complete street network that invites walking and bicycling.
   Town Center Arterial
   The Town Center Arterial is intended for use primarily in the East Planning Area's Otay Ranch
   Subarea. Its main purpose is to bring traffic into and through the heart of a Town Center. The
   unique separated travelway design through the Town Center encourages multi-modal circulation
   and enhances pedestrian activity that fosters a vibrant commercial mixed-use Town Center. Many
   conflicting movements are reduced through the use of paired one-way streets that may include
   on-street parking, wider sidewalks, and neckdowns at intersections. The Town Center Arterial
   provides a more efficient traffic flow by eliminating wide roadway arterials, with their inherent
   long signal cycle lengths and segregated left turn lanes at major intersections, and it creates a
   more energized, mixed use pedestrian-oriented community within an enlarged urban transit

network. The “split” or “paired” couplet design allows for double frontage exposures of
commercial uses, and slower traffic speeds that promote pedestrian activity and help define the
Town Center as an identifiable place.
5.6 Public Transit Plan
The proposed public transit system is a comprehensive network combining existing and planned
public transit facilities to provide affordable, efficient public transportation for the residents of
Chula Vista. It integrates the needs of both regional travel and local travel. The key routes of the
proposed public transportation system are discussed in the following sections. The public transit
network is based on SANDAG's Regional Transit Vision (RTV) and has been augmented with
additional routes by the City.
5.6.1        Regional Transit Plan
The Regional Transit Vision (Figure 5-14) calls for a network of fast, reliable, and convenient
services that include rubber-tired vehicles (referred to as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)) that connect
residential areas with employment and other major activity centers. The figure also delineates
routes as well as transit stations stops, and park and ride facilities. Using market research and
analyzing people's travel patterns, four service concepts have been identified to address varying
needs (see Table 5-10). Together, these different service concepts make up a comprehensive
system that complements and supports existing and planned land uses.
Yellow Car and Red Car services form the backbone of the regional transit system, providing
rapid and relatively frequent service. The Coaster commuter rail system is an example of Yellow
Car service, while the San Diego Trolley is an example of Red Car service in Chula Vista. Yellow
Car (BRT) service is planned for the Interstate 805 corridor, and Red Car (BRT) service is planned
for east/west corridors (H Street, Palomar Street, and Main Street) and the State Route 125
corridor.
Blue Car service is essentially the local bus network, while Green Car service includes local
shuttles that connect local activity centers and the backbone transit network. Green Car service
would connect the Bayfront Planning Area and the Northwest Planning Area's Urban Core
Subarea in Chula Vista.
5.6.2        Public Rapid Transit Expansion - South Bay Transit First!
SANDAG's adopted Regional Transit Vision and Transit First! Strategy, which is discussed in
Section 1.5.1 of this element, incorporates Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles into Chula Vista's
circulation system, replacing the previously planned light-rail transit system envisioned for
eastern Chula Vista. The BRT system uses high quality, rubber-tired vehicles, offering the speed,
comfort and amenities of a trolley with the flexibility of non-fixed modes of transportation. BRT
vehicles travel in their own lanes and/or receive priority at signalized intersections in mixed flow
conditions. Upgraded transit stations will have shelters, passenger information and other features
that may also include adequate parking for commuters.

   SANDAG approved the Otay Ranch Transitway Alignment for planning purposes in March 1993
   and is currently examining new alignments and variations in southeast Chula Vista, including
   the area east of State Route 125. Ultimately, the Otay Ranch segment would travel south along
   State Route 125 to meet the Otay Mesa Segment at the Otay Mesa Transit Center and Otay Mesa
   Road. In the Northwest and East Planning Areas, stops in Chula Vista may include those in the
   vicinity of Plaza Bonita; H Street/Terra Nova; Otay Ranch Villages 1, 5, 6, and 9; Freeway
   Commercial; the Otay Ranch Eastern Urban Center; the proposed university; and all of the Light
   Rail Transit (LRT) stations at E, H and Palomar Streets.
   Routes that will link eastern Chula Vista with the western areas of the City and the existing trolley
   stations include:
            !    Route 628/694: Downtown San Diego to Otay Ranch (Phase 1) and ultimately to East
                 Otay Mesa and the Mexican border (Phase 2)
            !    Route 627: H Street Trolley Station to Otay Ranch via Southwestern College
            !    Route RC-1/635: Palomar Street Trolley Station to Eastlake Business Center via Main
                 Street and Otay Ranch.
                 In addition to the existing San Diego Trolley (Route 510), other first tier routes
                 identified in the South Bay Transit First Study that will traverse Chula Vista providing
                 north/south links include:
            !    Route 540/640: San Ysidro international border crossing to Old Town Transit Center,
                 providing express service using Interstate 5 to supplement the corridor service
                 provided by the existing trolley.
            !    Route 680: San Ysidro international border crossing to Sorrento Valley, primarily along
                 Interstate 805.

                                                                                  CHAPTER 5
5.6.3         Local Feeder Bus Routes
The proposed public transit system also includes a network of
local bus routes oriented to each of the community activity
centers, as well as the Urban Core Subarea and eastern activity
centers. Community activity centers serviced by the local bus
network include Bayfront; Terra Nova; Bonita; Southwestern
College; Eastlake; Otay Ranch villages; the proposed university;
Sharp Hospital; and the Montgomery area. The local bus
network will loop into the neighborhood area collecting riders for
the east-west express bus route and the north-south regional
transit system.
5.6.4         Connection Services
The Urban Core Subarea have will have the greatest diversity of public; commercial; civic;
financial; cultural; and residential uses, emphasizing its role as the hub of Chula Vista. Extension
of streets from the Urban Core Subarea into the Bayfront Planning Area provides strong east-west
linkages for all forms of vehicular and transit movement, including pedestrians and bicyclists. An
appropriately designed local feeder bus route (Green Car Service), e.g., a transit loop operating on
E or F and H Streets, Third Avenue and Marina Parkway, is intended to connect the Bayfront's
activities and amenities to the Urban Core Subarea's Downtown Third Avenue and Civic Center;
H Street; and the mixed use transit-oriented developments surrounding the E and H Street trolley
stations, (See Figure 5-15 Bayfront Green Car Line).
Additional local feeder bus loops should connect areas as planned land uses are implemented
and future needs arise. Examples may include connections between the Eastern Urban Center
and other areas in the East Planning Area with the Northwest and Southwest Planning Areas;
connections between the Southwest and Northwest Planning Areas; or connections between
specific activity centers and nearby major transit stations. See Section 7.7 of this element for
policies on transit shuttles between activity centers.
5.7 Bikeway System
The City of Chula Vista Bikeway Master Plan identifies existing facilities and bicycle deficiencies
throughout the City, evaluates the existing bikeway system's relationship with other mobility
systems, and provides cost estimates to make improvements.
Bicycle paths, lanes, and routes are provided on a number of Chula Vista's roadways. The bike
                                                                                 Page LUT-75

   system provides bicyclists with connections between
   neighborhoods, parks, schools, and other neighborhood and                       There are three
   recreational facilities. There are a few Class I facilities (bike lane          regional bikeway
   separated from traffic) within the City, but virtually all arterial             projects being
   roadways east of Interstate 805 have Class II facilities (on-street             planned for the
   bike lanes marked at the curb or in the parking lane). There is a               City of Chula
   significant amount of Class III bikeway facilities (signage, no paint
   in right-of-way), primarily within western Chula Vista. See Figure              Vista.
   5-16 for the City's existing and programmed bikeway facilities.
   In addition to the City's bikeway system, the regional San Diego Bayshore Bikeway is a 26-mile
   bikeway around San Diego Bay, which includes a Class I segment along the Bay's east side,
   through Chula Vista's Bayfront Planning Area, with a bridge across the Sweetwater River. There
   are three regional bikeway projects being planned or scheduled for completion within or very
   near to the City of Chula Vista:
        !   Sweetwater River/Otay River Loop, which includes joint planning by City of Chula Vista,
            City of National City, and the County of San Diego;
        !   State Route 905 Corridor, which provides access from the City to two U.S.-Mexican
            border crossings; and
        !   State Route 94/State Route 54 Corridor, where the State Route 54 portion will connect to
            the Sweetwater River Bikeway.
   5.8 Pedestrian Sidewalks, Paths and Trails
                                          Pedestrian sidewalks, paths, and trails are important for several
                                          reasons, including: mobility and access; connectivity between
                                          land uses; safety; health; and community interaction. Not all
                                          people get to their destination by automobile, including those
                                          too young to drive, the elderly, or those who prefer to walk.
                                          Even for people who do drive or take transit, all trips begin and
                                          end by walking. Sidewalks and other pedestrian pathways are
                                          important for providing connections to schools; parks; shopping;
                                          jobs; and between neighborhoods. Children, in particular,
                                          should be able to walk safely to school. Increased numbers of
   people walking along streets creates a safer environment, and, thereby, encourages others to
   walk also . Vibrant urban areas always have high levels of pedestrians.

neighborhoods that were annexed into the City from
unincorporated San Diego County areas are not completely served and need upgrades or
improvements. Also, areas intended for increased intensity may have sidewalks that are too
narrow to accommodate the envisioned activity levels or may lack convenient connections to
adjacent land uses, neighborhoods, or transit service. The safety and comfort of pedestrians
need to be considered.
5.9 Movement of Goods
The efficient movement of goods is vital to the economic stability and growth of both Chula Vista
and the San Diego region. A brief discussion of the rail, air, marine, and trucking facilities for
movement of goods is found below, and Figure 5-17, Movement of Goods Facilities, shows major
facilities used for goods transportation.
Rail
Two primary rail haulers of freight, the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe (BNSF) and the San Diego and Imperial Valley
(SDIV) railroads, link the San Diego County coastal region
(including Chula Vista) to the larger national railway
system. BNSF maintains a freight easement over the 62
miles of San Diego County coastal mainline that
terminates at the National City Marine Terminal north of
Chula Vista. BNSF also interchanges freight with the SDIV.
The SDIV operates freight service on the SANDAG-owned
railway in the southwestern part of the County, including
Chula Vista, where it is known as the San Diego and Arizona Eastern (SD&AE) Railway. Freight
                                                                               Page LUT-79

          2020
   hauling occurs during night-time hours when the trolley is not in service. The SDIV operates
   “short haul” railroad service south through Tijuana to the eastern areas of Tecate, Mexico and
   California's Imperial Valley.
   Air
   Chula Vista's commercial air transportation needs are served by
   Lindbergh Field, San Diego's international airport (passenger and
   freight traffic), and by Brown Field Municipal Airport, a general
   aviation facility with one runway located south of Chula Vista
   on Otay Mesa within the City of San Diego. Abelardo L.
   Rodriguez Airport, in Tijuana, is approximately one quarter mile
   south of the U.S.-Mexico border, with a single runway that
   provides passenger and cargo service to major cities in Mexico.
   Marine
                                             Maritime shipping needs for Chula Vista are provided by two
                                             major marine terminals, the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal in
                                             San Diego and the National City Marine Terminal in National
                                             City. The City of Chula Vista's marina at the south end of San
                                             Diego Bay, located at the west end of J Street in the Bayfront, is
                                             used for recreational boating and also has some boating-
                                             related light industrial uses.
   Trucks
   Although a portion of goods movement from and through Chula
   Vista is via the rail, air, and marine services discussed above, the
   vast majority of goods movement throughout Chula Vista is by
   trucks. SANDAG studies from 1981 onward show a steady
   increase of heavy-duty trucks (defined as having over a one ton
   carrying capacity) over the years. In Chula Vista, most truck
   traffic is through traffic on the regional freeways, but there is also
   internal truck traffic generated by economic activity typical of a
   mid-sized city, such as Chula Vista.

Noise is closely related to land use and transportation. See Section 3.5, Noise, of Chapter 9,
Environmental Element, for information on noise levels, with objectives and policies that address
protecting people from excessive noise and minimizing noise from transportation.

6.0        GOALS
 The overall goals of the Land Use and Transportation Element are:
 6.1    Safe; healthy; sustainable; walkable; and vibrant community with a
        balance of jobs, housing and access to healthy food options and a
        variety of options for recreational activity
 6.2    A mix of land uses that meets community needs and generates
        sufficient revenue for public facilities, services, and amenities.
 6.3    A circulation/mobility system that provides safe travel by any mode,
        meets the needs of travelers of all ages and abilities and
        is well-integrated with the City's land uses.

          2020
               PLANNING FACTORS, OBJECTIVES,
7.0            AND POLICIES
   There are several planning factors involved in achieving the three goals of the Land use and
   Transportation Element. Such factors are discussed in Sections 7.1 - 11.4.3 of this element. Each
   factor has at least one objective, or focused goal, and each objective has at least one policy,
   which describes how the City will meet the objectives.
   7.1 A Balance of Land Uses
   A balance of land uses–residential; employment; commercial; recreational; civic/cultural; and
   open space, provided at the appropriate intensity and density, location, and mix–is important for
   a sustainable Chula Vista future. Benefits include: a healthier community, reduced commute
   times; improved air quality; higher sales tax revenues; safer mobility; and an improved quality of
   life for City residents. For example, Smart Growth techniques, such as a balance of land uses,
   provide for more attractive, affordable, and healthier places to live. Currently, Chula Vista has
   fewer jobs than housing units. Adding more jobs, shopping, and restaurants to our City can help
   to reduce trips outside the City and increase local revenues. A full range of commercial services,
   from regional shopping centers to specialty stores, is convenient for residents, can attract non-
   residents to shop here, and keeps sales tax revenues in the City, where it will most benefit
   residents. Residential areas with nearby stores, services, and restaurants allow residents to walk
   or bike for their daily shopping needs, which is a healthier alternative to driving.
   Residential; commercial; industrial; educational; recreational; and civic facilities should provide a
   balance and combination of uses that both complement the existing community and
   accommodate the future needs and desires of the community. Ideally, this balance would meet
   the needs of Chula Vista's residents of all ages and abilities and contribute towards meeting
   regional needs.
                                         Objective - LUT 1
   Provide a balance of residential and non-residential development
   throughout the City that achieves a vibrant development pattern,
   enhances the character of the City, and meets the present and future
   needs of all residents and businesses.

7.2 Urban Design and Form
As introduced in Section 3.5 of this element, establishing and reinforcing Chula Vista’s
urban design and form is necessary to ensure that the desired character and image of the
City is protected and enhanced as the City grows and develops over time. The evolving
urban design and form of Chula Vista are considered to be key to the City's community
character and image, and should be addressed carefully. As noted, in particular, under
Theme 8, “Shaping the Future through the Present and Past”, such change and evolution
must be accomplished in a manner that complements Chula Vista's heritage and unique
sense of place, and improves the quality of life for all people who live, work and play in
Chula Vista. This includes consideration of a number of inter-related factors, such as
preserving and enhancing stable residential neighborhoods, a built environment that
provides a variety of healthy, accessible and affordable options, focusing on edges between
new development and redevelopment to ensure compatible land use and edge transitions,
and historic preservation, among others. This approach to ensuring harmony between
needed and desired changes and harmony between the City's past and present, is carried
out through a number of objectives and policies, both in this Section and in Sections 7.3
through 7.6, as well as in the Area Plans in LUT Sections 8.0 - 11.0
Given Chula Vista's past, and the community's concerns about image and character, another key
component of this General Plan is clearly identifying those areas where the highest intensities
and densities should be focused. In the General Plan, these areas consist of the Mixed Use
Transit Focus Area (TFA) designated lands in Northwest Chula Vista at the E and H Street trolley
station areas, and the area around Third Avenue and H Street. Within the Bayfront, higher
intensities and densities are planned near the marina. In Eastern Chula Vista, they are f
ocused within the Eastern Urban Center of Otay Ranch. These areas are targeted for the highest
intensity and density of land uses, the largest potential building forms, and in western Chula
Vista, some are located proximate to existing residential areas. Therefore, it is important that
provisions for transitions and edges among building masses, and land uses relationships both
within the TFAs, and between the TFA-designated areas and adjoining existing neighborhoods,
be clear and well-defined. These provisions must address such topics (among others) as building
setbacks, screening and landscaping, solar access and shadowing, and pedestrian and vehicular
circulation. The following Objectives and Policies, as well as those in Section 7.5, address these
topics.
Historically, taller buildings (over four or five stories) have occurred rarely, and certainly not
through a strategic effort to define the City's skyline, to identify where prominent building mass
would be beneficial, or to signify important activity centers. As shown on Figure 5-18, Urban
Form, this General Plan identifies four, limited locations where urban development intensities
would be most appropriate. These include the two Transit Focus Areas (TFA) in Urban Core of
western Chula Vista; around the existing E Street and H Street trolley stations, within the Bayfront
Planning area, and in the Eastern Urban Center in Otay Ranch which has been planned for
urban development since the Otay Ranch General Development Plan was approved in 1993.
                                                                                    Page LUT-87

Also depicted on Figure 5-18 is the H Street Transit Corridor Special Study Area. The purpose of
this special study is to analyze and evaluate the appropriateness of plan changes that could
result in mixed land uses, increased intensities, and potential high-rise buildings along H Street
between Interstate 5 and Fourth Avenue. An important consideration of the study is that the area
is a major activity corridor, and functions as the primary entry into the urban core. It is a major
link between Broadway and the downtown area, is targeted as a major transit connection
between the eastern portion of the City and the west, and currently consists primarily of
community or sub-regional-serving non-residential land uses. These uses include the South
County Regional Center and Superior Court; medical offices; several bank facilities; a major
hospital and medical facility at Scripps; major commercial uses at the Chula Vista Center;
numerous restaurants; retail businesses; and professional offices. In view of these existing land
uses along H Street, the future intensification planned with the two TFAs at either end of the
corridor, and the potential for future market forces to focus on H Street as a key corridor, a special
study is needed that examines further potential changes in land use and intensity; building
mass; the potential for taller buildings; and the relationship and appropriate transitions to
adjacent stable neighborhoods (see Policy LUT 2.6).
The identification of the above-mentioned TFAs and corridor within the City's Urban Core, the
Bayfront, as well as within the Eastern Urban Center (EUC), are intended to establish places
where people are attracted to active; pedestrian-oriented experiences, including: shopping;
restaurants; entertainment; and employment, and which are located along major thoroughfares
and transit routes where they can be most readily accessed. While allowance for higher
intensities and taller buildings, (or “high-rise” structures), in these locations provides more
housing, employment and other opportunities on a smaller amount of land, the principal reason
for high-rise structures is to provide landmarks and skyline recognition for key areas of the City,
and punctuate them as vibrant, active and successful community centers.
The following objectives and policies are provided to ensure that the evolution of more urban
land use areas within Chula Vista is strategically focused and harmoniously integrated to
adjoining, stable neighborhood areas, and that the allowance of high-rise structures of eight or
more stories is appropriately managed. In addition, please see Planning Area Plans in Sections
8.0 - 11.0 of this element for further site area specific discussions and policies, as well as the Otay
Ranch General Development Plan (GDP), which addresses development within the EUC.

                           fountains; parks or paseos; extensive streetscape improvements; public
                           venues or amenities, and energy efficiency andsustainable design.
                       !   The overall building height and massing must reflect appropriate
                           transitions to surrounding areas, in accordance with the future vision for
                           those areas, or if the building is on the periphery of an area of change,

   7.3 Preserving and Enhancing Stable Residential
            Neighborhoods
   Planning for existing neighborhood preservation, identity and protection is one of the most
   important purposes of the City's General Plan. Existing residential neighborhoods in the City
   consist of either mostly single-family dwellings, mostly multi-family dwellings, or areas in
   transition. Residential neighborhoods that are not considered in transition are considered stable,
   and should be protected. (Please refer to LUT Section 4.7 for discussion of this terminology.)
   To maintain the quality of existing, stable residential neighborhoods requires that the City
   conserve existing housing, ensure good street design, minimize and control traffic in residential
   neighborhoods, and ensure that development adheres to quality design standards. Please refer to
   Section 7.3 for additional policies on the protection of stable neighborhoods.
                                       Objective - LUT 4
   Establish policies, standards, and procedures to minimize blighting
   influences and maintain the integrity of stable residential
   neighborhoods.
   Policies
   LUT 4.1           Preserve and reinforce the community character of existing, older, well-
                     maintained, stable residential neighborhoods located outside of the Districts or
                     Focus Areas identified for change in this document.
   LUT 4.2           Protect existing, stable, single-family neighborhoods through zoning or other
                     regulations that discourage the introduction of higher density residential or other
                     incompatible or potentially disruptive land uses and/or activities.
   LUT 4.3           Require that new development, or redevelopment, through consideration of site
                     and building design, and appropriate transition and edge treatments does not
                     negatively affect the nature and character of nearby established neighborhoods
                     or development.

                adjacent parcels.
LUT 4.5        Establish zoning or other regulations to ensure that non-residential uses or
               activities in stable residential neighborhoods occur only when the character and
               the quality of the neighborhood can be maintained.
LUT 4.6        Minimize through circulation design and/or traffic-calming features (to the
               maximum extent practicable), the use of neighborhood streets in stable
               residential neighborhoods for regional or cut-through traffic, to protect those
               neighborhoods from adverse traffic effects. This would include access to and from

               shared-use paths.
7.4 Implementing Mixed Use Areas
This General Plan proposes mixed use developments to create a more vibrant and healthy
environment. These mixed use areas are intended to provide housing and jobs near existing
and proposed transit locations, as well as at activity centers located throughout the City. The
mixed use areas allow the City an opportunity to provide appropriate areas with a healthier,
more urban living and working environment than currently exists in the City.
                                                                                   Page LUT-93

   7.5 Compatible Land Use and Edge Transitions
   Incompatible land uses immediately adjacent to one another, such as residential and industrial
   uses, may significantly affect the health of a community. Uses should be appropriately buffered,
   or incompatibilities should be addressed through redesignation of uses or mitigation of impacts
   to adjacent uses in the area. Mixed use areas will inherently have higher levels of activity and
   intensity than solely residential neighborhoods. Both the pattern of mixed use areas and
   individual project designs must be sensitive to edge transitions between neighborhoods and
   strive to minimize potential impacts on adjacent residential neighborhoods.
                                       Objective - LUT 6

                     sensitive to the character of existing neighborhhods through consideration of
                     access, compatible building design and massing, and building height transitions,
                     while maintainin the goals and values set forth in the General Plan. Within TFAs,
                     design provisions should include requirements for a minimum building stepback
                     of 15 feet for every 35 feet in height, for edges abutting residential uses.
   LUT 6.4           Discourage additional multi-family development in existing single-family
                     designated neighborhoods.
   LUT 6.5           Require, through sensitive and attractive design, that neighborhood retail centers

7.6 Enhancing Community Image
Community image is the impression held in the minds of Chula Vista residents and visitors to the
City. It is created by both natural and man-made features, such as views; open space; city
entryways; primary or secondary gateways; streetscapes; buildings; parks; and plazas.
Preservation and enhancement of scenic resources, and the positive visual aspects of Chula
Vista's urban, suburban, and rural character are important factors as the City continues to grow.
Continued environmental protection of our open space network is important to City residents
and will continue. Directing new and infill growth to areas along major arterial corridors and
transit routes is beneficial to open space areas and will benefit our City as a whole. In addition,
preservation, enhancement, and accessibility to those things that make Chula Vista a unique
place, such as Chula Vista’s scenic resources, can have a direct, and positive effect on the overall
health and sustainability of the community.
Urban design refers to the various physical design elements that make up the City's built
environment, including buildings; public spaces; gateways; streetscape; and landscaping. The
quality, physical form, and arrangement of these elements contribute to the City's image,
neighborhood identity, and overall quality of life.
Gateway areas into the City or its districts that are well-designed, attractive, and exhibit a special
character help to enhance the City's image and instill community pride. Quality architecture and
landscape design are also important elements of city building and place-making. Preservation of
important cultural buildings and landmarks contribute to the community's unique sense of
place. Programs for public art, signs, and landscaping help to create an attractive and special
environment for both Chula Vista's residents and visitors.
Community Image and Identity
                                  Objective - LUT 8
Strengthen and sustain Chula Vista's image as a unique place by

7.7 Linking Chula Vista Internally and to the Region
Chula Vista is an integral part of the larger San Diego region and is emerging as the dynamic
hub of the south San Diego County area. To maintain and continue to develop in this role, it is
crucial that Chula Vista's transportation system is well connected to the region's overall
transportation network. It is equally important that Chula Vista's internal connections function
efficiently and provide convenient access between the City's various activity centers, and from
residential areas to activity centers.
This General Plan anticipates full funding and completion of State Route 125, including the Otay
River crossing, essential interchanges in Chula Vista, and accommodation of regional transit
service as central to supporting the development concepts of the General Plan.
                                  Objective - LUT 14

   7.8 Land Use and Transportation Integration
   Transportation and travel are important quality of life components for Chula Vista residents. Ease
   of getting back and forth to work and school, the amount of time spent commuting, and the
   number and degree of choices available for getting around are very important to the health and
   sustainability of Chula Vista. Land use type, function, and location all have a major effect on
   transportation use, and decisions about transportation influence what is built and where.
   Planning for land use and transportation facilities must be considered together to achieve the
   best solutions. Land use and transportation integration that provides for safe access to all modes
   of travel improves overall public health and sustainability, and decreases air pollutants,
   greenhouse gas emissions, and natural resources.

7.9 Improving Vehicular And Transit Mobility
The City of Chula Vista will continue its efforts to develop and maintain a safe and efficient
transportation system with adequate roadway capacity; however, the City's ability to widen roads
to accommodate increased demand from automobile traffic is limited. In some areas road
widening is not consistent with goals to create streets that are pedestrian-friendly and safe.
Chula Vista is committed to creating streets that are designed and operated to enable safe
access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and
abilities.

7.10         Grade Separated Transit Crossing at E Street and
             H Street
The San Diego Trolley Blue Line passes through the western part of the City of Chula Vista, along
the east side of Interstate 5, with stations at E Street, H Street, and Palomar Street. Because the
Trolley crossings of City streets are currently at-grade, station stops block the flow of traffic
between Interstate 5 and western Chula Vista, resulting in delays and queues. This is especially
true on E Street and H Street, which are major east/west roads linking the freeway and the
western part of the City. These conditions will worsen due to local and regional traffic growth
and the planned increase in Trolley service. Grade separation will reduce east/west traffic delays.
Projected gridlock-like conditions will be substantially improved, because east/west traffic will flow
through intersections without the queues and delays caused by increased Trolley crossings and
their gate operations.
                                   Objective - LUT 22
Encourage regional and local efforts to continue planning for

   7.11 Increase Mobility WKURXJK0XOWLPRGDO2SSRUWXQLWLHV
   Bicycles are an alternative to driving, accommodating longer trips than walking, especially when
   combined with transit. Every trip begins and ends with walking, so the pedestrian environment
   becomes the primary transportation element that connects all travel modes. For walking and
   bicycling to be viable alternatives to travel by car, the bicycle and pedestrian systems must
   efficiently and conveniently connect residential areas and activity centers in a safe and
   comfortable manner, and within an interesting environment.
   The creation of a transportation system that integrates Complete Streets design features and
   maximizes safety for drivers, transit users and pedestrians of all ages and abilities will increase
   mobility throughout the City. Complete Streets should be designed and operated to enable equal
   safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages
   and abilities; the result being transportation projects that make the street network better and safer.
                                         Objective - LUT 23

   7.12          Regional Cooperation and Coordination
   Many important issues affecting Chula Vista's quality of life, such as traffic congestion; air quality;
   jobs; and economic prosperity are regional issues shared by San Diego County's other cities, and
   unincorporated areas. Region-wide discussion and planning, with coordinated action and
   implementation, can address and improve regional issues and concerns that affect Chula Vista.
   The Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP) approved by SANDAG in July 2004 provides a common
   basis for the region's cities to address issues of mutual concern and to provide balanced, regional
   solutions. It is important that the City continue to participate on regional bodies that address
   these issues, and continue to advocate and support proposed RCP solutions that will improve the
   quality of life for City residents.
   The City is also influenced and affected by activities that take place immediately adjacent to its
   corporate boundary, such as National City, San Diego, and the Port of San Diego; within its sphere
   of influence, such as San Diego County’s Sweetwater Community Plan area; or in the nearby
   surrounding area, such as the Otay Valley and Otay Mesa. Chula Vista needs to address issues
   of concern or problems in these areas, including establishment of appropriate municipal service
   boundaries and clear community identity, and proactively work with the appropriate jurisdiction to
   develop solutions.
                                        Objective - LUT 24
   Work cooperatively with other agencies and jurisdictions to address
   regional issues that affect the quality of life for Chula Vista's residents,

          2020
   7.13 Relationship of Density / Intensity to Amenities
   Development in Chula Vista over the past 50 years has been
   primarily suburban in nature -- relatively low-density
   housing, well served by roadways where residents usually             Various strategies will
   need to drive to shop, work, and play. Now Chula Vista is            be employed to provide
   evolving from a suburban community into a city with a more           the needed community
   urban-type environment in certain areas, primarily eastern           amenities for existing
   Chula Vista's Eastern Urban Center (EUC) and portions of             and new development
   western Chula Vista. Urban-type environments are
                                                                        in mature areas of
   characterized by a mix of land uses and housing types,
   especially higher density, within walking distance of daily          Chula Vista.
   shopping needs; restaurants; entertainment; parks; plazas,
   and community facilities.
   Future urban-type development in the City will bring increased demand for services,
   infrastructure, and other needs. Due to the mostly built-out condition in the more mature areas
   west of Interstate 805, available land for acquisition for public parks and plazas is scarce and
   expensive. Various strategies will be employed to provide the needed community amenities for
   existing and new development in these mature areas of Chula Vista.
   All new construction, redevelopment, and infill development will observe City requirements and
   standards to provide necessary improvements. Implementation will be guided by appropriate
   plans and documents, including, but not limited to, the development standards and guidelines
   found in existing and future Specific Plans and other regulatory documents. The allowable
   density and intensity of development is tied to the provision of amenities needed to achieve
   the community's vision for a well-balanced urban environment. The amenities and incentives
   are intended to achieve the General Plan's vision and objectives for a vibrant and varied
   community that enhances and preserves Chula Vista’s unique features. Mixed use
   development, additional housing opportunities, and a transit-oriented, pedestrian-friendly urban
   environment provide for improved livability for residents, workers, and visitors.

7.14         Clustering of Residential Development
The concept of residential clustering involves the aggregation or grouping of allowable
residential units onto a reduced land area on a particular site, typically in response to the site's
unique physical characteristics. These characteristics include such items as: topography;
geology; biological resources; or other similar constraints. Clustering may also be used to provide
additional amenities for project residents, such as creating open space and/or recreational
opportunities. Clustering is most effective when both the site resources and the residents are
benefited.
One concern with clustering is that the resulting residential type and/or configuration becomes
different than that intended for the area (in a non-clustered situation), and raises issues of
consistency and compatibility. To respond, the degree of clustering should not result in housing
types inconsistent to the area, such as creating multi-story, multifamily units in a single family
designated area. In such an instance, smaller lot single-family dwellings, and single-family
attached units or townhomes would be more appropriate. To address another concern, use of
clustering is not intended to yield a number of units that would otherwise not be approved on
the site in a normal configuration.
                                  Objective - LUT 29
Allow for the clustering of residential development to respond to site
constraints, and improve amenities for project residents.
Policies
LUT 29.1         Clustering in response to site constraints must accomplish one or more of the
                 following: preservation of natural landforms; significant reduction in the amount
                 and extent of grading; response to geologic, soil or other hazards; and/or
                 protection of sensitive biological resources.

           2020
   LUT 29.2           Clustering may be allowed when it aggregates open space with the project for
                      amenity and recreational purposes, and/or improves the visual and functional
                      qualities of the project.
   LUT 29.3           Clustering shall not result in the creation of dwelling product types that are
                      substantially out of character with the intended dwelling type for the subject
                      General Plan residential classification. The introduction of some unit types
                      typically applicable to the next highest residential density classification may be
                      allowed, provided that the predominant character of the project maintains
                      consistency with the applicable residential classification.
   7.15 Parking
   Parking is a major component of existing and new development or redevelopment; however,
   parking demand and how it is met should not dominate or detract from the urban environment.
   Excessive land used for surface parking reduces residential and commercial densities and
   increases the distance between buildings and streets. A neighborhood or district's parking supply
   should be appropriate for the area's land uses and level of transportation service. Parking
   facilities should fit well within the area and not negatively affect its pedestrian-oriented
   environment, aesthetic qualities, or overall appearance.
                                        Objective - LUT 30
   Use parking management to better utilize parking facilities and
   implement policies to reduce parking demand before considering public
   expenditures for additional parking facilities
   Policies
   LUT 30.1           Consider limiting parking in appropriate areas to discourage single-occupant
                      vehicle commuting and to reinforce non-auto travel modes, but not so limiting as
                      to adversely affect the viability and vitality of the area.

7.16          Planning For Healthy Communities
Both Land use and transportation, have a strong influence on people's lifestyles and in
promoting a healthy and sustainable community. Land use arrangements and mixes that
provide safe, easy and convenient access to, transit and other non-auto modes of travel ,access
to daily needs, conveniences, and employment, and phisical activity create the underpinnings for
a healthy community.
Auto emissions are the single largest source of air pollution, and air quality is a major
environmental health factor therefore multi-modal options that reduce reliance on the auto
should be pursued. The availability of safe, convenient and connected walking paths, trails and
bikeways, and neighborhood-based park and recreational options also promote physical activity
and exercise. Providing mobility options can improve environmental healthy by reducing
reliance on auto usage.
Highlighting the growing awareness of the need for healthy planning the national “Healthy
Community” Initiative stresses healthy choices at all levels from appropriate placement of land
uses to ensure that citizens are not adversely affected by uses that may present health risks,
development of an interconnected transportation system that meets the varied modal needs of
all travelers, to opportunities for exercise and easy and convenient access to physical activity, to
recreation facilities and healthy food choices.
Another important facet of the Healthy Community initiative is increasing availability and access
to healthy food choices. This is particularly relevant in lower income areas that may have limited
food choices. Those areas are likely to be prone to concentrations of fast-food restaurants and
an over-concentration of small grocery stores that do not carry a full range of products including
fresh produce. Increased focus toward ensuring that neighborhood-serving commercial areas
provide access to a full range of healthy food is fundamental to the success of a healthy
community. This section includes policies designed to ensure that sources of healthy foods are
accessible in all neighborhoods. Other parts of the General Plan also relate to the notion of a
healthy and sustainable community and address topics such as mixed use and transit oriented
development, a balanced interconnected and safe transportation system, access to trails and
park and recreation facilities and services; sustainable development; protection of the
environment and people from air and water pollution and hazardous materials. For instance,
other sections of this Land Use and Transportation Element address Land Use and
Transportation Integration, Improving Vehicular and Transit Mobility, and Increasing Mobility
Through Use of Bicycles and Walking; Section 3.5 of the Public Facilities and Services Element
deals with Parks and Recreation, and includes an objective and policies on Joint Use of Park and
School Facilities; the Environmental Element (Chapter 9) contains sections on Sustainable
Development; Promoting Clean Air including indoor air quality; Protecting Water Quality; and
Hazardous Materials and Waste.

   7.17          Evaluations for Mobilehome Developments;
                 Mobilehome Overlay District
   As noted in LUT Section 7.1 and in Housing Element Part 1, Section 3.0, maintaining an
   adequate supply of land designated and zoned at appropriate densities to support a variety of
   residential housing types is an important component of ensuring sufficient diversity and balance
   to meet the needs of existing and future residents.
   In Chula Vista, mobilehome developments have historically been a part of that supply, and have
   effectively provided a unique and affordable housing source. Housing costs for mobilehome
   living are often lower than market rates for other types of housing such as comparable sized
   rental apartments. As such, it is not uncommon to find that many of the households residing in
   mobilehome developments are living on fixed incomes, or are otherwise in need of lower-income
   affordable housing. Additionally, many residents own their own coach, but rent or lease the land
   space, leaving them vulnerable to changes in land use. These circumstances can present added
   challenges in finding suitable replacement housing options for mobilehome residents in the
   event of potential closure of one or more of these developments.
   As shown on Figure 5-18(A), there are currently 32 mobilehome developments within the City in
   a variety of settings ranging from well organized and maintained parks with exclusive Mobile
   Home Park (MHP) zoning, to less formal and often smaller trailer parks in areas zoned for
   commercial or other development. Within the Urban Core Subarea, several mobilehome
   developments fall within the Interstate 5 Corridor District where higher density housing and
   transit-focused mixed uses are envisioned to occur. With increasing housing demands and
   rising land costs throughout the region, the likelihood for potential closure of some mobilehome
   Developments over time is real.

In recognition of these circumstances, and in order to better balance the often unique needs of
mobilehome residents with the challenges in locating suitable replacement housing, it is
important that analysis and planning be undertaken in accordance with the principles of the
Housing Element objectives prior to the City's consideration of any requested change in use and/
or rezoning affecting any of the existing mobilehome sites. In order to accomplish this, the
Mobilehome Overlay District is established to ensure that the appropriate evaluation and
consideration of the affects of potential changes in use and/or urban redevelopment on this
Unique form of housing from the standpoints of housing opportunity, affordability, and
displacement, replacement and/or relocation assistance is conducted in accordance with the
Principles et forth in the Housing Element and the Municipal Code.
As stated in the following Objective and Policies, the Mobilehome Overlay District ensures that
the analysis and planning on the affects of closure on existing mobilehome residents is
conducted and that the property owner and/or project proponent has prepared and carried out a
Plan to address those affects as required by the Municipal Code.

8.0         SOUTHWEST AREA PLAN
 8.1 Description/Setting
 The Southwest Planning Area consists of approximately 5,753 acres,
 and is generally bounded on the north by L Street; on the south by         Covering a major
 the Otay River; on the east by Interstate 805; and on the west by the      portion of the
 San Diego Bay. The Southwest Planning Area has several mature              Southwest
 neighborhoods, including: Harborside; Castle Park; Otay Town;              Planning Area is
 Woodlawn Park; Broderick Acres; Whittington Subdivision; and West
                                                                            the approximately
 Fairfield. Covering a major portion of the Southwest Planning Area is
 the approximately 3.5-square-mile Montgomery community, which, in          3.5-square-mile
 1985, was annexed from San Diego County. This annexation was the           Montgomery
 largest inhabited annexation in the State of California up to that time,   community.
 with approximately 26,000 residents.
 The Southwest Planning Area has a grid street pattern and a diversity of land uses, including a
 mix of residential, commercial, and industrial businesses that, in some cases, have evolved over
 time without adequate planning, and have resulted in land use conflicts.
 8.2 Subareas and Districts
 The Southwest Planning Area (Figure 5-19) consists of two planning subareas: Montgomery and
 Castle Park. Within these Subareas are established residential neighborhoods and supporting
 uses. The Montgomery Subarea includes Planning Districts that, as the City continues to mature,
 are expected to evolve over time and offer opportunities for both new development and
 redevelopment. The Planning Districts are the primary focus of the objectives and policies found
 in this Area Plan.
 The Southwest Planning Area has five Planning Districts, all within the Montgomery Subarea,
 which are listed below, and illustrated on Figure 5-20:

          2020
   In Section 8.3, Area-Wide Planning Factors, Objectives and Policies, below, issues are addressed
   and policies are presented that are important to the entire Southwest Planning Area.
   Subsequently, in Section 8.4, District Planning Factors, Objectives and Policies, issues are
   addressed and policies are presented specifically for the five districts noted above, and their Focus
   Areas.
   8.3 Area-Wide Planning Factors, Objectives, and Policies
   There are several topics or issues with respect to the Southwest Planning Area that require a
   more focused discussion:
           !   Residential Neighborhoods
           !   Housing
           !   Existing Non-Residential Development
           !   Mobility
           !   Parks and Recreation
           !   Open Space Conservation
           !   Safety and Aesthetics
   8.3.1         Residential Neighborhhoods
   Southwest Chula Vista includes several stable residential neighborhoods or enclaves, identified as
   Harborside; Castle Park; Otay Town; Broderick Acres; Woodlawn Park; and Whittington Subdivision.
   To maintain the stability of these neighborhoods, it is important to protect them from the intrusion
   of incompatible land uses, such as commercial and industrial uses and their associated impacts,
   including traffic and noise. The policies below are intended to maintain and improve these
   neighborhoods through: 1) neighborhood revitalization programs that minimize land use
   conflicts and provide upgrades to existing infrastructure; 2) zoning standards that address
   appropriate transitions and/or buffers that ensure domestic tranquility; 3) the provision of
   adequate and available transportation options for residents; and 4) the provision of nearby local
   retail and other services.
                                       Objective - LUT 35
   Revitalize and protect existing stable residential neighborhoods in the
   Southwest Planning Area from adverse land use impacts.

Policies
LUT 35.1            Strive to achieve a balanced residential community through integration of low,
                    moderate, and higher income housing within the Southwest Planning Area,
                    and the adequate dispersal of such housing to preclude establishment of
                    specific low-income enclaves.
LUT 35.2            Increase investment in the Southwest Planning Area, particularly through uses
                    that will serve both local residential neighborhoods, and also the entire City.
LUT 35.3            Promote the resolution of basic transportation; traffic; public facilities; and
                    drainage problems within the Southwest Planning Area.
LUT 35.4            Focus on historic preservation; safety and security; and code enforcement
                    efforts within older neighborhoods in the Southwest Planning Area.
LUT 35.5            Develop specific design regulations to maintain and encourage quality
                    architecture in the Montgomery District.
8.3.2        Housing
The Southwest Planning Area has a variety of housing types, including: mobile homes; single-
family homes; apartments; and condominiums. More housing is needed to accommodate future
growth projections. Additional housing opportunities should be located where necessary services
are available or can be provided, and where adequate transportation services will also be
available. The addition of new housing opportunities for both rental and home ownership should
include the provision of adequate infrastructure, including: needed parks; schools; adequately
sized roads; parking; and other facilities. New housing opportunities within the Southwest
Planning Area will be focused along major arterials such as Broadway, Third Avenue and Palomar
Street, where adequate services and transportation can be provided and where increased
economic viability can also occur.
                                                                                 Page LUT-139

          2020
                                        Objective - LUT 36
   Provide additional housing opportunities to accommodate anticipated
   population needs.
   Policies
   LUT 36.1               Introduce residential housing with retail commercial and professional services
                           in a mixed use arrangement within the Palomar Gateway, South Broadway,
                           and South Third Avenue Districts.
   8.3.3         Existing Non-Residential Development
   The Southwest Planning Area has a number of existing, non-residential land uses that have
   developed under prior development standards that, today, are considered to be non-conforming.
   Several of these non-conforming land uses still represent viable businesses and should be
   recognized for their contributions to the community and the economic investment in them that
   has occurred over time. While non-conforming, many of these land uses can continue to
   effectively co-exist with conforming uses, provided that upgrades or improvements are permitted
   to occur.
                                        Objective - LUT 37
   Recognize the benefit of permitting existing, non-conforming, non-
   residential land uses to improve their properties in a manner that is
   compatible with the City's goals and policies, and with surrounding
   conforming uses and proposed development.
   Policies
   LUT 37.1               Develop a program that encourages and allows existing, non-conforming
                           businesses to upgrade appearances and make reasonable improvements
                           without economic hardship.

8.3.4         Mobility
Convenient and timely mobility within and outside of the Southwest Planning Area is important.
Roadways, transit, and other transportation modes, such as bicycles and walking, contribute to a
community's mobility.
In addition to the Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 freeways and key arterial roadways (Broadway,
Third Avenue and Hilltop Drive), the existing Palomar Street Trolley Station links the Southwest
Planning Area to job centers in downtown San Diego and to the U.S.-Mexico border region to the
south. However, because many eastern Chula Vista residents use Southwest Planning Area
roadways to reach Interstate 5, rapid transit connecting the eastern portion of the City with the
Southwest Planning Area will be needed to minimize congestion on surface streets and provide a
stronger link between jobs and housing. A north/south shuttle link should also be established to
connect southwest Chula Vista with downtown Chula Vista.
Additionally, significant trails or pedestrian pathways providing alternative modes of pedestrian
movement are lacking in the Southwest (there are no sidewalks on Palomar Street, for instance),
although bicycle facilities (lanes, routes, paths) are provided on major roadways, where
appropriate. Opportunities exist within utility rights-of-way on the Bayfront and along the Otay
River Valley to provide recreational trails and pedestrian paths to provide alternative means of
travel.
                                    Objective - LUT 38
Provide a multi-modal transportation system to serve the Southwest
Planning Area.
Policies
LUT 38.1              Support the implementation of enhanced transit service concepts within the
                      Southwest Planning Area.
LUT 38.2              Develop an overall transportation system plan and standards, including an
                      evaluation of transit service levels, to address mobility and accessibility
                      between eastern and western Chula Vista as it affects the Southwest Planning
                      Area, and linkages between downtown and the Southwest Planning Area.
                                                                                   Page LUT-141

         2020
   LUT 38.3               Provide sidewalks throughout the main thoroughfares, such as Palomar Street
                          and Third Avenue.
   LUT 38.4              Provide shuttle service that can access J Street Marina, Broadway, and the E Street
                         loop.
   LUT 38.5              Provide park and ride access at the Palomar Trolley Station and other major
                         transit stations.
   8.3.5        Parks and Recreation
   The Southwest Planning Area has 12 parks totaling 57.82 acres, and the Otay Community Center.
   Through the acquisition and development of underdeveloped parcels, and through the

8.3.6         Open Space Conservation
Through natural open space, preserve planning efforts, such as the Multiple Species Conservation
Program (MSCP), the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge, and the Otay Valley Regional Park, areas
within the Southwest Planning Area where natural systems exist will be the focus of continuing
conservation efforts. Opportunities to provide for open space conservation occur within the Otay
River Valley and on the Bayfront, both key components of the City's Greenbelt system. Future
development opportunities adjacent to these areas, as well as regional park implementation
efforts, need to respect and conserve these important open space resources.
Refer to Chapter 9, the Environmental Element, for additional discussion and policies on open
space, and to Chapter 8, the Public Facilities and Services Element, for discussion and policies on
the Otay Valley Regional Park.

   8.4 District and Focus Area Planning Factors, Objectives,
             and Policies
   Five Districts have been identified within the Southwest's Montgomery Subarea, and are described
   in this section. This section also identifies proposals for change and improvement within the
   Districts and provides appropriate policies that will guide implementation of the vision for each
   District.
   8.4.1         South Third Avenue District
   Description of District
   The South Third Avenue District (Figure 5-21) is a significant north/south commercial street that
   links several neighborhoods in the City. The District is generally located between L Street on the
   north and Palomar Street on the south.
   Existing Conditions
   Retail and services along Third Avenue support adjacent residential areas. Civic uses, including a
   post office and Lauderbach Park, are located near the intersection with Oxford Street.
   Vision for District
   The South Third Avenue District is an area with neighborhood-serving commercial uses and good
   transit service for residents of the single-family and multi-family homes. It is an attractive area,
   with recent streetscape improvements and renovated building façades, where residents enjoy
   walking to do their daily shopping needs or dine in a restaurant. Some redevelopment along
   Third Avenue has introduced additional residential units above retail shops and professional
   offices. These physical improvements, plus the addition of more local-serving shops and a
   community center have helped to create a vibrant mixed use core in the Southwest Town Focus
   Area that has become a community focal point in the Southwest Planning Area.
   A transit station near the intersection of Third Avenue and Palomar Street, and a Bus Rapid Transit
   (BRT) route connect the Palomar Street Trolley Station with the eastern master planned
   communities and regional commercial centers. The transit station serves the Southwest Town
   Focus Area and provides additional transportation options for the area. Due to proximity to transit,
   residential densities are higher south of Oxford Street than north of Oxford Street.

                       and Palomar Street in concert with the establishment of a transit route
                       connecting the Palomar Trolley Station with eastern Chula Vista.
   LUT 41.3            Conduct a special study to determine the precise boundaries for the Southwest
                       Town Focus Area, generally between Naples Street and Orange Avenue along
                       Third Avenue. Subsequent to the special study, prepare a specific plan to guide
                       the future redevelopment of the Southwest Town Focus Area as a mixed use
                       neighborhood integrating multi-family housing with office; retail; service; and
                       community civic uses at a pedestrian scale where appropriate.

   Description of District
   The South Broadway District (Figure 5-22) extends from L Street to the City boundary at the Otay
   Valley.
   Existing Conditions
   The South Broadway District includes automobile services, major retail stores, and local-serving
   services for adjacent residential neighborhoods. Automobile-related/service repair shops currently
   exist on South Broadway from L Street to Naples Street and are not compatible with surrounding
   uses.
Page LUT-148    City of Chula Vista General Plan
                               LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
Vision for District
The South Broadway District includes additional residential
units along South Broadway, and the phased removal of
conflicting automobile-related service/repair shops from L Street
to Naples Street, and from Palomar Street to Anita Street. The
District focuses on increasing the viability of retail shops,
providing for needed housing opportunities, and improving the
appearance of this major corridor.
Automobile-related shops are focused within areas designated
as light industrial areas, west of Broadway and along Main
Street. This is a compatible location for necessary automotive services and avoids land use
conflicts on South Broadway, north of Anita Street.

8.4.3        Palomar Gateway District
Description of District
The Palomar Gateway District (Figure 5-23) is located at the interchange of Palomar Street and
Interstate 5, and is characterized by the Palomar Trolley Station, located at the southeast quadrant
of Palomar Street and Industrial Boulevard.
Existing Conditions
North of Palomar Street are light industrial businesses and multi-family housing. South of
Palomar Street is a mix of single-family and multi-family housing extending south to Anita Street.
Vision for District
The Palomar Gateway District is the major southern gateway into the City and functions as one of
the activity corridors in the City. The District provides housing and support uses near a regional
transit route. Higher density residential development within walking distance of the Palomar

8.4.4          West Fairfield District
Description of District
The West Fairfield District (see Figure 5-23), originally part of the Fairfield neighborhood that was
severed by the construction of Interstate 5, is located on the west side of Interstate 5, between
Palomar Street and Main Street, and is flanked by San Diego Bay on the west.
Existing Conditions
The West Fairfield District has a mix of light industrial and office uses interspersed with older,
single-family homes and vacant lots. West Fairfield is somewhat isolated from the rest of Chula
Vista, due to Interstate 5 forming its eastern edge. Pedestrian routes across the freeway are
limited and heavily traveled by cars and trucks. Freeway on- and off-ramps at Palomar Street
provide convenient freeway access into the District for vehicles.
Vision for District
The West Fairfield District has been redeveloped through a
well-planned and coordinated master plan. There are few land
use conflicts, and land uses have been expanded by
reclaiming an old San Diego settlement pond to the southwest.
The West Fairfield District has good freeway access at Palomar
and Main Streets, and it is an employment center, with regional
retail and other employment uses. An educational facility is
also located in the West Fairfield District.
                                                                                    Page LUT-157

                      or other regulatory document to coordinate and guide the comprehensive
                      redevelopment of the West Fairfield District.

   8.4.5        Main Street District
   Description of District
   The Main Street District (Figure 5-24) functions as a commercial-industrial service area and
   interfaces with the Otay Town residential neighborhoods north of Main Street and with the Otay
   River Valley open space to the south. The District is generally located between Industrial
   Boulevard on the west and Hilltop Drive on the east.
   Existing Conditions
   The Main Street District extends between Interstate 5 and Interstate 805 and is predominantly an
   industrial corridor. While there are relatively large commercial properties on the north side of
   Main Street, west of Broadway, remaining land uses on the north and south sides of Main Street
   consist of light industrial uses, also referred to as limited industrial uses. Several storage facilities
   and some businesses consisting of outdoor storage areas exist in the area.
   Vision for District
   The Main Street District is the focus of limited
   industrial uses within western Chula Vista. The
   appearance of this heavily traveled thoroughfare has
   improved over the years due to conformance with
   design standards that encourage attractive buildings
   and street frontages, and that provide protection of
   adjacent residential areas.
   Light or limited Industrial uses extend within
   previously disturbed development areas south of
   Main Street to the edge of the Otay River Valley open
   space. Mining activities within and adjacent to open
   space areas have ceased. With the implementation
   of mining reclamation plans for these areas, there is a balance between restoration of habitat for
   sensitive biological species, new employment, and other recreation uses.

   and establishing a strong open space connection with the nearby
   neighborhoods.
   Policies

                      maintenance standards.
   LUT 45.5           The City shall prepare, or cause to have prepared, a specific plan or plans, for
                      the Main Street District area that address an increase in depth of Limited
                      Industrial designated land uses on the north side of Main Street back to

                      land uses on or near Main Street.
                      The City will prepare an Implementation Program to define logical planning
                      units within the overall Main Street District, and to assure establishment of the
                      above plans/regulations for the overall District and the identified planning
                      units. The Implementation Program will also include interim provisions for the
                      consideration of any projects within this area prior to completion and
                      adoption of the applicable plan/regulations.

   The Northwest Planning Area has a broad range of land uses, including automobile-related
   businesses on Broadway; neighborhood services and offices near Downtown Third Avenue;
   regional retail shopping at the Chula Vista Center; two high schools, two middle schools; five
   elementary schools; several neighborhood and mini parks; and a mix of housing types, including
   apartments; condominiums; mobile homes; and single-family neighborhoods.
   The area east of Second Avenue and south of E Street is generally residential with well-
   maintained, traditional single-family homes. Residential areas west of Second Avenue and north
   of I Street, along with areas west of Broadway and south of I Street, are considered to be in
   transition with portions of these areas zoned and developed with large- and small-scale, multi-
   family residential. Large-size (greater than ¼-acre) and larger estate lots establish the character of
   an unincorporated island area of San Diego County located northeast of Hilltop Drive and H
   Street. Areas of commercial, industrial, and institutional lands (including parks) comprise the
   remaining areas.
   Designated scenic roadways, well-manicured neighborhoods, and urban amenities such as
   pedestrian and bicycle facilities, local parks, and open space all contribute to the character of the
   Northwest Planning Area. Despite having many unique and attractive characteristics, some
   neighborhoods have experienced decline over the years and blighted commercial and residential
   areas have been targeted for revitalization.

9.2 Subareas and Districts
The Northwest Planning Area has three planning Subareas:
Lower Sweetwater, Hilltop, and the Urban Core (Figure 5-25).             The Urban Core
The Subareas have established residential neighborhoods;
however, there are also Planning Districts with Focus Areas that
                                                                         Subarea is envisioned
are expected to evolve over time as the City continues to mature,        for the most change
and that offer opportunities for infill development,                     over the 25-year
redevelopment, and new projects. It is these Planning Districts          planning horizon of
that are primarily addressed by specific objectives and policies in      the General Plan.
the Northwest Area Plan discussion.
The Lower Sweetwater Subarea is generally bounded by Interstate 805 to the east, Interstate 5 to
the west, State Route 54 to the north, and C and E Streets to the south. This subarea consists of
commercial and industrial uses adjacent State Route 54, west of Second Avenue, and open space
east of Second Avenue. Predominantly stable-single family residential characterizes the
remaining areas within the Rosebank neighborhood, with some higher density residential west of
Interstate 805, near E Street. While properties near State Route 54 may redevelop over time,
residential areas are not anticipated to change.
The Hilltop Subarea is generally bounded by Interstate 805 to the east, Second Avenue to the
west, E Street to the north, and L Street to the south. This subarea consists predominantly of
stable, single-family residential neighborhoods that are not anticipated to change in the
timeframe of this General Plan.
The Urban Core Subarea is envisioned for the most change over the 25-year planning
horizon of the General Plan. It is important to note that given the current developed
condition of the Urban Core, and the unique nature of urban revitalization, the exact
extent, timing and sequence of infill development and redevelopment depends on a
variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to: long-term viability associated with
recent development; longevity of other existing residential and commercial uses that may not
redevelop over the planning horizon; preservation of significant historic structures, and
development costs associated with the acquisition, demolition, and cleanup of
urbanized land.

   The Urban Core Subarea is divided into five Planning Districts (Figure 5-26), in order to address
   particular area changes. Those Districts are listed below, along with subsequent sections
   addressing detailed policies for each District:
            !     Downtown Third Avenue, Section 9.5.1

            !     Mid-Third Avenue, Section 9.5.11
   The Northwest Area Plan first addresses issues and presents policies that are important to the
   entire Northwest Planning Area (refer to Section 9.3, Area-Wide Planning Factors, Objectives, and
   Policies), followed by issues and policies for the Urban Core Subarea (Section 9.4), its five
   Planning Districts, and their Focus Areas (refer to Section 9.5, Planning District and Focus Area
   Planning Factors, Objectives, and Policies).
   9.3 Area-Wide Planning Factors, Objectives, and Policies
   There are several topics or issues with respect to the Northwest Planning Area that require a more
   focused discussion:
           !      Historic Preservation
           !      Bayfront Linkages
           !      Residential Neighborhoods

           !      Urban Design and Form
   9.3.1         Historic Preservation
   The Northwest Planning Area contains historic resources, architectural features, and Focus Areas
   that need special recognition and preservation efforts. The City's historical and cultural heritage is
   important to preserve, as it memorializes Chula Vista's evolution and contributes to the City's
   image and identity. See Section 7.6, Enhancing Community Image, Historic Resources, for
   applicable objectives and policies, as well as Environmental Element Section 3.1.9.

9.3.2       Bayfront Linkages
The Northwest Planning Area is positioned between the largely underdeveloped Bayfront
Planning Area, and the newer communities in eastern Chula Vista. The Bayfront Planning Area
and the Northwest Planning Area’s Urban Core Subarea will provide different but complementary
uses and will provide residents with entertainment; recreational activities; lodging; and other
services within a compact are. Therefore, the full range of access linkages, by car; transit; bicycle;
or on foot should be planned and implemented through development of the Bayfront Planning
Area and redevelopment of the Urban Core Subarea. A paseo along the Bayfront should serve as
the spine that attaches to key linkages, such as F Street. Convenient access to the Bayfront
Planning Area from the Urban Core Subarea will allow successful development and appreciation
of both the Bayfront Planning Area and the Urban Core Subarea. The relationship between the
Bayfront Planning Area and the Urban Core Subarea provides an opportunity to create synergy to
connected, but distinct, areas of the City.
                                 Objective - LUT 46
Establish linkages between the Urban Core Subarea and the Bayfront
Planning Area for pedestrians, bicycles, and transit.
Policies
LUT 46.1            Pedestrian and bicycle access between the Bayfront Planning Area and the
                    Urban Core Subarea should be identified and guidelines for their
                    development should be established through the Urban Core Specific Plan or a
                    subsequent implementation document.
LUT 46.2            Pursue funding for the design and construction of enhanced (wider) Interstate

          2020
   9.3.3        Residential Neighborhoods
   Several older and well-maintained residential neighborhoods exist within the Northwest Planning
   Area. It is important that redevelopment of the Area respect and preserve these stable
   neighborhoods. Design guidelines and standards need to emphasize this and recognize that
   while redevelopment is important, it is just as important to protect the integrity of the City's
   residential neighborhoods. Refer to Section 7.3, Preserving and Enhancing Stable Residential
   Neighborhoods, and Section 7.5, Compatible Land Use and Edge Transitions, of this element for
   further discussion and applicable policies.
   9.3.4        Housing
   More housing is needed within the Northwest Planning Area to meet population growth
   projections through the year 2030 and to increase vitality in the Urban Core Subarea. Adding
   residents increases local business revenues and creates opportunities for a greater variety of
   restaurants, shops and entertainment. The majority of new housing, including affordable housing,
   is directed to the Urban Core Subarea's Focus Areas; however, some infill development is
   expected to continue in existing residential areas. Refer to the Housing Element for further
   discussion and applicable policies.
   9.3.5        Urban Core Subarea Street Network
   The intensification of residential and commercial land uses within the Northwest Planning Area's
   Urban Core Subarea will alter the character of the built environment on the west side over time,
   creating a more urban, rather than suburban, context. The transportation network takes into
   account all modes of travel within this urban context, including public transit; bicycles;
   pedestrians; and the automobile.
   As discussed in Section 5.5.7, separate roadway classifications have been identified for the
   Northwest Planning Area's Urban Core Subarea. These classifications reflect the special
   operating characteristics of roadways within a more urbanized, mixed use environment, and
   facilitate multi-modal design elements and amenities (such as enhanced sidewalks and transit
   facilities).

The streets located in the Urban Core Subarea should be designed with the pedestrian and
bicyclist in mind in order to increase social interaction; provide better support; emphasize a
friendly, inviting environment for bicycling and walking; and create great places for people to live.
In general, these streets will have tree-lined medians, wide sidewalks, and streetfront facades with
windows, thereby creating interesting places to walk. These streets will provide, in varying
amounts, the following generalized amenities:
         !    Wayfinding maps; tree grates; trash receptacles; and benches strategically located
              throughout the Urban Core Subarea. Streetscapes should be designed with inviting
              sidewalks wide enough to be passable without having to maneuver around hedges
              or other obstacles.
         !    On-street parking, limited driveway cuts, and landscaping or planting strips that create
              a buffer between traffic and pedestrians and provide canopy shade. A well-designed
              streetscape makes people feel comfortable and invites and motivates residents to
              walk or bike to destinations, such as shopping or work. Urban Core Subarea street
              design should include mid-block crosswalks and neighborhood passthroughs to
              future open space areas and common areas. This helps to create a human scale.
         !    Behind the sidewalk, easily accessible building entrances with minimum building
              setbacks, windows at street level, and no blank walls on adjacent buildings.
         !    Distinctive public transit amenities to increase ease of its use and attractiveness of
              neighborhoods. Transit amenities should include bus information kiosks, bicycle
              facilities and interconnections to other routes and bikeways; bike racks; lockers; and
              shower facilities. The intent is to reinforce bicycling as a mode of transportation
              connected to and coordinated with other modes to connect people and places
              through a complete street network.
The following street classifications are designated for the Urban Core Subarea:.
Gateway Street
The intent of the Gateway Street is to link the Urban Core Subarea to the surrounding freeways
that will provide regional access to and from this area. These roadways (segments of Broadway,
Fourth Avenue, E, H, and L Streets) connect the Urban Core Subarea to State Route 54, Interstate
805 and Interstate 5. These facilities are similar to four- and six-lane major roads in other parts of
the City, but will provide special design features and amenities to encourage access for the full
spectrum of travel modes.
                                                                                  Page LUT-171

         2020
   Urban Arterial
   The intent of the Urban Arterial is to serve all modes of travel within a more urbanized
   development context. These roads include portions of E and H Streets and Fourth Avenue.
   Urban Arterials are similar to four-lane major roads in other areas of Chula Vista, but with special
   features to support multi-modal trips. Urban Arterials serve as transitional roadways between
   Gateway Streets and the Commercial Boulevards and Downtown Promenades.
   Commercial Boulevard
   These streets include segments of Broadway and Third Avenue (north of E Street and south of H
   Street) and will serve existing and future shopping districts. Design will be generally consistent
   with four-lane majors in other areas, but with special design features reflecting the multi-modal
   nature of streets in more urban areas.
   Downtown Promenade
   These streets (including portions of F Street and Third Avenue) will provide access to retail
   establishments and residences in the heart of the Urban Core Subarea. Street cross-sections will
   be similar to a Class I Collector, but with multi-modal features and amenities that accommodate
   and enhance the surrounding urban context.
                                       Objective - LUT 47
   Establish roadway classifications in the Urban Core Subarea that
   respond to the special operating characteristics of roadways within a
   more urbanized environment, accommodate slower speeds in
   pedestrian-oriented areas, and facilitate multi-modal design elements
   and amenities.

   9.3.6       Mobility
   Mobility refers to all modes of transportation, and includes people's use of cars; trolleys; buses;
   bicycles; and walking. The Urban Core Subarea's historic grid street pattern will remain intact for
   vehicular use, although an emphasis on pedestrian circulation, accessibility, and safety is equally
   important to traffic flow. Increased access to transit facilities and a pedestrian-friendly
   environment that encourages walking are two important components of mobility for the Urban
   Core Subarea.
   The Transit First! Program prepared by SANDAG identifies future transit routes for Bus Rapid
   Transit (BRT) in Chula Vista that connect to the existing E and H Street trolley stations. This transit
   system will use the H Street corridor as an east/west route, with planned transit stations
   approximately every mile.
   The Urban Core Subarea's land use plan designates areas for jobs, shopping, and housing to be
   located near existing and planned transit station locations. Also, the shuttle system envisioned to
   link the Urban Core Subarea with the Bayfront Planning Area will provide residents and visitors
   with convenient access to the transit stations, as well as shopping and services in both areas (see
   Figure 5-15). Refer to Section 7.7 through 7.11 of this element for additional discussion, objectives,
   and policies regarding Mobility and Circulation throughout the City.
                                       Objective - LUT 48

                      Connections with the Civic Center and transit stations on E and H Streets
                      should be considered as priorities.

                       important features within Downtown, especially an F Street Promenade that
                       will link the Bayfront Planning Area with Broadway and Downtown Third
                       Avenue.
9.3.7         Parks and Recreation
Historically, the City of Chula Vista has provided significant recreation facilities in parks within the
Northwest Planning Area, although most of the parks are pre-existing and have matured as the
community has continued to grow. With the addition of new housing concentrated within the
Urban Core Subarea, additional park and recreation resources will be needed. It is anticipated in
this General Plan that a similar ratio of park and recreation facilities as is being provided in
eastern Chula Vista will be provided within the Northwest Planning Area to accommodate new
residential growth.
The nature and function of the park and recreation spaces in the
Urban Core Subarea and overall Northwest Planning Area will                 With the addition of
reflect the needs of its residents. Additional housing within the           new housing
Urban Core Subarea will be primarily apartments and                         concentrated within
condominiums in a more intense urban environment; therefore, it
is anticipated that the size of any new parks in this area, and the
                                                                            the Urban Core

   9.3.8        Urban Design/Form
   As the City continues to mature, there will be more infill development and redevelopment of
   existing properties within the Urban Core Subarea. Urban design considerations, such as
   building heights and massing; architectural style; public view corridors; circulation linkages, and
   the appearance of important gateways need to be addressed in order to balance needed urban-
   type revitalization and redevelopment in the area, while acknowledging and protecting stable
   neighborhood areas and maintaining the overall sense of place that the community identifies

   As the City and the community, through this General Plan and other efforts, focus their attention
   on the revitalization and redevelopment of the Urban Core, the issue of urban form and
   attendant community character will be of key importance in striking an acceptable balance
   between the new projects and activities that will shepherd in the needed and desired changes,
   and the shaping of those in a manner that retains important, key character elements. Guiding
   policies on urban design and form will help to implement the General Plan’s vision of how the
   City should grow, what visitors' first impressions of the City should be, and how to improve the
   overall image and amenities in western Chula Vista.
   Policies addressing these design considerations are found in Section 9.4, Urban Core Subarea,
   and Section 9.5, District and Focus Areas, of this element. Also refer to Section 7.2, Urban Design
   and Form and 7.6, Enhancing Community Image, of this element for City-wide objectives and
   policies addressing urban design and form; community image and identity; gateways;
   streetscapes; and quality design. Background discussions on Community Image and Character,
   and Urban Design and Form can be found in Sections 3.0 and 7.2 of this LUT Element,
   accordingly.
   9.4 Urban Core Subarea-Wide Planning Factors,
            Objectives, and Policies
   Description of Subarea
   The Urban Core Subarea is generally bounded by Interstate 5 on the west, C Street on the north,
   Second Avenue on the east, and L Street on the south. The Urban Core Subarea functions as the
   business, shopping, and government center of Chula Vista and contains the City's oldest
   established residential neighborhoods (see Figure 5-26).

Existing Conditions
The Urban Core Subarea has three major commercial streets that offer different types of shopping:
(1) Broadway's auto-oriented commercial strip malls, auto repair and service uses, and lodging; (2)
H Street's Chula Vista Center (regional shopping mall), Scripps medical facilities, and other
professional offices, restaurants and businesses; and (3) Downtown Third Avenue's pedestrian-
oriented specialty shops, restaurants, and small businesses that primarily serve local residents.
The City's Civic Center; central library; police headquarters; and the South County Regional
Government Center are also located in the Urban Core Subarea, along with two urban-style
passive parks and three elementary schools; one junior high school; and one high school. A
variety of housing types are located in the Urban Core Subarea's neighborhoods, including
single-family detached, multi-family apartments and condominiums, and mobile homes. Some of
the neighborhoods are in transition, adding multi-family housing in accordance with allowable
land use designations or upgrading the existing housing, while other neighborhoods remain
stable with relatively little change.
Interstate 5 and the San Diego trolley line form the Urban Core Subarea's west edge, while the
Bayfront Planning Area and San Diego Bay lay just beyond. Due to at-grade trolley crossings on
City streets, vehicular traffic delays and backups occur on some major streets such as E and H
Streets
Vision for the Urban Core Subarea
The Urban Core Subarea has developed into a vibrant area, with housing; shops; restaurants;
entertainment; and activities that attract from eastern Chula Vista and city-wide. Higher density
housing, shopping, and job centers are located near the major transit stations, including E Street
and Interstate 5; H Street and Interstate 5; and near Third Avenue and H Street. These key activity
nodes give people transportation choices, encourage the use of mass transit, and help to reduce
vehicular traffic. They are accentuated by landmark building design, and for the two Transit Focus
Areas at E Street/Interestate 5 and H Street/Interestate 5, strategic use of some taller (high-rise)
structures that draw attention, and provide unique identities for these important gateway
entrances to the urban core, the bayfront. A network of linked urban parks and plazas creates
pleasant pedestrian routes and provides areas for community activities. Increased population
(residents and workers) in the Urban Core Subarea has created opportunities for more shops and
a variety of restaurants. Entertainment and cultural arts are housed in new and renovated
buildings, offering both day and evening activities. The streets are bustling with shoppers and
people enjoying outdoor dining or heading to entertainment venues.
A grade-separated trolley line at E and H Streets has improved the flow of east-west traffic, while a
local shuttle provides frequent service between Urban Core Subarea activity centers. The Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) line allows residents in the East Planning Area convenient access to the
Urban Core Subarea.

          2020
   F Street is a pedestrian-oriented promenade that links Third Avenue; the Civic Center; Broadway;
   the E Street transit center; and the Bayfront Planning Area with themed landscaping and public
   art. The freeway crossings of Interstate 5 have been widened to accommodate additional
   pedestrian use, and entryways into the Urban Core Subarea are enhanced and inviting. Chula
   Vista's Urban Core Subarea has matured into an urban, pedestrian-oriented, active area that
   continues to be the primary economic, governmental, and social focal point of the south San
   Diego County region.
                                         Objective - LUT 49
   Encourage redevelopment, infill, and new development activities within
   the Urban Core Subarea that will provide a balance of land uses,
   reinforce its identity as Chula Vista's central core, and complement land
   uses in other planning areas, including the Bayfront and East Planning
   Areas.
   Policies
   Uses
   LUT 49.1                Focus mixed commercial/residential uses; neighborhood-oriented retail;
                           employment opportunities; and civic and quasi-public uses around urban
                           transit stations and focus areas, while protecting and preserving surrounding,
                           low-density neighborhoods from the encroachment of incompatible land uses.
   LUT 49.2                Encourage both commercial and residential development in the area
                           surrounding existing trolley stations and future Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
                           stations.
   LUT 49.3                Transit-oriented development of infill and revitalization sites should redevelop
                           underutilized parcels and incorporate existing surrounding uses into the form
                           and function of the transit-oriented development.
   LUT 49.4                Encourage new commercial development to accommodate a broad range of
                           uses that serve the needs of adjacent residents, promote neighborhood
                           activity, and are compatible with adjacent neighborhoods.

              that include pedestrian-oriented plazas, benches, other streetscape amenities
              and, where appropriate, landscaped play areas.
Intensity/Height
LUT 49.11     Establish locations within Focus Areas where the permitted heights and
              densities are greater than in locations adjacent to single-family areas.
LUT 49.12     Establish standards for transitions in building height that respond to public
              view corridors and proximity to single-family areas.
LUT 49.13     Limit high-rise development to the two transit-oriented mixed use areas near
              the E Street and H Street transit stations, subject to the provisions of the LUT
              Section 7.2 in the Land Use and Transportation Element.
LUT 49.14     Conduct a special study to examine the potential for higher land use
              intensities and taller buildings along the H Street Transit Focus Corridor
              between Interstate 5 and Fourth Avenue, and that will also address
              compatibility issues with adjacent stable, neighborhoods. The precise
              boundaries will be established at the time of the study, and all land use
              policies within this General Plan shall apply, until modified, as a result of
              study findings and appropriate amendments to this Plan. (Also see LUT 2.6.)

   9.5.1 Downtown Third Avenue District
   Description of District
   The Downtown Third Avenue District is in the core area of Chula Vista, where retail, office and
   civic activities are located in the traditional northern Third Avenue business district. These older
   buildings also have some residences on the second stories. The Downtown Third Avenue District
   is generally defined on the north by E Street, on the south by H Street, on the east by Second
   Avenue, and on the west by Fourth Avenue (Figure 5-28).
                                              Existing Conditions
                                              The Downtown Third Avenue District is characterized by the
                                              traditional Third Avenue business district consisting of shops
                                              and offices and wide sidewalks along Third Avenue, as well as
                                              smaller residential housing units in surrounding streets.
                                              Several civic facilities are located within a “Civic Focus Area”
                                              near the Civic Center complex in the Downtown Third Avenue
                                              District, including the central library, the police headquarters,
                                              the fire headquarters and City Hall.
   Vision for District
   The Downtown Third Avenue District is an exciting urban enclave with restaurants; evening
   entertainment; unique shops; and a cultural arts emphasis. Its urban residential neighborhood
   environment is served by several parks and open space features that create a special identity as
   the centerpiece of the City. A network of pedestrian paths links parks, urban plazas, and the
   Civic Center complex to a new pedestrian-oriented promenade extending along F Street between
   the Downtown Third Avenue District and the Bayfront.
   Third Avenue between E and G Streets remains a pedestrian-scaled area of specialty shops,
   services, and restaurants; however, small offices and multi-family housing have redeveloped
   above the retail uses, adding to the district's vitality. Buildings along Third Avenue's immediate
   street frontage are predominately low-rise to maintain the traditional character, while the mid-rise
   apartments and condominiums behind them are stepped back from the facade. East of Third
   Avenue, building heights are sensitively stepped down to visually blend with the adjacent existing
   residential neighborhood. West of Third Avenue is a higher density residential neighborhood
   with some offices and retail services.

The Civic Center complex surrounding the intersection of Fourth Avenue and F Street is
strengthened through the linking of civic uses by parks, promenades, and local transportation
systems.
Redevelopment of the Downtown Third Avenue District has resulted in mixed land uses (i.e.,
residential, office, and retail), and has retained important traditional aspects, primarily along Third
Avenue and connecting to the Civic Center complex located near the intersection of Fourth
Avenue and F Street.
                                    Objective - LUT 50
Provide for the redevelopment and enhancement of the Downtown Third
Avenue District as a lively, higher density, mixed use area, while
preserving the important elements that contribute to the charm and
character of traditional Third Avenue.

Description of District
The H Street Corridor District consists of H Street and the surrounding area generally bounded by
Broadway and Third Avenue on the west and east, and G and I Streets on the north and south.
The H Street Corridor District has two Focus Areas: the Chula Vista Center Focus Area and the H
Street Office Focus Area (see Figure 5-29), which are discussed separately in Sections 9.5.3 and
9.5.4 of this element.

          2020
   Existing Conditions
   The H Street Corridor District includes the Chula Vista Center shopping mall; medical facilities;
   South County Regional Complex; offices; commercial businesses; and some residential.
   Vision for District
   The H Street Corridor District connects the H Street gateway and Broadway commercial corridor
   with downtown Third Avenue, and includes a mixed use area with offices, shopping, and multi-
   family housing in a high-intensity, transit-oriented development pattern near the Third Avenue
   transit station. A redeveloped Chula Vista Center shopping mall includes some high-density
   residential housing, substantial office space, and a transit station.
                                                  H Street functions as a multi-modal boulevard and
                                                  major circulation route, linking eastern Chula Vista to
                                                  the west. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) links the H Street
                                                  trolley station to communities in the east, with two BRT
                                                  stops on H Street providing convenient transit access
                                                  for commuters, shoppers, and residents. In addition to
                                                  an active commuter hub, the Third Avenue and H
                                                  Street transit station area functions as a landmark
                                                  architectural entry statement for an active downtown
                                                  mixed use district. Building heights within the H Street
                                                  Corridor include low-rise and mid-rise.
   This will be important with H Street emerging as a transit corridor and major link between the
   Bayfront, Broadway and Downtown; and the existence of major activity nodes like the Chula Vista
   Center, medical facilities at Scripps, and the South County Regional Center. A special study to
   evaluate the potential for increased land use intensities and taller building forms will be
   conducted subsequent to adoption of this plan (see Section 7.2 and Figure 5-18).

          2020
   Existing Conditions
   The Chula Vista Center, located on the south side of H Street, is a regional shopping mall with
   approximately 878,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, and is surrounded by large parking
   areas typical of suburban shopping malls. On the north side of H Street is the Scripps Medical
   Center, a large parking lot, and various small commercial businesses on shallow depth lots
   fronting H Street. North of H Street are some residences, the Vista Square Elementary School, and
   Chula Vista Middle School.
   Visions for Focus Area
   South of H Street - A Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) station is located on H Street in the vicinity of Fifth
   Avenue, adjacent to a comprehensive redeveloped Chula Vista Center. Large-scale retail
   businesses have, over time, relocated to the west of Broadway and south of H Street, within the H
   Street Gateway Focus Area, creating a regional shopping center with exposure to Interstate 5 and
   easy access from H Street. Under this scenario, the land currently occupied by Chula Vista Center
   redevelops into a mixed-use area consisting of smaller scale local-serving retail shops, high-
   density residential housing, offices, and a large cultural arts facility and large public plaza/park
   near Broadway. This bold vision requires acquisition of substantial existing retail and residential
   properties in the H Street Gateway Focus Area, as well as the relocation of Chula Vista Center.
   Should this vision not materialize over time, it is envisioned that the Chula Vista Center would
   continue to function as a regional shopping mall, but would become a more vibrant mixed use
   area with added retail and office space along Broadway and H Street to complement existing
   retail uses, and multi-family residential housing, mainly along the I Street frontage. Building
   heights on the south side of H Street will be primarily low-rise with some mid-rise buildings under
   either scenario.
   North of H Street - The area north of H Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenue consists of
   commercial mixed use, primarily ground floor retail with some offices. This segment has been
   redeveloped into retail/office mixed use, requiring expanding lot depths to include a strip of
   existing properties along the south side of Otis Street. North of Otis Street, extending to G Street,
   residential density is increased to provide additional multi-family housing.
   Between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, also north of H Street, substantial office space is expanded.
   This reinforces past land uses and takes advantage of the BRT to connect this employment center
   to housing areas in the west and east. Building heights within Chula Vista Center Focus Area
   north of H Street are low-rise, with some mid-rise buildings.
   Between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, also north of H Street, substantial office space is expanded.
   This reinforces past land uses and takes advantage of the BRT to connect this employment center
   to housing areas in the west and east. Building heights within Chula Vista Center Focus Area
   north of H Street are low-rise, with some mid-rise buildings.

                            Objective - LUT 52
Encourage redevelopment of the Chula Vista Center, as well as properties
north of H Street, with a mix of land uses that will reinforce H Street as a
future planned transit boulevard and gateway corridor, and establish the
area as a significant public gathering space and vibrant mixed use area.

   9.5.5        Interstate 5 Corridor District
   Description of District
   The Interstate 5 Corridor District encompasses the area between Broadway and Interstate 5 from
   C Street on the north, to I Street on the south, as shown on Figure 5-26, Northwest Planning Area
   Urban Core Subarea Planning Districts, it is divided into four Focus Areas, including North
   Broadway, E Street Visitor, Harbor View, and H Street Gateway. Descriptions and policies for the
   overall District and each of these Focus Areas are stated below.
   Existing Conditions
   The Interstate 5 Corridor District is characterized by low-rise,
   multi-family housing extending from C to I Streets; mobile
   home parks between F and G Streets; three roadway
   connections to the Bayfront (E, F and H Streets); a lack of
   accessible park facilities; and poor pedestrian connectivity
   crossing Interstate 5 to the Bayfront or to Broadway.

Vision for District
This area has been redeveloped as a major mixed use district, with higher-density, urban-type
residential in mixed use development within one quarter mile of the E and H Street trolley
stations; increased neighborhood-serving commercial and some multi-family housing on
Broadway; and visitor-serving uses at select nodes. The lower-density mobile home parks have
been redeveloped with higher intensity housing types. A pedestrian-oriented F Street Promenade
links the district to the Bayfront and to the Downtown Third Avenue District. Major links between
the Urban Core and Bayfront land uses provide complementary services and economies, as well
as recreational amenities for visitors and residents alike, thereby creating new vitality and
interaction. Visitors to the City traveling along Interstate 5 can identify primary gateways into the
City and Bayfront from afar through the identifiable presence of some high-rise structures near
the freeway.
9.5.6        North Broadway Focus Area
Description of Focus Area
The North Broadway Focus Area (Figure 5-30) consists of both sides of Broadway between C and
E Streets.
Existing Conditions
The North Broadway Focus Area is characterized by a variety of different land uses, including
automotive-related businesses; restaurants; bars; and shops. This portion of the Interstate 5
Corridor District serves as a prominent secondary gateway for visitors from National City to the
north, and provides limited access to State Route 54.
Vision for Focus Area
The North Broadway Focus Area has been redeveloped with primarily local-serving ground floor
retail and higher-density residential units in a mixed use arrangement. Retail uses serve the
adjacent residential neighborhoods, as well as the new residential units. Automotive uses have
been transitioned out of this primarily retail segment of Broadway and replaced with residential
units. Building heights for the North Broadway District are primarily low-rise.

Vision for Focus Area
The E Street Visitor Focus Area is one of the three Transit Focus Areas (TFA) within the Urban Core,
and is characterized by more intensive development surrounding the transit station. Land uses on
the north side of E Street near Interstate 5 include visitor-serving uses (e.g., restaurants,
hotels/motels, service stations, etc.). The area further north, also adjacent to Interstate 5, includes
high-density, low-rise, multi-family development taking advantage of excellent views towards the
Bayfront and the San Diego Bay. Visitor-serving land uses are on all four quadrants of the
intersection of E Street and Broadway. The south side of E Street, where the trolley station is
located, has transit focus mixed uses, including residential units, offices, and ground floor retail.
Building heights for this focus area are primarily mid-rise, with some high-rise.
To ensure an appropriate urban form for the higher density and intensity of development at this
important gateway and visitor activity area, the following outcomes should be achieved through
development within that area:
         !  Function as a major entryway and gateway to the City through the use of unique
            architecture, landscaping and monumentation that symbolizes Chula Vista, and
            creates a strong sense of arrival for both residents and visitors.
         !  The intensity and density of development encouraged within this focus area must be
            supported by enhanced public benefits and amenities (i.e., plazas; fountains; public
            areas; extensive streetscape improvements, etc.) which should acknowledge use by
            both residents and visitors.
         !  Building and streetscape design support transit and emphasize features that provide
            opportunities to easily access transit and minimize the use of private vehicles.
         !  Transit-oriented design that focuses on pedestrians, and linkages to both the Bayfront
            and the F Street promenade, is particularly important given the existing San Diego
            trolley station, and the fact that a revitalized Interstate 5 Corridor District will increase
            the demand for transit at the E Street gateway. Designs must also take into
            consideration and promote grade separation of the trolley line for improved
            circulation for pedestrians and vehicles.
         !  The urban form and regulatory standards for this area as established through the
            Urban Core Specific Plan or other zoning actions, will achieve the above in
            consideration of the context of areas surrounding the TFA.

   Existing Conditions
   This Harbor View Focus Area is a mix of generally low-rise commercial businesses in a strip
   commercial arrangement, including several auto service and repair shops and discount furniture
   shops.
   Vision for Focus Area
   The Harbor View Focus Area is primarily a higher density residential area, which is compatible
   with and supported by mixed uses along Broadway. Located within one-quarter mile of the E
   Street and H Street trolley stations, the area offers excellent opportunities for transit-oriented
   development west of Broadway, and is near major shopping and employment centers in the
   Urban Core Subarea. Broadway is a mixed use area, primarily retail, with some higher density
   multi-family housing. Broadway is also an active entertainment area that provides services for
   nearby high-density residential neighborhoods and for visitor needs, such as hotels/motels and
   restaurants. Building heights for this district are primarily low-rise, with some mid-rise
   development between Broadway and Interstate 5.
                                       Objective - LUT 56
   Encourage redevelopment of the area between Interstate 5 and
   Broadway, bounded on the north by F Street and on the south by G

9.5.9         H Street Gateway Focus Area
Description of Focus Area
The H Street Gateway Focus Area (Figure 5-33) consists of the area along both sides of H Street
from Interstate 5 to Broadway, extending north to G Street and south to I Street. The Focus Area
also includes the west side of the Broadway frontage.
Existing Conditions
                                    This area is a mixture of generally low-rise commercial
                                    businesses fronting H Street and Broadway. The H Street trolley
                                    station is at the northeast corner of Interstate 5 and H Street.
                                    Primarily multi-family housing exists north of the H Street
                                    frontage to G Street, and single-family residential units exist south
                                    of the H Street frontage to I Street. H Street is currently four lanes,
                                    but will need to be widened to accommodate vehicles, transit and
                                    pedestrians.
Vision for Focus Area
The H Street Gateway Focus Area (Figure 5-33) is one of the three Transit Focus Areas (TFA)
within the Urban Core, and is characterized by more intensive development surrounding the
transit station. It serves as a particularly important major gateway to western Chula Vista and the
Bayfront area from Interstate 5. It also functions as a major transportation corridor and hub
where key east/west Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service intersects with major north/south routes at
the H Street Trolley Station. Land uses on the north side of H Street near Interstate 5, where the
trolley station is located, are characterized by high-intensity transit focus mixed uses, including
higher density residential units, offices, and ground floor retail. Visitor-serving land uses are in the
westerly quadrants of H Street and Broadway. Building heights for this Focus Area are primarily
mid-rise, with some high-rise closer to Interstate 5. H Street is a transit boulevard incorporating
BRT facilities in its design. In addition, H Street functions as a pedestrian route linking the Urban
Core Subarea with the Bayfront.
The south side of H Street, extending from Interstate 5 to Broadway, and south to I Street, is
redeveloped as a regional shopping center that either replaces or complements the Chula Vista
Center, provided that existing retail and residential properties are acquired for this purpose.
Under this scenario the regional center is enhanced by better exposure and freeway access, and
improved circulation along H Street provided by a reduced number of controlled access points.
                                                                                      Page LUT-209

          2020
   The regional center is complementary to Bayfront uses west of Interstate 5, and accessible to and
   from the H Street Trolley Station. Building heights for the area south of H Street are primarily mid-
   rise, with some high-rise focused closer to Interstate 5 and H Street. Residential neighborhoods
   south of I Street and the existing elementary school have been sufficiently buffered from the
   regional center.
   If existing retail and residential properties in this location are not acquired for purposes of
   creating a new regional shopping center, then the H Street Gateway Focus Area, south of H Street
   and west of Broadway, will redevelop as a transit focus mixed use area with higher density
   residential housing, offices, and ground floor retail uses located closer to H Street within walking
   distance of the H Street Trolley Station.
   To ensure an appropriate urban form for the higher density and intensity of development at this
   important gateway, visitor and transit hub, the following outcomes should be achieved through
   development within that area:
             !   Function as a major entryway and gateway to the City through the use of unique
                 architecture, landscaping and monumentation that symbolizes Chula Vista, and
                 creates a strong sense of arrival for both residents and visitors.
             !   The intensity and density of development encouraged within this focus area must be
                 supported by enhanced public benefits and amenities (i.e., plazas; fountains; public
                 areas; extensive streetscape, and landscape improvements, etc.), which signify H Street
                 as an important gateway, and acknowledge use by both residents and visitors.
                 Particular attention should be given to deck improvements over Interstate 5 in
                 creating an inviting pedestrian-friendly crossing to the Bayfront.
             !   Building and streetscape design must support transit and emphasize features that
                 provide opportunities to easily access transit.
             !   Transit-oriented design that focuses on pedestrians, and linkages to both the Bayfront
                 and easterly along H Street to Chula Vista Center and downtown Third Avenue is
                 particularly important to creating continuity for this major corridor. Designs must also
                 take into consideration and promote grade separation of the trolley line for improved
                 circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles.
             !   The urban form and regulatory standards for this area, as established through the
                 Urban Core Specific Plan or other zoning actions, shall achieve the above in
                 consideration of the context of areas surrounding the TFA.

   The Mid-Broadway District (Figure 5-34) consists of several blocks of Broadway frontage located
   between I Street and L Street.
   Existing Conditions
   The Mid-Broadway District consists mainly of retail establishments.
   Vision for District
   The Mid-Broadway District is a mixed use area, with primarily local-serving ground floor retail
   and higher density residential units. Retail uses serve the adjacent residential neighborhoods, as
   well as the new housing. In the redevelopment process, automotive uses were transitioned out
   of the area, and housing was added to an area that was primarily retail in character. Building
   heights for the Mid-Broadway District are primarily low-rise.

10.0                   EAST AREA PLAN
    'HVFULSWLRQ6HWWLQJ
   The East Planning Area predominately consists of master planned
   communities in various stages of development, and of open space.             The City of Chula
   The area is generally bounded on the west by Interstate 805; on the          Vista and San
   north by State Route 54 and the Sweetwater River Valley, where the           Diego County
   City's corporate and Sphere of Influence boundaries lie; on the              jointly planned
   northeast and east by Highway 94, within unincorporated San Diego            Chula Vista’s
   County, near the communities of Jamul and Dulzura in the San
   Miguel Mountain/Proctor Valley area; and on the south within and
                                                                                largest master
   adjacent to the boundaries designated by the General Development             planned
   Plan of the Otay Ranch master planned community. The East                    community, Otay
   Planning Area also includes areas within the City of San Diego and           Ranch.
   unincorporated areas of San Diego County, that, for the most part,
   are expected to remain within County jurisdiction. How these
   unincorporated areas are treated in relation to the City of Chula Vista is discussed within this
   General Plan.
   Significant open space lands within the East Planning Area that are outside of the designated
   villages, planning subareas, or other areas intended for development are to be preserved under
   the Otay Ranch Resource Management Plan and the Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP)
   Subarea Plan. Refer to the Environmental Element of this General Plan for identification and
   discussion of these areas.
   The City of Chula Vista and San Diego County jointly planned Chula Vista's largest master
   planned community, Otay Ranch, which consists of 23,000 acres that were annexed from the
   County. In October 1993, the Chula Vista City Council approved a General Development Plan
   (GDP), and the San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved a Subregional Plan (SRP) for
   Otay Ranch.
    6XEDUHDVDQG'LVWULFWV
   The East Planning Area consists of six subareas. The list below indentifies each subarea and the
   section of this chapter that addresses their policies. (Figure 5-36, East Planning Area Subareas,
   shows the location of each subarea.)

Balanced community is generally defined as one that maintains a high quality of life for its
residents through the provision of a range of land uses and facilities. A balanced community
typically has a strong sense of community, a vigorous economy, and a healthy environment. A
community is most stable when these three aspects are pursued together, rather than
independently, so that one goal does not come at the expense of
another -- for instance, the environment is sacrificed for jobs, or
community stability is sacrificed for economic growth. Balanced              Each of the master
communities look to provide a variety of housing choices to respond planned
to varying needs; offer employment opportunities; and provide for            communities has
the commercial, social and recreational needs of residents. Building         an adopted GDP
sustainable communities that conserve limited resources is an                that establishes
important element of maintaining quality of life for residents of
Chula Vista.

Since the mid-1970s, thousands of acres of formerly undeveloped              parameters.
land in the East Planning Area have been transformed into six
master planned communities consisting of housing; office parks;
local and regional commercial centers; schools; and churches. The communities have a variety
of building styles; floor plans; lot sizes; and pricing options. They also include extensive open
space, both passive and active, for recreational amenities such as lakes; golf courses; parks; bike
paths; and jogging trails. See Figure 5-41, for Master Planned Communities Subareas, areas with
master planned communities.
Each of the master planned communities has an adopted General Development Plan (GDP) that
establishes general development parameters, including the distribution of land uses; vehicular
circulation pattern; development densities; and an overall urban structure. The GDP is
implemented by the adoption of Sectional Planning Area (SPA) Plans, which provide zoning
regulations and design standards. Both the SPA and GDP must be adopted by City Council prior
to the start of development.
The Otay Ranch Master Planned Community is the only one of the six master planned
communities that is still in the process of creating SPA Plans for future development. The
remaining master planned areas are either built out or near complete construction.

   There are various activity centers, either existing or planned, in the East Planning Area, and each
   serves a unique purpose in providing services and amenities, helping to create a balanced
   community. The activity centers are listed below and shown on Figure 5-38.

            !     University and Adjacent Shopping Town Center
   Within the East Planning Area, there needs to be improved
   connections between commercial, residential, and
   employment areas; and educational facilities, such as
   Southwestern College and the future university. They
   should be well-integrated with their surrounding
   neighborhoods (as appropriate to their use); conveniently
   reached from adjacent villages; and well connected to each
   other. It is important that these activity centers be easily
   reached by vehicles; public transit; bicycles; and walking,
   both within the East Planning Area, and to other parts of
   the City, particularly west of Interstate 805. (This topic is
   more broadly addressed in Section 7.7 Linking Chula Vista
   Internally and to the Region of this element.)
   The Bayfront and downtown Chula Vista are the original heart of the City. With the creation of
   numerous master planned communities in eastern Chula Vista, there has been a feeling of
   separation between the older, established communities in western Chula Vista, and the newer
   communities in the East Planning Area, as if they were two separate cities. Bridging this gap is
   essential in creating balance, connection, and unity within the City.
   To achieve this vision of more integrated communities that provide both livability and accessibility,
   the following strategies should be employed:
            !    Create compact and balanced communities;
            !    Create a greater mix and intensity of land uses;
            !    Implement an integrated transportation network;
            !    Establish pedestrian-friendly development standards; and
            !    Create incentives to reduce driving.

   As the East Planning Area continues to develop, the City of Chula Vista intends to create a
   balanced community, including a variety of housing types and neighborhoods; employment
   opportunities in light industrial and commercial businesses; the full range of community facilities
   and services; and a multi-modal circulation system that accommodates vehicles and mass
   transit, while also providing for bikes and pedestrians. An important component of this balanced
   community will be the approximately 265-acre Eastern Urban Center (EUC), a Focus Aarea that is
   part of the Eastern University District. The EUC is intended to be the urban core for the Otay
   Ranch planned community and consist of urban core residential density and a range of
   integrated mixed use, retail and office commercial, cultural, entertainment, and public uses. It is
   intended to attract residents of the East Planning Area and the surrounding region, drawing

As Chula Vista's population continues to grow, demand for a facility for higher education will
increase. Locating a higher education facility within the City, such as a multi-institutional
university center or a traditional college or university, would substantially increase the opportunity
for residents to obtain a college education and benefit from continuing education programs.
Cultural opportunities for Chula Vista's residents would also be enhanced by the cultural arts and
literature programs typically associated with higher education facilities. See additional policies in
Section 10.5.4, Eastern University District, of this element, and also Chapter 6, the Economic
Development Element, of this General Plan.

   Planned communities within the East Planning Area, particularly those in the Otay Ranch
   Subarea, have been developed in a manner that preserves natural resources; links natural areas
   and development areas by a system of trails and pathways; and provides a system of regional,
   community, and local parks. This will continue.
   A key component of the East Planning Area's open space system is the 11,000-acre Otay Ranch
   Open Space Preserve, which is intended to preserve natural animal and plant communities as
   part of the City's Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP). The Preserve also establishes a
   major portion of the Chula Vista Greenbelt, a continuous open space trail and park system
   around the perimeter of the City. This integrated open space system is provided in the land use
   plan for the East Planning Area by application of appropriate land use designations and policies.

Description of Subarea
The Unincorporated Sweetwater Subarea is generally located between State Route 54 and the
Sweetwater Reservoir on the north and Bonita Road on the south, within an unincorporated area
of the County of San Diego. The neighborhoods of Bonita and Sunnyside are located within this
Subarea. Figure 5-39 shows the boundaries of the Unincorporated Sweetwater Subarea.
Existing Conditions
                                  The Unincorporated Sweetwater Area is composed of primarily
                                  stable, well-maintained single-family neighborhoods; limited
                                  supporting retail commercial; and substantial open space,
                                  including the Sweetwater Regional Park. The Area has been
                                  within the City's General Plan Area and Sphere of Influence for
                                  over 20 years. The Sweetwater Area and Chula Vista are tied
                                  through naturally supportive infrastructure and services, and the
                                  actions of each have an influence upon the other.
As a largely developed community, the general current desire of residents and property owners is
to remain unincorporated. At present, guiding land use and other General Plan policies for the
Area are contained within San Diego County's General Plan and the County's Sweetwater
Community Plan. It is the City's intent to reflect the County's plans through corresponding Chula
Vista General Plan designations.
Vision for Subarea
The Sweetwater Subarea continues to be an area of well-maintained, single-family residential
neighborhoods that are compatible with and complement adjacent neighborhoods.

   Existing Conditions
   Both the San Ysidro Mountain and the Proctor Valley Districts have relatively rugged topography
   of mountains, low hills, mesas, and many canyons and ridgelines. Each District contains
   important biological habitat and natural, scenic beauty. A major portion of these environmentally
   sensitive lands is included in the Otay Ranch Preserve. Due to the Subarea's environmentally
   sensitive nature, rugged topography, and scenic viewsheds, San Diego County's Otay Subregional
   Plan designates most of it for either low density, estate-residential development, or open space.
                                         For most of these lands, the level of development will not require
                                         extension of City services, nor annexation to the City. Since the
                                         completion of the County Multiple Species Conservation Program
                                         (MSCP) Subarea Plan and the approval of the Chula Vista MSCP
                                         Subarea Plan, several areas within the unincorporated County
                                         portion of the Otay Ranch (north and south of the Otay Reservoir)
                                         have been acquired by public/quasi-public agencies to be
                                         preserved as permanent open space. These areas are depicted
                                         on the General Plan Diagram (Figure 5-12).
   Vision for Subarea
   Development within this Subarea is carefully planned. It has lower intensity development that is
   carefully sited to preserve and protect its sensitive natural habitat communities; prominent
   hillsides/ridgelines; and scenic viewsheds. The area located north of Lower Otay Reservoir and
   along Otay Lakes Road, identified as the Resort Focus Area, has more intense resort and
   residential uses, as shown on the County's Otay Subregional Plan. Development of the Resort
   Focus Area may require City services to be extended to the site.

Although Otay Ranch is its own Subarea (as discussed in Section 10.4.6), Otay Ranch Villages
One, One West, Five, Six and Eleven are included in the Master Planned Communities Subarea
for this General Plan because these villages are either substantially built out and/or planning
efforts for them are nearly completed.
Existing Conditions
Several master planned communities have been approved and
constructed in the East Planning Area, and each has a set of
documents to guide and regulate development. These
documents include a General Development Plan (GDP) that
sets the goals, objectives and policies; Sectional Planning Area
(SPA) Plans that address land use, circulation, public facilities,
open space, and design guidelines; and the associated Planned
Community (PC) District Regulations that include specific
development regulations. A GDP may provide regulations for
more than one master planned community, but SPA Plans and
their regulations are unique to each master planned community.
Vision for Subarea
The Master Planned Communities Subarea comprises unique, stable, and desirable planned
communities, as envisioned by the goals, objectives, and policies for each of the communities
contained within adopted plans and implemented by application of the Planned Community
District regulations.
                                  Objective - LUT 69

   Description of Subarea
   The East Main Street Subarea (Figure 5-42) consists of
   approximately 1,800 acres located in the southwest corner
   of the East Planning Area. It is located east of Interstate
   805 and south and west of the planned villages in the
   Otay Ranch Subarea. It includes the Otay Landfill and
   the Otay River Valley. A portion of the area is outside
   Chula Vista's city limits in the City of San Diego. The East
   Main Street Subarea is named for the eastern portion of
   Main Street, which is a major east-west circulation road
   that originates at Interstate 5, passes through the
   Southwest Planning Area, crosses Interstate 805 into the
   East Planning Area, and eventually connects to Heritage
   Road in the vicinity of the Coors Amphitheater.
   Existing Conditions
   The East Main Street Subarea consists of separate areas along and adjacent to the Otay River
   Valley. Land uses are varied and include single-family neighborhoods along Brandywine Avenue;
   entertainment sites, such as the Coors Amphitheater and Knott’s Soak City water park; the Otay
   Landfill; an auto park; and several auto-wrecking yards.
   Vision for Subarea
   The East Main Street Subarea is a mix of residential and
   commercial uses, carefully planned and developed such that           Expansion of the auto
   land use conflicts are avoided and the desirability of               dealerships along Main
   neighborhoods and businesses is enhanced. Expansion of               Street is encouraged,
   the auto dealerships along Main Street is encouraged, as are         as are some additional
   some additional commercial uses that support the existing            commercial uses that

villages and planning areas in various stages of planning. Four             mixed use and
villages within the Otay Ranch are either developed or are sufficiently     medium-high

continue to play in the planning for the area, many of the terms,
concepts and other identifying components from the GDP are utilized
in the text and mapping of this Subarea. Some of these terms and concepts are unique to the
Otay Ranch GDP and are not found in the other Area Plans or the Districts in the East Area.
The Otay Ranch was jointly planned by the City of Chula Vista
and San Diego County. Overall guidance is provided by the
City's General Development Plan (GDP) and the County's
Subregional Plan (SRP). These documents were approved in
October 1993 by the Chula Vista City Council and the San Diego
County Board of Supervisors. The City's GDP is periodically
revised and updated to maintain consistency with the City's
General Plan.
Existing Conditions
The villages of the Otay Ranch Subarea are currently in various stages of development. Some
villages are substantially built and, therefore, have been included in the Master Planned
Communities Subarea. Other villages are either just beginning planning studies or have
sufficient planning activities remaining to benefit from specific policy guidance from the General
Plan.
The heart or center of the villages within Otay Ranch are the Village Cores. Village Cores have
mixed use and medium-high residential land use categories, and serve as the focal point and
commercial hub of the overall village. They are centered around a main street or plaza and
include retail/commercial; residential; neighborhood parks; and other civic or community uses.

   Vision for Subarea
   Otay Ranch is comprised of villages that integrate neighborhoods, shops and employment
   opportunities with parks, schools, and other civic facilities that create a community with a shared
   sense of pride and place. Neighborhoods are designed to encourage community interaction.
   Development is clustered in villages with varying character and density, interrelated, yet distinct in
   identity and style. A high intensity mixed use urban center (the Eastern Urban Center) provides a
   unique functional and symbolic center for Otay Ranch. A range of transportation alternatives to
   the automobile is provided, most notably transit and a pedestrian/bicycle network. Offices and
   commercial development are located near transit stations. Streets, plazas, and buildings are
   designed to complement human, rather than vehicular activity.
   A comprehensive open space preserve exists and the importance of landform preservation and
   environmental design have promoted environmentally sensitive communities.
   In addition to the Village Cores, which provide central areas of more intense uses, Town Centers
   have been established in several villages of Otay Ranch. Planned with the same mixed use and
   mobility characteristics as Village Cores, they provide for even more intense land use, such as
   higher residential density, and more office, retail, and other commercial uses. They also utilize a
   more extensive grid street system, which promotes pedestrian circulation and allows for more
   efficient integration of transit, pedestrian, and automobile traffic. Town Centers include a Town
   Center Arterial roadway, designed to accommodate pedestrian-oriented development based upon
   higher residential densities. Town Centers also include transit stations within a one one-quarter
   mile radius, to serve the high density residential in and around the Town Centers.

   Description of District
   The Western District is located at the west end of the Otay Ranch Subarea and includes Villages
   Two, Two West, and Three of the Otay Ranch GDP (Figure 5-43). The District's major features
   are the Village Two and Three Village Cores, and the Village Three industrial/business park..
   Existing Conditions
   The Western District surrounds the Otay Landfill on three sides, and extends to Olympic Parkway
   on the north, the planned La Media Road and existing Wolf Canyon to the east, and the Otay
   Valley to the south. The district is mostly vacant, with only a fire station and Otay Ranch High
   School currently existing. The District is being planned and implemented in accordance with the
   objectives and policies of this General Plan and the Otay Ranch's GDP.
   Vision for District
   The villages in the District, are pedestrian-oriented communities that include a variety of land
   uses and large Village Cores. The Village Two and Three cores are larger and more intense
   than the typical Village Core in Otay Ranch, but are not as intensely developed as the Town
   Centers found in several other villages. Residential density and the intensity of uses transition
   to lower densities and intensitites as they approach open space areas located in Poggi and
   Wolf Canyons. A separate, smaller neighborhood-serving commercial area is also located in
   Village Two, providing services to nearby village residents.
   The southwest portion of Village Two West and northern portion of Village Three serves as a
   transition area between the Otay Landfill and the residential areas within the balance of the
   Villages by providing industrial uses that buffer the landfill from residential development. It
   also provides a planned extension of industrial uses from the Sunbow master planned
   industrial community to the west.
   The third village in the District, Village Three, also serves as a transitional buffer between the
   landfill and adjacent open space areas, and residential development areas.

Description of District
The Central District of the Otay Ranch Subarea is centered at the planned intersection of Main
Street with La Media Road (Figure 5-44). It is comprised of Villages Four, Seven and Eight of
the Otay Ranch General Development Plan (GDP).
Existing Conditions
This District is being planned and implemented in accordance with the objectives and policies of
this General Plan and the Otay Ranch's GDP.
Vision for District
The District has a mixture of land uses and intensities that includes a large community park; a
pedestrian-oriented mixed use town center; single-family and multi-family residential uses
surrounding a typical Village Core; and a middle school. The large community park provides
                                                                                   Page LUT-257

   along Main Street have expansive views of Wolf Canyon, Rock Mountain, and the Otay Valley.
   Development in the Rock Mountain area is sensitively situated to preserve significant viewsheds
   and topographic features. A pedestrian-oriented Town Center, with transit services and Town
   Center Arterials in the form of couplets or other pedestrian-oriented arterial street design, is
   located along portions of La Media Road and Main Street, where Villages Four, Seven, and Eight
   meet.
                                       Objective - LUT 81
   Develop a higher density, mixed use, transit-oriented town center
   positioned on the intersection of Main Street and La Media Road,
   surrounded by lower intensity residential use and a large community
   park, that preserves Rock Mountain as an important landform and visual

    Description of District
    The Otay Valley District is comprised of three parcels along the Otay Valley in the southerly
    portion of the Otay Ranch. The parcels are separated by the open space lands that surround
    each parcel (See Figure 5-45).
    Existing Conditions
    The District consists primarily of undeveloped, relatively flat land on both sides of the Otay River,
    and a topographically constrained site, located on the south side of the Otay Valley, east of
    Heritage Road, and adjacent to the City of San Diego jurisdiction on Otay Mesa. A portion of this
    site has been used for industrial activities. Much of the District's land is within the Open Space
    Preserve in Chula Vista's Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) Subarea Plan. The
    MSCP has identified certain areas as potential locations for active recreation uses. Refer to
    Chapter 9, the Environmental Element, of this General Plan, for policies intended to preserve
    sensitive resources in and near these areas by limiting the location, type, and character of
    development.

A portion of the District's lands was previously used for a gun club. Consequently, lead
contamination from bullet slugs is a concern for any planned future use, due to potential water
quality degradation to the adjacent Otay River and/or human exposure. Thorough testing,
evaluation, and remediation (if required) of potential lead contamination will be required.
Vision for District
Active recreation uses are located on properties adjacent to the Otay River that were identified as
suitable sites for such uses by the City's MSCP Subarea Plan.
                                  Objective - LUT 84
Designate and allow for appropriate and carefully planned land uses
that provide additional recreational activities, both public and private,
and entertainment and supporting commercial activities that do not
threaten the viability of sensitive biological habitats or the Otay Valley's
function as a key component of the Otay Ranch Preserve.

   Description of District
   The Eastern University District consists of approximately 1,200 acres in five Focus Areas:
   University Focus Area; Comprising of a University Campus and a Regional Technology Park;
   University Village; Village Ten: Eastern Urban Center; and Freeway Commercial, aligned
   north-south along State Route 125, a major transportation corridor. (See Figure 5-46)
   Existing Conditions
   The majority of the Eastern University District's five Focus Areas are vacant, undeveloped, and in
   various stages of planning. The Freeway Commercial (Otay Ranch Town Center) focus area is
   mostly developed. State Route 125 forms the western edge of the district.
   Vision for District
   The Eastern University District serves as the urban center for        The Eastern Urban
   the East Planning Area, and also serves much of the inland
                                                                         Center (EUC) is the
   south San Diego County region. This District provides needed,
   higher value employment opportunities along business and              vibrant urban hub of the
   commercial services; cultural and entertainment services; and         Otay Ranch, providing
   a university campus and related support uses. As a regional-          regional services and
   serving center, residential development is at a greater scale,        commercial and
   intensity, and density than the surrounding villages and Town         residential uses to the
   Centers located throughout Otay Ranch.                                area.
   The District's five Focus Areas have strong relationships to
   each other and are connected by compatible, mutually supportive land uses, circulation, and
   urban form. The District is linked together and supported by a rapid transit system.
   The University Focus Area, is comprised of the university campus and a regional technology park.
   The university campus can be a multi-institutional university center or traditional university. The
   Regional Technology Park is a large, master-planned business park, providing research and high-
   tech manufacturing industries, arranged in clusters. The RTP capitalizes on the research activities,
   incubator and start-up industries, and skilled labor force resulting from the presence of the
   adjoining university campus. The university helps create additional opportunities for economic
   development and employment through relationships formed between academic research and
   study, research and product development activities, and light industrial/manufacturing uses.

                                                                                    CHAPTER5
The University Village Focus Area is comprised of a university-oriented Town Center of transit-
oriented mixed use, and low-medium to mixed-use residential beyond the Town Center.
Responding to the significant demand the university generates for housing and university-related
commercial services, it provides the housing; retail; cultural; and other commercial services
required by the university. Residential densities have been increased through collaborative
arrangements between private development interests and the university, which encourage higher
residential densities in return for land dedicated for the university campus and its related
facilities.
Village Ten Focus Area is immediately south of the University Focus Area and east of the
University Village Focus Area. It is composed of a mixed use village core surrounded by
Medium density residential. Village Ten compliments the University and Village Nine
Focus Areas, as well as the Eastern Urban Center, by providing housing and residents in
support of the services and retail/commercial uses provided by the adjacent focus areas.
The Eastern Urban Center (EUC) is the vibrant urban hub of the Otay Ranch, providing regional
services and commercial and residential uses to the area. The EUC derives increased vitality and
commercial market demand from the university campus.
The Freeway Commercial Focus Area, while relating to the university much less than the other
Focus Areas in the District, enhances the commercial vitality of the EUC, and also benefits from
increased market demands generated by the presence of the university and the EUC.
University Village Study Area and Strategic Framework Policies
The five Focus Areas of the Eastern University District have an interdependent land use and
physical relationship that require coordinated development policies prior to adoption of any SPA
Plan within the University Focus Area or University Village Focus Area. The Strategic Framework
Policies will consider key relationships between land use, transportation, transit, grading,
backbone infrastructure, and drainage as they pertain to the University Focus Area and the
University Village Focus Area.
The Strategic Framework Policies shall be completed and incorporated into the Otay Ranch
General Development Plan prior to, or in conjunction with the preparation and approval of the
first SPA Plan or similar planning document within the University Focus Area or University Village
Focus Area. The policies shall provide for an orderly and cohesive development pattern for the
University Village Study Area. These coordinated efforts will ensure a synergy between the uses
that will result in interconnected patterns for land uses and facilities. It also ensures that the
detailed design decisions for any of the properties within the area will not unduly affect the
potential development of the adjoining properties. The completion of the Strategic Framework
Policies will allow SPA plans within the Eastern University District that are under multiple
ownership, to be prepared in a coordinated and cohesive manner.
The following objectives and policies recognize the interdependence and important relationships
between the Focus Areas of the Eastern University District, and the need for coordinated
development to enhance the economic and community success and vitality of this District.

   LUT 86.1            Accommodate the coordinated development of four primary land use Focus
                       Areas within the State Route 125 corridor: (1) a region-serving urban center
                       with the highest residential densities and an office/commercial focus; (2) a
                       sub-regional retail/lifestyle center; (3) a higher education institution(s) that
                       make up a multi-institutional university center or a traditional university
                       campus and a research and technology-oriented, light industrial business
                       park; and (4) a Town Center providing university-related retail, service, cultural,
                       and entertainment centers.
   LUT 86.2            Allow for flexibility and adjustments of the designated land use/Focus Area
                       boundaries, and recognize ownership boundaries to: promote the intermixing
                       of uses that support and complement those existing in adjoining Districts
                       and subareas; account for changing market conditions and economic
                       development objectives; and foster the development of a cohesive pattern of

Use & Design
LUT 91.1    Prior to the adoption of a SPA Plan that includes the university site or any
            contiguous area, locate and design the development of university and
            supporting uses and those adjoining areas to achieve a cohesive and
            integrated campus environment, in consideration of the following principles
                !    The campus shall be located in proximity and linked to the Town
                     Center, establishing continuity of urban form; density; street network;
                     pedestrian sidewalks; paths; and landscape. Uses that may be shared
                     by the university and surrounding community should be concentrated
                     along the campus/Town Center edge, such as art galleries; cultural
                     facilities; retail; food service; and similar uses. A permeable edge
                     between the campus and Town Center shall be established.
                !    The campus shall be linked with the transit center established within
                     the Town Center.
                !    Individual research institutes that may be developed with a Multi-
                     Institutional Teaching Center (MITC) or traditional university may be
                     distributed throughout the university site and/or as an interface with
                     the Town Center, Regional Technology Park (RTP), or Eastern Urban
                     Center (EUC). There should be direct physical linkages with the campus
                     core.
                !    The university's uses and buildings shall be linked and unified through
                     a system of plazas/quads; pathways; transportation corridors;
                     recreational areas; and open spaces.
                !    Greenway linkages shall be established between the university campus
                     and surrounding open spaces.
                !    Buildings shall be sited along common sidewalks, pathways, and
                     plazas to stimulate a high level of pedestrian activity.
                !    Parking shall be located on the periphery of the campus core and
                     university campus, to the extent feasible.
LUT 91.2    Permit flexibility in the delineation of the edge between the university and an
            adjacent Town Center to facilitate the mixing of land uses and account for the
            building program established at the time of development, provided that the
            General Plan's concepts of land use relationships, urban form, and community
            character are achieved. General concepts shall be prepared as part of the
                                                                            Page LUT-275

 10.5.5.2 Regional Technology Park
 Vision for Focus Area
 The Regional Technology Park (RTP) portion of the University Focus Area is a large approximate 85-
 acre, master-planned business park oriented to, and accommodating research and high-tech
 manufacturing activities. The RTP integrates manufacturing and research uses with related
 commercial business uses. The design of the RTP accommodates corporate manufacturers that
 require high quality manufacturing and research oriented facilities and workplace amenities. The
 research and manufacturing uses are able to capitalize upon the presence of the university
 research activities, a skilled workforce, and other supporting or related industries located within the
 RTP and in other nearby areas of Otay Ranch, and the broader south County region.
                                      Objective - LUT 92
 Establish a high-quality business park that is oriented to and accommodates
 high technology businesses conducting research and light

Description of Focus Area
The University Village Focus Area is located adjacent to the west of the University Focus Area,
with State Route 125 along its west boundary (see Figure 5-47). It will be strongly identified with
and oriented to the planned university facility and regional technology park.
Existing Conditions
The site is currently vacant and undeveloped. Conceptual planning will be followed by
subsequent GDP and SPA applications.
Vision for Focus Area
The University Village Focus Area includes a university-oriented Town Center of transit-oriented
mixed use, medium-high, medium, and low-medium residential land use designations and
densities. The Town Center residential densities are higher than typically found in Otay Ranch as
a result of the dedication of fifty additional acres for the university campus, which further
facilitates the development of the university and integrates the Town Center with this expanded
university campus as shown on Figure 5-47. As a result, the area is strongly tied to the planned
university campus and regional technology park. It provides housing, retail and other
commercial services, and cultural and entertainment uses that are necessary to support the
university. It incorporates a Town Center generally centered at the intersection of the Town Center
Arterial roadways and a planned transit station.
Residential areas that surround the Town Center and near a university campus maintain a higher
density than other villages typical of the Otay Ranch area in order to respond to the increased
demand for housing to be created by the university campus at the size and location shown on
Figure 5-47. Because of the unique and significant market factors attributable to the university,
demand is strong for land capable of providing residential and non-residential uses, both within
the campus boundary and in adjacent areas
.
                                   Objective - LUT 95
Establish a pedestrian-oriented, mixed use Town Center that serves as
the interface, or common meeting ground, of the university, regional
technology park, and surrounding residential development and serves
the university campus at the size and location shown on the General
Plan as well as the regional technology park work force

Description of Focus Area
The Eastern Urban Center (EUC) is approximately 265 acres, located in the central portion of the
Eastern University District, between the Freeway Commercial and the University Village Focus
Areas (see Figure 5-47). State Route 125 borders the area on the west and other major roadways
either surround the Focus Area or lead directly toward it.
Existing Conditions
The area is currently vacant and undeveloped. Planning for this area is underway, in
conjunction with the planning of adjacent focus areas.
Vision of Focus Area
The EUC is the urban core of eastern Chula Vista and is the most intensely developed of all
areas in the Otay Ranch and east Chula Vista. It is a vibrant hub, integrating high density
residential housing, low-and high-rise office uses, and community and regional-serving
commercial and entertainment uses, providing opportunities for new City-wide and region-wide
functions to be located there. As an urban hub, it is served by a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system
with a centrally located transit station. Surrounding land uses in the adjacent University Village,
the University Campus, Regional Technology Park, and Freeway Commercial Focus Areas relate
closely to the EUC.

   The southerly 85-acre portion of the area (Freeway Commercial South (FC-1) is currently
   developed as a regional shopping mall. The northerly 35-acre portion (Freeway Commercial
   North (FC-2)) is vacant and undeveloped. Planning and engineering for the development of
   the northerly areas is currently underway, following the adoption of a SPA amendment
   application and approval of a tentative map and associated zoning permits authorizing
   construction of hotels, high density residential units, park, and retail commercial in a mixed-
   use format

Vision for Focus Area
This Focus Area provides both local and regional-serving retail commercial and entertainment
uses. These uses are an important component of the Eastern University District's role as the
urban and cultural center for the East Planning Area, as well as serving the surrounding south
San Diego County region. The area's immediate proximity to State Route 125 and other major
streets provides for an automobile orientation, although it is also served by the regional rapid
transit BRT system. High Density/Mixed Use Residential uses in the northerly portion of
this area promote walkability, reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMTs), and decrease traffic
impacts through the pedestrian activation of Town Center Drive and close proximity between
the hotels, park, retail commercial, residential uses, and the adjacent transit.
                                   Objective - LUT 99
Create a retail commercial center that supports the East Planning
Area/Otay Ranch population by providing regional goods and services
that are not accommodated in the residential Village Cores or Town
Centers; functions integrally with the intense, pedestrian-oriented urban
activity of the Eastern Urban Center (EUC) Focus Area; and
accommodates the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system connecting it to other
villages, the Eastern Urban Center (EUC), and the region.

11.0                BAYFRONT
 11.1 Description/Setting
 The Bayfront Planning Area encompasses approximately 2,620
 acres, which includes uplands or filled areas above mean high               The Chula Vista
 tide; and wetlands. The majority of the developed area within                  Bayfront is
 the Bayfront Planning Area currently consists of industrial and             envisioned as a
 commercial uses. The remainder of the uplands is underutilized                world-class
 and either vacant or used for smaller industrial warehouse and           Bayfrfont to benefit
 commercial purposes. The existing development consists of low-
                                                                             all citizens and
 rise buildings and open parking areas
                                                                              visitors to the
                                                                                   region.
 Planning for the Bayfront Area is a multi-tiered effort that requires inter-jurisdictional cooperation
 with the State of California and the San Diego Unified Port District. The State of California
 Coastal Commission guides development within the Chula Vista Bayfront coastal zone area
 throughThe California Coastal Act Local Coastal Program (Chula Vista LCP). The Chula Vista LCP
 provides a detailed land use plan for the orderly growth, development, redevelopment, and
 conservation of resources. The Chula Vista LCP has been certified by the State Coastal
 Commission and adopted by ordinance in the Chula Vista Municipal Code. The San Diego
 Unified Port District (Port District) manages and protects the State tidal lands for the people of the
 State of California. Tidelands are held in public trust for purposes of water-related commerce,
 navigation, fisheries, recreation and the environment, for which private development, including
 residential use, is not allowed. Approximately 554 acres of the 2,573-acre Bayfront Planning Area
 is within the trusteeship and planning jurisdiction of the Port. The remaining land within the
 Bayfront Planning Area is within the planning jurisdiction of the City of Chula Vista. A Bayfront
 Master Plan has been developed in partnership between the Port District and the City of Chula
 Vista to guide the development of the Bayfront Planning Area as described by the City of Chula
 Vista LCP and the Port District Master Plan.
 The Bayfront Master Plan envisions a world-class Bayfront in the City of Chula Vista to benefit
 citizens and visitors to the region, and to complement existing and proposed development within
 the City's corporate boundaries.
                                                                                   Page LUT-291

         2020
   A major component of the Bayfront Master Plan is the protection of natural areas and sensitive
   biological resources. The Bayfront Master Plan supports the implementation of a variety of uses
   including office, residential, retail, entertainment, recreation, other visitor-serving uses, and
   reconfiguration of the harbor. Objectives identified in the Bayfront Master Plan include:
            !   ·     Ensuring conformance with the tidelands trust requirements·
            !         Protecting and enhancing environmental resources
            !   ·     Enhancing the existing culturally diverse community
            !   ·     Providing visitor-serving and recreational opportunities
            !   ·     Creating recreational, public art and open space opportunities
   II.2 Subareas
   The Bayfront Planning Area (Figure 5-48) consists of three planning subareas: Sweetwater,
   Harbor and Otay. Within these subareas are established commercial, office, industrial,
   recreational and natural preserve areas that are expected to evolve over time as the City
   continues to mature, and that offer opportunities for infill development, redevelopment, and new
   project, including residential development.
   In Section 11.3, Area-Wide Planning Factors, Objectives, and Policies, issues are addressed and
   policies are presented that are important to the entire Bayfront Planning Area. Subsequently,
   Section 11.4, Subarea Planning Factors, Objectives and Policies, issues are addressed and policies
   are presented specifically for the three subareas noted above.

   II.3 Area-Wide Planning Factors, Objectives and Policies
   There are several topics or issues with respect to the Bayfront Planning Area that require more
   focused discussion:
     ·  Create a Bayfront Focal Point
     ·  Bayfront Linkages
     ·  Bayfront Street Network
     ·  Mobility
     ·  Parks and Recreation
     ·  Open Space Conservation
   11.3.1         Create a Bayfront Focal Point
   The continuing development and redevelopment of the Bayfront will create a water-oriented focal
   point for the entire City. With an emphasis on public recreation activities, tourism and
   conservation, it will emerge as the premier waterfront experience in the South County. The
   development standards and quality will equal those of similar areas in the northern section of
   San Diego Bay. The diversity of uses will exceed that of many similar projects and contribute to
   its vitality and use by all citizens.
                                         Objective - LUT 101
   Create a water-oriented focal point for the entire City of Chula Vista,
   which includes uses that are attractive to visitors and residents alike.
   Policies
   LUT 101.1               Provide for a balanced and well-defined mix of land uses including visitor

                           Conservation.
   LUT 101.2               Improve the visual quality of the Bayfront by promoting both public and
                           private uses that will remove existing blighted structures or conditions, and
                           develop a new image through high quality architecture and landscape
                           architecture.
   LUT 101.3               Allow Bayfront development intensity that provides for economic generators

                     Enhancement of environmentally sensitive lands in the Bayfront.
11.3.2         Bayfront Linkages
The Bayfront Planning Area will provide visitors and residents with entertainment, recreational
activities, lodging and other services within a compact area. Therefore, the full range of access
linkages by car, transit, bicycle, or on foot should be planned and implemented through
development of the Bayfront Planning Area. The relationship between the Bayfront and the
adjacent Urban Core Subarea of the Northwest Planning Area provides an opportunity to create
synergy to connected, yet distinct, areas of the City.
                                    Objective - LUT 102
Establish linkages between the Bayfront Planning Area and the
Northwest Planning Area for pedestrians, bicycles, and transit.
Policies
LUT 102.1            Pedestrian and bicycle access between the Bayfront Planning Area and the
                     Northwest Planning Area should be identified, and guidelines for their
                     development should be established, through the Bayfront Specific Plan or a

                     any freeway interchange improvement programs. The crossings shall
                     incorporate vehicular, transit, and pedestrian/bicycle access.
LUT 102.3            Promote the development and operation of a circulation system to link and
                     serve the Bayfront Planning Area, the Urban Core Subarea's commercial
                     Areas, and the E and H Street trolley stations.

   LUT 102.4             Ensure integration of the Chula Vista Bayfront component of the regional
                         Bayshore Bikeway that will provide a continuous bike loop around San Diego
                         Bay.
   LUT 102.5             Ensure integration of the Bayfront Planning Area component of the Chula
                         Vista Greenbelt to provide a connection between eastern Chula Vista and the
                         Bayfront.
   11.3.3       Bayfront Street Network
   The intensification of land uses within the Bayfront Planning Area will alter the character of the
   built environment over time, creating a more urban context. The transportation network takes into
   account all modes of travel within this urban context, including public transit; bicycles; pedestrians;
   and the automobile. Figure 5-49 illustrates the Bayfront street network.
   The streets located in the Bayfront should be designed with pedestrians and bicyclists in mind in
   order to increase social interaction; provide better support; emphasize a friendly, inviting
   environment for bicycling and walking; and create great places for people to live, work and visit.
   In general, these streets will have wide sidewalks, street trees, and parkways. These streets will
   provide, in varying amounts, the following generalized amenities:
   !· Wayfinding maps; trash receptacles; and benches should be strategically located throughout
       the Bayfront. Streetscapes should be designed with inviting sidewalks wide enough to be
       passable without having to maneuver around hedges and other obstacles, and non-
       contiguous to the street for the creation of parkways.
   !· On-street parking, limited curb cuts, and landscaping or planting strips that create a buffer
       between traffic and pedestrians and provide canopy shade. A well-designed streetscape
       makes people feel comfortable and invites and motivates people to walk or bike to
       destinations. The Bayfront street design should include mid-block crosswalks and off-street
       pathways through future common areas and open spaces.
   !· Easily accessible building entrances in close proximity to the sidewalk. Windows at street
       level with no blank walls on adjacent buildings.
   !· Distinctive public transit amenities to increase ease of its use and attractiveness of the area.
       Transit amenities should include bus information kiosks, bicycle facilities and
       interconnections to other routes and bikeways; bike racks; lockers; and shower facilities. The
       intent is to reinforce bicycling as a mode of transportation connected to and coordinated with
       other modes to connect people and places through a complete street network.
   As discussed in Section 5.5.7, separate roadway classifications have been identified for the
   Northwest Planning Area's Urban Core Subarea. These classifications reflect the special operating
   characteristics of roadways within a more urbanized, mixed-use environment, and facilitate multi-
   modal design elements and amenities (such as enhanced sidewalks and transit facilities).

                                  Objective - LUT 103
Establish roadways in the Bayfront Planning Area that respond to the
special operating characteristics of roadways within a more urbanized
environment, accommodate slower speeds in pedestrian-oriented areas,
and facilitate multi-modal design elements and amenities.
Policies

11.3.4                 Mobility
Mobility refers to all modes of transportation, and includes people's use of cars; trolleys; buses;
bicycles; and walking. The planned street circulation system within the Bayfront Planning Area
will provide vehicular access, although an emphasis on pedestrian circulation, accessibility, and
safety is equally important to traffic flow. Increased access to transit facilities and a pedestrian-
friendly environment that encourages walking are two important components of mobility in the
Bayfront.
The Transit First! Program prepared by SANDAG identifies future transit routes for Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) in Chula Vista that connect to the existing E and H Street trolley stations. This transit
system will use the H Street corridor as an east/west route, with planned transit stations
approximately every mile. A bus shuttle system is envisioned to link the Urban Core Subarea
with the Bayfront Planning Area to provide residents and visitors with convenient access to transit
stations, as well as shopping and services in both areas and to provide access to the Bayfront
Planning Area from other parts of the city.
The extensive parks and open spaces within the Bayfront Planning Area provide an important
recreational amenity for Chula Vista residents and visitors. Bicycle and pedestrian paths are
envisioned throughout the Bayfront Planning Area to provide access between transit stations,
parking areas, the waterfront, and these park and open space areas.
                                                                                    Page LUT-297

Natural open space preserve planning efforts, such as the Multiple Species Conservation
Program (MSCP) and the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, areas within the Bayfront
Planning Area will be the focus of continuing conservation efforts. Opportunities to provide for
open space conservation occur throughout the Bayfront and such open spaces are a key
component in the City's Greenbelt System. Future development opportunities adjacent to these
areas, as well as park implementation efforts, need to respect and conserve these important open
space resources.

   II.4 Subarea Planning Factors, Objectives and Policies
   11.4.1            Sweetwater Subarea
   Description of Subarea
   The Sweetwater Subarea is located in the northern portion of the Bayfront Planning area, west of
   Interstate 5. The Subarea extends south to F Street and includes a small peninsular area
   extending southwest of F Street.
   Existing Conditions
   The majority of the planning area is owned by the Federal Government and operated by the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service as the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. Primary land uses
   outside the Wildlife Refuge include commercial, motel, restaurant, office, and transportation/utility
   easement.
   Vision for the Sweetwater Subarea
   The Sweetwater Subarea has developed with a focus on employment uses and visitor-serving
   hotels and restaurants located in proximity to Interstate 5, while providing for expansive views and
   protection of sensitive open space preserve areas that extend through the Sweetwater Marsh to
   the San Diego Bay. To provide for protection of open space, development has transitioned from
   lower scale buildings adjacent to open space buffer areas to taller buildings near Interstate 5.
   Pedestrian and bicycle linkages, including the Bayshore Bikeway, meander along scenic roadways
   and provide a component of the Chula Vista Greenbelt trail system that encircles the city.
   Pedestrian-oriented urban development in the City's Urban Core is linked to the Sweetwater
   Subarea by the F Street Promenade, providing opportunities for residents to enjoy the benefits of
   the Bayfront natural setting.

1.0             INTRODUCTION
   1.1           Purpose and Scope
   The Economic Development Element establishes policies to ensure the long-term vitality of the
   local economy. The purpose of the element is to help develop and guide employment and
   business ownership opportunities in Chula Vista, and encourage appropriate economic and
   business development in the City. It promotes a sustainable local economy to benefit present
   and future generations without detrimentally affecting resources. This Economic Development
   Element is designed to favorably influence the types of jobs that will be created and retained, and
   the balance between employment and housing.
   1.2           Implementing the Vision and Themes
   The Vision for Chula Vista reflects the desire of the City to improve the community and meet the
   opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. To achieve this Vision, the City recognizes that its
   prosperity depends upon its people, their skills, and a competitive and healthy community. Chula
   Vista continues to expand its local economy through providing a broad range of business,
   employment, and housing opportunities that support an excellent standard of living and improve
   the ability for residents to live and work locally. A full discussion of our vision and eight themes
   is found in Chapter 4 of this General Plan. This Economic Development Element focuses on and
   develops Theme 2, Healthy and Sustainable Economy, and Theme 5 , Healthy and Sustainable
   Commnity of those Vision Themes.
   1.3          Relation to Other General Plan Elements and3ROLFLHV
   The Economic Development Element is directly related to the Land Use and Transportation
   Element through the distribution of land uses, including housing, industry, and business areas.
   Sufficient land is assigned for commercial and manufacturing enterprises, considering needs
   such as access and customer populations. Chula Vista recognizes that people want to live in
   and visit walkable, mixed use, transit rich communities and sees the economic value in healthy
   individuals as workers and consumers. The Housing Element includes policies that promote
   suitable housing to maintain desirable jobs/housing balance. Finally, the Economic Development
   Element is related to the Public Facilities and Services Element and the Growth Management
   Element with regards to providing appropriately timed facilities and achieving overall fiscal health.

          2020
                 PLANNING FACTORS,
3.0              OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
   There are several planning factors involved in achieving the goal of the Economic Development
   Element. Such factors are discussed in Sections 3.1 - 3.2.12 of this element. Each factor has a
   least one objective, or focused goal, and each objective has at least one policy, which describes
   how the City will meet the objectives.
   3.1           The Regional Setting
   The economic fortunes of Chula Vista are tied to those of the
   San Diego region, and particularly to those of south San Diego          Chula Vista is a
   County. In the 1980s, the region began moving to diversify the          leader in fostering
   economy and encourage the growth of technology companies.               small and emerging
   As a result, the region's core industry sectors include leading         business networks
   centers for biotechnology, communications, and software                 and technological
   development. The South County Economic Development Council
                                                                           alliances that create a
   (SCEDC) is a non-profit organization, formed in 1989 by a group
   of business and community leaders. SCEDC objectives/goals               diversified,  ever-
   within the south county region include: encourage private               growing economic
   investment; promote diversified residential and overall business        base.
   development; publicize the cultural, educational, social, and
   geographical opportunities of the area; improve and enhance the image and quality of life of
   the South County and serve as an advocate for the area's public and private interests. Chula
   Vista's unique location near the U.S./Mexicoborder is key to developing partnerships with Baja
   California.
   3.2           Economic Development in Chula Vista
   During the 1990s, employment in nearly all industries grew robustly in Chula Vista. The most
    recent forecast by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) is that employment in
    Chula Vista will continue to grow, increasing by nearly 50% between 2000 and 2030 (SANDAG,
    December 2003). By proactively linking technology and trade opportunities, Chula Vista provides
    a rich environment for corporate headquarters; high-tech research, development and production
    centers; and importers/exporters serving Mexico and the Pacific Rim. Chula Vista is a leader in
    fostering small and emerging business networks and technological alliances that create a
    diversified, ever-growing economic base.

          2020
   Employment land, or land designated for commercial, industrial and other non-residential or
    open space use, is concentrated in three principal areas: the tideland area, the Montgomery area,
    and the Otay Valley area. Emerging industrial development is underway in the eastern portion of
    the City, including areas of Eastlake and Otay Ranch. The smallest businesses (those with fewer
    than nine employees) are largely found west of Interstate 805, concentrated in the Third Avenue
    District, the Broadway corridor, and Main Street. Employment land areas are shown in Figure 6-1.
   3.2.1          Diverse Economic Growth In the City
   Diverse business interests are already present in the City of Chula
   Vista. Industrial and retail sectors have expanded, in recent years, to
   keep pace with population increases. As the City continues to grow
   and attract new residents from throughout the region, the need for
   growth in the economic sector will remain strong. Chula Vista has
   the opportunity to capture demand for technology and
   manufacturing space; increased office space; professional services;
   and shopping.
                                             Objective - ED 1
   Provide a diverse economic base for the City of Chula Vista.
   Policies
   ED 1.1         Market the diverse economic opportunities in the City. Target and attract industries
                  and businesses that contribute to diversification and stabilization of the local
                  economy.
   ED 1.2         Provide sufficient tracts of land at a variety of sizes available for industrial and
                  commercial uses in order to provide a stable economic base.
   ED 1.3         Encourage the preservation and expansion of existing industrial uses in areas
                  designated as industrial.

ED 1.4      Increase the supply of land for non-retail employment through the designation of
            land to accommodate a regional technology park; a future business park; industrial or
            business park space; and development of a university campus.
ED 1.5      Consider fiscal implications of General Plan amendments that propose changes to
            industrial and commercial lands.
ED 1.6      Promote economic development that fosters job availability, economic revitalization
            and tax revenues.
3.2.2        Jobs/Housing Balance
Currently, many Chula Vista residents commute out of the City for
employment, contributing to local and regional traffic congestion
and air pollution. It is essential to the City's job creation goals that
areas for business park, office, and retail development are
designated, properly zoned and entitled. In the same manner, it is
equally important that areas of the City are properly zoned for a
variety of housing types, from multi-family units to estate
development. Providing a variety of jobs with differing income
opportunities and a variety of housing types helps Chula Vista
remain competitive in the regional marketplace in terms of location,
amenities and costs. It also assists the City in attracting new, targeted businesses to provide a
diverse and ample employment base for Chula Vista residents.
                                      Objective - ED 2
Maintain a variety of job and housing opportunities to improve Chula
Vista's jobs/housing balance.
Policies
ED 2.1       East of the State Route 125 commercial corridor and the University Village 9 Town
            Center, plan and facilitate a Regional Technology Park and development that
            generates regional-serving retail and service jobs.
ED 2.2      Facilitate increased employment densities near transit stations and routes.
                                                                                 Page EDE-6

         2020
   ED 2.3       Pursue a diverse supply of housing types and costs, as well as a diverse supply of
                jobs with varying income potential, to balance local job and housing opportunities.
   ED 2.4      Encourage home-based businesses, as permitted by the Chula Vista Zoning
               Ordinance, where operations are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
   ED 2.5      Encourage mixed use projects where retail, commercial and office development is
               developed with residential opportunities on the same lot site or in the same building.
   ED 2.6      Leverage economic development incentives to provide high quality jobs for Chula
               Vista residents.
   ED 2.7      Support businesses that provide healthy living options in proximity to residential
               development.
   ED 2.8       Encourage and support development projects that are inclusionary and that provide
               healthy living options such as smoke free spaces and green energy and
               environmental design.
   3.2.3       Growth of Small Business
   A significant source of new jobs in a local economy is typically the
   community's existing small businesses. The success of small local
   businesses is important to diversify and invigorate the local
   economy. These firms can also grow into larger employers. It is
   important to have a long-term economic strategy that focuses efforts
   on identifying and assisting the community's existing and potential
   high-growth, job-creating firms. Their success can lead to a stronger
   economy and one that is increasingly driven by locally owned
   companies, rather than one that is dependent on decision-making
   from remote locations.
                                           Objective - ED 3
   Retain and grow a mix of economically sustainable industries and
   businesses.

Policies
ED 3.1       Encourage, through technical assistance and financing, the attraction, retention, and
             expansion of industries with good growth potential.
ED 3.2       Identify and mitigate, where appropriate, obstacles to the formation and expansion of
             local business.
ED 3.3       Implement programs to support local businesses, and market Chula Vista as an ideal
             location for business development and growth.
ED 3.4       Ensure the provision of adequate land and appropriately sized parcels for small
             industries and start-up businesses.
ED 3.5       Provide for ancillary commercial development in business parks, such as banks and
             restaurants, in order to provide amenities for future tenants.
ED 3.6       Encourage and facilitate a diversity of the type of small businesses established in
             proximity to one another so as to avoid redundancy of uses within a single block,
             commercial mall, or neighborhood, but do not preclude clusters of mutually
             supportive businesses such, as found in a “restaurant row”.
ED 3.7       Provide incentives to businesses that provide healthy food options, promote healthy
              living and implement sustainable practices.
3.2.4        Promoting Technology
Chula Vista has had success in attracting electronics, defense, and
transportation industries, and can build upon these efforts.
Opportunity exists in recruiting the biotech, bio-med,
telecommunications, and software industries, as well. Establishment
of technology schools, as well as a university campus, will aid the
City in seeding technology parks and industries, potentially in the
form of a regional technology park (RTP). The concept of an RTP is to
facilitate development of a business and industrial park large
enough to accommodate research and production for the emerging
high-technology and biotechnology sectors. By attracting technology
industries to Chula Vista, the City can create desirable jobs for its residents, resulting in higher per
capita incomes; more discretionary income to spend on local goods and services (generating
more local tax revenues for public services); and more income to invest in local improvements
and amenities. This, in turn, will help continue to raise the community's overall standard of living.

   Become a center for applied technology innovation.
   Policies
   ED 4.1       Publicize the economic and social benefits of industry, emphasizing the health of the
                Chula Vista economy, the “high-tech” dimensions of industry, and the community
                value of well-paying, high-benefit industrial employment.
   ED 4.2       Maintain land sufficient for the long-term location of an approximately 85-acre
                Regional Technology Park in eastern Chula Vista (which may include portions of Otay
                Ranch).
   ED 4.3       Incorporate a high quality office park in the Bayfront that can accommodate research
                and technology businesses.
   ED 4.4       Continue to recruit and promote the establishment of a university campus, as well as
                research and development facilities that promote technology.
   3.2.5        International Trade
   The importing and exporting of goods is critical to the region’s
   economy. Chula Vista is in the center of the binational, San
   Diego/Tijuana metropolitan area. Because of the City’s proximity to
   the US/Mexico border, the busiest border crossing in the world, and
   its position on the Pacific Rim, Chula Vista is uniquely situated to
   capitalize on cross-border and international trade. Several Pacific
   Rim-related firms, including Hitachi and Dai-Nippon, are located in
   Chula Vista. Future business attraction and recruitment strategies
   should continue to focus on the City’s distinct locational advantage,
   and on targeted export/import and maquiladora (”twin plant”) firms.

Promote cross-border and international trade.
Policies
ED 5.1       Develop and implement programs designed to attract regional and cross-border
             expenditures and, thus, generate sales and other tax revenues for the City.
ED 5.2       Support infrastructure improvements along the border region.
ED 5.3       Identify, monitor and proactively assist local firms involved in international trade.
ED 5.4       Develop and support clusters of Pacific Rim-affiliated, international firms.
ED 5.5       Support development of Chula Vista as an export city, capitalizing on the City’s
             bayfront location and on its proximity to the international border to create a niche for
             export businesses and industries.
ED 5.6       Coordinate with federal, state and local entities to position the City to take advantage
             of existing and future free trade agreements, including NAFTA, European Union, and
             Pacific Rim agreements.
ED 5.7       Promote social, regional and economic cohesion and build stable, sustainable cross-
             border economic development.
3.2.6         Tourism and Recreation Opportunities
Regional-serving retail centers, hotels, and attractions bring new wealth
into a community, create numerous jobs, and help diversify the local
economic base. Local investment in these types of venues can also
contribute to the quality of life for local residents. A high quality of life, in
turn, is essential to attracting targeted technology businesses to the City.
Based upon its current venues and the attraction and development of
                                                                                  Page EDE-10

   additional ones, Chula Vista has the opportunity to build upon its reputation as a growing,
   progressive community within south San Diego County, and to establish itself as the recognized
   hub for leisure; recreation; shopping; and entertainment throughout the entire region.
                                           Objective - ED 6
   Become the hub for leisure and recreational activities, shopping, and
   entertainment in south San Diego County.
   Policies
   ED 6.1      Pursue actions to support development of tourism in the City.
   ED 6.2      Plan and develop a commercial-recreation zone in the Otay River District. Consider
               sites for commercial recreation, a golf course, or other low-impact recreation uses near
               the existing water park and amphitheatre.
   ED 6.3      Through subsequent planning programs, develop and promote various portions of the
               City, including the Chula Vista Bayfront; the Third Avenue District; Eastlake; and the
               area surrounding Otay Lakes as regional visitor destinations that could include
               hotels, meeting spaces, and conference facilities.
   ED 6.4      Plan and develop regional-serving commercial centers in identified areas throughout
               the City.

3.2.7        Connection Between Eastern and Western Chula Vista
From the mid-1970's to present, Chula Vista has experienced enormous investment in new,
master-planned communities. However, certain portions of the City's older west side present ripe
opportunities for focused reinvestment in physical, commercial, and social infrastructure.
Focused reinvestment in Western Chula Vista will encourage all of the City's residents to shop,
recreate, and socialize throughout all areas of the City and will facilitate greater commercial and
social interchange between segments of the City. Achieving this objective will help the City
retain a greater share of sales tax dollars spent by local residents, better use of existing
commercial areas, and create a more cohesive, fiscally sound, and well-balanced city.
                                       Objective - ED 7
Develop a strong land use and transportation link between the
downtown urban core, bayfront, southwestern, and eastern areas of the
City to support economic development throughout.
Policies
ED 7.1       Improve traffic flow and transportation linkages between the downtown, bayfront,
             southwestern and eastern areas of the City. Add additional travel lanes where
             warranted, revise signal timing to improve traffic flow, and consider additional freeway
             crossovers, where necessary.
ED 7.2       Link activity centers through strong public transportation and combined land uses
             that encourage multi-purpose trips.
ED 7.3       Improve existing districts and uses in western Chula Vista that will attract residents
             citywide.
ED 7.4       Develop activities in eastern Chula Vista that will attract residents citywide.
ED 7.5       Encourage citywide-serving institutions, South County sub-regional governmental
             agencies, and cultural and performing arts facilities to locate primarily in the
             downtown/urban core area Bayfront or Eastern Urban Center, as deemed appropriate
             for specific facilities, making them destinations for all City residents.
                                                                                   Page EDE-12

          2020
   3.2.8        Marketing and Image Enhancement
   The competition to attract jobs is fierce throughout the region, state
   and nation. Corporate site selection is a highly competitive arena
   that requires a city to take a very proactive and highly visible
   approach. To effectively market itself, a community must understand
   its assets and be able to clearly and effectively articulate them.
   Quality of life factors, proximity to markets, operating costs, and
   incentives, all need to be effectively conveyed to gain the attention of
   companies seeking to relocate or expand. Conveying an
   updated, positive image is important as Chula Vista continues to
   attract and recruit industries whose owners and employees demand
   a high-quality working and living environment. An aggressive business outreach effort that
   educates the general public, business, real estate, and investment communities about Chula
   Vista's amenities is needed. The effort should highlight the community’s award-winning
   master-planned developments; regional attractions; emerging technology clusters and creative
   industry; revitalization efforts; business opportunities and Chula Vista as a healthy community.
                                            Objective - ED 8
   Develop and maintain a City-wide image that promotes the City’s assets.
   Policies
   ED 8.1        Develop; fund; implement; and maintain an image enhancement and marketing plan
                 for the City. Coordinate with local, south county, and regional promotional, image
                 enhancement and marketing efforts.
   ED 8.2        Facilitate identification of activity areas throughout the City to aid in promoting
                 recognizable destinations for shopping, recreating, and business.
   ED 8.3        Designate the location, function, and characteristics of primary City gateways and key
                 corridors, and enhance them to make them attractive and inviting.
   ED 8.4        Promote Chula Vista as a vibrant healthy community that values the health and well
                being of those that live, work, and play in Chula Vista.
   ED 8.5        Develop awareness, understanding, and participation in Cultural Arts City-wide.

3.2.9       Community and Neighborhood Commercial Development
Commercial development throughout the older parts of Chula Vista
has historically grown to serve surrounding neighborhoods.
Community and neighborhood-focused development helps meet
local needs and helps keep local spending in the community. A
major challenge facing the City is how to maintain the unique
character and business mix in these established parts of Chula Vista,
as well as in other parts of the City, in the face of rising property
values and increasing pressure for more regional-serving
commercial providers. Projects that incorporate residential and
commercial uses on a single development site or in a single
building, as well as projects that incorporate pedestrian and transit-friendly design features will
help create a more urban character for Chula Vista and its residents in selected areas.
                                     Objective - ED 9
Develop community-serving and neighborhood uses to serve residents
and visitors, alike.
Policies
ED 9.1      Provide for community and neighborhood commercial centers in areas convenient to
            residents. These centers should complement and meet the needs of the surrounding
            neighborhood through their location; size; scale; and design. The neighborhood
            concept of providing pedestrian, bicycle, and other non-motorized access should be
            encouraged.
ED 9.2      Plan and develop the downtown urban core, bayfront, and Eastern Urban Center
            areas to strengthen their positions as business, cultural, and entertainment hubs of
            the City. Encourage retail; office; financial; government; and professional uses, as
            appropriate, to expand the current business mix and increase economic viability as
            destination points for shopping; work; dining; and entertainment.
ED 9.3      Encourage the upgrading and/or replacement of older, marginal retail uses along
            Broadway and Main Street including, as appropriate, the development of professional
            office and multi-family residential.
                                                                                 Page EDE-14

         2020
   ED 9.4       Develop specific plans, which include an economic component, for areas of the City,
                including, but not necessarily limited to, the West Main Street; Broadway; South Third
                Avenue; North Fourth Avenue/Third Avenue “gateway”; E Street; West H Street; and
                Palomar Street areas. More than one area may be addressed in a single plan, such as
                the Urban Core Specific Plan.
   ED 9.5       Encourage clustered commercial uses to prevent and discourage strip development.
                Locate commercial uses at focal points along major arterial streets or expressways
                and in village core areas.
   ED 9.6       Encourage clustered, smaller scale office and professional uses along major streets
                and in neighborhood centers in a variety of areas dispersed throughout the
                community to meet the needs of nearby neighborhoods.
   ED 9.7       Encourage merchants, neighborhood associations and other groups to enhance
                business districts and meet the needs of adjacent neighborhoods.
   3.2.10       Supporting Physical Infrastructure
   To maintain a vibrant local economy, the City is
   committed to supporting and providing high-quality
   infrastructure; exceptional public services; secure and
   affordable energy supply; and a reliable supply of clean
   water, in a manner that does not place excessive
   financial burdens on the business community. Doing so
   is essential for the overall economic development of the
   City and for attracting and retaining a healthy mix of
   businesses.
                                         Objective - ED 10
   Provide infrastructure to support the local economy and attract new
   business and industry clusters.

Policies
ED 10.1        Provide sufficient telecommunication; water; sewer; and other infrastructure capacity
               to support new business development, including technology and science based
               industries, while continuing to support the existing business base.
ED 10.2        Work with regional agencies to develop and implement strategies for public
               improvements that benefit Chula Vista and all of south county, including, but not
               limited to: road; transit; energy; water; wastewater; and telecommunications
               infrastructure improvements.
ED 10.3        Identify ways to obtain timely funding for public facility and service needs.
ED 10.4        Define, evaluate and implement quality of life standards that address the provision
               of exemplary public facilities and services to Chula Vista residents and businesses.
ED 10.5        Increase commercial and light industrial intensity in appropriate areas to generate
               higher assessed values and property tax revenues per acre that can be used for
               public purposes.
3.2.11       Workforce Development
Chula Vista's success in becoming a hub of commerce is directly
linked with the quality of the local workforce. Chula Vista and south
county must possess and produce a workforce that can meet the
needs of the City's targeted, technology-based companies, as well as
those of existing companies. To ensure a sizable and qualified
workforce, Chula Vista will assume a leadership role in organizing
public and private partnerships with the educational community to
develop comprehensive strategies to address workforce development.
Successful workforce development yields net social and economic
benefits to the community.

3.2.12      Government Leadership, Organization and Services
Professional and effective provision of city services affords a positive
impression of the City. It also ensures that business needs are
addressed, thereby reducing development costs and time. This helps
create a business-friendly environment that encourages and
supports the business community, leading to a diversified and
thriving local economy. As the demand on city services continues to
grow, the City should continue to ensure that its services and
materials are provided in an efficient, effective, and friendly
manner to further support these efforts. A key element of creating a
thriving local business and industrial environment is the
development of effective partnerships with public and private economic development interests.
Equally important is an effective organizational structure that helps leverage existing community
resources.
                                    Objective - ED 12
Develop and maintain programs and services that address the needs of

1.0           INTRODUCTION
 1.1          Purpose and Scope
 The Public Facilities and Services Element establishes the City's plan to provide and maintain
 infrastructure and public services for future growth, without diminishing services to existing
 development. Public facilities collectively refer to utilities, such as: water; sewer; drainage; power;
 and telecommunications services. Public services collectively refer to schools; libraries; law
 enforcement; and fire protection. This element also includes public facilities and services that
 support and enrich the community, such as: parks and recreation centers; art and cultural
 facilities and programs; childcare opportunities; and health and human services.
 While state planning law requires cities to adopt specific elements in their general plans, the
 California Government Code does not require a public facilities and services element. However,
 the Code permits a general plan to include other elements and subjects that relate to the
 physical development of a city, such as public facilities (Section 65030). It also permits the
 inclusion of subjects that relate to quality of life, such as: parks and recreation; art and culture;
 childcare; and human services. Once an optional element has been adopted, it carries the same
 legal force and effect as a mandatory element. The Chula Vista Public Facilities and Services
 Element has been prepared under the provisions for optional elements and addresses those
 facilities and services needed by existing and future development.
 1.2          Implementing the Vision and Themes
 The Vision for Chula Vista reflects the desire of the City to improve the community and meet the
 opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Achieving this Vision requires that the City recognize
 that our businesses, neighborhoods, and communities depend on efficient and accessible public
 facilities and infrastructure. The Vision calls for ways to improve life in the City of Chula Vista,
 from strong communities, to enhanced resources, to exemplary facilities. The Public Facilities and
 Services Element helps implement the Vision by providing policies for development that ensure
 that public facilities keep our city running smoothly, public services that protect and enrich the
 lives of our citizens and provide a healthy and sustainable community for everyone.

   1.3 Relation to Other General Plan Elements and
           Policies
   The Public Facilities and Services Element is directly related to the Land Use and
   Transportation Element through the distribution of land uses and circulation routes and the
   provision of safe and convenient access to recreational opportunities. Public utility infrastructure
   must support the varied land uses and often shares the same rights-of-way with circulation
   roads. The Public Facilities and Services Element is related to the Economic Development
   Element, the Growth Management Element and the Implementation Chapter with regards to
   providing appropriately timed facilities and achieving overall fiscal health. Finally, the
   Environmental Element addresses water conservation and recycling, which relate to overall water
   demand addressed in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
   1.4 Related Plans and Programs
   As described below, several plans and programs influence public facilities and services in Chula
   Vista.
   Growth Forecasts
   While new construction in eastern Chula Vista has dominated the production of additional
   housing in the City in recent years, (and this is expected to continue over at least the near term)
   an increasing proportion of new housing stock in western Chula Vista is forecast over the longer
   term. This growth in new, as well as in older areas of the City, will impact the provision of public
   services and facilities. The City maintains short-term and mid-term population projections as
   planning tools. As discussed in the Chula Vista in Perspective chapter, the City's population
   estimate as of January 1, 2004 is 209,100, representing a 20 percent increase since the year 2000
   census. Based on this General Plan, the City's population would reach approximately 300,000 by
   the year 2030.
   Regional Comprehensive Plan
   The San Diego Association of Governments, or SANDAG, serves as the forum for decision-making
   on regional issues, such as housing and transportation in San Diego County. The Regional
   Comprehensive Plan (RCP) was prepared under SANDAG's umbrella to provide a long-term
   planning framework in the San Diego Region. The RCP addresses how and where projected
   growth should occur, while providing ahigh quality of life for existing and future residents. The
   plan balances the need to accommodate regional population, housing, and employment growth
   with habitat and open space preservation and public facility and service needs.

                                                                                    CHAPTER 8
The RCP prioritizes public investment in areas that support the preferred direction for regional
growth. It relies, to a large extent, on other agencies, such as local governments and other
providers of public facilities and services, to carry out the Plan in a collaborative manner. The
City's General Plan supports relevant RCP policy objectives and actions.
Long Range Plans
Most of the service providers identified in this element maintain long-range service plans that
identify the infrastructure improvements needed to serve new development. These long-range
service plans, often called Facility Master Plans, have been used to prepare this element . While
not a part of the adopted General Plan, the various long-range service plans implement its goals,
objectives, and policies.          .

2.0             GOAL
   The overall goal of the Public Facilities and Services Element is to:
   Provide and maintain public facilities and services within Chula
   Vista through abundant public infrastructure and community
   services that support and enhance the well-being of the city and all
   of its residents.

             PLANNING FACTORS, OBJECTIVES,
3.0          AND POLICIES
 There are several planning factors involved in achieving the goal of the Public Facilities and
 Services Element. Such factors are described in Sections 3.1 - 3.10.1 of this element. Each factor
 has at least one objective, or focused goal, and each objective has at least one policy, which
 describes how the City will meet the objectives.
 3.1 Water, Sewer and Drainage
 Water Infrastructure
 San Diego County is a semi-arid landscape with a Mediterranean climate. The majority of the
 region's water supply must be imported in order to provide for demands from agriculture;
 population; commercial/industrial development; and public entities. Water availability has long
 been a point of consideration for development in Chula Vista.
 Chula Vista has historically received the majority of its water supply from the San Diego County
 Water Authority (CWA). The CWA generally imports from 75 to 95 percent of this water from the
 Metropolitan Water District (MWD) of Southern California. Water imported to the region comes
 from two primary sources: the Colorado River, through the 240-mile Colorado River Aqueduct; and
 the State Water Project from Northern California, through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta
 and the 444-mile California Aqueduct. These sources deliver water to the MWD, which then
 distributes water supplies to districts throughout the Southern California region, including the
 CWA. The CWA is comprised of 23 member water agencies and water districts, including two that
 serve Chula Vista: Otay Water District and Sweetwater Authority. A third water agency, the
 California American Water Company, also provides water to a small portion of the Chula Vista
 planning area, but is not a member of the CWA (see Figure 8-1, Water Service Areas).
 The three districts vary in size and age of infrastructure but are all expected to conform to the
 same quality and service standards established by the State Department of Health Services (DHS)
 and the federal Clean Water Act. In addition to providing water supplies, these agencies provide
 emergency storage systems and implement conservation efforts.
 Sewer Infrastructure
 Sewer services are essential for public health, safety, and welfare. The City maintains and operates
 sewer facilities that feed into a larger regional system for treatment and disposal. Chula Vista
 relies on the City of San Diego Metropolitan (Metro) Sewage System for treatment and disposal of
 the wastewater generated within the General Plan area.
                                                                                   Page PFS-5

                                                                                 CHAPTER 8
Chula Vista's current wastewater collection system consists of seven major sewer basins,
including: Sweetwater and G Street Basins in the northern part of the City; Telegraph Canyon and
the Main Street- Date-Faivre Basins in the southern part of the City; Bayfront Basin in the west;
and Salt Creek and Poggi Canyon Basins in the east.
The City of Chula Vista currently operates and maintains approximately 400 miles of sewer
pipelines, ranging in size from 6 inches to 48 inches in diameter, and an extensive network of
manholes; metering stations; pump lifts; and lift stations (see Figure 8-2, Backbone Infrastructure
for Wastewater Collection). In addition to maintaining the existing systems and replacing
outdated or damaged components, the City must also address system upgrades and expansions
to accommodate new sewer connections, especially in the eastern portion of the City.
Completion of the Salt Creek Gravity Sewer Interceptor will provide additional capacity in eastern
Chula Vista. Preliminary design plans for construction of the Wolf Canyon Trunk Sewer, a tributary
to the Salt Creek Basin, are also being prepared. This improvement will serve development
projects in the Wolf Canyon Basin.
The City has purchased 19.8 million gallons per day (mgd) of capacity rights in the Metro
Sewage System. Based on existing conditions in 2004, the City discharges approximately 16.6
MGD into the Metro Interceptor. Based on flow analyses, it is estimated that by the year 2030, the
City will generate approximately 26.2 mgd of sewage. The City is working with Metro to acquire
additional treatment capacity to meet this demand.
Drainage Infrastructure
Drainage facilities are public improvements to control storm water runoff so that peak runoff does
not threaten public health or safety in the form of flooding and erosion. The City maintains strict
requirements for sediment control from water runoff. These requirements are found in various
programs and policies, including The City of Chula Vista
Grading Ordinance; Subdivision Manual; Storm Water
Management Standards Requirements Manual; development               Drainage facilities
and redevelopment projects; and “Best Management                    are public improvements

The City of Chula Vista includes 16 major drainage basins. Figure 8-3 shows major drainage
improvements that handle storm water runoff in the City. Based on existing conditions in 2004,
current facilities have adequate capacity for short-and mid-term development, defined as
projected growth, within the 18-month and 5-year time frames. Long-term build-out includes
major development in the eastern sections of the City that will add significant amounts of storm
water to the existing system.
Chula Vista is part of the San Diego watershed area. The San Diego watershed area's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requires that all runoff be treated so that
pollutant levels at the storm water outfalls are minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
Subsequently, drainage infrastructure may need to be constructed or modified to insure that “first
flush” pollutants are captured and treated during significant rainfall events. It is the City's intent
to establish a priority program through the Chula Vista Storm Water Management Unit. Typically,
NPDES on-site detention/desiltation facilities will be required on development projects. The City
will maintain its ability to enforce adequate maintenance of these facilities. The Environmental
Element also addresses drainage issues throughout the City as they relate to water quality.
3.1.1        Keeping Pace with Growth and Maintenance Needs
              (Water, Sewer, Drainage)
The City and its servicing districts strive to maintain existing water,
sewer and drainage facilities to meet current and future demand,
and to comply with federal, state, and local requirements. The
eastern sections of the City are being developed as master
planned communities according to General Development
Plans that greatly increase the ability to predict and accommodate
growth. Knowledge of future zoning and population density
increases in established areas allow the City and service districts
to schedule and construct needed improvements. The challenge
posed by new development is to extend service to unserved areas,
keep pace with construction, and adjust for changes in the
designated zoning or density. The challenge posed by density increases in older parts of the City
system is to repair existing deficiencies and maintain, and possibly upsize, older infrastructure.
Over time, as the City continues to expand and additional water, sewer, and drainage facilities are
added, the demand for maintenance, along with associated fiscal impacts, will also grow.

Policies
PFS 1.1     Coordinate with water districts by providing growth forecast information to allow
            the districts to plan and design water facilities and ensure adequate supply
            needed to accommodate anticipated growth.
PFS 1.2     Plan for adequate systems and facilities to manage the City's wastewater
            generation, treatment, and disposal.
PFS 1.3     Plan and design drainage facilities, and upgrade existing facilities, as necessary,
            to meet current needs, accommodate growth, and satisfy state and federal
            requirements.
PFS 1.4     For new development, require on-site detention of storm water flows such that,
            where practical, existing downstream structures will not be overloaded. Slow
            runoff and maximize on-site infiltration of runoff.
PFS 1.5     Accelerate infrastructure upgrades throughout the City, especially in older portions
            of western Chula Vista as growth places additional demands on existing,
            potentially sub-standard facilities.
PFS 1.6     To avoid recently improved streets from being torn up repeatedly, maintain a
            comprehensive facility phasing and capital improvement program. The program
            should be based on anticipated land development and be conducted in
            coordination with all utilities.
PFS 1.7     Identify ways to obtain timely funding for public facility and service needs. Upon
            request by community representatives, facilitate the possible formation of
            assessment districts to finance public infrastructure, upgrades, and maintenance.

   3.1.2          Meeting Demand Through Alternative Technologies
   Growth will generate increased demand for water delivery and
   for sewer and drainage systems throughout the City. Water
   will continue to be a limited resource in semi-arid southern
   California. The ability to treat wastewater will be affected by
   the limitations of the San Diego Metro system. Drainage
   facilities will need to handle increased storm water runoff and
   potential pollutants in the face of increased growth and
   diminishing supplies of land. Building more infrastructure
   and acquiring more capacity can and should be offset by
   using alternative technologies to handle demand both in the
   older, established parts of the city and in the newly developing
   areas. The following objective and policies address meeting
   resource and service demands through use of alternative technologies. An important and related
   topic, reducing demand through conservation measures, is discussed in more detail in the
   conservation portion of the Environmental Element, Chapter 9 of this General Plan.
                                           Objective - PFS 2
   Increase efficiencies in water use, wastewater generation and its re-use,
   and handling of storm water runoff throughout the City through use of
   alternative technologies.
   Policies
   PFS 2.1          Promote and encourage local water resource development and explore all
                    opportunities for viable water supplies, including desalination. If appropriate,
                    reserve suitable land areas to accommodate such potentially viable facilities and
                    to protect groundwater sources and water storage aquifers.
   PFS 2.2          As part of project construction and design, assure that drainage facilities in new
                    development incorporate stormwater runoff and sediment control, including state-
                    of-the-art technologies, where appropriate.
   PFS 2.3          In designing water, wastewater, and drainage facilities, limit the disruption of
                    natural landforms and water bodies. Encourage the use of natural channels that
                    simulate natural drainage ways while protecting property.

3.1.3        Long-Term Water Supplies
Based on water rates used by the Otay Water District and the
Sweetwater Authority, projected water demand for the City at buildout of
update areas under this General Plan is 23.92 million gallons per day
(mgd). The California Water Code requires all urban water suppliers
within the state to prepare urban water management plan(s) and
update them every five years, in years ending in five or zero. The plans
are to identify supply and demand, infrastructure and funding. In
accordance with state law, the County Water Authority (CWA) adopted
an Urban Water Management Plan in 2000 and updated it in 2005.
The 2000 Plan forecasts total projected water demand for the entire
area served by the CWA as 813,000 acre-feet of water in the year 2020.
This figure includes municipal, industrial, and agricultural demand, and
is adjusted for conservation savings. The report estimates total projected
local water supplies in the year 2020 as 223,500 acre-feet. Local water
supplies include surface water; water recycling; groundwater; and
seawater desalination. Through a shortage contingency analysis, the
report also concludes that the CWA and its member agencies, through
Emergency Response Plans (ERP) and Emergency Storage Projects
(ESP), are taking actions to prepare for and appropriately handle a
catastrophic interruption of water supplies.
While the CWA relies almost entirely on water imported from outside the region, the Sweetwater
Authority has historically imported less than half of its water to meet demand. Sweetwater
Authority’s remaining supply has been from two large local surface water reservoirs, Sweetwater
and Loveland, that store surface runoff from the Sweetwater River. Sweetwater Authority also
adheres to development of additional local resources, such as groundwater pumping and
groundwater desalination. As our City grows, the need to identify the long-term supply of water
continues.
                                  Objective - PFS 3
Ensure a long-term water supply to meet the needs of existing and
future uses in Chula Vista.

3.1.4       Long-Term Sewer Capacities
The City maintains and regularly updates a Wastewater Management Plan to evaluate the
adequacy of the existing wastewater collection system to sustain the long-term growth of the City.
The Wastewater Management Plan helps the City budget for Capital Improvement Projects (CIP),
allocate resources for the acquisition of additional sewage capacity, and determine the short and
long-term sewer capacity needs of the City.
                                    Objective - PFS 4

          2020
   3.2 Law Enforcement, Fire Protection, and
            Emergency Medical Services
   In the City of Chula Vista, fire protection and emergency medical services are provided by the
   Chula Vista Fire Department, and law enforcement services are provided by the Chula Vista Police
   Department. Fire stations are dispersed throughout the City, while police facilities are centered in
   headquarters located in downtown Chula Vista (Figure 8-4 Police and Fire Station Locations). The
   current Fire Station Master Plan calls for nine fire stations, eight of which have been constructed.
   The Master Plan is being updated to reflect changes to respond to a revised set of performance
   criteria proposed in the Fire Department Strategic Plan. Therefore, the number and location of
   future fire stations, along with how they are equipped, may change.
   To maintain the high level of dependable, competent fire protection and emergency medical
   services our City enjoys, several strategies will continue to be employed. The City will continue to
   use a growth related service standard to help determine if public safety is adequately protected.
   Fire Department staffing and equipment will continue to be expanded, as needed, to meet the
   service standard and to minimize hazards to the firefighters and public, in conformance with
   changes to the updated Fire Department Master Plan. The Fire Department will continue to
   enhance its capabilities and staffing through mutual aid agreements with fire departments in the
   surrounding communities.
   Similar strategies also facilitate the provision of law enforcement services that meet our City's
   needs. The Department will continue to monitor calls for service, analyze crime statistics and
   resident survey data, and make changes in staffing and patrols to reflect the growing
   community's needs.
   Effective fire protection and emergency medical and law enforcement services require two-way
   relationships with the community. Staff must understand the unique needs and conditions in the
   community and the community must lend support to the various programs and efforts of the
   Police Department and Fire Department. The City encourages active participation by the Fire and
   Police Departments in all facets of community life, including involvement in area business, senior
   and youth activities.
   Disaster and Emergency Response Program
   State regulations establish the Standardized Emergency Management System, (SEMS). The system
   includes requirements for incident command systems; multi-agency coordination systems; mutual
   aid agreements; and the “operational area” concept. As an agency (municipality) with emergency
   response capability within the state, Chula Vista is required to use the SEMS system.
   Chula Vista provides for the preparation and execution of plans for the protection of persons and
   property within the City in the event of an emergency (Chula Vista Municipal Code, Chapter 2.14,

   There may be occasions when a limited scale evacuation is the             in May 2004 to
   appropriate response to an emergency situation. Under these               help mitigate
   circumstances, people should be evacuated to neighborhood and             impacts to the
   community schools, hospitals, and public facilities, where they could     City in the event
   receive adequate care and treatment. In the event of a major
   disaster, where a large part of the City may require evacuation, the
                                                                             of a natural or

   Federal law (Disaster Management Act 2000) requires that, in order to remain eligible for post-
   disaster Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding after November 2004, every
   jurisdiction in the United States must have an approved Hazard Mitigation Plan (HAZMIT plan) to
   address the management of, and response to, emergency situations. In addition, to be eligible for
   pre-disaster FEMA funding for use in hazard mitigation, each jurisdiction's approved HAZMIT
   Plan must include the planned uses of those funds. The City of Chula Vista adopted a HAZMIT
   Plan in May 2004 to help mitigate impacts to the City in the event of a natural or man-made
   disaster. The City's HAZMIT Plan was included in the San Diego County Multi-Jurisdictional
   HAZMIT Plan submitted to FEMA for approval in compliance with Federal law.
   3.2.1        Keeping Pace with Growth
                (Police, Fire Protection, and Emergency Medical Services)
   The City of Chula Vista has experienced significant residential growth over the last decade. The
   majority of new growth has occurred in the east, where continued relatively high growth is
   expected in the coming years, along with density increases in the west. Fire protection,
   emergency medical service and police services will need to expand to match the demand
   brought on by this anticipated growth.

3.2.2        Emergency Response and Development
General Plan policies and Growth Management standards tie new
development and redevelopment to the provision of adequate public
facilities and services, including police and fire protection. Due to rolling
terrain and varied topography, some new developments have winding
streets and irregular layouts instead of the grid pattern found in older,
traditional neighborhoods. Some design characteristics, such as narrow
street widths, aim to create walkable communities, serve to establish an
overall neighborly atmosphere, and tend to reduce traffic speeds. In
mixed use neighborhoods, density increases may result in taller
buildings. The evolving urban form and the cumulative increase in
development will affect emergency service response times as well as the
equipment, facilities and personnel needed for fire and police services.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a method of incorporating design
techniques into projects to help reduce the potential for crime. CPTED is used in the development
of parks; residential and commercial projects; schools; transit stations; and parking lots to reduce
the number of calls for service. The reduced call volume may favorably impact response times.
CPTED includes the use of four primary strategies:
          ! Providing natural access control into areas;
          ! Improving natural surveillance (i.e., Increasing “eyes on the street”);
          ! Maintaining and managing a property to reduce crime and disorder; and
          ! Using territorial reinforcement to distinguish private space from public space.
                                    Objective - PFS 6
Provide adequate fire and police protection services to newly developing
and redeveloping areas of the City.

   3.2.3        Emergency Response Program
   A Citywide emergency response program provides the framework for
   responding to any type of emergency or disaster that might occur in
   Chula Vista. Accomplishing efficient emergency response involves
   coordination with other agencies regarding disaster preparedness;
   preparation and regular update of the emergency response plan;
   education of residents and businesses about the plan and about
   evacuation routes; and periodic training of City staff and other
   emergency response staff to effectively implement the plan.

In the event of disasters and emergencies, a swift and efficient response
minimizes injuries, casualties, and property damage. Planning post-
disaster operations ensures the safety, health, and welfare of our
residents by allowing critical operations to continue as expeditiously and
efficiently as possible following a catastrophic event. Post-disaster
analysis will help our City improve safety plans and responses.

   through Southwestern Community College. The City is also pursuing
   development of a four-year college or university.                             District (CVESD)
                                                                                 and Sweetwater
   As of 2004, the CVESD operate 42 schools and the SUHSD operated               Union High School
   26 schools, both within and outside the boundaries of the City of             District (SUHSD).
   Chula Vista (Figure 8-6). Both districts actively plan for
   modernization and expansion of campuses to accommodate
   anticipated increases in enrollments. The CVESD, in particular, has completed improvements to
   almost all its schools in the older, western portion of the City through modernization programs
   and bond issues. The SUHSD, likewise, prepared modernization plans in preparation for
   construction in 2005.
   Both districts serve a diverse population beyond Chula Vista's City limits, including the San Diego
   County communities of Bonita and Sunnyside, and the southern portion of the City of San Diego.
   Enrollments in 2004 were 26,195 for CVESD and over 41,000 for SUHSD (Growth Management
   Questionnaire). Approximately 45 languages are spoken in the districts, and more than one-third
   of the student population consists of English language learners. Efforts to accommodate high
   enrollments include the use of modular/relocatable classrooms. Schools are designed to
   accommodate these modular units during temporary spikes in student enrollment.
   The school districts provide many educational programs and facilities. In addition to traditional
   instruction, Family Resource Centers are located on the sites of four elementary schools (as of
   2004). These Centers offer various community services, including: case management; counseling;
   emergency food; assistance with health insurance and other applications or forms; job search
   help; and employment internships. Also in place through the school districts are programs for

Chula Vista has actively pursued the possibility of locating a university within its boundaries, as a
University of California campus or another public or private institution. As of 2004, the City
identified approximately 1,250 acres in the Otay Ranch/Salt Creek area of the City as a site for a
potential institution of higher education.
3.3.1         Keeping Pace with Growth and Technology
              (School Facilities)
Demand for school facilities will continue to increase as our City's
population grows. Eastern Chula Vista's residential growth between 2000
and 2003, was high, with continued high growth expected. In addition,
population growth in western Chula Vista may impact existing, older
school facilities. Modernization of school campuses is expected to
continue as the school districts plan for facility improvements. Technology
continues to change the work place and the social and cultural
environments of our community. The school system, which helps shape
our children and our future, must keep pace with the needs of a
changing workforce and technological world. While the development
and siting of schools falls under the jurisdiction of the local school
districts, not the City, it is the City's intent to facilitate the district's efforts
to provide school services.

   3.3.2         Site Location and Design
                 (School Facilities)
   This General Plan identifies only generalized locations for future
   school facilities. Specific parcels are not identified or zoned for these
   public uses. This allows flexibility in the development process to
   ensure adequate acreage, proper access, and appropriate design.
   School districts control site selection and school design. In all
   instances, safe pickup and dropoff of students is a primary concern.
   Schools are generally designed with the intent of adding modular
   units to accommodate temporary spikes in student enrollment. While
   both Chula Vista school districts use this strategy, drawbacks include
   the fact that the units displace parking, open space and recreation
   areas. Some schools in western Chula Vista are already running out
   of limited open space and have no room to expand their campuses
   in their current land locked locations.

   3.4 Libraries
   Successful library systems serve to increase knowledge and
   enrich lives within the community by equitably connecting               Planning is underway
   people to programs, services, and resources. The Chula Vista            to develop a facility to
   Public Library, created in 1891, twenty years before the City of        serve the northern and
   Chula Vista was formally chartered, is an integral part of the          eastern portion of the
   City. Three library facilities serve our community: Civic Center        City, including the
   Branch, Eastlake Branch, and South Chula Vista Branch. As of
   2004, these facilities comprised a total of 102,000 square feet of      Rancho Del Rey,
   library space, including support and administrative space. A            Eastlake, and Otay
   fourth facility, located in Bonita and operated by the County of        Ranch neighborhoods.
   San Diego, also serves Chula Vista residents (Figure 8-7).
   The Civic Center Branch Library is the system's largest facility, and has many unique resources,
   including city and local history information, environmental impact reports, and genealogy
   resources. The South Chula Vista Branch Library is one of the most attractive, dramatic, and
   functional libraries constructed in the last ten years. It includes the latest in technology and a
   strong collection of popular media. This branch serves as a model library and hosts regular tours
   of officials from other jurisdictions. The Eastlake Branch Library is a joint-use facility between the
   Chula Vista Public Library and the Sweetwater Union High School District. Housed in a building
   in the rear area of the Eastlake High School campus, the facility serves as the High School
   Library during the school day, and as a public library during non-school hours.
   In 2001, the Chula Vista Public Library developed a strategic plan to provide a blueprint for library
   service over the next five years, and to focus priorities and resources to ensure that Chula Vista
   residents receive the highest quality library service possible. Planning is underway to develop a
   facility to serve the northern and eastern portion of the City, including the Rancho Del Rey,
   Eastlake, and Otay Ranch neighborhoods. A new branch of the Chula Vista Public Library is
   expected to open to the public in late 2007 or early 2008.
   Although not formally counted as part of the library, the Civic Center Branch also oversees the
   operation of the approximately 500-square-foot Chula Vista Heritage Museum on the edge of
   Memorial Park. The mission of the Heritage Museum is to locate; collect; display; preserve; and
   record materials of local historic interest to the South San Diego Bay communities. The museum
   collection has expanded beyond its available square footage and, therefore, uses the Civic Center
   Branch basement to store and process photos and memorabilia.
   The Educational Services Division, formed in 1998, oversees the literacy programs and the
   STRETCH and DASH after school-programs. The Office of Cultural Arts Division is responsible for
   fostering a community-wide appreciation of the arts, producing arts events, and providing
   administrative and technical support to local arts groups.

Criteria for siting new library facilities include proximity to community
activity centers, high visibility from the street, and adequate vehicular
or transit access to the site.

   3.4.3        Joint Use of School and Library Facilities
   Increased residential densities and intensity of development in
   western Chula Vista, as well as continued development in eastern
   Chula Vista, will result in an increased demand on school and library
   facilities. Creative methods to meet this increased demand will be
   pursued by the City. One opportunity would be joint-use facilities
   where school and library resources mutually benefit. A public library
   facility associated with any four-year university or college that
   ultimately locates in the City could be a positive joint-use venture.
   Future joint use facilities will be designed to ensure proper
   accessibility.

accessible active and passive recreational uses city-wide.
Regional parks are large open space and recreational facilities, and include uses such as public
golf courses; beaches; lakes; trails; campgrounds; and wildlife refuges. As of 2004, Chula Vista
had over 9,433 undeveloped acres of regional parks, including significant portions of the
Sweetwater and Otay River Valleys and the Otay Reservoirs. These make up a significant portion
of the Chula Vista Greenbelt, a concept first introduced in the 1989 General Plan.
Community parks, designed to serve more than one neighborhood, are ideally 30 or more acres
and provide a wide variety of facilities including: swimming pools; playing fields; recreation
centers; cultural centers; and picnic areas. The City's six community parks range in size from 15 to
60 acres. The 59.9-acre Rohr Park could be considered a regional park for the South Bay, given its
location and amenities. As of 2004, the City had over 177 acres of community parks.
Neighborhood parks, intended to serve local residents, range in size from 5 to 15 acres, and
include open play space, playing fields, play equipment, and picnic areas. As of 2004, the City had
approximately 195 acres of neighborhood parks within walking distance of the residents they
serve.
Mini-parks consist of both public and private facilities, are typically less than four acres in size,
serve a smaller number of homes, and contain very limited facilities, such as a tot lot or play
structure and some grass play area. Public mini parks are typically located in the older western
portion of the City. Private mini-parks, including common useable open space areas, are typically
located east of Interstate 805 in new master planned communities and are not considered for
public park credit. Approximately 20 acres of public mini-parks are in existence as of 2004.
Urban parks are generally located in urban downtown areas and may contain facilities such as:
public plazas; tot lots; play structures; public art features; sports courts (such as basketball or
tennis); walking/jogging trails; dog walk areas; picnic or seating areas; some grass play area; and
trees. Urban parks, which primarily only occur west of Interstate 805, where infill and
redevelopment activity is likely to occur, may be considered for public park credit as a necessary

purpose park.
Recreation facilities are generally located within community parks, and include: community
centers; gymnasiums; swimming pools; youth centers; and senior centers. Recreation facilities are
currently provided through development impact fees collected as part of the recreation
component of the City's Public Facilities Development Impact Fee (PFDIF). As of 2004, the City had
four community centers; one youth center; one senior center; one gymnasium; and two swimming
pools.
Chula Vista offers a full range of classes; programs; events; sports activities; after-school
programs; and day camps for all ages. In addition, the Chula Vista Public Library, the YMCA, Boys
and Girls Club and other non-profit organizations; commercial vendors; school districts; churches;
and volunteer groups maintain a series of after-school programs and other valuable recreational
programs to serve the community. A wide variety of outdoor recreation and leisure opportunities
are available to the residents of Chula Vista because of its location in south San Diego County.
Public beaches; harbors; local mountains; and deserts are all within short traveling distances. In
addition, commercial facilities, such as the water park; Amphitheater; the Olympic Training Center;
and numerous movie theaters; arcades; bowling alleys; skate parks; and regulation and miniature
golf courses provide further recreational opportunities.
Several related documents address the development of parks and recreation facilities in the City.
The Chula Vista Parks and Recreation Master Plan, adopted in November 2002, contains an
inventory of existing parks and recreation facilities, a needs assessment, and policies to
implement the General Plan. The Master Plan envisions the City's park and recreation facilities as
an integrated system of amenities, programs, and services interwoven throughout over 700 acres
of parkland to meet the expressed needs of the community. The Greenbelt Master Plan identifies
segments of an overall backbone system of 28 linear miles of open space and parks that encircle
the City. It discusses unique opportunities for a continuous trail system to link City parks and
other resources outside of the City boundary.

   3.5.1        Keeping Pace with Growth
                (Parks and Recreation)
   The City strives to maintain existing parks and recreation facilities; to
   offer recreational programs to meet current demand; to plan and
   construct new parks and facilities; and to develop new programs to
   meet future demand due to growth. The majority of residential growth
   in the last decade has occurred in eastern Chula Vista; however, it is
   anticipated that significant growth will occur in both the east and the
   west in the future.
   The Parks and Recreation Master Plan and Public Facilities
   Development Impact Fee program provide direction and financing for
   the size and location of parks and recreation facilities, based on population, density, and land use
   designation.
   Timely development and the provision of staffing and equipment that is responsive to growth and
   community demands and expectations are important.
                                         Objective - PFS 14
   Provide parks and recreation facilities and programs citywide that are

   opportunities for personal development, health, and fitness, in addition
   to recreation.

                  recreation community center; library; cultural arts center; or museum.
3.5.2         Meeting Park Demand
Historic park development in western Chula Vista has been impacted
by several factors: pre-existing park development standards that
differ from current City standards; the Quimby Act (state legislation
limiting park dedication requirements for new development); and
Proposition 13 (state legislation limiting property tax revenues).
Increased residential densities and intensity of development will
create a corresponding increase in demand for recreation
facilities and programs. The current City-wide standard for new
                                                                                    Page PFS-41

   development provides for either the dedication and development of three acres of parkland for
   every 1,000 residents, or the payment of in-lieu fees. The City’s Recreation Development Impact
   Fee provides a funding mechanism and new development recreation facility requirements. City-
   wide parkland and recreation development policies to guide future ordinances and master
   planning are identified below.
   While future growth will result in the need and requirement for additional parklands and
   recreational facilities, there will be increased difficulty in securing appropriate park and recreation
   sites in western Chula Vista, where land is largely built out. Lack of vacant and under-used land,
   and/or competing demands and uses for land in the west provide challenges to increase park
   and recreation facility inventory . Maximizing the utility of existing parks and recreation facilities
   through renovation and expansion and consideration of non-active recreational use within
   existing utility corridors can assist in addressing existing recreation needs in the west; however,
   while this strategy will not provide additional park acreage, it will partially meet the needs of
                                      future residents. In addition to parkland acquisition efforts, potential
                                      solutions for new park sites include the covering of portions of
                                      Interstate 5 to create park and open space areas; active and non-
                                      active recreational uses on land controlled by the Port of San Diego;
                                      and joint-use of school classrooms; playing fields and sports courts
                                      by the public, via joint-use agreements. The provision of a
                                      community center within urban development areas should be
                                      considered, possibly within a new mixed use or storefront
                                      environment.
   An overall combination of park and recreation facilities to serve all Chula Vista residents is
   planned. While a majority of the future demand for facilities may be met within planned public
   park sites, there will continue to be a need to rely on quasi-public park sites and joint-use
   facilities to increase recreation facility inventory in our City. Details and strategies for meeting park
   demand will be addressed further through comprehensive revisions to the existing Parks and
   Recreation Master Plan.
                                          Objective - PFS 15

PFS 15.3 Consider a broad mix of park types and facilities toward meeting park
         requirements in the Northwest and Southwest planning areas, in response to
         existing development conditions and lack of land availability. Such facilities
         could include urban parks; plazas; neighborhood parks; and community parks
         to meet the parkland dedication requirements of new development in the west.
PFS 15.4 Promote the inclusion of park and recreation facilities in or near redevelopment
         areas to both serve the new development and to contribute to meeting existing
         park and recreation needs.
PFS 15.5 Use park dedication, location, site design, and acceptance of dedication

         Park Dedication Ordinance and the Recreation Development Impact Fee (DIF)
         program, as may be amended from time to time.

   3.5.3        Regional Facilities in Otay Valley Regional Park
   The Otay Valley Regional Park is an 8,700-acre, multi-jurisdictional
   regional open space being planned by the City of Chula Vista, the
   City of San Diego and the County of San Diego. It will contain a
   substantial preserve area, as well as active recreation and passive
   park opportunities. Equestrian, hiking, and biking trails are
   anticipated. The Otay Valley Regional Park Concept Plan
   anticipates the park to extend throughout the Otay River Valley from
   San Diego Bay to Upper and Lower Otay Lakes. While the park is
   regional in scope, the provision of certain active and passive
   recreational facilities will effectively serve as local neighborhood
   and/or community parks for the City of Chula Vista and, thus, will
   increase the total park land-to-population ratio in the City.
   The Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) is a
   comprehensive program for the preservation of more than 85
   sensitive plant and animal species in the region. The City of Chula
   Vista MSCP Subarea Plan implements the MSCP in the City of Chula
   Vista. The Subarea Plan anticipates development of up to 246 acres
   of active recreation uses within the Chula Vista MSCP Subarea Plan
   preserve in the eastern portion of the Otay Valley Regional Park.

3.5.4         Chula Vista Landmark Park
Chula Vista enjoys an ideal setting on the bay, close to river valleys and mountains. The City's
location within San Diego County and the geography of the area provide several advantages for
attracting residents, businesses, and visitors. To enhance the attractiveness of Chula Vista, it has
been recommended through public input received in the updating of this General Plan that the
City strive to increase its local and regional park facilities to serve existing and future residents.
Further, the City should create a significant public open space or gathering place that the entire
community would embrace and identify with. In other words, create a “landmark park”, a park that
would provide a strong sense of place where people could see friends, meet and greet their
neighbors, and where they would feel a strong sense of attachment to the community. This
landmark park would provide activities for different ages, be accessible and easy to move
through, and would be well integrated with adjoining land uses. It would be a place where
people feel comfortable, safe, and enjoy bringing out-of-town visitors.
                                                                                   Page PFS-45

   As conceptually imagined, a landmark park in Chula Vista would be of unique design, and
   possibly include museums; a cultural arts center; gardens; significant gathering spaces; and
   performance areas. The park could be new or an enhancement to an existing City park or parks.
   Another possibility includes the development of a series of linear parks, linked together through
   an overall master planned theme. The landmark park or combined linear parks could be 20
   acres or more in size. Figure 8-10 shows possible landmark park locations.
                                         Objective - PFS 17

   Policies
   PFS 17.1          Amend the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, as needed, to address the
                     possibility of a landmark park in the City of Chula Vista.

   3.5.5        Joint-Use of Park and School Facilities
   Increased intensity of development in western Chula Vista and lack
   of vacant and underutilized land for park facilities will result in an
   increased demand on parks and facilities and schools. This situation
   provides an opportunity for joint-use of facilities so that the school
   children and the general public mutually benefit.
   Public demand for field space for youth leagues exceeds the City’s
   supply of sports fields in City parks, due to competing demands with
   adult athletic leagues and the sheer number of youth sports teams
   to accommodate. The City currently relies on individual elementary,
   middle, and high schools to allow usage of their fields by Youth Sports Council leagues.
                                         Objective - PFS 18

                     Youth Sports Council leagues via a process administered by the City, and to allow
                     after-school use of classrooms at different schools for recreation classes.
   PFS 18.2          Coordinate with the school districts on the design of school grounds and fields to
                     provide for use of these facilities by the City’s Youth Sports Council leagues.
   PFS 18.3          Consider siting elementary schools adjacent to neighborhood parks, where
                     feasible, to allow for expanded use of the school grounds and classrooms by the
                     general public and the park area by the school children.

3.6 Art and Culture, Childcare, Health and
         Human Services
Art and Culture
Art and culture are important parts of any society, and the City
of Chula Vista enjoys an active and growing arts and culture              Both art and culture
community. Both art (defined as the conscious use of skill and            are dependent on the
creative imagination), and culture, (defined as the collective            human capacity to
body of knowledge, customary beliefs and social forms that                share and to pass
define a group of people), are dependent on the human
capacity to share and to pass information on from one person,
                                                                          information on from
generation, or people to another.                                         one person,
                                                                          generation,or people
Chula Vista has a number of venues for the presentation of                to another.
cultural programs or events. These facilities include large to
small private facilities, such as the Coors Amphitheater; the OnStage Playhouse on Third Avenue;
and the Ruth Chapman Center for Performing Arts (which is operated by the Sweetwater Union
High School District); Mayan Hall at Southwestern College; and other various school and public
venues. The City is host to a variety of cultural arts events, exhibits, and programs throughout the
year, including the annual Taste of the Arts by the Bay, the Music in the Park series, and the
McCandliss Art Awards. Culture and arts programs and classes are offered through the City
Recreation Department, and cultural programs are presented at all three City branch libraries.
Childcare
Chula Vista recognizes childcare as an important part of the fabric of the City and that to
disregard the need for quality childcare is to endanger the City's long-term social, physical, and
economic health. With a growing community, the demand for quality childcare increases.
While the City does not administer them, a variety of profit and non-profit childcare facilities and
programs are available to those who work and/or live in the City of Chula Vista. The two
principal types of facilities are Family Daycare Homes and Childcare Centers. Other facilities and
programs include those provided by school, church, and recreation groups.
Health and Human Services
Health and human services collectively refers to a wide variety of agencies, departments, and
providers that help to improve people's quality of life. Sharp HealthCare, Scripps, and Kaiser
Permanente provide medical services in Chula Vista. Residents also benefit from Family Resource
                                                                                  Page PFS-49

   Norman Park Senior Center, a multi-purpose public community facility where adults over 50 years
   of age and their families can access services and programs to meet many of their social, physical,
   and intellectual needs.
   3.6.1         City’s Role in Art and Culture, Childcare, and Health Services
   The City of Chula Vista recognizes that providing art and culture
   opportunities, quality childcare facilities, a well-planned health and
   human services infrastructure and the implementation of policies
   and programs that support the health and sustainability of Chula
   Vista is vital to the well-being of its residents and the overall
   community. Typically the City's role is one of supporter, rather than
   provider, of these community services however the City is committed
   to continue to create policies and programs that improve the City’s
   physical and social environments, that promote awareness and
   access to healthy alternatives and amenities and create community
   partnerships that support the well being of all residents. By acquiring Community Purpose
   Facility acreage or fees, the City actively requires new development to set aside land or
   contribute to funding for community facilities that may include those addressing childcare,
   health and cultural needs.
                                       Objective - PFS 19

   centers. While not provided by the City, post offices are another example of civic facilities
   necessary to the everyday needs of the community. Friendly, professional, and effective provision
   of City services affords Chula Vista residents and the larger region a positive impression of the
   City. As the City continues to grow, the demand on civic facilities and services will continue to
   grow as well.

3.8 Energy
Fossil fuel products such as coal; natural gas; oil; and diesel
remained the primary fuel for generating electricity and for heating
homes, water, and food in 2004. The global supply of these products
is limited and the demand for electricity and fossil fuels continues to
increase. Employing efficient energy efforts throughout the City and
transitioning to non-fossil fuel alternatives will help to extend limited
supplies; reduce the need for expensive new regional power
generators and transmission lines, and contribute to Chula Vista’s
economic sustainability and regional competitiveness. Cleaner
energy, more efficient power sources and conservation also
contribute to the City’s environmental sustainability by decreasing the level of air pollutants
produced by fossil fuel based electrical generation and heating, and further the City’s long
standing commitment to CO2 reduction and the prevention of global warming.

   appurtenances needed to transport natural gas, and transmit and distribute electricity to Chula
   Vista residential; commercial; industrial; and institutional facilities. SDG&E estimates that
   additional infrastructure may be needed to deliver gas and electricity (energy) to serve a growing
   population, maintain local and regional reliability, and move energy through the western regional
   U.S. System. SDG&E projects that infrastructure may include new electricity distribution substations
   in both the eastern and western parts of the City. Each substation may require at least two
   separate and distinct transmission right-of-ways (ROW), which most likely would be accomodated
   within street ROW. Each ROW could be up to 25 feet in width and could vary in length. Other
   SDG&E infrastructure improvements or upgrades may include a new 200-foot-wide transmission
   ROW in the northeast section of the City and a relocation of the South Bay electricity substation
   to a six-acre site.
   The following objective and policies relate to the provision of energy to the City. A discussion and
   related policies addressing energy conservation are contained in the Environmental Element,
   Chapter 9 of this General Plan.
   3.8.1        Powering Chula Vista
   Population growth in Chula Vista will increase demand for energy
   and power. In response to energy needs, the City embarked on a
   mission to identify viable options to control the City's energy future.
   On May 29, 2001, the City Council adopted the City of Chula Vista
   Energy Strategy and Action Plan (Energy Strategy) and adopted an
   ordinance to investigate the possibility of creating a municipal utility.
   The Energy Strategy identifies recommended actions, including
   monitoring the energy market and legal restrictions; being prepared
   to enter into an electrical services contract with an energy services
   provider or power generator, as allowed by law; partnering with a
   third party to build and operate power generation facilities;
   developing an emissions offset program, based on mobile sources;
   becoming a municipal “aggregator” and acquiring electricity at
   negotiated rates for City facilities and participating residents and business owners; expanding
   energy conservation projects for City facilities and promoting energy-efficient and renewable
   energy programs for businesses and residents; and developing and implementing a legislative
   strategy that facilitates the City's overall energy plan.

Ensure adequate energy supplies throughout Chula Vista.
Policies
PFS 22.1    Continue to address energy needs in Chula Vista by periodically reviewing and
            updating the City of Chula Vista Energy Strategy and Action Plan and by
            implementing and monitoring the recommendations of the Strategy.
PFS 22.2    Coordinate with regional energy planning programs and efforts.
PFS 22.3    Encourage and support the research, development, and use of alternative sources
            of energy.
PFS 22.4    Review energy facility requests and encourage siting and design techniques that
            minimize community impacts. Such techniques may include: undergrounding
            facilities, where possible; co-locating new facilities with existing utility
            infrastructure; locating facilities in non-residential areas; and implementing
            architectural details and landscaping that help facilities that blend with the
            surrounding area. The development and operation of natural gas-fired plants
            within the City shall utilize “best available control technology” to the greatest
            extent practicable.
PFS 22.5    Maximize future sustainable energy options by pursuing distributed generation
            and planning energy transmission and transportation options that complement
            the development of local renewable energy options.
                                Objective - PFS 23
Integrate sensible and efficient electrical and natural gas facilities into
the natural and developed environment.

   Policies
   PFS 23.1          Use existing transmission corridors as effective wildlife corridors.
   PFS 23.2           Provide sufficient open space buffering between utility facilities and
                      residential development.
   PFS 23.3           Ensure adequate area is reserved early in the development process for critical
                      electrical service facilities.
   PFS 23.4           Assure that utility facilities safely integrate into the developed landscape.
   PFS 23.5           Appropriate secondary land uses (such as nurseries, RV storage, and useable open
                      space and parks, among others) should be encouraged to locate within overhead
                      transmission facility rights-of-way, when appropriate. Trails can also be included as a
                      secondary land use, pursuant to agreement with SDG&E.
   3.9 Telecommunications
   The rapidly expanding world of telecommunications allows residents and
   businesses to interact with the global community from anywhere in our
   City. Technology and capabilities continue to advance at great rates,
   creating more efficient communication options. State-of-the-art
   services facilitate a healthy business climate, making businesses more
   competitive and providing an edge in accessing and using important
   information. Furthermore, telecommunication technologies allow residents
   to establish home offices, which can decrease commutes, enhance
   neighborhood security and provide flexibility for working parents.
   In 2004, telecommunications services in Chula Vista included telephone,
   cable and wireless communication services provided by several companies. Future
   communication technologies may expand into other fields. Infrastructure upgrades are being
   made by private providers to facilitate high-speed data transmission and interactive video
   capabilities. The City encourages constructing new office and industrial buildings with state-of-
   the-art telecommunication circuits to use these upgrades.

PFS 24.2         Review new telecommunications facilities and request siting and design
                 techniques that minimize community impacts. Such techniques may include co-
                 locating new facilities with existing utility infrastructure, locating facilities in non-
                 residential areas, and using architectural features or details that blend with the
                 surrounding area.
PFS 24.3         Encourage developers of new office and industrial buildings to
                 incorporate state-of-the-art telecommunications technologies.
3.10         Solid Waste
In general, urbanized areas generate substantial amounts of trash,
requiring disposal in nearby landfills. And, often times, materials that
could be recycled for other uses are instead thrown out. The City of
Chula Vista has established an exclusive franchise agreement with
Pacific Waste Services, which extends through 2007, for the removal,
conveyance and disposal of any non-recyclable waste. The City has
three additional eight-year options on this agreement, taking care of
disposal needs through the year 2031. The agreement includes a
number of programs and incentives for the franchisee and the public
to maximize recycling and other forms of landfill diversion. Pacific
Waste's parent company, Allied, owns and operates both the Otay Landfill and the Sycamore
Canyon Landfill located further north in San Diego County. Most of the solid waste generated in
the City is disposed at the Otay Landfill (Figure 8-11). The important discussions of recycling and
of the handling and disposal of hazardous waste materials are addressed in Chapter 9,
Environmental Element of this General Plan.
                                                                                     Page PFS-57

       Vision                                                                            CHAPTER 8
           2020
                                        In 1989, with a population of approximately 135,0000 people, the
                                        city disposed of approximately 189,000 tons of trash at the Otay
                                        Landfill in eastern Chula Vista. In 2003, with a population of
                                        approximately 200,000 people, the City disposed of approximately
                                        170,000 tons of trash. This 19,000-ton reduction was due to city-
                                        wide recycling efforts. Nonetheless, as more development occurs,
                                        available capacity at disposal sites used by the City will be
                                        reduced. At a minimum, this could result in increased costs for
                                        transporting materials greater distances to available disposal sites,
                                        and the possibility of increasing the number of waste transfer
                                        sites within the City.
   The Otay Landfill is estimated to reach capacity in the year 2027. At this time, there is one
   proposed new landfill site in San Diego County: Gregory Canyon, located in north county, near
   the communities of Fallbrook, Vista, and Pauma Valley. The 1,770-acre Gregory Canyon site is
   designed for a 30-year life expectancy. Its opening date is uncertain, due to opposition to the
   facility. In south San Diego County, an area in East Otay Mesa was previously identified by the
   County as a tentative site. However, the County is no longer pursuing landfill siting at this
   location, and there are no private siting efforts currently proposed. The East Otay Mesa site retains
   a tentative classification for reservation as a future landfill. One may again be proposed through
   the County of San Diego’s discretionary permit process.
   Once the Otay Landfill is closed, it is anticipated that a portion of the site could be used for a
   trash transfer facility and/or a Material Recovery Facility (MRF) where recyclables are prepared for
   secondary markets. The City estimated the cost of such a facility to be over ten million dollars.
   The longer the Otay Landfill is capable of accepting waste, the longer this expense is delayed.
   The City has also acquired rights to approximately 30 acres of space at the Otay landfill for a
   composting facility when the landfill closes. Compostable material accounts for approximately 25
   percent of the City's total waste stream. Recyclable and compostable materials, together,
   accounted for approximately 54 percent of the City's waste stream in 2002. Therefore, continued
   efforts to expand recycling and to accommodate compostable materials will reduce future waste
   transfer costs.
   Chula Vista currently relies on the County of San Diego Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) to
   permit and regulate solid waste facilities. However, the City may choose to contract directly with
   the state or establish its own LEA. Nonetheless, the City has the ability to control waste production
   within its General Plan area. Current solid waste management strategies include source
   reduction, recycling, and composting to decrease the waste stream impacting landfills.

   3.10.1        Providing for Solid Waste Disposal
   The following objective and policies address the efficient handling of solid waste throughout the
   City. The important and related topics of reducing overall solid waste and of handling hazardous
   wastes are addressed in the Environmental Element, Chapter 9 of this General Plan. It is
   estimated that the Otay Landfill will reach capacity within the next 23 years, requiring closure of
   the facility. Meeting future needs of the planning area may require the creation of a regional
   transfer station, where solid waste collected from individual collection routes is transferred into
   large trucks for disposal. The transportation of solid waste to an alternate site must occur in an
   efficient manner that restricts adverse circulation, visual, and noise impacts.
                                        Objective - PFS 25
   Efficiently handle solid waste disposal throughout the City.
