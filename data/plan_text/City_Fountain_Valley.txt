I.       INTRODUCTION
A.       Community Overview
Fountain Valley is located in the northern portion of the County of Orange, along the Santa Ana River.
(Refer to Figure 1, Vicinity Map.) Incorporated in 1957, Fountain Valley is a general law city that
encompasses 9.75 square miles. With a 2012 population of 55,810 1, the City’s growth is nearly
complete.
Virtually all of Fountain Valley is flat and within Flood Zones X and A. This flood hazard, which is
equivalent to the formerly designated 100 year flood plain, is mostly caused by the Santa Ana River,
which carries runoff from large portions of San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange Counties through
Fountain Valley.
The majority of development in Fountain Valley took place during the 1960’s based on a master plan
that created a balanced but predominantly single family residential community. Multifamily residential
development with a density of up to 30 dwelling units per acre (du/ac) (without a density bonus
allowance) is mixed with the single family residential areas and located close to arterial roadways and
commercial development. Industrial uses are located in the eastern portion of the City, along the Santa
Ana River.
To serve its residents, the community owns and maintains fourteen neighborhood parks. In addition,
Mile Square Regional Park is a County owned facility located in the north central portion of Fountain
Valley. It stretches over 640 acres of land, and contains two lakes, three 18-hole golf courses, baseball
and softball fields, picnic shelters, tennis courts, basketball courts, racquetball courts, a gymnasium, a
community center and a twenty acre urban nature area planted with California native plants.

City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                                 Page | 1-1

                                                          2014-2021 Housing Element
The provision of adequate housing for families and individuals of all economic levels is an important
public goal. It has been a main focus for state and local governments. The issue has grown in
complexity due to rising land and construction costs, as well as increasing competition for physical and
financial resources in both the public and the private sectors.
In response to this concern, the California Legislature amended the Government Code in 1980. The
amendment instituted the requirement that each local community include a specific analysis of its
housing needs and a realistic set of programs designed to meet those needs. This analysis is to be set
forth in a Housing Element and incorporated in the General Plan of each municipality.
The requirements of the law are prefaced by several statements of State policy set forth in Section
65580 of the Government Code:
“... The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent
housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order.”
“... Local and State governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate
the improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all
economic segments of the community.”
“... The legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local government also has
the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set
forth in the general plan and to cooperate with other local governments and the State in addressing
regional housing needs.”
C.       Legislative Requirements
State law requires each municipality to accomplish the following tasks:
   To identify and analyze the current and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
    community.
   To evaluate the current and potential constraints to meeting those needs, including identifying the
    constraints that are due to the marketplace and those imposed by the government.
   To inventory and assess the availability of land suitable for residential use.
   To establish a series of goals, objectives, policies and programs aimed at responding to the
    identified housing needs, the market and governmental constraints, and the housing opportunities.
D.       Scope and Content
The Housing Element consists of five major components:
   An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends.
   A summary of the existing and projected housing needs of the City’s households.
   A review of the potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to meeting the
    City’s identified housing needs.
   An evaluation of the resources available to achieve the City’s housing goals.
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                             Page | 1-2

                                                         2014-2021 Housing Element
   A statement of the Housing Plan for the years 2014 through 2021 to address the City’s identified
    housing needs, including the housing goals, policies and programs.
E.       Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a General Plan.
Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the General Plan and the parts and elements
thereof shall comprise an integrated and an internally consistent and compatible statement of policies.
The Fountain Valley General Plan contains the following nine elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Circulation; 3)
Parks, Recreation and Open Space; 4) Conservation; 5) Public Safety; 6) Noise; 7) Air Quality; 8)
Housing; and 9) Growth Management. The Fountain Valley General Plan is internally consistent. Policy
direction introduced in one element is reflected in the other elements.
Relative to housing, the General Plan identifies both constraints and opportunities to providing new
affordable housing. The Land Use Element addresses the scarcity of available land to support new
development, the Circulation Element addresses the limitations of the City’s roadway capacity, and the
Public Safety Element identifies flooding related hazards that constrain development. In spite of these
constraints, Fountain Valley’s General Plan supports a balanced land use pattern. The City’s residential
and mixed use densities allow for an adequate diversity and supply of housing to satisfy the
requirements of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) presented in this Housing Element.
This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements. It is entirely consistent with the
policies and proposals set forth by the General Plan.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65400, the City will annually review its progress in implementing
this Housing Element and ensuring consistency between this and the City’s other General Plan
Elements.
F.       Public Participation
State housing element law requires that communities allow for public participation and comment
opportunities in the creation and evaluations of the jurisdiction’s housing element. Section 65583(c)(5)
of the Government Code states that:
         "The local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all
         the economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element,
         and the program shall describe this effort."
This requirement presents an opportunity for the City to engage constituents and stakeholders in a
dialogue – defining problems and creating solutions. The inclusion of community stakeholders in the
housing element public participation process helps ensure appropriate housing strategies are more
efficiently and effectively evaluated.
In order to encourage citizen participation in the development of the City's 2013 Update of the Housing
Element of the General Plan, a number of actions were taken to receive the greatest amount of
participation.
On March 6, 2013, staff and the City’s Housing Element consultant gave a presentation on the Housing
Element to the City’s Housing and Community Development Advisory Board. This meeting was noticed
and open to the public.

On March 13, 2013, staff and the City’s Housing Element consultant gave a presentation to the Planning
Commission at a publicly noticed meeting.
On July 11, 2013, the City set up a Housing Element information booth at a concert in the park event.
At the booth, City staff and the Housing Element consultant provided community members with
information about the Housing Element and asked for input on housing challenges and opportunities in
Fountain Valley. The comments received from the community are provided in Appendix A.

II.      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A successful strategy for improving housing conditions must be preceded by an assessment of the
housing needs of the community and region. This section of the Housing Element reviews the major
components of housing need including trends in Fountain Valley's population, households, and the type
of housing available. These changes reflect both local and regional conditions. Therefore, the regional
context is also presented.
The analysis that follows is broken down into four major subsections:
   Section A, Population Characteristics, analyzes the City of Fountain Valley in terms of individual
    persons and identifies population trends that may affect future housing needs.
   Section B, Household Characteristics, analyzes Fountain Valley in terms of households, or living
    groups, to see how past and expected household changes will affect housing needs.
   Section C, Housing Stock, analyzes the housing units in Fountain Valley in terms of availability,
    affordability and condition.
   Section D, Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion, analyzes housing units that have expiring use
    restrictions, such as project-based Section 8 contracts and early tax-credit financing contracts.
    Such projects are at risk of losing rent restrictions within the next few years, which can result in
    significant rent increases for their tenants.
This assessment of Fountain Valley's housing needs is used as the basis for identifying appropriate
policies and programs in this Element.
A.       Population Characteristics
Fountain Valley's population characteristics are important factors affecting the type and extent of
housing needs in the City. Population growth, age, race/ethnicity and employment characteristics are
discussed in this section.
1.       Population Change
Fountain Valley is a built-out community. From 2000 to 2010, Fountain Valley’s population increased by
0.6 percent. Orange County’s population grew by 5.8 percent, and the State of California by 10.0
percent. Growth in neighboring cities varied. Huntington Beach grew by 0.2 percent. Costa Mesa grew
by 1.1 percent. Westminster grew by 1.7 percent. Santa Ana’s population decreased by 4.0 percent.
Table 2-1 depicts the 2000 and 2010 population counts and percentage changes for Fountain Valley,
neighboring cities, Orange County and the State. Figure 2-1 graphically illustrates these population
changes between 2000 and 2010.

The age structure of a population is an important factor in evaluating housing needs and planning
future housing development. For example, if a city is experiencing an outmigration of young adults
(ages 25-34), this may indicate a shortage of first-time homebuyer opportunities and/or well-paying
employment opportunities. If a city has a substantial elderly population, special housing types or
services may be needed, such as assisted living facilities, housing rehabilitation programs, paratransit,
meals on wheels, and home health care services, in order to enable seniors to remain in the
community. Table 2-2 shows the number and percentages of Fountain Valley residents in each age
group according to data from the 2010 Census. The table also shows the median age for the City,
County of Orange and the State.
Fountain Valley is a maturing community. Between 2000 and 2010, the median age of Fountain Valley
residents increased from 38.1 to 42.6 years. The County’s median age increased from 33.3 to 35.2
years and the State’s median age increased from 33.3 to 36.2 years. The median age for the City, as
                                                                                              1
well as the County and State, is expected to increase as the Baby Boom generation ages .

combined with local housing costs preclude the option of home purchase, the City may wish to initiate
a home-buyer assistance program or participate in or publicize the programs that are available
elsewhere. Income and affordability is best measured at the household level, as are may be special
housing needs of certain groups such as large families and female-headed households.
The Census Bureau defines a "household" as “all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include
families, singles, or other." Boarders are included as part of the primary household by the Census.
Families are households related through marriage or blood, and a single household refers to individuals
living alone. "Other" households reflect unrelated individuals living together (e.g., roommates). Persons
living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living situations are not
considered households.

2.       Overcrowding
Overcrowding is another indicator of housing affordability. Unit overcrowding is caused by the
combined effect of low earnings and high housing costs in a community, and reflects the inability of
households to buy or rent housing that provides sufficient living space for their needs. The Census
defines overcrowded households as units with greater than 1.01 persons per room, excluding
bathrooms, hallways and porches.
According to the 2005-2009 ACS, overcrowding in Fountain Valley affected 611 households, or 3
percent of the City's households. The ACS estimates 369 of the overcrowded households were renters,
meaning 7 percent of all renter-occupied households in Fountain Valley were overcrowded. The
balance of overcrowded households (242), were owner households, indicating that 1.8 percent of the
City owner-occupied households were overcrowded.

3.        Household Income
An important factor in housing affordability is household income. While above-moderate income
households may have more discretionary income to spend on housing, low and moderate-income
households can be more limited in the range of housing they can afford.
State-Defined Income Categories
According to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the area median income for a four-person
household in Orange County was $85,300 in 2012. 2 The area median income is an assumed income used
as a basis for determining eligibility for various housing programs. California law and some federal
housing programs define several income categories based on a percentage of the area median income
(AMI) determined by HUD and HCD, as follows:
         Extremely Low Income–30% of the area median income and below
         Very Low Income – between 31% and 50% of the area median income
         Lower Income - between 51 and 80% of the area median income
         Moderate Income – between 81 and 120% of the area median income
These income ranges are used to determine eligibility for various subsidized housing programs. The
2012 income limits for these categories by household size are presented in Table 2-5, below:

presented for lower income are higher than median income numbers.

As shown in Figure 2-3, the median household income for renter-occupied households was $56,119
based on the 2007-2011 ACS, 41.1 percent lower than the $95,295 median household income for owner-
occupied households. The SCAG reports that the 2005-2009 American Community Survey estimates also
indicate that 49.7 percent of Fountain Valley renter households paid more than 30 percent of their
income on housing; compared to 37.8 percent of Fountain Valley owner households.

4.       Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. These “special needs" groups include the elderly, large families, disabled
persons, female-headed households, farm workers, and the homeless. Under State law, the housing
needs of each group are required to be addressed in the Housing Element. This information is
summarized in Table 2-8. The identified special needs groups are defined below:
Elderly and Elderly with Disabilities
The special needs of many elderly households result from their fixed incomes, higher rate of physical
disabilities and common need for assistance from others. Elderly is defined as age 65 or older.
According to the 2010 Census, 9,716, or 17.6 percent of Fountain Valley’s residents were elderly.
Elderly households, those headed by a person 65 year or older, comprised 5,041 or 26.8 percent of all
Fountain Valley households according to the 2007-2011 ACS. By comparison, 20 percent of all County
households were headed by an elderly person.

Based on 2005-2009 HUD CHAS data, there are a total of 3,730 owner-occupied households that have an
elderly householder, of which 28 percent are cost burdened. Additionally, there are 1,214 renter-
occupied households with an elderly householder, of which 57 percent are cost burdened.
Table 2-9, on the previous page, shows housing problems for all household types, based on 2005-2009
HUD CHAS data. Information is included for extremely low and very low income renter and owners, by
household size and elderly household. For renter households, the largest lower income groups appear
to be small related households (2 to 4 persons), with 270 households in the extremely low category and
325 households in the very low category. For owner households, the largest lower income groups
appear to be elderly households, with 475 households in the extremely low category and 545
households in the very low category. For renter households, those with the greatest percent of any
housing problems are large households (74 percent). Elderly households (65 percent) have the second
highest percentage of any housing problems. For owner households, those with the greatest percent of
housing problems are large households (49 percent). Based on this CHAS data, Fountain Valley’s
affordable housing needs appear to spread across all groups, with the greatest needs affecting the
large households and elderly households.
In terms of housing, seniors typically require smaller, more affordable housing options and/or
assistance with accessibility and home maintenance. They often require ramps, handrails, lower
cupboards and counters to allow greater access and mobility for wheelchairs or walkers. Senior
households are likely to be on fixed low incomes and at a greater risk of housing over payment.
As discussed above, the median age for the City, as well as the County and the State, is expected to
continue to increase. According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 3,027 of Fountain Valley elderly residents have
at least one disability. Because of their limited mobility, the elderly also often need to live close or
have transportation assistance to shopping and medical facilities. As the elderly population increases,
the need for senior housing and related services also is expected to increase.
City Approach to Meeting Elderly Needs: Fountain Valley currently has a number of existing
affordable housing projects that are available exclusively or primarily to senior citizens. These include:
    Guadalupe Manor – a 71 unit housing development with one-bedroom and efficiency units.
      Constructed in 1989, this development provides 63 units reserved for elderly residents and 7 units
      reserved for disabled units. All units are limited to households with incomes less than 80% the
      County median.
    Carmel Retirement Village – a 189 unit market rate senior housing development, constructed in
      1989, with no income requirements.
    Parkhurst Retirement Home – a 124 unit market rate senior housing development, expanded in
      1988, with no income requirements.
    Palm Island Apartments – a 456 unit market rate senior housing development.
    The Jasmine at Founder’s Village – a 156 unit senior housing development, with 152 units limited
      to households with incomes less than 80% the County median.
    The Liberty at Founders Village – a 54 unit owner occupied senior condominium development,
      limited to households with incomes less than 120% the County median.
    Manor Care – a 151 bed skilled nursing facility for seniors, with no income limits.
    Rancho La Siesta – a senior mobile home park community.
These facilities offer an array of housing types, services and affordability options. Social and
recreation services to senior residents are available at The Center at Founders Village Senior and
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                           Page | 2-15

Large Households
Large households are identified in State housing law as a “group with special housing needs based on
the generally limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units.” Large households are
defined as those with five or more members. According to 2007-2011 ACS, 13.6 percent of all
households in the City were large households. Approximately 28 percent of these large households,
were renters, while approximately 72 percent, or 1,871 households, were homeowners. See Figure 5
below for detail on household size by tenure.

Fountain Valley has the housing stock to accommodate its large households. According to the 2007-2011
ACS, the average number of rooms per housing unit in the City is 6.1, versus 5.2 for the County.
Approximately 3 percent of Fountain Valley households experience overcrowding according to SCAG.
However as previously shown in Table 2-9, large households demonstrate a high percentage of housing
problems, both for renter and owner households. This information suggests that large houseolds are
likely cash strapped when it comes to keeping up with housing related costs.
City Approach to Meeting Large Family Needs: The City of Fountain Valley has a diverse housing
stock with about 70% of its housing single family detached. Single family detached units are typically
the housing type most attractive to large households.
Persons with Disabilities
Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design as well as
limit the ability of the disabled individuals to earn an adequate income. The proportion of physically
disabled individuals is increasing nationwide due to overall increased longevity and lower fatality rates.
Mentally disabled individuals include those disabled by a psychiatric illness or injury, including
schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, AIDS-related infections and conditions related to brain trauma.
Disabilities tabulated by the Census include sensory, physical and mental limitations. According to the
2008-2011 ACS, 5,234 Fountain Valley residents (9.5 percent of the City population) have a disability.
Disabilities of these residents included each of the categories tabulated by the Census, with most
persons having physical disabilities.
Of Fountain Valley’s disabled residents, 269 were under the age of 18. 1,938 were between the ages of
18 and 64. 3,027 were over the age of 65.
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State Housing Element law to require the analysis of
the disabled to include an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental

                                                           2014-2021 Housing Element
disabilities. According to Section 4512 of the State Welfare and Institutions Code, a "developmental
disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old,
continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
individual. This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism, as well as disabling
conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that
required for individuals with mental retardation. The definition does not include other disabilities that
are solely physical in nature.
Many persons with developmental disabilities can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. Individuals with more severe disabilities may require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Supportive housing for
persons with developmental disabilities is often needed during the the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services provides community-based services to approximately
243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21
regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Regional
Center of Orange County serves the City of Fountain Valley, and other cities in Orange County and
provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The Center is a private,
non-profit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
The US Census does not have specific information regarding persons with developmental disabilities.
However, each regional center maintains an accounting of the number of persons served. The Regional
Center of Orange County serves 280 Fountain Valley residents with developmental disabilities. Of these
persons, 113 are under the age of 14 and 57 are between the ages of 15 and 22. Four are 65 years or
older. The remaining are between the ages of 23 and 64.
Access and affordability are the major housing needs of a disabled person. Physically disabled persons
often require specially designed dwellings to permit access within the unit, as well as to and from the
site. The disabled, like the elderly have special needs with regard to location. Because of their limited
mobility, the disabled often need to live close or have transportation assistance to shopping and
medical facilities.
There are a number of housing types and opportunities appropriate for people living with a
developmental disability, including rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family
homes, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. SB
962 homes are licensed residential facilities for adults with developmental disabilities who are
medically fragile and require around the clock licensed nursing support. Within the City of Fountain
Valley, there is one development (Guadalupe Manor) which reserves seven units for low-income persons
with disabilities. In addition, there are two of small licensed residential care facilities within the City
(Singh's Family Care Home and Center Care Home) which provide housing for persons with
developmental disabilities. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services
and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities are some of the considerations that are
important in serving this group. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multifamily housing (as
required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest
range of choices for residents with disabilities. Special consideration should also be given to the
affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
City Approach to Meeting Disabled Needs: Fair Housing Accessibility Standards and California
Administrative Code Title 24 sets forth access and adaptability requirements for the physically
handicapped (disabled). These regulations apply to public buildings such as motels, employee housing,
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                           Page | 2-17

                                                         2014-2021 Housing Element
factory-built housing and privately funded newly constructed apartment houses containing five or
more dwelling units. The regulations also require that ramp ways, larger door widths, restroom
modifications, etc. be designed to enable free access. Such standards, however, are not mandatory of
new single family residential construction. The City of Fountain Valley provides grants and rebates to
low and moderate income disabled persons for accessibility modifications to the single family homes.
The City has adopted a Reasonable Accommodations in Housing to Disabled or Handicapped Individuals
Ordinance. The purpose of this ordinance is to provide a process for individuals with disabilities to
make requests for, and be provided, reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning
regulations to housing. This ordinance will comply with Fair Housing Laws, and is administered by the
City Planning Department. Table 9, shows the Special Needs Household Categories in Fountain Valley
including disabled.
In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will
implement programs to coordinate with the Regional Center of Orange County to promote
opportunities for supportive living services and support efforts to eliminate barriers for housing for
persons with developmental disabilities.
Female Head of Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their greater needs
for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female head of households with children in particular
tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group. According to the 2007-
2011 ACS, Fountain Valley has 276 female-headed households with children 18 years or younger and
with an income below the federal poverty level. These special needs households comprise 1.5 percent
of the City’s total households. Countywide, female head of households comprise 16.0 percent of the
population, of which 15.4 percent (or 2.5 percent of all County households) have children 18 years or
younger and live in poverty.
An issue affecting all family households, especially those headed by females, is finding quality,
affordable childcare. Many households find this a severe constraint, and in the case of a single parent
household, the parent may become unable to work. As a result, the parent cannot provide basic
necessities, such as food and housing to their children.
Although female head of households in Fountain Valley represent a smaller special needs group than
elderly and disabled persons, the Housing Element provides for the needs of this group through policies
that promote maintenance and construction of affordable housing, specifically in areas close to
commercial districts and transportation corridors.
City Approach to Meeting Female Head of Households Needs: The City has been active increasing
the supply and ensuring the maintenance of affordable housing through programs such as the Orange
County Housing Authority Section 8 Housing Program, which administers financial assistance to lower
income households seeking to rent housing in the private market (described in Section V.D.4, below).
The City has assisted with the development of a number of housing projects, two of which provide
affordable housing to female head of households. These include:
        Heil Park – 24 two- and three-bedroom condominiums, constructed in 1993 and limited to
         homebuyers whose incomes do not exceed 80% of the County median.
        Centre Park – 15 single family homes, constructed in 1996 and limited to moderate income
         homebuyer.

Table 2-9, shows the Special Needs Household Categories in Fountain Valley including female head of
Households.
Farmworkers
The 2007-2011 ACS estimates that 108 Fountain Valley residents (0.4 percent of the population) are
employed in agriculture or related industries. There are no designated agricultural uses in or adjacent
to Fountain Valley. Persons employed in this broad category are most likely associated with landscape
and horticultural jobs. Consequently, farm workers are not a special housing needs group in Fountain
Valley.
Homeless People
During the past decade, homelessness has become an increasingly reported problem throughout the
state. Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness included the general lack of housing affordable
to low and very low income persons, an increased number of persons whose incomes fall below the
poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and the de-institutionalization of the mentally
ill.
The most recent data regarding the homeless population in Orange County comes from the 2011 Orange
County Homeless Census and Survey. The 2011 Homeless Census estimates 18,325 episodes of
homelessness in the County over a 12-month period. The duration of an episode could be a range from
a single day to many months. The majority of homeless individuals in Orange County were white males
between the ages of 31 and 60. Single individuals made up 75 percent of the point-in-time homeless
population, while persons in families made up 25 percent. Nearly two-thirds of homeless persons in
Orange County were unsheltered. Job loss and substance use were the top two causes of homelessness.
City Approach to Meeting Homeless Needs: Due to limited funds for homeless studies specifically for
the City and the transient nature of homelessness, it is unknown the number of homeless within the
City. However, the City’s Police Department estimates there are approximately 40 homeless persons in
Fountain Valley. Around 20 persons are chronic homeless that police officers observe in the City on a
regular basis. The remaining are persons who are temporarily homeless or travel in and out of the
City 3. The Police Department will occasionally refer victims of domestic violence to shelters.
Additionally, city staff makes referrals to clients who are needing shelter and other supportive
services. The backbone of Fountain Valley’s outreach efforts to homeless lies in its Public Service
Agency (PSA) Grant Program that gives funds to shelters.
The City of Fountain Valley is also a member of the County of Orange’s Continuum of Care (COC). The
COC is a regional effort to to address homelessness. Through this collaboration regional homeless
information is gathered.
Fountain Valley commits staff to the COC planning and implementation process, and provides the COC
Steering Committee critical information regarding the types of resources and programs Fountain Valley
currently funds that assist the homeless.
Current facilities serving the Fountain Valley community are shown in Table 2-11. These facilities offer
emergency and short-term shelter, as well as financial, employment and family counseling.

Single-Room Occupancy Units (SROs):
There are two hotels and one motel in the City, and a recently completed project (Ayres Hotel).
Although, the City does not have the appropriate building stock to accommodate SRO development, the
City is committed to satisfying to HCD’s interpretation of Assembly Bill No. 2634. Consequently, City
amended its Zoning Code to allow SRO’s in the C-2 zone subject to a Conditional Use Permit.
Transitional and Supportive Housing:
Transitional and supportive housing must be considered residential uses subject only to those
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. For example, if the
transitional housing is a multifamily use proposed in a multifamily zone, the zoning should treat the
transitional unit the same as other multifamily uses proposed in the zone.
The City currently allows Transitional and Residential Care Facilities-Large (Supportive Housing-7+) in
Multifamily Zone with a conditional use permit. These facilities are subject to the same requirements
as a traditional multifamily development. The City has included a policy in this Housing Element to
review and revise the Zoning Code to define transitional and supportive housing and target population
and to revise provisions for these uses as appropriate in compliance with State law.
C.       Housing Characteristics
A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile home, or a single room occupied as a separate
living quarter or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as a separate living quarter. Separate living
quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the
building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. A
community's housing stock is the compilation of all its housing units.

1.       Housing Growth
According to the 2007-2011 ACS and City building permit records, 40 percent of Fountain Valley’s
housing was built between 1970 and 1979. Over 37 percent were constructed from 1960 to 1969.
Housing growth slowed starting in the 1980’s.

2.       Housing Type
Fountain Valley is primarily a community of single family houses. As shown in Table 2-13, the
California Department of Finance (DOF) estimates that 14,500 (approximately 75 percent of the City’s
total housing stock) are single family units, most of which are detached units. Multifamily units range
in size from duplex to over 20 units in a complex, and total 4,276 (approximately 22 percent) of the
City housing stock. Only 391 units (2 percent of the City housing stock) are mobile homes.

3.       Age and Condition of Housing Stock
Most homes begin to exhibit signs of decay when they approach thirty years of age. Common repairs
needed include new roofs, wall plaster and stucco. Homes thirty years or over with deferred
maintenance require more substantial repairs, such as new siding, plumbing or multiple repairs to the
roof, walls, etc. As illustrated in Table 2-13, above, the majority of Fountain Valley’s housing stock
(81.5 percent) was constructed prior to 1980.
Understanding the aging character of its housing stock, the City of Fountain Valley actively monitors
the condition of its housing stock. According to the City’s 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan, most of the
City’s housing inventory is sound. The majority of Fountain Valley’s housing stock now exceeds 40
years. While a few units in the City qualify as being in need of substantial rehabilitation, many units
located within older tracts are showing a need for minor to moderate rehabilitation.
As identified by the 2007-2011 ACS, 0.3 percent of the housing units in the City lack complete plumbing
facilities and 1.8 percent lack complete kitchen facilities.
According to a September 2008 windshield survey of the City residential neighborhoods conducted by
City staff, 371 single family dwelling units are in need of minor rehabilitation, such as exterior paint,
landscape maintenance and junk removal. Another 185 single family dwellings were found to need
moderate rehabilitation, including new roof, window replacement and fence or wall repair. Finally, 68
single family dwelling units were found to be generally deteriorated, needing substantial
rehabilitation, including major remodels or demolition and replacement.
City Housing Maintenance Efforts: As part of an ongoing effort to preserve and enhance its
residential neighborhoods, the City of Fountain Valley offers federal (CDBG) assistance to qualified
homeowners. Eligible improvements include interior/exterior painting; accessibility modifications;
stucco repair; roofing; plumbing, electrical and heating systems; termite eradication and damage
repair; weatherization; and room additions in over-crowded situations. Qualified households may
receive assistance under a maximum of two of the City’s three home improvement programs.
Households that qualify for participation in multiple programs may choose to use both sources of
assistance simultaneously or on separate occasions. Eligible households are those with incomes at low
or moderate income levels.
The City home improvement programs include the Single-Family Home Grant and the Mobile home
Rehabilitation Grant and Rebate Programs. A description of each of the City’s Home Improvement
Programs is provided below:
Grants: Under the City of Fountain Valley Single-Family Home Grant Program, qualified homeowners
may receive a grant of up to $9,500 for eligible repairs. The homeowner is not required to pay back any
portion of the financial assistance received under this program. The Single-Family Home Grant Program
is funded through a grant received from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD).
Rebates: Under the City of Fountain Valley Single-Family Home Rebate Program, qualified low-income
homeowners can receive a rebate of up to $7,500 for reimbursement of expenses incurred in
completing approved repairs/ improvements. Rebate amounts are set at 50% of the total cost of
improvements and are disbursed after the homeowner has paid for the initial cost of the
repairs/improvements.
Mobile home Rehabilitation Program: The City of Fountain Valley also offers financial assistance to
qualified low-income mobile home owners for the repair/rehabilitation of their mobile homes. Under
the City’s Neighborhood Preservation Program, qualified participants may receive up to $9,500 in
financial assistance in the form of a grant. Recipients of either type of assistance are not required to

pay back any portion of the financial assistance received.
Rebate amounts are set at 50% of the total cost of the improvements up to a maximum of $5,000.
Rebates are disbursed after the homeowner has paid for the costs of the repairs/improvements in full.
The City also operates a lead based paint hazard grant program that tests homes for lead based paint,
and provides funding assistance for the removal of the paint. To date, the City has tested 37 homes for
lead based paint, but only 2 have shown presence of lead beyond 600 parts per million.
In addition to these programs, City Code Enforcement program ensures properties are maintained
according to City codes. The Neighborhood Improvement and Community enhancement (Nice
Neighborhoods) program combines code enforcement with community outreach. Through the Nice
Neighborhoods program, the City targets neighborhoods in need of area wide clean-up, providing area
wide trash hauling and a tool lending program.
4.       Housing Costs
Housing costs are driven by the price of raw land, infrastructure costs (e.g. sewer and water),
construction costs, supply relative to demand, and financing costs. The diminishing supply of
developable land in Fountain Valley and the recent rapid rise in residential real estate prices that has
occurred throughout the southern California region, have driven up the cost of both ownership and
rental housing in Fountain Valley.
Ownership Housing
Most ownership housing in Fountain Valley is single family homes. The value of these homes varies
based on the type, size and location. Smaller condominium units are typically the least expensive,
while large upgraded single family homes are typically the most expensive.
For-sale home prices have declined in Fountain Valley and neighboring areas during the past five years.

Rental Housing
The rental housing market in Fountain Valley is comprised primarily of apartments and single family
homes. Rental rates have continued to increase at a steady pace over the past years. Table 2-15,

rental rates have risen from an average of 24 percent; and between 2000 and 2012 an average of 35
percent. As of the third quarter of 2012, the average rental price in Fountain Valley is $1,433.

Vacancy Rates
The residential vacancy rate, a translation of the number of unoccupied housing units on the market, is
a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand in a community. When the
demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy rate will be low. Concurrently, a low
vacancy rate drives the cost of housing upward to the disadvantage of prospective buyers or renters.
In a healthy housing market, the vacancy rate would be between 5.0 and 8.0 percent. These vacant
units should be distributed across a variety of housing types, sizes, price ranges and locations within
the City. This allows adequate selection opportunities for households seeking new residences.
The State of California Department of Finance reports that the overall City vacancy rate was 2.69 as of
January 2012 4. These rates indicate that the housing market is very tight with little room for buyers or
renters to find a suitable unit or negotiate a lower purchase or rental price.
Household Tenure
According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, there were 18,795 occupied housing units in
Fountain Valley. Of these units, 71.9 percent were owner-occupied and 28.1 percent were renter-
occupied.
Housing Affordability and Overpayment
Federal and state guidelines specify that households should not spend more than 30 percent of their
gross income on housing. SCAG reports that 49.6 of renter households in Fountain Valley spend more
than 30 percent of their income on housing based on the 2005-2009 ACS. Of owner households, 37.8
percent are overpaying.

Based on 2005-2009 HUD CHAS data, 76 percent of extremely-low income households in Fountain Valley
experience overpayment. Fifty-eighth percent of very-low income and 64 percent of low income
households experience overpayment.
Table 2-16, below, estimates the maximum housing costs affordable to Extremely Low, Very Low
Income, Low Income and Moderate Income households based on HCD established income criteria. In the
case of rent, the 30 percent assumes utilities are included in the monthly rental cost. Utilities may
include water, sewer, trash pickup, electric and gas, and may add $100 - $200 to the monthly cost of a
rental unit. In the case of purchase, the 30 percent includes payment on mortgage principal and
interest, plus property tax, homeowner insurance and utilities.
As indicated in Table 2-16, maximum housing costs affordable to an Extremely Low Income four-person
household are $166,050 to purchase a home and $723 per month to rent a home. For a Very Low
Income four-person household, maximum costs are $277,000 to purchase a home and $1,204 per month
to rent a home. For a Low Income four-person household, the maximum affordable housing costs are
$442,500 to purchase a home and $11,926 per month to rent a home.
As presented above, the current sales price for a home in the City currently averages $534,400. The
average sales price is above the affordable purchase price for lower-income households.
As presented in Table 2-15, a 2-bedroom Fountain Valley apartment rents at an average 1,568 per
month. These costs are above the reach of the Extremely Low and Very Low Income households.

D.       Assisted Housing
State law requires the City to identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve housing units that
are currently deed restricted to low income housing use and will possibly be lost as low-income housing
as these deed restrictions expire. This section identifies those units in Fountain Valley, analyzes their
potential to convert to non-low income housing uses and analyzes the costs to preserve and/or replace
those units.
This section also identifies assisted low income housing not at risk of converting to market rate. Goals,
policies and programs to preserve these assisted units are presented later in Section V.B. of this
Housing Element.
1.       Inventory of At-Risk Housing
This section identifies all of the low income rental housing units in the City of Fountain Valley that are
at risk of converting to losing their affordability because of expiring use restrictions or contracts during
the next five years (through 2018) or the next ten years (through 2023). Table 2-17, shows all of the
assisted units including a review of all rental units assisted under federal, state and/or local programs,
including HUD programs, state and local bond programs, and local in lieu of fees, inclusionary, density
bonus, or direct assistance programs. The inventory also covers all units that are eligible to change to
non-low income housing units due to termination of a subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or
expiring use restrictions. The inventory was compiled based on information provided by City staff.
The City of Fountain Valley has five housing projects which are funded exclusively with federal housing
programs or with a combination of federal and local sources. They provide affordable housing units for
senior citizens, disabled persons, large households, and low and moderate-income households in the
City. Of the five projects listed, one has affordability requirements expire in the next five years and
one has affordability requiremetns that will expire in the next 10 years.
The Section 202 loan used to fund the Guadalupe Manor will expire in 2018. The City desires to keep
the Guadalupe Manor affordable. This project recently sold. Prior to the sale, staff met with the
potential buyers to discuss their responsibilities. This project’s affordability covenants were
transferred to the new owners thereby keeping the project affordable until 2018.
The Housing Division continues to be responsible for the monitoring of all affordable housing units. Well
in advance of any expiration, the City will contact non-profit housing agencies including Orange
Housing Development Corporation, Linc Housing, Jamboree Housing, Mercy House and other reputable
affordable housing groups to discuss options to ensure the units at-risk continue to be affordable.
Table 2-17 summarizes the housing units with income restrictions in Fountain Valley.

III. CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION
A variety of factors adds to the cost of housing in Fountain Valley and constrains the provision of
affordable units. These include market and governmental constraints. Potential and actual constraints
to the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities also impact
housing production and availability.
The extent to which these constraints are affecting the supply and affordability of housing in the City
of Fountain Valley is discussed below.
A.        Market Constraints
The most significant factor affecting the affordability of housing within the City of Fountain Valley is
the disparity between housing cost and household income for households within the Extremely Low and
Very Low Income levels. The high cost of housing relative to income is a region-wide concern. In
Fountain Valley, housing cost is driven up by the high cost of land, attributable, at least in part, to the
limited supply of vacant, developable land. High construction costs, labor costs, and construction
liability concerns also contribute to the high cost of housing.
1.        Land Costs
Fountain Valley is almost entirely built out. Only small infill residential sites remain. These residential
sites are scattered parcels and are listed in Chapter V. Recent estimates provided by City staff indicate
that residential land cost varies between $25 and $40 per square foot, depending on site size and land
use designation.
2.        Construction Costs
Construction costs are also very high, and continue to rise as the both the cost of materials and labor
increase due to current heavy construction demands occurring regionally and internationally. Recent
estimates provided by City staff indicate that residential construction cost is currently about $145 -
$170 per square foot.
3.        Financing
Home mortgage interest rates have been at historic lows during the past ten years. However starting
about five years ago, there was a sharp rise in foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market. Increases
in interest rates coupled with declining property values in the Orange County region caused many home
owners to default on the mortgages. Unable to recoup their investments, a number of lenders shut
down or filed for bankruptcy.
This mortgage crisis made qualifying for a home loan more difficult. Although 30-year fixed rate
mortgages are available at about 3.5 percent as of February 2013 (Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage
Market Survey), the income and down payment requirements are more stringent. There are also fewer
flexible loan programs to bridge the gap between the amount of a required down payment and a
potential homeowner’s available funds.
B.        Governmental Constraints
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                            Page | 3-1

                                                         2014-2021 Housing Element
Housing affordability is influenced by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions by the City
and by the surrounding jurisdictions influence the amount of housing developed, its type, form,
location, and ultimate price. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees
and other local programs intended to improve the overall quality of housing may have the unintended
consequence of serving as a constraint to housing development. Based on the information provided
below, the City land use controls, fees and permitting processes do not present a constraint to
residential development.
1.       Land Use Controls
The Fountain Valley General Plan and Municipal Ordinance provide for a range of housing types and
densities. Residential uses are permitted in the following zones that include both residential only
zones and commercial mixed-use zones. The information presented below generally represents all the
zoning standards applied to housing, plus the standards contained in the City Specific Plans, which have
standards that are more explicit than the Zoning Code.
Development Standards by Residential Zoning District: A summary of City residential zoning districts
is provided below.
R-1 (Single Family Residential): Permits one dwelling unit with a minimum lot size of 7,200 square
feet or 6,000 square feet if part of a planned development area. Maximum permitted building height is
27 feet. Parking requires 2 spaces, or 3 spaces with 5 or more bedrooms. Affordable housing and small
residential care homes are permitted uses in this zone.
G-H (Garden Home District): Permits one and two dwelling units with a minimum lot size of 1,800
square feet and a minimum project area of 5 acres. Maximum permitted density is 10.8 units per acre;
and maximum permitted building height is 30 feet. Parking requires 2 spaces, or 3 spaces with 5 or
more bedrooms. Affordable housing and small residential care homes are permitted uses in this zone.

to 10 dwellings per acre pursuant to a conditional use permit, with a minimum lot size of 7,200 square
feet. Maximum permitted building height is 28 feet for 2 stories and 35 feet for 3 stories. Parking for
multiple dwellings is Studio, bachelor or one bedroom unit: 1.5 spaces for each unit with 1 space per

15 dwellings per acre pursuant to a conditional use permit, with a minimum lot size of 7,200 square
feet. Maximum permitted building height is 28 feet for 2 stories and 35 feet for 3 stories. Parking for
multiple dwellings is Studio, bachelor or one bedroom unit: 1.5 spaces for each unit with 1 space per
unit in a garage/carport. 2 or more bedroom unit: 2 spaces for each unit plus 0.5 additional spaces for
each bedroom over 2, 1 enclosed space per 2 bedroom unit and 2 enclosed spaces for 3 or more
bedroom units. Affordable housing and small residential care homes are permitted uses in this zone.
R-4 (High Density Multiple Dwelling): Permits two dwelling units, and multiple dwellings of up to 30
dwellings per acre pursuant to a conditional use permit, with a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet.
Maximum permitted building height is 28 feet for 2 stories and 35 feet for 3 stories. Parking for
multiple dwellings is Studio, bachelor or one bedroom unit: 1.5 spaces for each unit with 1 space per
unit in a garage/carport. 2 or more bedroom unit: 2 spaces for each unit plus 0.5 additional spaces for
each bedroom over 2, 1 enclosed space per 2 bedroom unit and 2 enclosed spaces for 3 or more
bedroom units. Affordable housing and small residential care homes are permitted uses in this zone.
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                            Page | 3-2
                                                          2014-2021 Housing Element
Specific Plans: The City has successfully utilized Specific Plans for projects instead of zone changes for
several projects. From past experience, and proven track record, the City has found that by tailoring
the requirements specifically for the project, the developer and City goals can be met. By allowing
increases in density and/or height requirements or reducing parking and/or setback requirements the
most feasible projects have been created. The City makes a determination on a project by project
basis the number of du/ac based on the number of du/ac in the adjacent areas and what the project
can support realistically. Based on the City’s experience, the use of the Specific Plan process is the
most effective means of achieving high density residential development.
Housing Opportunity Overlays: The City has adopted two housing opportunity overlays (-HO1 and –
HO2). These overlays permit residential development by-right. These parcels within the housing
opportunity overlays are reserved for residential uses only. If the property owner requests a waiver to
develop a parcel within the housing opportunity overlays with non-residential uses, the waiver request
must demonstrate the availability of appropriately zoned alternative sites to accommodate the City’s
remaining RHNA need prior to granting the waiver request.
-HO1 (Housing Opportunity Overlay Area #1): Permits by-right residential development at a maximum
of 10.8 du/ac based. Projects within this overlay must comply with the development standards of the
GH Zone.
-HO2 (Housing Opportunity Overlay Area #2): Permits by-right residential development at a maximum
of 30 du/ac. Projects within this overlay must comply with the development standards of the R-4 zone.
Density Bonus: The City’s Zoning Code includes incentives for the production of affordable housing,
senior housing, and child care facilities in compliance with State Government Code Section 65915 et
seq., regarding density bonuses and other incentives. To qualify for Affordable Housing Density Bonus
Incentives the developer of a proposed housing project of at least five units, must provide housing units
affordable to certain income households, donate land, and/or construct a child care facility or provide
qualifying senior housing pursuant to State Government Code Section 65915 et seq. The review of an
application for a density bonus and concession or incentive request is as a planning application
pursuant to Chapter 21.32 of the Municipal Code. The Planning Department reviews the application for
its conformance with California Government Code Section 65915 et seq., and applicable City codes and
make a report to the Planning Commission. If the application involves a request for direct financial
incentives, then any action by the Planning Commission on the application is advisory only, and the City
Council has the authority to make the final decision on the application.
Second Units: In addition to the single family and multifamily units identified above, second units are
governed by Section 21.08.030 of the Fountain Valley Municipal Code. Second units are permitted by
right in every residential zone. The development standards governing these units include: a minimum
residential lot size of 7,200 square feet, and that the second unit be included in the overall floor area
ratio for the lot.
Other Density Provisions: The City allows up to 35 dwelling units per acre for senior housing
development, and an unspecified density (minimum of 20 units) through the Specific Plan process. As
an example, the Warner/Newhope Specific Plan approved by the City in September 2004, and
subsequently amended, permits high density housing. (Reference Section V.A.1, below for a discussion
of Warner/Newhope Specific Plan multifamily residential projects.)
Building Codes: The City of Fountain Valley has adopted the 2010 California Code, Residential Code
and Green Building Standards Code. These building codes are followed uniformly by California cities,
and consequently, is not considered a constraint to development of affordable housing. Fountain
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                            Page | 3-3

Valley’s code enforcement is generally reactive rather than pro-active. Code enforcement is pro-
active, however, if there is an imminent threat to public health, safety, and welfare.
Site Improvements: Development in Fountain Valley occurs largely on in-fill parcels, fully served by
roads and infrastructure. Although the developer may be required to provide improvements for their
project frontage, such as streetscape and street improvements (e.g. curb cuts), there are generally
minimal site improvement costs associated with development in Fountain Valley. Consequently, site
improvement costs are not considered a constraint to development of affordable housing.
Parking Requirement Reductions: The City has a standing policy to allow the reduction of required
parking for senior citizen and other qualified affordable multifamily development projects. The
reduction of parking requirements are determined by the size of the development. The distance to
public transportation and other considerations that would produce a quality development and not
produce overflow parking on to adjacent properties The statutory parking requirements have been
reduced to allow more affordable units to be build. A listing of parking requirement reductions granted
to date by the City are listed below by project, parking required, parking granted and expanded
development area achieved. A recent example is the Los Caballeros development where shared parking
was permitted with adjacent manufacturing and office uses.

2.       Development Fees
Development fees that apply to residential development in Fountain Valley are low relative to most
areas in California. Fees are set annually by the City Council based on the actual cost of services. As a
result, most development fees are set in line with the actual services.

These fees, calculated based on actual costs, are similar to many other Orange County cities. Appendix
B presents the results of a 2011-2012 survey by the Building Industry Association (BIA) for selected
Orange County cities, including Fountain Valley, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Huntington
Beach. As indicated by the survey results, Fountain Valley’s fees are similar or less than other
neighboring cities. Fountain Valley development and building fees do not act as a constraint to
development.
3.       Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by City procedures contributes to the cost of housing in
that holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately reflected in the unit’s selling price. The City's
goal is to expedite processing of all residential development applications.
In Fountain Valley, individual single-family houses and duplexes are reviewed over a 10 day period by
the Planning and Building staff. Total time to process these permits are typically 30-60 days.
Multifamily projects and single-family tract projects are reviewed by the City Planning Commission,
typically within 30-60 days of application submission. Projects requiring zone changes or General Plan
amendments are processed within 90-120 days and require Planning Commission and City Council
review.
Fountain Valley’s development approval process is designed to accommodate development. Currently,
the City does not have a formal procedure for expediting projects with affordability components.
Because of the reasonable and relatively quick processing times provided by the City, these
requirements are expected to facilitate, rather than hinder, new residential development.
The City’s typical land use review process for multifamily (which includes Specific Plan zones) and
single family developments are summarized in the following flow charts:

C.        Constraints to Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Constraints to the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities
impact housing production and availability. Recent changes to state law, including Government Code
Sections 65583(a)(4) and 65583(c)(3), address the provision of accessible housing for disabled persons.
These changes require that the Housing Element include an analysis of potential and actual
governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all
income levels and for persons with disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing
and permit procedures. These changes also require that the Housing Element address methods for
removing governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing,
including housing for all income levels and housing for persons with disabilities.
Fountain Valley endeavors to accommodate disabled access and to comply with the recent changes to
state law. The City has adopted a reasonable accommodation ordinance. The ordinance allows
individuals to apply to the City for exemptions from City housing related land use, zoning, or building
laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures in order to reasonably accommodate their disability.
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                            Page | 3-7

The City Planning Director reviews and acts on the applications. The ordinance requires that the
Director issue a written determination within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of a completed
application and may (1) grant the accommodation request, (2) grant the accommodation request
subject to specified nondiscriminatory conditions, (3) deny the request, or (4) may refer the matter to
the Planning Commission, which shall render a decision on the application in the same manner as it
considers an appeal.
Other City efforts to accommodate the disabled include the fitting of arterial streets with curb cuts,
disabled access signal controls and seeing impaired crossing signals. The City has adopted the
California Building Code, including all provisions related to facilitating disabled access. These
provisions are strictly enforced by the City Building Official. Further, according to the City Zoning
Ordinance, ramps and platforms necessary to accommodate disabled access are permitted to intrude
into required setbacks. Should added allowances be needed to accommodate disabled access, these
are processed as a Reasonable Accommodation application reviewed by the City Planning Director.
The City of Fountain Valley provides grants and loans to low and moderate income disabled persons for
accessibility modifications to the single family homes.
Residential Care Facilities: According to the Fountain Valley Zoning Code, “family” means:
         “Family” means one or more persons occupying a premises and living as a single nonprofit
         housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a boarding or lodging house, hotel,
         club or similar dwelling for group use. A family shall be deemed to include domestic help
         employed by the family.
The City Zoning Code defines “residential care facilities”:
         “Residential care homes” means facilities providing residential social and personal care for
         children, the elderly, and people with limited ability for self-care, but where medical care is
         not a major element. Includes: children’s homes; board and care homes; transitional houses;
         rehabilitation centers; self-help group homes.
The City permits small residential care facilities that serve 6 or fewer clients in every residential zone.
Large residential care facilities serving more than 6 clients are permitted in every residential zone
pursuant to a conditional use permit. The City Zoning Code does not regulate concentrations of group
homes or contain specific site planning criteria for group homes. Any group home would be regulated
by the zoning district in which it locates. Large residential care facilities are required to add one
parking space per each employee. Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) grants are
available for American Disabilities Act (ADA) improvements to facilities.
Regarding business licenses, the City follows California Health and Safety Code Section 1566.2, for
residential facilities with six or fewer persons. The code says that they shall not be subject to any
business taxes, local registration fees, use permits, fees, or other fees.
In addition, the City provides CDBG grants for American Disabilities Act (ADA) improvements to
facilities.
D.       Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints to housing include natural hazards that limit the development potential of
land or increase the cost of development. In Fountain Valley, environmental constraints that could
impact housing development include: flooding hazards; Seismic hazards; and Noise. Land available for
residential construction is discussed in Section V. Residential Land Resources.
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                            Page | 3-8

1.       Flooding
The Santa Ana River forms the eastern boundary of Fountain Valley. With the river’s influence and the
City’s level terrain, 88 percent of the City is within the FEMA designated Zone X, equivalent to the
formerly designated 100 year floodplain. Storm drain facilities required for construction in flood prone
areas add to the cost of high density residential development. None of the potential affordable housing
sites identified in Table 19 are located in a designated floodplain.
2.       Liquefaction
According to the City Public Safety Element of the General Plan, approximately half of the City is in a
high liquefaction zone, with ground water less than 10 feet below the surface. These high liquefaction
areas are generally along the City’s eastern boundary, adjacent to the Santa Ana River and south and
west of the Interstate 405. It is largely infeasible or cost prohibitive to construct underground parking
in high liquefaction zones of the City. This is a serious constraint to high density development which
often depends on subterranean parking to achieve residential densities of 30 dwelling units per acre,
which is the default density for affordable housing as specified by AB 2348. None of the potential
affordable housing sites identified in Table 19 are located in a designated liquefaction zone.
 3.      Seismicity
Like the entire Southern California region, Fountain Valley is located in an area of high seismic activity.
Although no active faults cross the City, Fountain Valley is located close to five major fault zones. This
proximity subjects the area to potential surface rupture, ground shaking and ground failure.
Requirements to ensure buildings, especially multi-story buildings are secure from seismic hazards, add
to the cost of high density residential development. None of the potential affordable housing sites
identified in Table 19 are located on an identified active fault.
4.       Noise
Residential land uses are sensitive to loud noises. Vehicular traffic from the Interstate 405 Freeway,
which bisects the City, is the largest noise source in Fountain Valley. Potential sites located proximate
to the freeway are considered infeasible for residential development. None of the potential affordable
housing sites identified in Table 19 are located in a noise impacted area.
E.       Removal of Housing Constraints
1.       Availability of Public Services and Facilities
Fountain Valley is largely built-out. New residential development will occur as infill or redevelopment.
Public facilities are readily available to accommodate development throughout Fountain Valley. The
City’s roadway and infrastructure system is in place and capable of accommodating additional
residential development pursuant to the City General Plan. There is adequate water volume and sewer
capacity available to accommodate additional residential development pursuant to the City General
Plan, including the City’s RHNA requirements.
All new development projects in the City are required to comply with the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit and Waste Discharge Requirements for Orange County. To comply
with NPDES requirements, the City has incorporated the Stormwater Quality Management Plan (SQMP)
developed by the County of Orange Department of Public Works, Watershed Division. The City’s SQMP
is a reference document that serves as the basis for its storm water management program. The City’s
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                            Page | 3-9

                                                          2014-2021 Housing Element
version consists of the following programs: development planning; development construction; illicit
connection/discharge detection and elimination program; industrial/commercial inspection, and public
information.
There are minimum water quality protection requirements for development construction projects.
Unless exempted, all development construction projects will be required to implement best
management practices (BMPs) necessary to reduce pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP)
to meet the minimum water quality protection requirements. Construction activities include activities
such as clearing, grading, excavation, road construction, structure construction, or structure
demolition that result in soil disturbance.
2.       Removal of Market Constraints
The City follows the latest state legislation regarding energy efficiency and sustainable development,
including AB 32. As specific implementation measures are promulgated pursuant to AB 32, the City will
adopt these measures as feasible and as required, including adoption of a green building code and
operation of low emission City vehicles.
3.       Removal of Governmental Constraints
As discussed under Section III.B. above, the City Zoning Code provides ample opportunity for residential
development of varying types and densities. The City also endeavors to provide expedited processing
of all residential development applications. Current City land use and development processes therefore
have not been considered a constraint to housing development.
4.       Equal Opportunity Constraints
The City contracts with an effective private fair housing organization, Fair Housing Council of Orange
County (FHCOC), to provide comprehensive educational and enforcement programs to its residents. The
FHCOC provides fair housing community education, fair housing enforcement, tenant legal assistance,
housing dispute evaluation & resolution and a mediation program. The FHCOC provides training for
members of the city’s staff on the elements of fair housing. The FHCOC also promotes fair housing
education within the banking and lending industry. City staff refer residents to the FHCOC when
residents request information on the services that the FHCOC provide. Additionally, informational
handouts are available at City Hall, as well as on the City of Fountain Valley’s website.
Between FY 2007-2008 and FY 2011-2012, the FHCOC assisted an average of 64 households annually
from Fountain Valley. Issues addressed included issues between renters and landlords including
security deposits, discrimination, substandard conditions, harassment, unlawful detainers, etc. The
majority of the issues were resolved without being referred to court or mediation. During FY 2012-
2013, it is estimated that the FHCOC will provide fair housing services to over 60 Fountain Valley
residents with approximately 180 cases. The City’s involvement with the FHCOC adequately addresses
possible constraints relative to equal opportunity housing.
F.        Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Under current law, this Fountain Valley Housing Element must include analysis of opportunities for
energy conservation with respect to residential development. Government Code Section 65583(a)(7).
The Legislature in 1974 created the California Energy Commission to deal with the issue of energy
conservation. The Commission in 1977 adopted conservation standards for new buildings. The
Legislature directed the Commission to periodically improve the standards to account for state-of-the-
art energy efficient building design. The Commission has adopted revised energy standards for new
City of Fountain Valley General Plan                                                        Page | 3-10

                                                          2014-2021 Housing Element
residential buildings. The revised energy conservation standards for new residential buildings have
been placed in Title 24 of the California Administrative code. The new standards apply to all new
residential buildings (and additions to residential buildings) except hotels, motels, and buildings with
four or more habitable stories and hotels. The regulations specify energy saving design for walls,
ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling
devices, conservation standards and the use of nondepleting energy sources, such as solar energy or
wind power. Compliance with Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations on the use of energy
efficient appliances and insulation has reduced energy demand stemming from new residential
development. Included in Title 24 is the California Green Buildings Standards Code (Cal Green). Cal
Green includes standards to incorporate green building practices and technologies in both residential
and non-residential uses.
In relation to new residential development, and especially affordable housing, construction of an
energy efficient building does add to the original production costs of ownership and rental housing.
Over time, however, the housing with energy conservation features should have reduced occupancy
costs because the consumption of fuel and electricity is decreased. This means the monthly housing
costs may be equal to or less than what they otherwise would have been if no energy conservation
devices were incorporated in the new residential buildings. Reduced energy consumption in new
residential structures is one way of achieving affordable housing costs when those costs are measured
in monthly carrying costs as contrasted to original sales price or production costs.
Strategies a developer can undertake to achieve energy efficient construction include:
     Locating the structure on the northern portion of the sunniest area on the site.
     Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the building and to reduce
      exposure to extreme weather conditions.
     Locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and placing
      corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north face of the building to
      serve as a buffer between heated spaces the colder north face.
     Making the main entrance a small, enclosed space that creates an air lock between the building
      and its exterior; orienting the entrance away from prevailing winds; or using a windbreak to
      reduce the wind velocity against the entrance.
     Locating window openings to the south and keeping east, west and north windows small,
      recessed, and double-glazed.
These and other potential energy efficient opportunities are evaluated and promoted by the City
during the site plan review process.
Strategies to support energy conservation that are supported by the City include provision of SCE
energy savings brochure at City Hall and the Senior Center. The City is working to be a role model
through the Orange County Cities Energy Partnership to identify and create projects to improve long
term energy efficiency and sustainability of municipal operations. In addition, the City follows the
latest state legislation regarding energy efficiency and sustainable development, including AB 32. As
specific implementation measures are promulgated pursuant to AB 32, the City will adopt these
measures as feasible and as required.

G.       Financial Resources
There are a variety of potential funding sources available to support affordable housing in the City of
Fountain Valley. They include the following:
1.       Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
Through the federal CDBG program, HUD provides funding for a range of community development
activities. CDBG grants are awarded for housing activities, including acquisition, rehabilitation,
homebuyer assistance, economic development, homeless services and public services. CDBG funds are
subject to certain restrictions and generally cannot be used for new housing construction. CDBG grants
primarily benefit households with incomes not exceeding 80% of the county median family income.
The FY 2012-2013 entitlement allocation is $271,507. An additional $170,000 in carryover and program
income increases the total CDBG funding to $441,507. Table 3-2 summarizes the proposed funding for
programs using the CDBG funding.
                                                  Table 3-2
                                Community Development Block Grant Funds
                 Program                                      Funding
                 Home Improvement Programs                    $195,980
                 Code Enforcement                             $68,000
                 Public Service Agency Grant Program          $40,726
                 Lead Hazard Reduction Grant                  $7,500
                 Fair Housing                                 $4,932
                 ADA Improvements                             $75,000
                 Program Administration                       $49,369
2.       Section 108 Program
Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the CDBG program. This provision provides communities
with a source of financing for a variety of housing and economic development activities. All rules and
requirements of the CDBG program apply, and therefore all projects and activities must principally
benefit low and moderate income persons, aid in the elimination or prevention of blight, or meet
urgent needs of the community.
Monies received per the Section 108 loan guarantee program are limited to no more than five times the
applicant’s most recently approved CDBG amount, less prior Section 108 commitments. Activities
eligible for these funds include: economic development activities eligible under CDBG; acquisition of
real property; rehabilitation of publicly owned property; housing rehabilitation eligible under CDBG;
construction, reconstruction or installation of public facilities; related relocation, clearance or
installation of public facilities; payment of interest on the guaranteed loan and issuance costs of public
offerings; debt service reserves; and public works and site improvements.
Section 108 loans are secured and repaid by pledges of future and current CDBG funds. Additional
security requirements may also be imposed on a case by case basis.

3.       Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program
The federal Section 8 rental subsidy program provides rental assistance to low-income households.
With a Section 8 housing voucher, households pay 30-40% of their income towards housing and the
Housing Authority pays the rest, up to certain maximum rent limits. The vouchers are paid directly to
the landlords. The Housing Authority inspects its tenants’ units annually to ensure that health and
safety standards are met. This program also allows households to use their vouchers toward the
purchase of a home.
The Housing Authority manages approximately 463 Section 8 housing vouchers in the City of Fountain
Valley.
4.       Section 202/811 Housing for Elderly or Disabled
Under this federally administered program, direct loans are made to eligible, private nonprofit
organization and consumer operative sponsors to finance development of rental or cooperative housing
facilities for occupancy by elderly or disabled persons. The interest rates on such loans are determined
annually. Section 8 funds are made available for all of the Section 202 units for the elderly. Rental
assistance for 100% of the units for disabled persons has also recently been made available. Section
811 can be used to develop group homes, independent living facilities, and intermediate care facilities.
Private, nonprofit sponsors may qualify for Section 202 no interest capital financing loans. Households
of one or more persons, the head of which is at least 62 years old or is a qualified non-elderly disabled
person between the ages of 18 and 62, are eligible to live in these units.
5.       California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
CHFA is an agency of the state of California that administers programs that provide below market
interest rate mortgage capital through the sale of tax-exempt notes and bonds. CHFA sells tax-exempt
Mortgage Revenue Bonds to provide below market rate financing through approved private lenders to
first-time homebuyers for the purchase of new or existing homes. The program operates through
participating lenders who originate loans for CHFA purchase.
CHFA assists nonprofit housing development corporations that acquire land, provide building plans, and
package loans for self-help housing. Families, under the supervision of nonprofit corporations, provide
the majority of the construction labor. CHFA makes commitments to self-help corporations for low-
interest mortgages and provides credit enhancements to lenders who provide construction financing
and preferential interest rates.
CHFA also operates a Multifamily Rental Housing Mortgage Loan Program. This program finances the
construction or substantial rehabilitation of projects containing 20 or more units. In a project, 20% of
the units must be set aside for low income tenants at affordable rents for the greater of 15 years or as
long as the mortgage is outstanding.
6.       Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program
This State program provides for federal tax credits for private developers and investors that agree to
set aside all or a portion of their units for low income households and the elderly for no less than 15
years. A minimum of 20% of the units must be made available to families whose income is less than
50% of the County median income or 40% of the units must be made available to families whose income
is up to 80% of the median. Developers and investors must apply for an allocation of housing units from
the State Allocation Committee, administered by the Tax Credit Allocation Committee.

7.       Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bonds
Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bonds, as discussed above, are used to finance construction and
mortgage loans, as well as capital improvements for multifamily housing. Federal law requires 20% of
the units in an assisted project to be reserved for lower income households, whose income does not
exceed 80% of the median household income for the County. Funding for this program is administered
by the California Debt Limit allocation committee and has been extended indefinitely.
8.       General Funds
The City uses general revenue funds to support general City operations and a wide variety of programs.
Related to housing, the City uses general fund revenues to assist with code enforcement, infrastructure
improvements in residential neighborhoods, and rezoning efforts specified in the Housing Element
Implementation Plan.
9.       Mental Health Services Act (MHSA)
Proposition 63 (now known as the Mental Health Services Act or MHSA) was passed in November 2004
and provides increased funding, personnel and other resources to support county mental health
programs and monitor progress toward statewide goals for children, transition age youth, adults, older
adults and families. The Act addresses a broad continuum of prevention, early intervention and service
needs and the necessary infrastructure, technology and training elements that will effectively support
this system. $400 million in MHSA funds have been made available to finance the capital costs
associated with development, acquisition, construction and/or rehabilitation of permanent supportive
housing for individuals with mental illness and their families, especially including homeless individuals
with mental illness and their families.
H.       Agencies Involved in Housing in Fountain Valley
City efforts to provide affordable housing opportunities are assisted by the following agencies:
   Fountain Valley Housing Authority: The Fountain Valley Housing Authority is the primary agency
    providing affordable housing opportunities in Fountain Valley. The Housing Authority is the
    Successor Agency to the former Fountain Valley Redevelopment Agency.
   Orange County Housing Authority. The Orange County Housing Authority administers the Section 8
    rental subsidy program. Within Fountain Valley, 463 households participate in the Section 8 rental
    subsidy program as of 2012. Of these households, 83 are family households, 53 disabled households,
    and 327 elderly households.
   Fair Housing Council of Orange County: Fair housing information and tenant-landlord dispute
    mediation is available through Fair Housing Council of Orange County. Information and resources
    are provided to both tenants and landlords regarding their rights and responsibilities. The City of
    Fountain Valley contracts for provision of these services to its residents. Based on monthly
    tabulations prepared by the Fair Housing Council, most reported fair housing complaints were from
    renters complaining about unfair lease and eviction policies.
   Housing and Community Development Advisory Board: The Housing and Community Development
    (HCD) Advisory Board acts in accordance with local, state and federal laws. Among other tasks, the
    Board reviews the City’s on-going federally funded CDBG program and makes recommendations to

IV. HOUSING ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
Housing Element law requires cities to meet both local and regional housing needs. Fountain Valley’s
local housing needs are discussed in Sections II and III above. Fountain Valley’s regional housing needs
are established by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and are summarized
below.
The Housing Plan, presented in Section VI that follows, establishes specific policies and programs to
address these identified housing needs.
A.       Local Housing Assessment
Local housing needs, as discussed in Section II, have been identified based on information from the
2010 Census, the American Community Survey, and Community Development and Building Department
records. Based on this information, areas of local housing needs in Fountain Valley include:
     More affordable rental housing to accommodate the Extremely Low and Very Low Income
      households.
     More affordable and accessible housing for seniors and persons with disabilities.
     Monitoring and preservation of federally, state and locally assisted units that are at-risk of
      converting to market rate housing. Minor and moderate repair assistance for older housing
      structures.
B.       Regional Housing Assessment
State law requires jurisdictions to provide for their share of regional housing needs. As part of the
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
determines the housing growth needs by income category for cities within its jurisdiction, which
includes the City of Fountain Valley. RHNA determinations for the City of Fountain Valley during this
planning period are presented in Table 4-1. As illustrated in the Table, Fountain Valley is required to
provide adequate sites for the construction of 358 new dwelling units during this planning period. Of
these new units, 42 should be affordable to Extremely Low Income households (as a subset of Very Low
Income households), 83 to Very Low Income households, 59 to Low Income households, 65 to Moderate
income households, and 151 to above moderate income households.

V.       RESIDENTIAL LAND RESOURCES
State Housing Element Law mandates that a city shows it has adequate sites available through
appropriate zoning and development standards and with the required public services and facilities for a
variety of housing types and incomes. This evaluation of adequate sites represents planning goals and
not goals for actual production of housing within the planning period. The City must demonstrate that
it has capacity or adequate sites to accommodate the projected need for housing.
The State DOF is responsible for developing the total Statewide housing demand projection. With the
State HCD, this demand is apportioned to each of the State’s regions. The demand represents the
number of additional units needed to accommodate the anticipated growth in the number of
households, to replace expected demolitions and conversions of housing units to non-residential uses
and to allow for a future vacancy rate conducive to healthy functioning of the housing market.
SCAG, the Council of Governments (COG) representing the region, in cooperation with local
jurisdictions is responsible for allocating the region’s projected new housing demand in each
jurisdiction. This process is known as the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) and the goals are
referred to as the RHNA goals or the “regional share” goals for new housing construction. The
allocation takes into account factors such as market demand for housing, employment opportunities,
the availability of suitable sites and public facilities, commuting patterns, type and tenure of housing
need and others. In determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income category, the
allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of Lower Income households in any one
jurisdiction. The allocation is divided into four income categories:
     •   Very Low-Income- 0 to 50 percent of the median income;
     •   Low-Income- 51 to 80 percent of the median income;
     •   Moderate-Income- 81 to 120 percent of the median income; and,
     •   Above Moderate-Income- more than 120 percent of the median income.
This section of the Housing Element evaluates the potential additional residential development that
could occur in Fountain Valley under the existing General Plan, along with existing and modified zoning
classifications and regulations.
A.       Projects in the Pipeline
The City of Fountain Valley currently has one large residential development “in the pipeline.” This
project is the Mt. Hope/ Rancho Las Bolsas project. The location of this project is show in Exhibit 5-1.
The Fountain Valley Agency for Community Development acquired the vacant parcel and entered into
an agreement with Jamboree Housing Corporation to develop 128 affordable housing units. An Initial
Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared and circulated for public review. The project is in
the review process. The Fountain Valley Agency for Community Development has been dissolved,
consistent with the dissolution of redevelopment agencies statewide. The City of Fountain Valley is the
Successor Agency to the Fountain Valley Agency for Community Development and retains ownership of
the site. The City is working with Jamboree Housing Corporation to identify alternative funding sources
to construct the project. The Fountain Valley Housing Authority will be approving an Exclusive
Negotiating Agreement on December 17, 2013. This agreement will ensure continued availability of
this project to meet future affordable housing needs, subject to final funding and financing.

There are currently 20 units under construction in the Solana Walk development within the Fountain
Valley Civic Center Specific Plan area. These units will be completed in 2014 and are anticipated to be
affordable to moderate and above moderate income households. For the purpose of this analysis, these
units are assumed to be affordable to above moderate income households.
In addition, the City has recently approved subdivision of 5 new single family lots at 10442 and 10452
Warner Avenue and 10431, 10441 and 10451 Circulo de Villa. The land is currently undeveloped and the
homes are anticipated to be affordable to above moderate income households.
B.       Vacant/Underutilized Land Resources
The City of Fountain Valley has minimal areas of vacant. There are vacant sites scattered throughout
the City with the potential for infill development. There are additional areas of the City zoned for
residential use that are currently developed with non-residential uses or are otherwise underutilized.
Table 5-1 summarizes the vacant land with potential for residential development within the City.
Exhibit 5-2 shows the location of these parcels.
State Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B)(iv) allows jurisdictions in metropolitan counties, such
as Fountain Valley, to include sites with a density of 30 units per acre as appropriate sites to
accommodate the jurisdictions’ lower income households. It is assumed that the market can create
affordable units at this density. The Housing Opportunity Overlay Area #2 (-HO2) allows residential
development at a density of 30 du/ac. Therefore, the land within the Golden Triangle (11701-11765
Edinger Avenue) is assumed to accommodate the City’s lower income RHNA need. The Golden Triangle
area is currently developed with an older strip commercial center. There are a number of vacant units
and a high turner of businesses within the center. Single family neighborhoods are to the north and
south of the center and a multifamily residential development is directly adjacent to the east.
There are an additional 1.14 acres of vacant land within the HO1 overlay that are assumed to provide
opportunities for moderate income households.

There are 38 vacant lots zoned R-1 in the Colonia Juarez tract, located between Slater Avenue and
Warner Avenue on the west side of Ward Street. The City also owns a vacant lot at 11560 Iris Street.
This was the former site of water well. The well has been abandoned and sealed. The City will be
disposing of the site in 2014. These vacant lots are assumed to accommodate housing for above
moderate income households.

D.       Zoning Consistency Program
In order to accommodate the City’s remaining above moderate income RHNA need of 85 units, the City
will rezone a minimum 17 acres of vacant and underutilized sites that are currently designated for
single family residential use in the City’s General Plan Land Use Element. These sites that were
previously identified in the City’s 2008 Housing Element Update are shown in Table 5-3 and are
candidate sites to be rezoned to permit 5 du/ac consistent with the General Plan land use designation.

VI.      HOUSING PLAN
Chapters II through V establish the housing needs, constraints and opportunities in Fountain Valley. The
Housing Plan evaluates the accomplishments of the last adopted housing element, and then presents
the City's 2014-2021 Housing Plan. The Plan sets forth the goals, policies and programs developed to
address Fountain Valley's identified housing needs.
A.       REVIEW OF HOUSING ELEMENT PERFORMANCE
State Housing Element law requires communities to assess the achievements under adopted housing
programs as part of their housing element update. These results should be quantified where possible,
but may be qualitative where necessary. These results need to be compared with what was projected
or planned in the previous element. Table 6-1 summarizes the progress in implementing the policy
program in the 2006-2014 Housing Element.

            Implementation Programs
            Program 2.a: Provision of Adequate Sites
            The City shall continue to provide appropriate zoning for sites to ensure capacity to
            accommodate the City’s 2014-2021 RHNA allocation. This includes zoning for sites which
            are adequate to accommodate the City’s allocation of 83 units affordable to very-low
            income households, 59 units affordable to low income households, 65 units affordable to
            moderate income households, and 151 units affordable to above-moderate income
            households. Current projects “in the pipeline” that are entitled or under construction and
            vacant and underutilized sites are anticipated to meet the City’s lower and moderate
            income RHNA need. The City will continue to monitor development of current projects. If
            during the planning period, the City finds that projects are not resulting in housing units to
            meet its RHNA allocation, the City will ensure remaining sites are available in areas
            allowing densities necessary to provide for housing at the necessary affordability level and
            evaluate potential incentives and flexibility in development standards to encourage new
            housing construction.
            In order to accommodate the City’s remaining above moderate income RHNA need of 85
            units, the City will rezone a minimum of 17 acres of vacant and underutilized sites that are
            currently designated for single family residential use in the City’s General Plan Land Use
            Element. These sites that were previously identified in the City’s 2008 Housing Element
            Update will be rezoned to permit 5 du/ac consistent with the General Plan land use
            designation.

            Program 2.b: Review Residential Development Standards
            To respond to changing market trends and encourage continued provision of housing
            opportunities for Fountain Valley residents, the City will review and revise the existing
            Zoning Code, including residential development standards, as appropriate. The City shall
            evaluate modifications and or revisions that further increase the feasibility of residential
            development.

            Program 2.c: Mt. Hope Specific Plan Area/Rancho Las Bolsas
            The former Fountain Valley Community Development Agency acquired the land known as
            Mt. Hope and entered into an agreement with an affordable housing developer to construct
            128 new rental housing units affordable to lower and moderate income households.
            Following the dissolution of the Fountain Valley Agency for Community Development, the
            Housing Authority retains control over the land, but Housing Set-Aside funds are no longer
            available to assist in the project development. The Housing Authority will continue to work
            with the housing developer to seek alternative financing and funding that will allow
            construction of affordable units on the site. If during the development process the City
            finds that changes to the Rancho Las Bolas project are necessary to meet changes in
            funding/financing or market conditions, the City will evaluate additional sites to
            accommodate any remaining lower income needs resulting from a changed project.
                      Objective:                        128 new housing units, affordable to lower

APPENDIX A. COMMUNITY OUTREACH SUMMARY
A.       Introduction
On July 11, 2013, the City hosted a Housing Element information and outreach booth at the Fountain
Valley Recreation Center and Sports Park during the Concert in the Park. At the booth, community
members had the opportunity to pick up informational flyers about the Housing Element update, ask
questions of the project team, and provide comments in response to two questions: “What are the
housing challenges in Fountain Valley?” and “What are your ideas for improving housing in Fountain
Valley?”
B.       Community Comments
The following are comments provided by the community in response to the two questions: “What are
the housing challenges in Fountain Valley?” and “What are your ideas for improving housing in Fountain
Valley?” All comments are provided verbatim.
What are the housing challenges in Fountain Valley?
    •    Connecting w/our neighbors
    •    $ For Housing Rehab Programs
    •    Housing for Fixed Income/Retired
    •    Need for more street sweeping
    •    Mobile home management challenges
    •    Neighborhood socialization
    •    Parking (for townhomes)
    •    No more land for growth
    •    Too many banners (ads) in shopping centers creates blight affects housing
    •    Yard & tree maintenance on private property
    •    Rent increase in manufacture home park
    •    Challenges with density
What are your ideas for improving housing in Fountain Valley?
    •    Rent stabilization program
    •    Mansionization. In-fill should be compatible (DITTO!)
    •    School boundaries. Some F.V. addresses belong to GGUSD instead of FVUSD.
    •    Don’t confuse “Mansionization” with extended family living. FV is all about family – if three
         generations want a big house so be it!
    •    “Touch ad Truck” events for kids.
    •    New community center 500+
    •    Co-op with schools to open up recreation. Previous Mayor promised FVHS track would be open
         to public. It is locked up 24/7. Synthetic track would be great for everyone.
    •    Water fountain.
    •    Neighbors social.
    •    $$ For rental rehab.
    •    Focus on quality instead of quantity.
