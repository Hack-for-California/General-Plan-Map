                                city as a series of distinctive neighborhoods/villages. This is a major
                                policy step for Stockton. It will create a new way of planning and
                                implementing both reinvestment in the existing city and how the city
                                grows in the future.
                                The Stockton General Plan 2035 sets out a hierarchy of goals, policies,
                                and implementation measures that will guide future planning in the
                                city. This plan will cover the city and its Planning Area, encouraging
                                infill development and providing guidance for orderly expansion.

decisions. In general terms, a goal is a statement that 
describes in general terms a desired future condition 
or “end” state. A goal serves as a general direction‐

1.6       General Plan Planning Area
For purposes of developing this General Plan, the 
City established a Planning Area early in the update 
process.  As stated in the General Plan Guidelines, a 
general plan must “cover the territory within the 
boundaries of the adopting city or county as well as 
‘any land outside its boundaries which in the 
planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its 
planning’ (§65300).” 
The Planning Area established for the Stockton 
General Plan is shown on Figure 1‐2.

Most of Stockton’s growth occurred as a result of its 
role as a major gold rush supply and transportation 
center in the mid‐1800s. In 1850, the City of Stockton 
was incorporated and by 1854, the city had grown to 
7,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest city in 
the state. 
As gold mining waned in the latter half of the 19th 
century, miners turned to agriculture. Agriculture 
was also the catalyst for other related industry such 
as flourmills, shipyards, agricultural machinery, 
financial institutions, and tanneries.

 existing community. The community development framework anticipates
 annexation, infrastructure extensions, neighborhood and district revitalization, and
 reinvestment as an integral part of growing a healthy city. Fundamental to this
 section is the discouragement of “leapfrog” expansion over “problem areas.”
 Concept 2: Neighborhood Planning and Design System
 The Stockton General Plan 2035 policies encourage infill development and orderly
 expansion of the city. The community expressed their desire to approach planning
 of the city in district (existing developed areas) or village (new development areas)
 increments. Many of the planning concepts and policies in the General Plan use
 these geographic areas to provide focused solutions for the specific planning needs.
 Concept 3: Designing for Transit
 All development in Stockton’s future will be designed to support and serve transit
 users and pedestrian needs. Density and design will dictate the success of a mixed-
 mode solution. [Agency Comment]
 Concept 4: Community Building Sequence
 The General Plan has identified a system of villages as the framework for planning
 and expanding the city. The villages will be connected by transit, roadway, and
 utility systems. In addition to these connections, the villages, commercial services
 and public facilities will be phased in as the market and population demands them.
 Concept 5: Community Design
 The design and livability of public and common spaces and places are an
 important part of the overall approach to city building. The Stockton General Plan
 2035 promotes integration of new investment in the community. Public places are
 the focus for social and economic centers for the community.

          Manage foreseeable population and job growth by identifying 2035 City
           boundaries calculated to reflect realistic market conditions and growth
           assumptions, with the objective that, to the extent feasible, new development
           will proceed in an orderly fashion within City boundaries rather than in the
           unincorporated area, and be subject to land use principles and concepts
           intended to discourage development in areas with sensitive resources, critical
           habitats, and important scenic resources.
          Discourage “leapfrog” expansion over “problem areas”.
          Encourage infill development and orderly expansion of the city.
          Focus industrial uses and similar types of compatible land uses around the
           Stockton Metropolitan Airport.
          All future development will be designed to support transit and pedestrian
           modes of travel.
          Utilize a system of villages as the framework for planning and expanding the
           city.
          Design public places as the focus for social and economic centers for the
           community.
          Provide for the orderly development of the City with a 2035 planning horizon
           and to accommodate a target population of 580,000.
          Maximize infill development within the existing portions of the City.
          Provide new and expanded employment opportunities that focus on
           manufacturing, office development, transportation and wholesale distribution
           activities.

4.6      Implementation Programs
Like all jurisdictions in the Central Valley, the City of Stockton had a State-mandated timeline for the completion
of an updated Housing Element. To meet this deadline, this element was prepared and adopted separate from
the rest of this General Plan update.
This element was adopted by the City of Stockton on September 14, 2004, and was subsequently certified by the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
The timeframes for implementation reflect the timelines as adopted by the City in 2004.

      proposals approved or under review
      by the City, of the housing to be
      developed during the remainder of the
      period covered by the Housing
      Element. In addition, the City will
      monitor and quantify the number of
      second units being constructed
      annually. This analysis will be

      share housing need to determine if any
      changes in land use policy are
      warranted.

     website, and monthly utility billing
     inserts. Community Development and
     Housing and Redevelopment staff will
     also promote second unit development
     as part of their ongoing housing
     programs outreach. In addition, the
     City will encourage the development
     of second units by trying to include at
     least 10 percent of such units in
     projects where City funding is
     involved.

Overview
The City shall use the village concept as the primary
basis for planning large land areas as designated on
the Land Use Diagram. The Village concept
described in this section will be the basic building
block for major new development in the City. Key
features of each village will include a mix of housing
types and densities, and development of a village
center comprised of neighborhood commercial,
higher density housing, schools, public service uses
(such as a fire station), bicycle and pedestrian trails,
and open space.

 supply coupled with an urban conservation program (maximizing the use of
 reclaimed water). Second, the distribution system will impact the development

         phasing and sequencing. Third, water quality, as it pertains to run-off and
         drainage, will have a long-term impact on groundwater.
         Concept 6: Drainage
         San Joaquin County and the City of Stockton are located at the confluence of
         several creeks and rivers at the edge of the Delta. Continued expansion of the
         community will require “best practice” engineering solutions at a village and
         project level for drainage designs that protect water quality.
         Concept 7: Recreation and Waterways
         Parks are an integral part of the community-wide and local design framework.
         Parks provide open space for social and recreational interaction for districts and
         villages. These open spaces are connected via streets and waterways, with
         waterways intended to be an integral part of the open space system. Parks overlay
         the neighborhoods, villages, and districts with a natural system that includes
         walking and biking trails.
         Concept 8: Provide Infrastructure at Time of Development
         Villages and other new development shall be required to provide transportation
         improvements prior to or no later than at the time of new construction, or pay a
         fair share of the costs to complete the infrastructure. The City will use its best

         period. [New Concept, Public Comment]
         Concept 9: Heavy Rail Passenger Transit Connections
         The City of Stockton shall work with the Councils of Governments, San Joaquin

                                                                                        4. Housing
SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
State housing element law (Government Code Section 65580) mandates that local governments
must adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments
of the community. This section provides a snapshot of current (2015) information on household
characteristics, housing needs, housing supply, land inventory for new development, housing
programs, constraints, and incentives for new housing development. It also evaluates progress
made since the last Housing Element was adopted in 2010.
Overview of State Requirements
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability of
housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term
general plan for the physical development of their city or county. The housing element is one of
the seven mandated elements of the general plan. State law requires local government plans to
address the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community
through their housing elements. The law acknowledges that in order for the private market to
adequately address housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans
and regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing
development. As a result, housing policy in the state rests largely upon the effective
implementation of local general plans, and local housing elements in particular.
The purpose of the housing element is to identify the community's housing needs, to state the
community's goals and objectives with regard to housing production, rehabilitation, and
conservation to meet those needs, and to define the policies and programs that the community
will implement to achieve the stated goals and objectives.
State law requires cities and counties to address the needs of all income groups in their housing
elements. The official definition of these needs is provided by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) for each city and county within its geographic
jurisdiction. Beyond these income-based housing needs, the housing element must also address
special needs groups such as persons with disabilities and homeless persons.
As required by State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65583(a)), the assessment
and inventory for this Housing Element includes the following:
         Analysis of population and employment trends and projections and a quantification of the
          locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. This analysis of
          existing and projected needs includes Stockton’s share of the regional housing need.
         Analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment
          compared to ability to pay, and housing characteristics, including overcrowding and
          housing stock condition.
         Inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
          having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning, public
          facilities, and services to these sites.
         Identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted
          use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit.
Adopted April 12, 2016                          Background Report                          Page 4BR-1

Stockton General Plan
       Analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
        improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons with
        disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
        improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and
        permit procedures. Analysis of local efforts to remove governmental constraints.
       Analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
        improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the availability
        of financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
       Analysis of any special housing needs for the elderly, persons with disabilities (including
        developmental disabilities), large households, farmworkers, families with female heads of
        household, and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
       Analysis of opportunities for residential energy conservation.
       Analysis of “at-risk” assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from lower-
        income housing to market rate housing during the next 10 years.
The Housing Element Background Report identifies the nature and extent of the City’s housing
needs, which in turn provides the basis for the City’s response to those needs in the Housing
Element Policy Document. In addition to identifying housing needs, the Background Report also
presents information on the setting in which the needs occur, which provides a better
understanding of the community and facilitates planning for housing.
The Background Report sections draw on a broad range of information sources. Information on
population, housing stock, and the economy comes primarily from the HCD pre-approved data
package1 as well as the American Community Survey (ACS), the California Department of Finance
(DOF), and City of Stockton records. Information on available sites and services for housing comes
from numerous public agencies. Information on constraints on housing production and past and
current housing efforts in the City of Stockton comes from City staff, other public agencies, and a
number of private sources.

  HCD compiled a significant amount of data needed to update the Background Report. Most of
the data in the HCD pre-approved data package is from the 2008-2012 American Community
Survey. The source information for the tables identifies when the data is from the data package.

                                                                                       4. Housing
General Plan and Housing Element Consistency
The Housing Element is a component of the 2035 General Plan, which provides guiding policy for
all growth and development within the city. The General Plan consists of 11 elements that address
both State-mandated planning issues plus optional subjects that are of particular concern within
Stockton. These elements are:
        Land Use
        Economic Development
        Community Design
        Economic Development
        Districts and Villages
        Transportation and Circulation
        Public Facilities and Services
        Recreation and Waterways
        Health and Safety
        Youth and Education
        Natural and Cultural Resources
This Housing Element, adopted April 12, 2016, updates the City of Stockton 2035 General Plan
Housing Element that was adopted in 2010. During the process of this Update, the City has
conducted an internal consistency review to ensure consistency between the Housing Element
and all other elements of the General Plan. The City will maintain consistency as future General
Plan amendments are processed by evaluating proposed amendments for consistency will all
elements of the General Plan, including the Housing Element. When the City adopts a
comprehensive update to the General Plan, the City will review and update the Housing Element
as necessary to maintain consistency.
General Plan and Housing Element Differences
The housing element is one of seven State-mandated elements that every general plan must
contain. Although the housing element must follow all the requirements of the general plan, the
housing element has several State-mandated requirements that distinguish it from other general
plan elements. Whereas the State allows local government the ability to decide when to update
their general plan, State law sets the schedule for periodic update (five-year time frame) of the
housing element. Local governments are also required to submit draft and adopted housing
elements to HCD for State law compliance review. This review ensures that the housing element
meets the various State mandates. When the City satisfies these requirements, the State will
“certify” that the element is legally adequate. Failing to comply with State law could result in
potentially serious consequences such as reduced access to infrastructure, transportation, and
housing funding and vulnerability to lawsuits.

Stockton General Plan
Public Participation
As part of the Housing Element update process, the City implemented the State’s public
participation requirements in Housing Element Law, set forth in Government Code Section
65583(c)(7), that jurisdictions “…shall make a diligent effort to achieve participation of all
economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element.”
September 28, 2015 Community and Stakeholder Workshops
Prior to preparing the Housing Element, City staff and the Housing Element Consultants held two
workshops on September 28, 2015 – an afternoon meeting with stakeholders and an evening
meeting with the community at-large. The purpose of the workshops was to solicit input from
individuals and organizations in the community including local residents, non-profit and for-profit
housing developers, and social service providers. The City advertised the workshops on the City’s
homepage and Housing Element Update webpage, sent a public notice and press release to local
newspapers, posted announcements on social news media outlets including Facebook and
Twitter, posted flyers in City buildings and announcement boards, and sent e-mail announcement
to a list of over 75 stakeholders. As a result of the City’s press release, The Record, news media for
Stockton, published an article on the Housing Element and the workshops, which helped spread
the word to the community.
At the workshops, the Consultants and City staff held discussions in which they asked the
workshop participants to identify the City’s attributes and opportunities, housing issues, and
possible solutions to address the issues. The input provided by the community members and
housing stakeholders was taken into account when reviewing existing policies and programs and
considering new policies and programs in the updated Housing Element. Many of the issues and
solutions discussed are already addressed by the City’s existing policies and programs; however,
the updated Housing Element includes several new or modified policies and programs in
response to public input, including policies and programs to promote infill development and
mixed income housing, consider fee deferrals, and review development standards. The following
is a summary of the public input received at the workshops:
Attributes/Opportunities
Workshop participants identified the following as the city’s major attributes and opportunities for
residential development:
         The City is not reluctant to build affordable housing; the issue is limited resources.
         Stockton has a relatively low cost for land and utilities, and a low rate of natural disaster
          occurrences.
         Stockton has a lot of vacant, buildable infill lots throughout the city with infrastructure.
          SJCOG recently did an infill study that demonstrated Stockton has a lot of infill potential.
         Young people (especially millennials) are interested in living in Downtown Stockton.
          There is a lot of new energy in downtown brought by the younger generation (e.g., the
          STOCKMARKET, Huddle, and Ten Space).
         Downtown is changing; it is less scary, and there are more people with jobs. As an
          example, the University Lofts and University Plaza Waterfront Hotel have a waiting list.

                                                                                      4. Housing
      Downtown Stockton has beautiful character with the waterfront, historic arch, and a lot of
       opportunities.
      Stockton has a lot of passionate people dedicated to improving the City.
      Stockton’s population continues to grow despite challenges.
      More businesses are moving to Stockton, which provides more jobs.
      Stockton has a central location at the center of freeways, the Delta, an airport, and the
       Port.
      Stockton has the natural feature of the Delta breeze.
      Stockton has a large working class community with the ability to buy housing.
      When it comes to housing, the younger generation wants low maintenance and high
       activity. The shift in housing trends demonstrates the changes from the older generations
       who remember what downtown used to be to what the younger generation prefers.
      There is an opportunity to include a transit-oriented development (TOD) component
       because downtown Stockton is connected to the Bay Area by the ACE Train.
      Midtown and South Stockton groups are coming together and taking an interest in their
       communities.
Issues
Workshop participants identified the following as the city’s major issues related to housing:
      Social services are being cut.
      Younger generations do not support older generations as they age.
      Individuals with lower incomes are forced to share housing (i.e., double up), which results
       in overcrowding.
      Stockton needs more translation services to alleviate language barriers.
      There is a need for more supportive housing that is accessible.
      There is still a high rate of unemployment.
      There are challenges to building downtown. The City needs to attract people with the
       vision of what Stockton will become. Stockton can capitalize on the historic
       infrastructure, while renovating it to support seismic standards.
      The perception of downtown is shaped by homeless issues, such as panhandling and
       boarded up buildings.
      Multifamily zoning went away from the new subdivision areas during the housing bubble.

Stockton General Plan
      There is a lot of pressure from the Bay Area for affordable housing, which reduces
       resources for Stockton. As an example, Visionary Home Builders built 30 units of new
       affordable housing in Stockton and received 700 applications, 60 percent of which were
       from Oakland.
      There is a lot of crime in the city (e.g., copper thieves), absentee landlords, and boarded
       up buildings.
      There are a lot of safety issues from landlords neglecting building maintenance.
      The City lacks infrastructure, services, and transportation in older residential
       neighborhoods.
      Absentee landlords from the Bay Area paid cash for foreclosed homes and outcompeted
       local lower-income residents.
      A lot of the housing stock has been converted to rentals after the foreclosure crisis and
       will be put back on the market when prices recover. The shift will result in a higher need
       for rental housing.
      Stockton has SB 5 flood issues that will make a lot of western areas unbuildable after
       2016 and affect established neighborhoods too.
      Affordable housing cannot be built without subsidies, and to attain the subsidies
       developers must compete for funding with entities across the state. To create a
       competitive application, Stockton needs all the players to participate.
      There is a shortage of labor to build housing.
      Stockton needs matching funds to compete for grants.
      Ordinances, such as fire sprinklers in all residences, make housing unaffordable.
      City and school district fees are an issue.
      Stockton needs more vocation training.
      There is no housing for extremely low-income households to move people out of
       homelessness. There is no place for homeless people to go and there are not enough
       subsidies. The Housing Authority serves 11,000 people, but there is a long waitlist.
       Housing First is an approach that focuses on offering permanent, affordable housing first
       so people can deal with addiction. Federal funds (e.g., CDBG and HOME) have been cut
       significantly.
      Stockton needs to accommodate luxury housing.
      Stockton lacks planning staff.

Solutions
Workshop participants identified the following as potential solutions to address housing issues:
      Infill development is a solution that requires the City and developers to address costs of
       infrastructure.
      There are opportunities to mix incomes in developments and create communities with
       people of all incomes.
      Stockton needs a mechanism to get affordable housing in new growth areas.
      Stockton needs ready-to-build lots.
      There needs to be more creativity and flexibility in the development process, which
       requires staff resources.
      Meetings with staff cost money and affordable housing development cannot afford to
       bear this cost.
      The fee structure could reflect reduced costs for multifamily and affordable housing. The
       subsidized fee structure could be on a sliding scale based on unit size.
      Stockton can reduce lot size requirements for small homes (e.g., reduce setbacks, parking,
       and yard requirements).
      Form-based code and overlay zones would allow flexibility.
      Stockton can use brownfield sites to build affordable housing.
      The City should encourage adaptive reuse of existing buildings in the downtown.
      Riverside improved downtown buildings by asking artists and community groups to put
       displays in the vacant buildings. The City could consider a similar program.
      Bring back redevelopment agencies.
      Stockton can pursue cap and trade funds aggressively.
      Stockton needs to grow businesses because they contribute a lot to the local economy.

SECTION 2: EXISTING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Major Findings
      In the early 2000s, Stockton was one of the fastest growing communities in California.
       However, when the housing market crashed in 2007 and 2008, the population actually
       decreased by over 19,000 residents, and has been growing more slowly during the
       recovery.
      Stockton’s population was slightly younger than the county and state average in 2013.
       The city had a higher percentage of residents under the age of 35 than San Joaquin
       County, and the median age in Stockton (31.0) was lower than that of the county (32.9)
       and the state (35.4).
      Stockton’s population was more ethnically and racially diverse than the county and state
       in 2013. The most notable changes in the racial and ethnic composition of the city’s
       population between 2000 and 2013 were the higher percentage increases in the Asian
       and Hispanic populations.
      The personal income gap between residents in the city of Stockton and California is
       growing. In 1970, Stockton, California, and the U.S. had about the same average personal
       income; however, by the early 1980s, Stockton’s average per-capita personal income had
       decreased compared to California and national averages. By 2013, the personal income
       gap between Stockton and California was four times greater ($13,862) than what it was in
       1985 ($3,504).
      Stockton’s household income distribution is more heavily concentrated in the lower end
       of the income spectrum than the county and state. In 2013, Stockton’s median
       household income ($46,831) was slightly lower than the countywide median ($53,380),
       and significantly lower than the state ($61,094).
      The overall unemployment trend in Stockton over the last eight years has followed the
       ups and downs of the county and state, except at a higher rate. The unemployment rate
       has increased since 2006, consistent with an overall decrease in the housing market. In
       2014, 11.5 percent of Stockton residents were unemployed, slightly higher than the
       county (10.6 percent) and considerably higher than the statewide unemployment rate
       (7.5 percent).
      According to San Joaquin Council of Government (SJCOG) projections, Stockton’s
       population is expected to increase 17.9 percent from 319,827 in 2010 to 377,058 in
       2025 and another 14.1 percent to 430,393 in 2035. Employment growth in Stockton is
       projected to occur at a similar rate to population growth, leading to a stable jobs-housing
       ratio.
      During the housing boom of the early 2000s, homeownership was on the rise in
       Stockton, increasing from 51.6 percent in 2000 to 55.0 percent in 2007. However, after
       the recession and foreclosure crisis, the homeownership rate decreased to 45.1 percent
       in 2014. Stockton had a much lower rate of homeownership in 2014 compared to
       homeownership countywide (53.5 percent) and statewide (53.7 percent).

                                                                                          4. Housing
         Stockton has a greater need for large housing units than the county and state. Stockton
          had a larger average household size, smaller housing units, and higher overcrowding rates
          than the county and state.
         From 2000 to 2014, nearly 16,000 single-family detached units were built in Stockton,
          making up nearly 88 percent of all new residential units constructed. The majority of new
          home construction occurred prior to the recession from 2000 to 2007. From January
          2008 to September 2015, only 981 building permits were issued for new residential
          units.
         The rate of housing cost burden for lower-income households is slightly higher in
          Stockton (77.5 percent) than in San Joaquin County (73.0 percent) and California (70.0
          percent), pointing to a need for more affordable housing units in Stockton.
         From July 2006 to July 2011, the median home sale price in Stockton decreased by 67
          percent, from a high of $383,000 in July 2006 to a low of $128,000 in July 2011.
          However, the market has started to rebound and the median home sale price was
          $220,000 in July 2015. The trend of rising home prices occurred throughout California
          and in the surrounding cities of San Joaquin County.
         Renting an average two-bedroom and one-bathroom apartment had an average cost of
          $993 per month (this includes $100 monthly utility allowance) in 2015, which is
          affordable to a low-income household of two or three persons (80 percent AMI) earning
          $47,740.
         The 2015 countywide point-in-time homeless count identified 218 unsheltered adults
          and 12 unsheltered children in Stockton.
Introduction
This section begins with a description of housing and demographic characteristics of Stockton.
The section then discusses the existing housing needs of the city based on housing and
demographic characteristics, and the housing needs of “special” population groups as defined in
State law. Data for Stockton is presented, wherever possible, alongside data for San Joaquin
County and California for comparison. This facilitates an understanding of the city’s characteristics
by illustrating how the city is similar to, or differs from, the county and state in various aspects
related to demographic, employment, and housing characteristics and needs.
Demographic and Employment Profile
The purpose of this section is to establish “baseline” population, employment, and housing
characteristics for Stockton. The main sources of the information in this section are the HCD pre-
approved data package, 2009-2013 American Community Survey, and the California Department
of Finance (DOF). Other sources of information include the San Joaquin Council of Governments
(SJCOG), the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Demographics
Population
Stockton has been one of the fastest growing communities in California. Table 4-1 shows the
long-term historic population trends for the city of Stockton. Since incorporating in 1850,
Stockton has been a rapidly growing city. The city experienced its highest average annual growth
rate (AAGR) during a 10-year period between 1980 and 1990 when the population grew at an
average rate 3.6 percent each year. The population growth slowed significantly between 1990
and 2000, and then increased in the early 2000s during a housing boom. However, when the
housing market crashed in 2007 and 2008, the population actually decreased by over 19,000
residents, and has been growing more slowly during the recovery. Stockton’s population
exceeded 300,000 in 2014.

             Age
             Table 4-3 shows the distribution of Stockton’s population by age from 1990 to 2013. The median
             age in Stockton is 31.0 years, which is lower than the county (32.9 years) and the state (35.4
             years). As shown in the table, the share of persons between 15 to 24 years of age and ages 45
             years and older increased from 1990 to 2013, while all other age groups decreased in their share
             of the overall population. Since 1990, persons ages 55 to 64 have been the fastest growing age
             group in the city with an AAGR of 3.1 percent. This group increased from 6.0 percent of the total
             population in 1990 to 10.2 percent in 2013. If most residents who are now in their 50s and 60s
             remain in the city over the next 20 years, the senior population will continue to increase and
             eventually become a larger proportion of the total population in Stockton.

Income and Employment
Local demand for housing is significantly impacted by income, employment characteristics, and
regional job growth. To effectively address the housing and jobs relationship, an understanding of
local salary and job profiles is needed. This section analyzes personal income, household income,
and employment characteristics for San Joaquin County and the city of Stockton, when available.
Personal Income
Figure 4-1 shows the change in average per capita income for the Stockton MSA, California, and
the U.S. from 1969 through 2013. In 1969, Stockton, California and the U.S. had similar average
personal incomes. However, by the early 1980s, Stockton’s average per-capita personal income
had decreased compared to California and national averages. From 1985 to 2013, Stockton’s per-
capita personal income rose 160 percent to only $34,755 compared to California, which rose
approximately 188 percent to $48,617, and the U.S. per-capita income, which increased 199

Household Income
Household incomes in Stockton are generally lower than incomes countywide and in the state.
The most significant income disparities when comparing Stockton with the county or in the state
occur at either end of the income spectrum. For example, approximately 28 percent of Stockton
households earned less than $25,000 in 2013, compared to 22 percent countywide or 21 percent
in the state. Households earning $75,000 or more made up 32 percent of Stockton households,

         Figure 4-2 illustrates average annual unemployment rates in Stockton, San Joaquin County, and
         California from 1990 to 2014. Throughout the timeline, the city’s unemployment rate has been
         consistently higher than the county and state averages. The unemployment rate rapidly increased
         from 2006 to 2011, consistent with an overall decrease in the housing market and the national
         recession. Following the peak in 2011, Stockton’s unemployment rate has been decreasing similar
         to the trends countywide and statewide. In 2014, 11.5 percent of Stockton residents were
         unemployed, slightly higher than the countywide rate (10.6 percent) and considerably higher than
         the statewide unemployment rate (7.5 percent).

Population and Employment Projections
The San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) produces projections of population and
employment for the cities in San Joaquin County, including the city of Stockton. SJCOG’s most
recent projections, released in 2009, cover the period from 2006 to 2035. SJCOG is working on
an updated population and employment projections that is expected to be released by the end of
2015. Table 4-8 shows SJCOG’s 2009 population and employment estimates using 2006 as the
base year with population and employment projections on through 2035.
As shown in the table, Stockton’s population is projected to increase at an average annual rate of
1.8 percent from 319,827 in 2015 to 348,977 in 2020. By 2035, the city’s population is
projected to be 430,393, which is a 48.0 percent increase from 2006. Despite the loss of jobs
from 2006 to 2010, employment growth in Stockton is projected to occur at a similar rate to
population growth. The number of jobs is projected to increase at a rate of 1.6 percent each year
from 115,283 jobs in 2015 to 124,547 in 2020. The ratio of jobs per capita is projected to
remain relatively stable at 0.36 jobs per person estimated in 2006 to 0.35 jobs per person
estimated in 2035.

Household Characteristics and Housing Supply
This section provides an analysis of household characteristics and housing supply. The first section
analyzes household characteristics, such as household population, composition, size, tenure, and
overcrowding. The second section analyzes the city’s housing inventory and supply, including a
discussion of vacant units.
Household Characteristics
 Household Population
Household population is an important measure for establishing the number of persons residing in
private households. Persons in institutional or group quarters are not included in the count of
household population. According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, as of 2013
Stockton had a total population of 294,406 comprising 100,011 households. The city had an
average of 3.19 persons per household.
Household Composition
The U.S. Census divides households into two different categories, depending on their
composition: family and non-family. Family households are those consisting of two or more
related persons living together. Non-family households include persons who live alone or in
groups composed of unrelated individuals. As shown in Table 4-9, families have made up a larger
share of the population in Stockton and San Joaquin County than the state average. In 1990, 70.7
percent of Stockton households were family households compared to 73.9 percent countywide
and 68.8 percent in the state. From 1990 to 2000, family households as a percentage of total
households increased slightly in Stockton to 71.5 percent. By 2013, the percentage of family
households in the city increased more significantly than the county and state, and almost equaled
that of the percentage of family households in the county (73.3 percent compared to 74.4
percent).

Tenure
Tenure is a measure of the rates of homeownership in a jurisdiction. Tenure for a type of unit and
the number of bedrooms can help estimate demand for a diversity of housing types. The owner
versus renter distribution of a community's housing stock influences several aspects of the local
housing market. Residential stability is influenced by tenure, with ownership housing typically
having a much lower turnover rate than rental housing.
Home equity is the largest single source of household wealth for most Americans. On average,
median net wealth for renters is about 3 percent of that of homeowners. The national
homeownership rate has risen from around 40 percent before World War II, to 66 percent in
1980, 64 percent in 1995, and 65 percent in 2013.
Table 4-10 shows rates of homeownership and renter occupancy in Stockton in 2000, 2007, and
2014, and San Joaquin County and California in 2014. Homeownership rates in Stockton
changed dramatically over this time period. The rate of homeownership increased from 51.6
percent in 2000 to 55.0 percent in 2007, and dropped to 45.1 percent in 2014 following the
housing market crash and foreclosure crisis. Stockton had a much lower rate of homeownership
in 2014 compared to homeownership countywide (53.5 percent) and statewide (53.7 percent).
This trend is shown in Figure 4-3 below.

Overcrowding
U.S. Census Bureau standards define a housing unit as overcrowded when the total number of
occupants is greater than one person per room, excluding kitchens, porches, balconies, foyers,
halls, half-rooms, or bathrooms. For example, if there were more than five people living in a
home with five rooms (three bedrooms, living room, and dining room), it would be considered
overcrowded. Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely overcrowded,
and should be recognized as a significant housing problem.
Table 4-11 compares housing overcrowding data for Stockton with data for San Joaquin County
and California. In 2012, 90.8 percent of Stockton’s households had 1.0 or fewer persons per
room with only 8.2 percent considered overcrowded. Of all units in Stockton, 7.0 percent had
between 1.01 and 1.5 persons per room, and only 1.2 percent were severely overcrowded with
more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding was slightly more of a problem in Stockton in
2012 than countywide where only 7.9 percent of all households had more than 1.0 persons per
room, and in California where 8.2 percent of households were considered overcrowded.
Overcrowding is typically more of a problem in rental units than owner-occupied units. Only 5.9
percent of Stockton’s owner households were overcrowded, while 10.4 percent of renter
households were overcrowded in 2012. Countywide, 4.5 percent of owner households and 12.8
percent of renter households were overcrowded. Statewide overcrowding was also greater among
renter households (13.3 percent) compared to owner households (4.1 percent).

Table 4-13 shows the number of bedrooms per housing unit by tenure in Stockton, San Joaquin
County, and California in 2012. As shown in the table, 55.4 percent of all housing units in
Stockton contained three or more bedrooms in 2012. This is lower than the percentage of units
with three or more bedrooms countywide (66.7 percent) and California (62.8 percent).
Renter-occupied units typically have a smaller number of bedrooms than owner-occupied units.
This was the case in Stockton in 2012, where 85.2 percent of owner-occupied units had three or
more bedrooms, compared to only 38.6 percent of renter-occupied units. The percentage of
renter occupied units in Stockton with three of more bedrooms was lower than the percentage
countywide (41.4 percent) but higher than California (26.9 percent).

Average household size is a function of household population (group quarters population is not
counted) divided by the number of occupied housing units. Table 4-14 shows the average
household size for Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California. The average number of persons
per household in Stockton increased slightly from 3.00 in 1990 to 3.02 in 2000 to 3.17 in 2012.

period, and slightly larger than the statewide average (2.94). Both Stockton and San Joaquin
County had greater average household sizes in 2012 for renter-occupied households (3.20 and
3.23) compared to owner-occupied households (3.14 and 3.07).

 the type of structures in which units are located. Single-family detached housing units accounted
 for the majority of housing in Stockton in 2014. At 64.8 percent of the total housing stock, single-
 family detached units in Stockton made up a much larger share of the total than in the state

 15,753 single-family detached units were built in Stockton, making up nearly 88 percent of all
 new residential units constructed. The majority of new home construction occurred prior to the
 recession from 2000 to 2007. From January 1, 2008 to September 23, 2015 only 981 residential
 building permits were issued.

 Stockton’s housing stock, comprising 18.0 percent (17,982 units) of the total in 2014. Between
 2000 and 2014, over 1,300 units were built in multi-family complexes with five or more units.
 Between 2000 and 2014, the number of mobile homes in the city decreased, and the overall
 share of mobile homes as a percentage of the entire housing stock decreased from 1.6 percent in
 2000 to 1.1 percent in 2014.

According to HCD, the desired vacancy rates necessary to provide a stable housing environment
are approximately 2 percent for the for-sale housing market and 5 percent for the rental housing
market. Table 4-17 provides more detail on the vacancy rates of different housing types for
Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California in 2010. The vacancy rate of for-sale housing
available for occupancy in Stockton in 2010 was 1.6 percent and the vacancy rate for rental
housing available for occupancy was 4.6 percent. In 2010, the city had a lower than desired
vacancy rate for for-sale housing and rental housing, indicating that Stockton has a need for more
units.

Housing Conditions
The U.S. Census provides limited data that can be used to infer the condition of Stockton’s
housing stock. For example, the Census reports on whether housing units have complete
plumbing and kitchen facilities. A very small percentage of all housing units in Stockton lack
complete plumbing or kitchen facilities (see Table 4-18 below), although a greater percentage of
renter-occupied housing units lack these facilities compared to owner-occupied housing units.
Since housing stock age and condition are generally correlated, one Census variable that provides
an indication of housing conditions is the age of a community’s housing stock. As shown in Table
4-18, as of 2012, the median year built for all housing units in Stockton was 1978, compared to
1979 in San Joaquin County and 1973 in California. Over 18 percent of Stockton’s housing stock
was built after 2000 and another 13.8 percent of the housing stock was built between 1990 and
1999. These statistics reflect the tremendous growth in the area during the 1990s and 2000s.
Since 32.0 percent of the housing units in Stockton had been built since 1990 (as of 2012),
Stockton’s housing stock should still be in relatively good condition compared to communities
with larger shares of older homes.
While the City has not had the resources to conduct a housing conditions survey in recent years,
past survey efforts have focused on three specific areas of the city that were formerly
Redevelopment Agency Project Areas: Midtown, South Stockton, and North Stockton. These are
the areas of the city with the greatest concentrations of blighted structures and residences in need
of significant rehabilitation. Based on these past surveys and a consideration of current conditions,
it is estimated that there are around 4,000 housing units needing major repairs or replacement.

The Neighborhood Services Division of the Police Department enforces codes, laws, and
regulations for the abatement of substandard housing conditions and blight issues. Code
enforcement statistics from the Neighborhood Services Division provide a sense of the number of
units that may need renovation, rehabilitation, or replacement in the city. As shown in Table 4-
19, the Neighborhood Services Division processed 135,456 housing code enforcement cases over
the past 10 years at an average of about 13,546 cases each year. The most common housing
violations are structural problems, raw sewage, exposed wiring, and other exterior housing

on the amount and severity of the violations.

During the stakeholder workshop on September 28, 2015, participants suggested out of town
landlords were a cause for deteriorating housing conditions in the city’s neighborhoods. When
housing prices were at their lowest in the city, many out of town investors offering cash payments
outcompeted local residents for low cost housing. Workshop participants claimed that many of
these homes that already had lower values and were in need of repairs have become further
deteriorated.
According to a recent (April 2015) article in The Stockton Record, a code enforcement case of a
multifamily complex demonstrates the hazardous situation created by absentee landlords. The
property had numerous issues including a cockroach infestation, broken pipes spewing sewage
and water, black mold, mildew, nonfunctional refrigerator, broken heaters, and so forth. After
numerous notices for repairs to bring the property up to State Health and Safety Code, Code
Enforcement was forced to relocate the tenants to ensure their well-being. The current owners
purchased the eight-unit complex after the property went into foreclosure. At the time of eviction
the tenants had never met the owners and were paying monthly rent, often in the form of cash or
money order, to a man affiliated with the owners (Goldeen, 2015).

Housing Affordability
Housing is classified as “affordable” if households do not pay more than 30 percent of income for
payment of rent (including a monthly allowance for water, gas, and electricity) or monthly
homeownership costs (including mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance). State law
(65583(a)(2)) requires “an analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including
level of payment compared to ability to pay.” Identifying and evaluating existing housing needs
are a critical component of the housing element. This requires comparison of resident incomes
with the local cost of housing. The analysis helps local governments identify existing housing
conditions that require addressing and households with housing cost burdens or unmet housing
needs. This section includes an analysis of housing cost burden, ability to pay for housing, and the
cost of housing.
The data in this section uses HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)
database. Income groups are shown in the CHAS tabulation based on the HUD-adjusted area
median family income.
Housing Cost Burdens
This section provides an analysis of the proportion of households “overpaying for housing.” An
“excessive cost burden” is defined by HUD as gross housing costs exceeding 30 percent of gross
monthly income. A “severe cost burden” is defined as gross housing costs exceeding 50 percent of
gross monthly income.
Income groups are based on the HUD-adjusted area median family income (AMI). The area
median family income is based on the Stockton Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA),
encompassing all of San Joaquin County. In 1974, Congress defined “low-income” and “very low-
income” for HUD rental programs as incomes not exceeding 80 and 50 percent, respectively, of
the area median family income, as adjusted by HUD.2
Table 4-20 shows the CHAS special tabulation data from the 2008-2012 American Community
Survey regarding the percentage of households with an excessive housing cost burden (greater
than 30 percent) and severe cost burden (greater than 50 percent) by income group and tenure
for Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California.
As shown in Table 4-20, 47.8 percent of all households in Stockton had an excessive housing cost
burden in 2012. This rate is slightly higher than countywide (44.5 percent) and in California (44.8
percent). In Stockton 24.7 percent of households had a severe housing cost burden in 2012
compared to 21.4 percent and 21.7 percent for San Joaquin County and California, respectively.
As would be expected, housing cost burdens were more severe for households with lower
incomes. Among lower-income households in Stockton (incomes less than or equal to 80 percent
of the AMI), 77.5 percent of households had an excessive housing cost burden in 2012 compared
to 25.3 percent of non-lower-income households. This rate of housing cost burden for lower-
income households is slightly higher in Stockton than in San Joaquin County (73.0 percent) and
2
  Statutory adjustments now include upper and lower caps for areas with low or high ratios of housing costs to income and, for
each non-metropolitan county, a lower cap equal to its state’s non-metropolitan average. Estimates of the median family income
and the official income cutoffs for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county are based on the most recent Decennial
Census results and updated each year by HUD. Each base income cutoff is assumed to apply to a household of four, and official
cutoffs are further adjusted by household size.

California (70.0 percent). This data points to the need for more affordable housing units in
Stockton to meet the needs of lower-income households.
Rates of housing cost burden were greater among low-income renter households than among
low-income owner households for Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California. However, for
non-lower-income renter households, rates of housing cost burden were lower than those of
owner-occupied households. This trend was common across the city, county, and state. In
Stockton 81.9 percent of low-income renter households paid 30 percent or more of their monthly
incomes for housing costs in 2012, compared to 67.8 percent of low-income owner households.
Among moderate- and above moderate-income households, the percentage of owner households
with excessive housing cost burdens was far higher than renter households (29.8 percent
compared to 16.0 percent).

Housing Affordability
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in
Stockton with the presumed maximum affordable housing costs for households at different
income levels. This information can provide a picture of who can afford what size and type of
housing. It can also indicate the type of households that would likely experience overcrowding or
overpayment.
Housing affordability is based on area median income (AMI). According to HCD, the AMI for a
four-person household in the Stockton MSA was $66,300 in 2015. Income limits for larger or
smaller households were higher or lower, respectively, and are calculated using a formula
developed by HCD (see Table 4-21).
The following section compares the cost limits for affordable owner and rental housing by income
limit as defined by the California Health and Safety Code.3 The State income limits are used in
affordable housing programs and projects. Because above moderate-income households do not
generally have problems locating affordable units, affordable housing is usually defined as units
that are reasonably priced for low- and moderate-income households. The list below shows the
definition of housing income limits.
          Extremely Low-Income Household is one whose combined income is between the floor
           set at the minimum Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and 30 percent of the AMI. A
           household of four is considered to be extremely low-income in Stockton if its combined
           income is $24,250 or less for the year 2015.
          Very Low-Income Household is one whose combined income is at or between 31 and
           50 percent of the AMI. A household of four is considered to be very low-income in
           Stockton if its combined income is between $24,251 and $33,150 for the year 2015.
          Low-Income Household is one whose combined income is at or between 50 and 80
           percent of the AMI. A household of four is considered to be low-income in Stockton if its
           combined income is between $33,151 and $53,050 for the year 2015.
          Moderate-Income Household is one whose combined income is at or between 81 and
           120 percent of the AMI. A household of four is considered to be moderate-income in
           Stockton if its combined income is between $66,331 and $79,550 for the year 2015.
          Above Moderate-Income Household is one that whose combined income is above 120
           percent of the AMI. A household of four is considered to be above moderate-income in
           Stockton if its combined income exceeds $79,551 for the year 2015.

Table 4-22 shows the 2015 HCD-defined household income limits for extremely low-, very low-,
low-, and moderate-income households in the Stockton MSA by the number of persons in the
household. It also shows maximum affordable monthly rents and maximum affordable purchase
prices for homes. For example, a three-person household was classified as low-income (80
percent of median) with an annual income of up to $47,750 in 2015. A household with this
income could afford to pay a monthly gross rent (including utilities) of up to $1,194 or could
afford to purchase a house priced at or below $206,804.

Table 4-23 shows HUD-defined fair market rent levels (FMR) for the Stockton MSA for 2015. In
general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to pay the gross rent (shelter
rent plus utilities) of privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-
luxury) nature with suitable amenities. FMRs are housing market-wide estimates of rents that
provide opportunities to rent standard quality housing throughout the geographic area in which
rental housing units are in competition. The rents are drawn from the distribution of rents of all
units that are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units,
newly built units, and substandard units.
HUD uses FMRs for a variety of purposes: FMRs determine the eligibility of rental housing units
for the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program; Section 8 Rental Certificate program
participants cannot rent units whose rents exceed the FMRs; and FMRs also serve as the payment
standard used to calculate subsidies under the Rental Voucher program.
Comparing the current FMR levels to Table 4-23, a three-person household classified as low-
income (between 51 and 80 percent of median) with an annual income of up to $47,750 could

afford to pay $1,194 monthly gross rent (including utilities). The 2015 FMR for a two-bedroom
unit is $946, which is affordable to the household, assuming such a unit was available in Stockton.
However, a three-person very low-income household ($29,850) could afford to pay only $746,
which is below the 2015 FMR amount.
Since the FMR levels apply to the entire Stockton MSA (i.e., San Joaquin County) residents of
communities with higher rental rates are likely to find that there is a limited supply of rental units
at the regional FMR levels. The lack of affordability would be even worse for the very low-income
household mentioned above if the household has to spend more than the FMR amount to rent a
unit in Stockton.

Affordable Housing by Income/Occupation
Table 4-24 is an abbreviated list of occupations and average annual incomes for Stockton
residents, such as fire fighters and police officers, employees of the Stockton Unified School
District, and minimum wage earners. A fire fighter earning an income of $47,823 could be
considered moderate-income depending on the household size, and could afford to purchase a
home for $177,255. A registered nurse earning $94,120 could afford to pay an estimated
$348,854 for a home.
Figure 4-4 shows median home sale prices in Stockton. With a median sale price of $220,000 in
Stockton in 2015, many, but not all of the households shown on the table are priced out of the
market, even given the recent price declines in the housing market. New homes, with a median
sale price of $350,000, would be out of the affordable price range of all single-earner households
listed in the table. A household with two wage earners collectively earning about $75,000, such
as a preschool teacher and fire fighter, would be able to afford the median-priced new home in
Stockton. A preschool teacher and security guard collectively earning $46,841 annually could not
afford a median-priced home.
Households with limited or fixed incomes are of particular interest when examining overall
affordability of a city. The FMR for a studio unit ($605) is more than twice the amount that a
single person on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) could afford to pay ($220). However, two
workers earning minimum wage could afford $936 for rent, which makes the FMR rent for a one-
bedroom apartment affordable, depending on utility costs.

Housing Values
During the early 2000s there was a significant boom and bust in local housing markets that is
commonly referred to as the “housing bubble,” in which local markets exploded with
construction and sales activity fueled largely by subprime loans for homeowners. Figure 4-4
shows the median home sale prices in Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California from July
Adopted April 12, 2016                            Background Report                                        Page 4BR-37

Stockton General Plan
2006 to July 2015. As a result of the housing bubble, the median home sale price in Stockton
decreased by 66.6 percent from a high of $383,000 in July 2006 to a low of $128,000 in July
2011. While there were significant declines in median home sale prices from 2006 to 2011, from
July 2011 to July 2015 median home sale prices increased by 71.9 percent in the city, 70.0
percent in the county, and 39.0 percent in the state. These figures demonstrate the recovery in
Stockton and San Joaquin County has been slower than many other parts of the California. As of
July 2015, the median home sale price was $220,000 in Stockton.

Average Monthly Rents
Table 4-25 contains data on apartment rents between the second quarter of 2007 through the
second quarter of 2015 provided by RealFacts, a private vendor of apartment market data. The
average rent for a two-bedroom, one-bath unit, the most common unit size in Stockton, requires
an annual household income of $39,720 to cover the $893 monthly rent and an estimated $100
utility allowance. Based on the HCD income limits, the average apartment is affordable to a low-
income household of two or three persons (80 percent of the AMI).
The RealFacts data also shows that rental rates for studios and one-bedroom units have remained
stable from 2007 to 2015, and rental rates have increased over time for larger units. From 2007 to
2015 the greatest rental rate increase was for 3-bedroom and 2-bathroom units, which had an
eight-year increase of 5.7 percent.
Additionally, RealFacts provides data on average occupancy rates. The apartment rental market in
Stockton has an average vacancy rate of 2.9 percent, which is below the five percent healthy

     Special Housing Needs
     Within the general population of Stockton, there are several groups of people who have special
     housing needs. These needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable
     housing. The following subsections discuss the special housing needs of six groups identified in
     State housing element law: the elderly; persons with disabilities, including developmental
     disabilities; large families; farmworkers; families with female heads of households; and families
     and persons in need of emergency shelter. In addition to these six groups, the section also
     discusses the housing needs of extremely low-income households and persons living with AIDS
     and related diseases. Where possible, estimates of the population or number of households in
     Stockton belonging to each group are shown.
     Senior Households
     Seniors are defined as persons 65 years and older, while senior households are those households
     headed by a person 65 years and older. Seniors often face unique housing problems. While many
     may own their homes outright, fixed retirement incomes may not always be adequate to cover
     rising utility rates and insurance. Also, many elderly homeowners do not have sufficient savings to
     finance the necessary repair costs. This is a situation commonly described as “house-rich and
     cash-poor.”
     Table 4-26 shows information on the number of seniors, the number of senior households, and
     senior households by housing tenure in Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California in 2012.
     Seniors represented 9.8 percent of the population in Stockton in 2012 compared to 10.4 percent
     of the population countywide and 11.4 percent of the population in California. Because of
     smaller household sizes senior households as a percentage of all households is higher. Senior
     households represented 17.9 percent of all households in Stockton, 17.8 percent countywide,
     and 19.8 percent in California. Senior households have a high homeownership rate; 67.5 percent
     of senior households in Stockton were owner-occupied in 2012, compared to 74.8 percent of
     senior households countywide. Senior households represented 23.2 percent of all owner-
     occupied households in Stockton and 12.1 percent of all renter households.

   While some seniors may prefer to live in single-family detached homes, others desire a smaller,
   more affordable home with less upkeep, such as condos, townhouses, apartments, or mobile
   homes. In general, most senior households consist of a single elderly person living alone, or a
   couple. Housing developments for senior households should contain greater proportions of
   smaller housing units than projects intended for the general population.
   Some seniors have the physical and financial ability to continue driving well into their retirement;
   however, those who cannot or choose not to drive must rely on alternative forms of
   transportation. This includes not only bus routes, rail lines, and ride sharing programs, but also
   safe, walkable neighborhoods. In order to accommodate transit access in senior housing, it must
   be located near transit centers, and in neighborhoods that cater to pedestrians by providing well-
   lit, wide, shaded sidewalks, clearly marked crosswalks, and longer walk signals at intersections.
   Table 4-27 shows the housing cost burdens by age and tenure in Stockton, San Joaquin County,
   and California based on the 2009-2013 American Community Survey. As shown in the table,
   32.3 percent of all senior-owner households and 59.6 percent of all senior-renter households in
   Stockton had a housing cost burden greater than 30 percent in 2013. The percentage of senior
   households in Stockton with a cost burden was slightly less than non-senior owner households
   and slightly greater than non-senior renter households. More than 41 percent of all senior
   households in Stockton had a moderate housing cost burden compared to 37.7 percent in the
   county and 40.5 percent in the state.

               Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a needs-based program that pays monthly benefits to
               persons who are 65 or older, are blind, or have a disability. Seniors who have never worked, or
               have insufficient work credits to qualify for Social Security disability, often receive SSI benefits. In
               fact, SSI is the only source of income for many low-income seniors. With the monthly maximum
               Federal amount of $733 in 2015, SSI recipients are likely to have difficulty finding housing that fits
               within their budgets since they could afford to pay only $220 (or 30 percent of their income) for
               rent, as shown earlier in Table 4-24. Because of the affordability gap, elderly SSI recipients will
               need to find publicly assisted units with deep subsidies or participate in the Housing Choice
               Voucher (Section 8) Program.
               Table 4-28 shows Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients by category in San Joaquin
               County and California in December 2013. In 2013 there were 29,545 individuals in San Joaquin
               County received Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which represents 4.2 percent of the total
               San Joaquin County population. In San Joaquin County, there were 9,389 SSI recipients age 65
               years and older in the Stockton MSA. California as a whole had a lower percentage of the total
               population that received SSI benefits at 3.4 percent.

Persons with Disabilities
Table 4-29 shows information from the 2013 American Community Survey on the disability status
and types of disabilities by age group for persons five years and older in Stockton, San Joaquin
County, and California. As shown in the table, 13.5 percent of the total population in Stockton
five years and older had one or more disabilities in 2013, compared 12.7 percent countywide
and 10.8 percent in California. In terms of the three age groups shown in the table, 5.3 percent of
the city’s population 5 to 17 years of age, 11.7 percent of the population 18 to 64 years of age,
and 42.4 percent of seniors (65 years and older) had one or more disabilities in 2013. The
percentage of individuals with a disability is higher for all three age groups in Stockton compared
to San Joaquin County and California.
Table 4-29 also provides information on the nature of these disabilities. The total number of
disabilities shown for all age groups in Stockton (73,043) exceeds the number of persons with
disabilities (36,304) because a person can have more than one disability. Among school age
children, the most frequent disability was cognitive (59.6 percent). For persons ages 18 to 64
years, the most frequent disabilities were ambulatory (27.6 percent), cognitive (22.7 percent), and
independent living (21.6 percent). Finally, for seniors, ambulatory and independent living
disabilities were the most frequent (29.4 percent and 21.1 percent, respectively).

Stockton General Plan
Persons with disabilities in Stockton have different housing needs depending on the nature and
severity of the disability. Physically-disabled persons generally require modifications to their
homes such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, wide doorways, and modified fixtures and
appliances. If a disability prevents a person from driving, then access to public transportation is
particularly important. If a disability prevents an individual from working or limits income, then
the cost of housing and the costs of modifications are likely to be even more challenging. Those
individuals with severe physical or mental disabilities may also require supportive housing, nursing
facilities, or care facilities. In addition, many persons with disabilities rely solely on Social Security
Income, which is insufficient for market rate housing.
The City of Stockton has adopted the 2013 California Existing Building Code including Title 24
regulations dealing with accessibility for persons with disabilities. Newer housing will at least meet
minimum standards for access for persons with disabilities. One of the key needs for persons with
disabilities is assistance in retrofitting older homes.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an
evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A
"developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes
18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and
Autism.
According to the California Department of Developmental Services, as of November 2013 the
Valley Mountain Regional Center served 6,315 residents with developmental disabilities in the
region and 4,091 residents in Stockton. Of the total in the region, 41.2 percent of disabled
persons are under the age of 14, 12.9 percent are ages 15-22, 36.3 percent are ages 23-54, 6.2
percent are ages 55-64, and 3.4 percent are 65 or older (Table 4-30). A significant number of
developmentally-disabled Stockton residents receiving services from the Valley Mountain Regional
Center lived in group home facilities (28.2 percent of adults). Most developmentally-disabled
individuals lived at home (50.0 percent). Many developmentally-disabled persons are able to live
and work independently. However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living
environment with supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and physical
therapy. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first housing issue for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from living with a parent/guardian as a child to an

Large Families/Households
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines a large household or
family as consisting of five or more members. The most critical housing need of large families is
access to larger housing units with more bedrooms than a standard two- or three-bedroom
dwelling. Multi-family rental housing units typically provide one or two bedrooms and not the
three or more bedrooms that are required by large families. As a result, the large families that are
unable to rent single-family homes may be overcrowded in smaller units. In general, housing for
families should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and should be located to provide
convenient access to schools and childcare facilities.
Table 4-31 shows the number and share of large households in Stockton, San Joaquin County,
and California in 2012. As shown in the table, 21.1 percent of all households in Stockton had five
or more persons. Large households made up 18.5 percent of all owner-occupied households and
24.4 percent of all renter households in Stockton in 2012. The percentage of large households
among all households in Stockton was larger than the percentages countywide (19.9 percent) and
in California (14.3 percent).

Female-headed households generally have lower incomes because there is only one potential
wage earner. Individuals in this special needs group often have more difficulties finding adequate,
affordable housing than families with two adults. Female-headed households with small children
may need to pay for childcare, which further reduces disposable income. This special needs
group will benefit generally from expanded affordable housing opportunities. More specifically,
the need for dependent care also makes it important that housing for single-headed families be
located near childcare facilities, schools, youth services, and medical facilities.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are an essential component of Stockton’s economy. Determining the number of
farmworkers in a region is difficult due to the variability of the definitions used by government
agencies and other characteristics of the farming industry, such seasonal workers who migrate
from place to place. A source of information on the number of families with school-age children is
the San Joaquin County Office of Education (SJOE). According to the SJOE Department of Migrant
Education there are currently (2015) 371 migrant families in Stockton. However not all
farmworkers in Stockton have school-age children, and not all school-age children from migrant
farmworker families are enrolled in the migrant education program.
Another source is the U.S. Census of Agriculture, which is conducted every five years and gives
the most recent estimate on the number and type of farmworkers in San Joaquin County. The
most recent U.S. Census of Agriculture is from 2012. The Census has shown changes in the
farmworker population over time. In 2002, 22,634 farmworkers worked in San Joaquin County;
however, by 2007 only 15,508 farmworkers were employed in the county. By 2012, 24,872
farmworkers were employed in the county, which is a significant increase from the 2007 figure,
and a return to the levels found in 2002.
Housing conditions for migrant farmworkers are substantially different from the housing
conditions of permanent residents employed full-time or part-time in agriculture. Since migrant
farmworkers frequently move locations, they are typically renters. Additionally, migrant
farmworkers earn a low income. This forces the farmworking community to compete for the
lowest cost housing, which is typically substandard. Most rental units available to migrant
farmworkers are small, however, most farmworking families are above average in size. Along
those lines in order to afford the high rents that result from low vacancy rates, particularly at the
height of the migrant worker season in the county, migrant workers often share rooms and
housing units. As a result, housing affordability and overcrowding are critical issues among this
special needs group.
The San Joaquin County Housing Element contains numerous policies and programs to address
the needs of farmworkers. A major policy approach in San Joaquin County is to encourage
farmworker housing in the unincorporated county’s agricultural zones. This reduces farmworkers’
commute times, decreases transportation expenses, and provides more affordable housing
options. While the City supports the efforts to provide farmworker housing, it is primarily the
County’s role to provide this housing. Conversely, it is largely the responsibility of Stockton to
provide the higher-density affordable housing for the county’s lower-income households.
The decline in grower-provided worker shelter resulted in the State government directing
resources to farmworker housing through State-owned and local government-operated migrant
labor camps. The Housing Authority of San Joaquin County operates three of these State-owned
migrant camps totaling 287 units. This housing is available annually from mid-March through the

end of October. Day care centers are provided for farmworkers, as well as services from the
Employment Development Department, the Social Security Administration, and education and
health care services. During the off-season, one of the migrant camps in French Camp is also used
as a cold weather overflow homeless shelter for families (from mid-December through mid-
March).
Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter
Homelessness is a continuing concern in California. Most families become homeless because
they are unable to afford housing in a particular community. Nationwide, about half of those
experiencing homelessness over the course of a year are single adults. Most enter and exit the
system fairly quickly. The remainder essentially lives in the homeless assistance system, or in a
combination of shelters, hospitals, the streets, jails, and prisons. There are also single homeless
people who are not adults, including runaway and “throwaway” youth (children whose parents
will not allow them to live at home).
The housing needs of homeless persons are more difficult to measure and assess than those of
other population subgroups. Since these individuals have no permanent address, they are not
likely to be counted in the Census.
The most recent information available on homeless individuals is a “point-in-time” (PIT) count
that was conducted by the San Joaquin County Community Development Department and the
Central Valley Low Income Housing Corporation in late January 2015 (Table 4-33). The PIT count
was conducted in the cities of Stockton, Tracy, Lodi, and Manteca because the majority of
homeless services are provided in these larger cities. The highest concentration of unsheltered
homeless persons was found in Stockton, accounting for 43 percent of the unsheltered persons
included in the PIT.
The 2015 PIT count reports a total of 1,708 homeless individuals in San Joaquin County – about
an eight percent increase from the 2013 PIT count. While the results suggest there has been an
increase in the number of unsheltered homeless, the increase may also be a result of a more
complete and rigorous unsheltered count. Of the total 1,708 individuals, 68.7 percent were
sheltered, while 31.3 percent were unsheltered. Among the total homeless persons counted, 20.4
percent were unsheltered males and 11.0 percent were unsheltered females. The majority of
persons counted were Caucasian (65.1 percent) and 24 years or older (68.4 percent). A total of
472 persons ages 18 years or younger were counted (27.6 percent). Veterans accounted for 8.4
percent of the total homeless persons counted. Chronically homeless persons comprised 15.9
percent of the total. These figures demonstrate the typical demographics of a homeless individual
in San Joaquin County is a single, Caucasian male ages 24 years or older.

 The City of Stockton implements the Continuum of Care (CoC), which is a comprehensive, three-
 fold approach, to meets the needs of the City’s homeless. The first tier is emergency shelter and
 short-term housing, the second tier is transitional housing, and the third tier is permanent
 affordable housing. In order to address the problem of homelessness effectively, the City uses a
 comprehensive approach that combines these shelter and housing facilities with support services
 to address the needs of each of the sub-populations within the homeless population. Treatment of
 mental illness and substance abuse, counseling and protection for domestic violence victims, the
 provision of job training, and intensive case management are critical to reducing homelessness.

Stockton General Plan
The goal of a comprehensive homeless service system is to ensure that homeless individuals and
families move from homelessness to self-sufficiency, permanent housing, and independent living.
In addition, the City works with San Joaquin County in administering the Shelter Plus Care
Program to provide special supportive housing for persons with disabilities and for homeless
individuals. City staff meets on a regular basis with staff of other local agencies to identify local
issues and discuss appropriate programming of services for homeless persons and those
individuals with special needs. The Shelter Plus Care Program is designed to provide housing and
supportive services on a long term basis for homeless persons with disabilities, primarily those
with serious mental illnesses, chronic problems with alcohol and/or drugs, AIDS, or related
diseases who are living in places not intended for human habitation or in emergency shelters.
Overnight and Emergency Shelters
Table 4-34 summarizes overnight and emergency shelter facilities available in San Joaquin
County, including Stockton, the bed capacity, and the characteristics of clients they serve. The

Safe House is the only shelter that specifies serves unaccompanied youth under 18. Stockton
Shelter for the Homeless (SSH) and Gospel Center Rescue Mission (GCRM) have the greatest

    Transitional Housing
    For many, transitional housing, long-term rental assistance, and/or greater availability of low-
    income rental units are also needed. Transitional housing is usually in buildings configured as
    rental housing developments but operate with State programs that require the unit to be cycled to
    other eligible program recipients after some pre-determined amount of time. Supportive housing
    has no limit on length of stay and is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the resident in
    retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live
    well and work in the community.
    Transitional housing programs provide extended shelter and supportive services for homeless
    individuals and/or families with the goal of helping them live independently and transition into
    permanent housing. Some programs require that the individual/family transition from a short-term
    emergency shelter. The length of stay varies considerably by program but is generally longer than
    two weeks and can last up to 60 days or more. In many cases, transitional housing programs will
    provide services for up to two years or more. The supportive services may be provided directly by
    the organization managing the housing or by other public or private agencies in a coordinated
    effort with the housing provider. Transitional housing/shelter is generally provided in apartment-
    style facilities with a higher degree of privacy than short-term homeless shelters, may be provided
    at no cost to the resident, and may be configured for specialized groups within the homeless
    population such as people with substance abuse problems, mental illness, victims of domestic
    violence, veterans, or have AIDS/HIV.

Stockton Housing Element Update
Persons Diagnosed with AIDS and Related Diseases
According to the California Department of Public Health as of December 31, 2013 there have
been 1,421 reported cases of AIDS since the onset of the disease in the county in the 1980s.
Through the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program, federal funds are
allocated to the State and the County for the purpose of assisting people living with the disease in
securing permanent and affordable housing. Through San Joaquin County Public Health Services,
Stockton Shelter uses HOPWA funds to purchase and run transitional houses for AIDS-infected
persons who are homeless or having financial difficulties. Residents can stay in transitional housing
for up to 12 months while they secure a job, home, or SSI benefits. Within the City, Stockton
Shelter administers one transitional house, with capacity for eight individuals, and five
condominiums for families of three to four people. In addition to transitional housing, Stockton
Shelter also provides emergency assistance for people who cannot afford their housing payments
due to a health emergency or high health-care costs.
According to area health care providers, additional housing needs for people with AIDS and HIV
include more emergency housing assistance, funding to cover first- and last-month's rent, low-cost
housing for individuals such as residential hotels, and assisted living for persons in the middle- to
late-stages of the disease.
Extremely Low-Income Households
Extremely low-income (ELI) households are defined as those households with incomes under 30
percent of the area median income. Extremely low-income households typically consist of
minimum wage workers, seniors on fixed incomes, disabled individuals, and farmworkers. This
income group is likely to live in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions. This group of
households has specific housing needs that require greater government subsidies and assistance,
housing with supportive services, single room occupancy (SRO), and or shared housing, and/or
rental subsidies or vouchers. In recent years rising rents, higher income and credit standards
imposed by landlords and insufficient government assistance has exacerbated the problem.
Without adequate assistance this group has a high risk of homelessness.
In Stockton, a household of three persons with an income of $20,090 in 2015 would qualify as an
extremely low-income household. Table 4-37 shows the number of extremely low-income
households and their housing cost burden in Stockton, San Joaquin County, and California in
2012. As shown in the table, Stockton had a higher percentage (13.8 percent) of extremely low-
income households than countywide (10.3 percent), although slightly less than the state (14.7
percent). Following the statewide and countywide trends, the city had a larger proportion of
extremely low-income renter households (23.7 percent) than countywide (18.9 percent) and a
slightly smaller proportion than the state (24.5 percent). Stockton had a similar proportion of
extremely low-income owner households (4.7 percent) than countywide (4.3 percent) and less
than California (7.0 percent). In Stockton, 83.9 percent of extremely low-income households had
a moderate housing cost burden and 75.4 percent had a severe housing cost burden. This was
slightly higher than the cost burdens of extremely low-income households in the county and state.
Extremely low-income renters in Stockton had a much higher incidence (85.9 percent) of a
moderate housing cost burden than owners (74.9 percent) and 78.4 percent of renters had a
severe cost burden compared to 61.8 percent of owners. This information suggests that there is a
need for affordable rental units for extremely low-income residents in Stockton.

Stockton Housing Element Update
SECTION 3: THE RHNA AND SITES INVENTORY
Major Findings
        The San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) allocated 11,824 new housing units to
         the City of Stockton for the current RHNA projection period (January 1, 2014, to
         December 31, 2023). The allocation is equivalent to a yearly need of approximately
         1,182 housing units over a 10-year time period. Of the 11,824 housing units, 1,675 are
         to be affordable to extremely low-income households, 1,482 to very low-income
         households, 2,004 to low-income households, 2,103 to moderate-income households,
         and 4,560 to above moderate-income households.
        After accounting for built, approved, and under construction residential developments,
         the City exceeded its RHNA for above moderate- and moderate-income units. The City
         had a remaining need for 4,343 lower-income units. The vacant and underutilized sites
         inventory identified enough land to accommodate 1,167 above moderate-income units,
         880 moderate-income units, and 6,203 lower-income units, which exceeds the City’s
         2014-2023 RHNA for all income categories.
Introduction
State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the importance of an
adequate land supply by requiring that each Housing Element contain “an inventory of land
suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for
redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to
these sites” (Government Code Section 65583(a)(3)).
This section describes the City's Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) and analyzes the
resources and opportunities available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
affordable housing in Stockton. Included is an evaluation of the availability of land resources and
the adequacy of public facilities, services, and infrastructure for residential development during
the Housing Element planning period.
The inventory includes residential projects built or planned since the start of the RHNA projection
period (January 1, 2014) (see Table A-1) and the vacant and underutilized land that is suitable
and available within the city of Stockton for residential development (see Table A-2).
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
HCD is required to allocate the region’s share of the statewide housing need to Councils of
Governments (COG) based on Department of Finance population projections and regional
population forecasts used in preparing regional transportation plans. The COG develops a
Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) allocating the region’s share of the statewide need to cities
and counties within the region. The RHNP is intended to promote the following objectives:
        increase the housing supply and the mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in all
         cities and counties within the region in an equitable manner;
Page 4BR-56                              Background Report                    Adopted April 12, 2016

                                                                                                          4. Housing
            promote infill development and socioeconomic equity, the protection of environmental
             and agricultural resources, and the encouragement of efficient development patterns; and
            promote an improved intraregional relationship between jobs and housing.
  Housing element law requires a quantification of each jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing
  need as established in the RHNP prepared by the COG. The Regional Housing Needs Allocation
  (RHNA) is a minimum projection of additional housing units needed to accommodate projected
  household growth of all income levels by the end of the housing element statutory planning
  period. Each locality’s RHNA is distributed among five income categories to address the housing
  needs of all economic segments of the community.
  This section describes projected housing needs in Stockton based on the adopted Regional
  Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) prepared by the San Joaquin Council of Governments
  (SJCOG). SJCOG adopted its Regional Housing Needs Plan on August 28, 2014. As required by
  State law, SJCOG allocated to each jurisdiction a “fair share” of the regional housing need by
  income category (i.e., very low-, low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income). The allocations
  are intended to be used by jurisdictions when updating their housing elements as the basis for
  assuring that adequate sites with appropriate zoning are available to accommodate at least the
  number of units allocated.
  Countywide, the total housing need is 40,360 new units, of which the City received 11,824 units
  (29.3 percent). Table 4-38 shows the projected housing needs for the RHNA projection period
  from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023, for the City of Stockton.

Stockton Housing Element Update
Built and Approved Housing Units
One of the Housing Element’s main goals is to ensure that a variety of housing opportunities at a
range of prices and rents are made available to residents. This includes, but is not limited to,
conventional single family homes, multifamily apartments, town homes, and housing for special
needs groups. Since the RHNA projection period runs from January 1, 2014, to December 31,
2023, the RHNA can be reduced by the number of new units built or approved since January 1,
2014.
Affordability Assumptions for Market-Rate Development
Stockton has a very affordable housing market. Based on 2015 new home sales data and rental
listings, moderate-income households can afford the median market-rate sales price for single
family homes, and lower-income households can afford the average market-rate rent. In July
2015, the median home sales price in Stockton was $200,000 (CoreLogic, 2015). At this price a
3-person, moderate-income household, whose ability to purchase a single family home is about
$265,384, could afford a single family residential unit. Additionally, in 2015, the average market-
rate rent for a two-bedroom apartment is about $893 per month. An affordable rent for a low-
income household is less than $1,194. Average rental rates are generally affordable to low-income
households, but unaffordable to very low- and extremely low-income households. (See “Ability to
Pay for Housing Based on HUD Income Limits” for a more specific breakdown.)
Based on this analysis, it is assumed that a portion of new single family homes built since January
1, 2014 or approved but not yet built would be affordable to moderate-income households
(assumed as 20 percent for the purpose of the analysis), and the remaining single family units
would be affordable to above moderate-income households. It is also assumed that a portion of
new multifamily units built or approved would be affordable to low-income households (assumed
as 10 percent for the purpose of the analysis), and the remaining multifamily units would be
affordable to moderate-income households. These are conservative assumptions given current
affordability levels in the city.
Built and Approved Subdivisions and Projects
Table 4-39 summarizes market-rate units in subdivisions and projects that have been constructed
since the start of the current Housing Element projection period (January 1, 2014), are under
construction (as of September 23, 2015), or currently have entitlements during the Housing
Element planning period. A detailed inventory of these sites is available in Appendix A. There
are 27 current subdivision projects (as of September 2015) amounting to 3,638 acres of land.
Single family residential development accounts for a majority of the development potential in
these subdivisions and projects; however, there are 2,865 approved multifamily units.

Since January 1, 2014, the City has issued building permits for 177 single family units. Based on
the housing affordability described above, it is assumed that approximately 80 percent (142 units)
of these units would be affordable to above moderate-income households, and 20 percent of
these built single family units (35 units) would be affordable for moderate-income households.
Remaining, un-built single family units within approved subdivisions and projects can provide for
an additional 14,455 single family residential units. Similar to the units that have been issued
building permits (as described above), approximately 80 percent of these single family units
(11,564 units) are assumed to be affordable to above moderate-income households. It is
assumed that 20 percent of these new single family units (2,831 units) could be affordable to
moderate-income households.
There are an additional 2,865 multifamily units included in approved subdivisions and projects.
Based on the affordability analysis described above, it is assumed that about 10 percent of these
units will be affordable to lower-income households (287 units), and the remaining 90 percent
(2,578 units) will be affordable to moderate-income households.
Approved Affordable Housing Projects
City staff and the Consultants compiled an inventory of all residential projects with a deed-
restricted affordable housing component that have been constructed, are under construction, or
are approved and planned within the current Housing Element planning period as follows:
          Affordable units built since the start of the current RHNA projection period (January 1,
           2014);
          Affordable units currently (as of September 23, 2015) under construction; or
          Affordable units currently (as of September 23, 2015) approved and scheduled to be built
           by the end of the current Housing Element planning period (December 31, 2023)
Table 4-40 shows an inventory of deed-restricted built and approved affordable housing projects
within the city of Stockton. The effective inventory date is September 23, 2015, and the project
status as of that date is used for inventory purposes. For each project the table shows the name of
the development, address, APN, number of affordable units by income category, project status,
and type of units. As shown in the table, there are a total of 531 approved and built affordable
units counted in the inventory.

Remaining Need
Based on the information on approved and built projects presented in Table 4-39 and Table 4-
40, Stockton’s remaining housing need is calculated in Table 4-41. Units that have been
approved, built, or are under construction satisfy about 15.9 percent of the RHNA for lower-
income units and exceed the RHNA for moderate- and above-moderate-income units. The
remaining need to be satisfied during the Housing Element planning period is 4,343 lower-
income units. This remaining RHNA for lower-income units must be accommodated by vacant
and underutilized sites.

Opportunity Sites Available for Residential Development
The residential land inventory is required “to identify sites that can be developed for housing
within the planning period and that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s share of the
regional housing need for all income levels” (Government Code Section 65583.2(a)). The phrase
“land suitable for residential development” in Government Code Section 65583(a)(3) includes all
of the following:
         Vacant sites zoned for residential use;
         Vacant sites zoned for non-residential use that allows residential development;
         Residentially zoned sites that are capable of being developed at a higher density; and
         Sites zoned for non-residential use that can be redeveloped for, and as necessary, rezoned
          for, residential use.

Stockton Housing Element Update
The inventory is required to include the following (Government Code Section 65583.2(b)):
         A listing of properties by parcel number or other unique reference;
         The size of each property listed and the general plan designation and zoning of each
          property;
         For non-vacant sites, a description of the existing use of each property;
         A general description of any environmental constraints to the development of housing
          within the jurisdiction, the documentation for which has been made available to the
          jurisdiction. This information need not be identified on a site-specific basis.
         A general description of existing or planned water, sewer, and other dry utilities supply,
          including the availability and access to distribution facilities. This information need not be
          identified on a site-specific basis.
         Sites identified as available for housing for above-moderate income households in areas
          not served by public sewer systems. This information need not be identified on a site-
          specific basis.
         A map that shows the location of the sites included in the inventory, such as the land use
          map from the jurisdiction’s general plan for reference purposes only.
Methodology for Identifying Housing Sites
The data was compiled by City staff and the Consultants and mapped using a Geographic
Information System (GIS). The current (2015) inventory was built off the existing inventory
compiled in 2009. To update the inventory, City staff provided data on new building permits
issued between January 1, 2007 and September 23, 2015, and the Consultants used this data in
GIS to locate where permits had been issued for previously vacant and underutilized land. These
sites were removed from the inventory since they are no longer vacant. Furthermore, sites within
approved subdivisions and projects are not included in this inventory since they are already
counted against the RHNA.
The inventory was also updated to add new sites based on the SJCOG Regional Smart Growth
Transit-Oriented Development Plan (TODP), prepared in 2012. This Plan identifies opportunity
sites for transit-oriented development throughout the county. Sites identified in Stockton were
added to this housing sites inventory if they met the residential sites criteria established in this
inventory.
The following criteria were used to identify available residential sites:
Vacant Sites. Sites are considered vacant if they do not have any existing structures. Vacant
parcels were initially selected based on the County Assessor’s use codes in the parcel database.
Vacancy status was verified through aerial photographs and field observation, since the Assessor’s
use codes are not completely accurate for all parcels, the vacant parcel list was supplemented
with additional entries from City staff. The effective date of the vacancy status for each site is
September 23, 2015. Vacant sites were not included if they were located within an approved
project, since these units were already counted in the inventory.

                                                                                       4. Housing
Underutilized Sites. The criteria for sites considered underutilized are more complex than for
vacant sites. Based on the City’s vacant and underutilized parcel inventory, two steps were used
to determine parcels that have potential for reuse or redevelopment: evaluation of remaining site
capacity and location. Sites must also have the potential, based on zoning, to be developed for
residential uses.
The sites inventory primarily focuses on sites that are “physically underutilized”, meaning there is
additional capacity for development on the site without the need to remove the existing use. The
Consultants and City staff evaluated each underutilized site and identified what percentage of the
site was available for additional residential development. For example, if a site has a commercial
building occupying less than half of the site and there is remaining infill development capacity for
residential uses, the sites inventory assumes that at least 50 percent (depending on the size of the
undeveloped part of the site) of the site could accommodate additional residential development.
The percent development assumption is meant as a conservative estimate of the development
capacity and does not assume that the existing use would need to be removed in order to
develop on the site; however, some of the sites may be “economically underutilized” and have
uses that would likely be replaced prior to development. These economically underutilized sites
would likely develop with more units than what is assumed in the inventory.
The City has a history of allowing additional infill development on parcels with existing uses. For
example, in 2005 the City approved a 126-lot subdivision on a 15-acre site with an existing single
family home that remained on the site. In 2006 the City approved the subdivision of a 34,545
square foot parcel with an existing single family home into four small parcels, and in 2007 the
City approved two subdivisions of 0.5- and 0.29-acre lots to allow additional residential
development.
The City also has a history of adaptive reuse of properties. In 2002 the City renovated the Hotel
Stockton, built in 1910 as a 252-guest room hotel, into a mixed-use development incorporating
141 affordable, senior housing units. In 2008 the City approved the reuse of a former motel site
as a State-licensed residential drug and alcohol treatment center and transitional housing facility
with capacity for 120 residents. Currently (2015), Cal Weber 40, an adaptive mixed use project, is
under construction. Two buildings are being converted into a mixed-use project, which were
formerly used as assembly halls. The ground floor area, which is occupied by a variety of
commercial uses, will remain commercial while the second and third floors of the buildings,
which are currently vacant, will be renovated into 40 housing units available to rent to low- and
very low-income tenants. The project will also include a parking structure and an open space/play
area. To help with long-term affordability and sustainability, the project is being developed with
numerous energy efficient features, including solar panels; high efficiency HVAC units and water
heaters; energy star appliances; low flow toilets, shower heads, and faucets; low-e windows;
increased attic insulation; and locally sourced products.
The following shows examples of typical underutilized sites and illustrates the type of residential
infill that could occur. The shaded area of each site represents the developed part, and the
remaining area shows where infill development could occur.
Example 1 shows the development capacity on Site B-1-9. This 2.12-acre parcel contains an auto
sales company, whose building and parking area occupy an estimated 27 percent of the parcel.
The remaining 73 percent of the parcel is vacant land. This parcel has significant potential for
infill development on the unused part of the site. The sites inventory assumes that 70 percent of
the parcel is available for additional development.

Example 2 shows the development capacity on Site B2-34 from the 2009 Housing Element Sites
Inventory. This site is no longer included in the 2015 Housing Element inventory because it has
an approved affordable project on the site. This 3.05-acre parcel has a church and parking area
that occupy a small percentage of the parcel. The remaining area is currently (2015) vacant, but
Zettie Miller’s Haven, an 82-unit special needs housing project, is scheduled to begin
construction in 2016 (Table 4-40).

Example 3 is slightly different from the first two examples and shows how the City has grouped
adjacent vacant and underutilized parcels in the inventory to identify a larger opportunity site.
Site C-3-8 is made up of five adjacent parcels (18 acres), two of which are underutilized and
three of which are vacant. The 9.24-acre underutilized parcel contains a dilapidated, vacant
structure that was previously used for a golfing range. The sites inventory assumes that this parcel
is 100 percent underutilized and will fully redevelop. The 4.66-acre parcel contains a single
family home, detached garage, and storage sheds. The sites inventory assumes that this parcel is

Stockton Housing Element Update
90 percent underutilized. While the development of site C-34 could result in the replacement of
this single family home, the City has taken a conservative approach and assumes that it could
remain while infill development occurs around it.
TODP Sites Inventory. In creating the sites inventory for the Transit-Oriented Development Plan
(TODP), SJCOG worked with member jurisdictions to identify locations for infill development.
The TODP inventory used the 2009 Housing Element inventory as a starting point for identifying
TOD sites. As such, many sites identified by the TODP overlap with the sites identified in the
2009 Housing Element inventory. However, a different set of criteria identified additional sites in
the TODP that were added to the 2015 Housing Element inventory. These new sites are
identified with the term “TOD” in Table A-2. Other criteria used in the TODP methodology
include:
        The site must be within a half mile of an existing or proposed regional transit station,
         potential transit corridor or BRT, or within a half mile of a downtown;
        The site must be at least a half-acre or located in a downtown;
        The site must be surrounded on three sides by existing urban development; or
        The site must not have any pipeline projects or approved projects.
Site Size Threshold. The minimum site size considered feasible for development of lower-income
housing depends on the location within the city. Since sites in the Downtown Area can be
developed at densities up to 87 units per acre, it is feasible to develop more units on smaller sites;
however, allowed densities are lower for sites outside of the Downtown Area. The site thresholds
are also based on the City’s procedure to grant flexibility in development standards for infill
parcels to allow projects to achieve the maximum allowed density. The sites inventory assumes
the following site size thresholds for lower-, moderate-, and above moderate-income units:
        Downtown Area: This 253-acre area is bound by Fremont Street, Aurora Street, Hazelton
         Avenue, and Interstate 5. Sites as small as 0.20 acres were considered feasible for
         development of lower-income units in the Downtown Area based on higher allowed
         densities in this part of the city (i.e., maximum allowed density of 87 units per acre). This
         corresponds to recent development trends for affordable housing, the City’s desire to
         promote compact infill development Downtown as reflected in the 2035 General Plan,
         and General Plan policies and programs called for in the Settlement Agreement to require
         4,400 units in the Greater Downtown Area by 2035, which includes the Downtown Area.
         Vacant sites under 0.2 acres were considered feasible only for an above moderate-
         income single family residential unit. Underutilized sites below this threshold were not
         included in the inventory. Sites within the Downtown Area account for 23.9 percent of
         the opportunity sites inventoried.
        Greater Downtown Area: The Greater Downtown Area is about 2,479 acres (excluding
         the Downtown Area) and is generally bound by Harding Way, Charter Way (MLK),
         Pershing Avenue, and Wilson Way. Sites 0.5 acres and over were considered feasible for
         development of low-income units in the Greater Downtown Area based on the City’s
         desire to promote compact infill development and General Plan policies and programs
         called for in the Settlement Agreement to require 4,400 units in the Greater Downtown
         Area by 2035. Sites between 0.2 acres and 0.5 acres were considered available for
         moderate-income units based on the expected development type for these smaller

          parcels (e.g., duplexes, triplexes). Sites under 0.2 acres were considered only feasible for
          an above moderate-income single family residential unit. Sites within the Greater
          Downtown Area account for 5.3 percent of the opportunity sites inventoried.
         Other City Limits: The remaining area within the City limits is about 39,045 acres
          (excluding the Downtown Area, Greater Downtown Area). Sites 0.50 acres and greater
          were considered feasible for development of low-income units in the remaining City
          limits based on past trends and actions called for to develop 14,000 within in the 2008
          City limits as part of the Settlement Agreement with the Sierra Club and California
          Attorney General. Underutilized sites under 0.5 acres were not identified in the
          inventory. Vacant sites under 0.5 acres were considered only feasible for a single family
          residential unit. Sites within the remaining City limits account for 70.8 percent of the
          opportunity sites inventoried.
A summary of site size thresholds is provided in Table 4-42.

  Note: 1Applies only to vacant sites; underutilized sites are not considered feasible in the timeframe of the Housing Element.
The sites inventory groups individual parcels that are adjacent to one another and have the
potential for lot consolidation into single sites. The City has a history of facilitating lot
consolidation for the development of multifamily housing, including affordable housing. Table 4-
43 describes four projects in which the City assisted in consolidating adjacent, small lots. Three of
the four examples involve affordable housing. One example involved the consolidation of 28
small parcels that made up an entire city block. In addition, the Settlement Agreement directs the
City to focus on increasing the amount of residential development that occurs within the City
limits. When implemented, this will likely include strategies to encourage the consolidation of
adjacent vacant and underutilized parcels to facilitate residential development.

      Density Assumptions. In order to calculate the number of units that will accommodate its share
      of the regional housing need for lower-income households, a jurisdiction is required to do either
      of the following (Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)):
                 Provide an analysis demonstrating how the adopted densities accommodate this need.
                  The analysis shall include, but is not limited to, factors such as market demand, financial
                  feasibility, or information based on development project experience within a zone or
                  zones that provide housing for lower-income households.
                 Use the “default density standards” that are “deemed appropriate” in State law to
                  accommodate housing for lower-income households given the type of the jurisdiction.
                  The City of Stockton is classified as a “metropolitan jurisdiction” and the density standard
                  is defined as “sites allowing at least 30 units per acre.” HCD is required to accept sites
                  that meet this density standard as appropriate for accommodating Stockton’s share of the
                  regional housing need for lower-income households.
      The 29 units per acre maximum for high density zoning outside the Downtown Area and Greater
      Downtown Area is slightly lower than the 30 unit per acre default density, however, it is still a
      feasible density for lower-income housing in Stockton.
      To demonstrate that a density of 29 units per acre can encourage the development of housing
      affordable to lower income households, a three-part analysis was prepared based on market
      demand, financial feasibility, and project experience within the zone(s).
                 Market Demand. As shown in Table 4-44, market rents for apartments are affordable for
                  low-income households earning 80 percent of the area median income (AMI). According

        to HCD, the AMI for a four-person household in the Stockton MSA was $66,300 in 2015.
        Average rent for a one-bedroom is $734, and a low-income households can afford $995
        for a one-bedroom unit. Also, a two-bedroom average rent is $893-1,070, depending on
        the number of bathrooms, which is below the maximum rent affordable for a low-income
        household ($1,194). While the built densities and age or amenities of apartments for
        these figures are unknown, market rents, without financial subsidies, are within lower
        income affordability ranges; indicating that existing allowed densities can facilitate
        affordability for lower income households.

       Financial Feasibility. Given the availability and affordability of land in Stockton, densities
        of 29 units per acre encourage the development of housing affordable to lower income
        households. Land prices in Stockton are generally much less expensive than other parts of
        California such as the coastal region. Based on a sampling of residential land for sale in
        2015, the average listing price was $202,286 per acre.
The cost effectiveness of 29 units per acre, in simple terms, can be expressed in terms of land
costs per unit at various densities. For example, the following table uses a land price of $202,286
per acre. Based on a typical total development cost of approximately $274,000 per unit (see
Table 4-69), the table shows a less than significant difference between 20 units per acre and 30
units per acre, and no difference between 29 units per acre and 30 units per acre. Specifically,
land costs per unit at 29 units per acre are $6,975 per unit and represent 2.5 percent of total
development costs. Similarly at 30 units per acre, land costs are estimated at $6,743 per unit,
which also represents about 2.5 percent of total development costs. Given that land costs at 29
units per acre are similar to 30 units per acre and 30 units per acre is deemed appropriate to
accommodate housing for lower income households (Government Code Section 65583.2(c)), a
density of 29 units per acre is also appropriate for housing affordable to lower income
households.

   The City’s 2035 General Plan requires the City to promote compact infill development. In
   addition, actions called for in the Settlement Agreement with the Sierra Club and California
   Attorney General require the City to develop 4,400 units in the Downtown and Greater
   Downtown areas and 14,000 units elsewhere within the 2007 city limits. The City expects that
   the average densities of affordable, higher density projects will increase and the sites used for
   residential development will continue to be smaller with more compact residential development.
   To estimate the densities and affordability levels of zones included in the inventory, recent
   affordable and market rate projects were analyzed to determine average actual densities in each
   zoning district. Table 4-46 presents these estimates based on a range of about 70 percent to 85
   percent of the maximum allowed density. Descriptions of each zoning district can be found in
   Section 5 of the Housing Element. Potential housing development for opportunity sites have
   been estimated based on the typical densities from recent projects in each zone presented.

   Non-residential zoning districts that allow residential development include the CO, CN, CG, and
   CD zones. All of these zones allow 100 percent of development to be residential; however, to
   provide a conservative estimate for available land, the land inventory includes only 25 percent of
   the capacity of these sites for areas located outside the Greater Downtown Area. This assumption

                                                                                          4. Housing
reflects the fact that other uses, such as retail or office uses, could be built on these sites. Within
the Downtown and Greater Downtown Areas, 50 percent of the capacity is included in the
inventory for that area not zoned primarily for residential development. This reflects the City’s
desire to promote compact infill development and mixed use development as part of the 2035
General Plan and actions called for in the Settlement Agreement with the Sierra Club and
California Attorney General to develop 4,400 units in the Greater Downtown Area.
Although the inventory provides a conservative estimate for residential development in areas not
zoned for primarily residential uses, the City does has a history of developing non-residential
zoned sites with residential uses. To provide some recent (2015) examples, the City approved a
51 unit affordable housing project for veterans on a 0.6 acre site zoned Commercial Downtown,
located at 601 North Hunter Street. The City also approved an 82 unit affordable housing project
for veterans located at 804 North Hunter Street, zoned Commercial Office, and entails an
adaptive reuse of an existing commercial building. Currently (2015), there is a 0.3 acre site in the
Downtown Area, zoned Commercial Downtown, under construction for a 40-unit affordable
housing project located at 506 and 520 East Weber Avenue.
Single small sites were identified as more affordable since the lots are smaller and therefore
support smaller, more affordable housing types. Therefore, single small sites identified in the
inventory were assumed to be affordable for moderate-income households. Low density
residential (LDR) sites, by contrast, are generally larger and can support larger, higher-value
housing types. Therefore, 80 percent of LDR sites were assumed affordable for above moderate-
income households, while 20 percent of LDR sites were assume affordable for moderate-income
households. Please see the “Built and Approved Housing Units” section above for a more detailed
discussion of affordability levels of different housing types.
Environmental Constraints. All parcels included in the sites inventory were reviewed for any
known environmental constraints. The sites included in the inventory have all been designated for
residential development and are not constrained by topography, known environmental factors, or
other site specific constraints that would limit development, with the exception of flood issues.
Some of the parcels are located within the 100-year floodplain, as noted in Table A-2. The City
does not prohibit development within the 100-year floodplain, but requires development to build
two feet above the base flood elevation. Most of the floodplain within the city limits has a low
base flood elevation; however, some areas, mostly along the western edge of the city limits have a
base flood elevation in excess of 10 feet. Residential development in these areas may require
special design treatments such as elevation of the living space with garage and storage space
below as allowed under FEMA regulations. The sites inventory does not include parcels with a
base flood elevation in excess of 10 feet.
Summary of Vacant and Underutilized Sites
Table 4-47 summarizes the number and affordability level of units that could be built on vacant
and underutilized sites included in the inventory. Sites that could accommodate projects
affordable to lower-income households account for about 75.2 percent (6,203 units) of the sites
in the inventory. Sites that could be affordable to moderate-income households account for
about 10.7 percent (880 units). The remaining capacity is on sites that are assumed to
accommodate only above moderate-income housing, which accounts for about 14.1 percent
(1,167 units) of the inventory.

Stockton Housing Element Update
Second Units
In Stockton, second units are also a potential source of affordable housing. In addition to
identifying vacant or underutilized land resources, State law allows the City to address a portion of
the RHNA through the provision of second units. A projection of the number of second units
expected to be built should be based on the number built during the previous planning period.
However, given the lack of development during the recession, the projection of second units
within this Housing Element period is based on pre-recession development trends. As shown in
Table 4-48, Stockton permitted 22 second units from January 1, 2004 through March 30, 2008,
with an average of four units per year.

Table 4-49 summarizes the development potential of second units during the timeframe of the
Housing Element. This projection is based on the average development trends that occurred for
these unit types between 2004 and 2008. As Table 4-48 shows, 32 second units are expected to
be constructed through the time frame of the Housing Element based on average second unit
construction trends described in Table 4-47. These unit types are typically affordable to lower-
income households; however, as a conservative estimate the inventory counts these units as
affordable to moderate-income households.

Total Holding Capacity vs. Projected Needs by Income Group
Table 4-50 provides a summary of residential holding capacity compared to the adjusted
remaining share of the regional housing need (see Table 4-41). As shown in Table 4-50, Stockton
has adequate land in approved projects to meet its moderate-and above moderate-income
housing needs. The City’s adjusted remaining RHNA obligation for lower income households is
4,343 dwelling units (i.e., households of extremely low, very low, and low incomes). After
accounting for approved projects, second units, and capacity on vacant and underutilized sites
zoned RL, RM, RH, CO, CN, CG, and CD, the City has sufficient capacity for lower-income units,
and exceeds it by 1,860 units.

Adequacy of Public Facilities and Infrastructure
State law requires local governments to provide a copy of the adopted housing element to all
water and sewer providers. In addition, water and sewer providers must grant priority for service
allocations to developments that include units affordable to lower-income households. The city of
Stockton will comply with SB 1087 and provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to all
water and sewer providers.
This section addresses the adequacy of public facilities, services, and infrastructure to
accommodate planned residential growth through the end of the Housing Element planning
period (December 31, 2023). The following information regarding the adequacy of public
facilities and infrastructure is based largely on information from the 2008 City of Stockton
Municipal Service Review (MSR) and 2035 General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
Water
Water systems in the Stockton Metropolitan Area use a combination of treated surface water
provided by the Stockton East Water District and pumped groundwater to supply water within the
city. Stockton water purveyors include the City of Stockton Municipal Utilities Department,
California Water Service Company, and San Joaquin County Maintenance Districts.
Stockton has met and expects to be able to continue to meet annual water demands within the
city during differing hydrologic periods with surface water, groundwater, water conservation, and
other potential water supplies, such as non-potable supplies from local communities, raw surface

water from local irrigation districts, and water from active groundwater storage projects. The City’s
2035 General Plan commits the City to maintain existing facilities and develop new water
treatment and delivery facilities. The Plan includes policies that ensure and require that adequate
water supplies and facilities are located and maintained throughout the urbanized areas of the
city to meet future growth. In addition, any costs associated with new facilities and/or upgrades to
existing facilities will be offset through the increased revenue and fees generated by future
development. The City will review future projects on an individual basis and will require
compliance with City requirements (e.g., impact fees) in effect at the time building permits are
issued.
Sewer
The City’s wastewater collection and treatment facilities consist of the Stockton Regional
Wastewater Control Facility (RWCF) and the City of Stockton Wastewater Collection System
Facilities. The RWCF provides primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater
from throughout the city. According to the City’s 2008 Municipal Service Review, the RWCF has
a dry weather flow capacity of 48 mgd and actual dry weather flows are estimated at 35 mgd.
The City’s sanitary sewer collection system is divided into 10 designated sub-areas or “systems.”
Pump stations are located throughout the city and are integral to the wastewater collection
system. Most of the pump stations discharge to pressure sewers that convey flow under pressure
either directly to the RWCF or to a downstream gravity sewer.
The Stockton Wastewater Control Facility provides primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment of
municipal wastewater from throughout the city. The RWCF is located north of Highway 4 on both
sides of the San Joaquin River. The primary and secondary treatment facilities are located on the
east side of the river, while secondary polishing facilities (consisting of 630 acres of oxidation
ponds plus dissolved air flotation facilities), filtration facilities, and disinfection facilities are located
on the west side of the river. The RWCF includes filtration facilities to meet Title 22-based
requirements, including addition of nitrifying biotowers to the tertiary treatment facilities and an
effluent polishing wetland.
The current (2015) treatment facilities will remain in service until such time as additional facilities
are needed to accommodate the projected wastewater flows and loads. These facilities will also
be required to provide higher levels of treatment that will be needed to meet anticipated
discharge requirements. Phasing and timing of additional facilities to accommodate additional
growth are discussed in the 2011 Capital Improvement and Energy Management Plan.
Infrastructure Financing
The City of Stockton 2035 General Plan requires new development to pay its fair share of the
costs of public facilities and utilities needed to support additional growth. Stockton receives funds
for the provision of public services through State sources, development fees, property taxes, and
connection and usage fees. The City reviews its fee structures on an annual basis to ensure that
they provide adequate funding to cover the provision of City services. The City’s standard
condition of development requires preparation of a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for
specific plans and master plans. The City charges public utility fees on a per-dwelling unit basis
for residential uses. Because the City and other service agencies have adequate fee structures and
planning processes described above to ensure that the fees remain sufficient to cover costs of
required services, no financial constraints to service provision have been identified. The City’s

policy ensures it will continue its efforts to maintain funding of existing and future public facilities
and services.
The City has also received funding for capital improvement projects from the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The City receives subventions from the State of
California, such as gas tax revenues, which are used for infrastructure projects, and has also
benefited from one-time special allocations from the State for law enforcement and parks capital
improvement projects. The City has also been successful in applying for a variety of infrastructure
related grants.
The 2008 City of Stockton MSR found the water and sewer capacity adequate to meet current
and future demands within the city limits. Future development outside the existing city limits
within the Sphere of Influence boundary will require the development of new facilities. To
adequately meet future demands, new residential developments are required to pay for the major
capital improvements for water and sewer needed to serve future residents.

SECTION 4: EXISTING HOUSING PROGRAMS AND
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Introduction
This section provides information on local housing programs as well as local, State, and Federal
financial resources that are available to support the City of Stockton’s housing programs. Because
of the high cost of new construction, more than one source of public funds is often required to
construct an affordable housing development. The City of Stockton partners with the private
sector to develop new units with the assistance of these various funding sources. The City also
uses funds to support housing rehabilitation and preservation of the city’s older neighborhoods,
assist first-time homebuyers, and provide various other housing services to lower-income
households.
Major Findings
          From FY 2009/10 to FY 2014/15, the City provided approximately $27 million in financial
           assistance to over 500 lower-income households through its housing programs.
          Over the past several years, Stockton received approximately $3 million annually in
           CDBG funds. In Stockton, CDBG dollars are used to fund a wide range of activities
           including, housing and neighborhood preservation, economic development through job
           retention and creation activities, pursuit of public improvements and facilities, elimination
           of blight and blighting elements, and special programs offering significant community
           benefit and in direct support of local objectives.
          The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocated $12.1 million
           during the first round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program funding (NSP-1). The City
           also received $4.2 million during the third round of funding (NSP-3). The City used the
           funds to acquire and repair foreclosed properties, offer down payment and closing cost
           assistance to low- and moderate-income homebuyers, and rehabilitate foreclosed multi-
           family properties.
          As of September 2015, there are 3,297 affordable housing units in Stockton. In addition,
           there are seven affordable housing projects that are planned or under construction and
           are scheduled to provide an additional 415 units.
          There are currently (2015) four deed-restricted, affordable housing projects with a total of
           552 units at risk of converting to market-rate before 2025: Steamboat Landing, Village
           East, Hammer Lane Village, and Silvercrest.
Local Housing Programs
City of Stockton
The Housing Division of the City of Stockton Economic Development Department works closely
with other agencies in facilitating the production and preservation of affordable housing, assisting
in the development of suitable living environments, and expanding economic opportunities to
low-income families by providing them with financial assistance loans.
Page 4BR-78                                 Background Report                 Adopted April 12, 2016

                                                                                      4. Housing
Single Family Housing Repair Loan Program
The Single-Family Housing Repair Loan program provides low-income homeowners financial
assistance for home repairs. Funding for the loan program comes from CDBG, HOME, and
CalHome. The program aims to bring local housing into compliance with California Building Code
Standards and improve accessibility for homeowners. The following are the program guidelines:
        Eligibility: Low-income (80 percent AMI or lower), located within city limits, owner-
         occupied single-family or two units on one lot with one of the units occupied by the
         eligible owner.
        Loan Term: 30 years, deferred.
        Loan Interest Rate: one percent simple interest.
        Other: The owner’s debt ratio may not exceed 55 percent; the property loan-to-value
         ratio (after repair) may not surpass 105 percent.
Between fiscal years 2010/2011 and 2014/2015, the Single-Family Housing Repair Loan program
completed 14 housing unit rehabilitations. The cost of rehabilitation or reconstruction was
$26,274 to $70,780 per unit, with an average cost of $46,639 per unit over the five years. The
total 14 units rehabilitated or reconstructed over the five years used nearly $653,000 (see Table
4-51).
Emergency Housing Repair Program
The Emergency Housing Repair Program provides up to $30,000 in one-time funding for the
correction of code violations from the City, Fire Marshall or Health Officers to low-income
property owners. Funds are available on a case-by-case basis from CalHome and CDBG funds.
The following are the program guidelines:
        Eligibility: Low-income (80 percent AMI), owner-occupied, property within city limits.
        Loan Term: 30 years; loan forgiven after seven years if the borrower does not sell or
         transfer ownership; for senior households (60 years and over) the loan is forgivable.
        Loan Interest Rate: Zero percent, deferred.
        Other: property loan-to-value ratio (after repair) may not surpass 105 percent.
The total funding and the funding per unit for this program has fluctuated from the fiscal years
2010/2011 to 2014/2015. In 2010/2011, the program made six small loans of approximately
$10,000 each, and in 2011/2012 there were also six loans of approximately $15,000 each. In
2012/2013 there were five loans, and 2013/2014 declined to two loans. Most recently, in
2014/2015 there were five loans of approximately $23,000 each. Over seven fiscal years, the
Emergency Repairs Program awarded approximately $351,000 for 24 units, for an average of just
under $15,000 per unit (see Table 4-51).
Down Payment Assistance Program
The Down Payment Assistance Program for the City uses funds from NSP, CalHome, and HOME.
The goal is to increase the homeownership rate by helping lessen the burden of a down payment
Adopted April 12, 2016                    Background Report                            Page 4BR-79

and closing costs for low-income residents. The program lends up to $10,000 in assistance (or 5
percent of the purchase price plus the closing costs) toward the purchase of the home, plus
accessibility repairs to residences for handicapped persons. The funds are loaned for 30 years
with a simple interest rate of 3 percent for the first 15 years and zero interest for remaining 15
years.
        Eligibility: Low-income (80 percent AMI), first-time homebuyers, must reside or be
         employed within the City of Stockton for 12 months before applying.
        Loan Term: 30 years; deferred; amount of up to $10,000 or 5 percent of purchase price,
         plus closing costs.
        Loan Interest Rate: 3 percent for first 15 years and zero percent for remaining 15 years;
         at end of 30-year period owe entire amount of loan and a “balloon payment” of five
         percent of the home’s net appreciation.
        Other: Borrowers are required to attend a home buyer class from a City-approved
         provider.
The amount of funding and the number of recipients of down payment assistance varied greatly
from fiscal years 2010/2011 to 2014/2015. The total amount of funding peaked at $384,747 in
fiscal year 2012/2013, compared to $97,580 in total funding in 2010/2011. The amount of
funding spent on the program each year is a product of the number of qualified applicants, and
the amount of funding requested. In total, from fiscal years 2010/2011 to 2014/2015, the
program awarded just under $1.1 million to 84 homebuyers, or just under $13,000 per unit (see
Table 4-51).
Multi-Family Projects
The City provides funds for acquisition and predevelopment costs and for the cost of building or
renovating multifamily units. Funding comes from HOME, NSP, and Community Development
Block Grants – Recovery (CDBG-R). The following are the program guidelines:
        Eligibility: Funds are awarded through NOFA process and are project specific.
        Loan Term: Variable based on project.
        Loan Interest Rate: Variable based on project.
Between fiscal years 2010/2011 and 2014/2015, 381 units in Stockton were completed that
received funding through the Multi-Family Projects program. In the fiscal year 2010/2011,
$8,435,243 from HOME/RDA funds went toward building 125 units at Vintage Plaza and Gleason
Park Apartments. In fiscal year 2011/2012, $350,000 from CDBG-R went to 60 units. In
2012/2013, $5.2 million went towards 91 units. Nearly $6.2 million of HOME/RDA funds went
toward 71 units in 2013/2014. In addition, 49 units received funding in 2014/2015 (see Table
4-51).

Neighborhood Services - Code Enforcement
The Neighborhood Services Division of the Police Department enforces codes, laws, and
regulations for the abatement of substandard housing conditions and zoning violations, blight
issues, and the abatement of abandoned, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles. The City processed
84,777 housing code enforcement cases over the last seven years–an average of about 12,111
cases each year.
Since 2004, code enforcement has become a more important facet of the City’s operations.
Many of the problems the City faced in the past have become more manageable because of
public awareness and understanding of what can be done to fix the problems. Additional
resources and programs have also been made available to aid rehabilitation and renovation.
Stockton Code Enforcement operates primarily on a complaint basis. Once a code enforcement
officer (CEO) verifies a complaint, a Violation Warning Notice is prepared and posted on the
property and sent in the mail to the occupant and Property Owner (if different). The Violation
Warning Notice denotes the violations found and gives a deadline by which to correct the
violations. If compliance is not obtained, there are various administrative tools available, including
fees, fines, abatement, and civil penalties. The CEOs make every effort to work with property
owners and tenants and assist whenever possible. The response to the City’s approach and case
processing procedures has been positive. Approximately 30 percent of the cases are closed after
the first Violation Warning Notice and the number of administrative fines has declined in the past
few years.
The most common housing violations are structural problems, raw sewage, exposed wiring, and
other exterior housing problems. The majority of housing cases usually take a minimum of 45
days to resolve depending on the amount and severity of the violations. The potential causes of
these house code violations include the volume of rental housing and the structural age of many
buildings in the city. The majority of the violations involve multifamily dwellings. Rental property
owners, especially those not in the area, find it difficult to maintain their properties and monitor
their tenants on a regular basis. In the downtown and midtown areas, many of the buildings are
among the first built when Stockton became a City in 1851. Although they have been maintained
to some extent, many have serious structural problems that are difficult and costly to fix.
Former Stockton Redevelopment Agency
California law eliminated redevelopment agencies throughout the state in February 2012. The
law, Assembly Bill X1 26, required the establishment of successor agencies to take over the
remaining vestiges of redevelopment. Additionally in June 2012 Governor Brown signed into law
Assembly Bill 1484 (AB 1484). One of the key components of AB 1484 was the requirement that
all successor agencies develop a Long-Range Property Management Plan that governs the
disposition and use of former non-housing redevelopment agency properties. In August 2011 the
City of Stockton passed a resolution stating it would serve as the Successor Agency to the Stockton
Redevelopment Agency and the City would assume the Redevelopment Agency housing
functions. In April 2012 the City established the Stockton Successor Agency Oversight Board to
direct and approve functions of the Successor Agency. As the Successor Agency, the City oversees
bond proceeds of the former Redevelopment Agency.

Housing Authority of San Joaquin County
The Housing Authority of San Joaquin County has several programs to assist low- and moderate-
income households with housing costs, including the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP),
public housing, and migrant farmworker housing. The Public Housing Program provides rental
assistance at four main sites (two in Stockton, one in Tracy, and one in Thornton). Through the
Migrant Program the Housing Authority manages two migrant farm labor housing developments
located throughout the unincorporated areas of the county. In addition, the San Joaquin Housing
Authority provides the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, supportive services centers, and the
Resident Construction Program.
Housing Choice Vouchers Program (HCVP)
The San Joaquin Housing Authority manages the Housing Choice Vouchers Program (Section 8)
for all of San Joaquin County. The program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the
current fair market rent and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g. 30 percent of their income). The
voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment standard, but the
tenant must pay the extra cost. As of March 2015, 4,981 households in San Joaquin County
received rental assistance through HCVP.
Public Housing
The San Joaquin Housing Authority provides public housing at the four main locations shown in
Table 4-52. Two of the housing developments–Conway Homes and Sierra Vista Homes–are
located in Stockton. Both developments provide single-family homes at rents affordable to low-
income households. In addition, the Agency owns and manages four market-rate properties:
West Park Street Apartments, Washington Avenue Apartments, Mourfield Avenue Apartments,
and Claremont Manor Apartments. There are currently (February 2015) 14,428 households on
the waiting list for public housing.

Federal Housing Programs
There are several Federal funding programs that assist first-time homebuyers, build affordable
housing, and help special needs groups, such as seniors and large households. In most cases
other entities, including for-profit and non-profit developers, apply for funds or other program
Page 4BR-84                                     Background Report                         Adopted April 12, 2016

                                                                                       4. Housing
benefits. For example, developers apply directly to USDA for Section 515 loans, to HUD for
Section 202 and Section 811 loans, or to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC)
for low-income housing tax credits. In general, the City of Stockton relies upon the private sector
to develop new affordable units.
Entitlement Funds
As an entitlement community under Federal HUD regulations, the City of Stockton receives
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME)
funds, and Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG). Stockton relies on these entitlement funds to
support the majority of the City’s housing programs. These Federal dollars can be used toward a
wide range of activities, and to direct their use the Stockton City Council adopted the following
primary goals in the 2015-2020 Consolidated Plan:
         1. Preserve, improve, and expand the supply of decent affordable housing for lower-
             income households;
         2. Provide housing and services for the City’s homeless populations, including
             homelessness prevention;
         3. Provide housing and services necessary to meet the needs of the City’s non-homeless
             special needs population;
         4. Promote economic development activities that create, attract, and retain jobs and
             promote economic activity and vitality, especially those that provide economic
             opportunities for lower- and moderate-income persons; and
         5. Provide high quality public services to support ongoing community development,
             including the provision of funding for fair housing services, among other activities.
CDBG Funds
Over the past several years, Stockton received approximately $3.75 million annually in CDBG
funds. The Stockton Fiscal Year 2013/2014 HUD Performance Profile indicates that 82.7 percent
of CDBG funds directly assisted extremely low-income (less than 30 percent AMI), 15.5 percent
for low-income (30-50 percent AMI), and 1.6 percent for moderate-income (50-80 percent AMI).
The majority of CDBG funds were allocated toward repayment of Section 108 Loans throughout
FY 2009/2010 to 2013/2014. CDBG funds also went toward public services, public facilities,
economic development activities, and single family home rehabilitation. Housing activities funded
with CDBG funds in fiscal years 2010/2011 through 2013/2014 focused on a range of activities
including affordable housing, owner-occupied housing rehabilitation, down payment assistance,
public services, code enforcement, and homeless shelters and services.
HOME Program Funds
The City of Stockton funds many of its affordable housing programs using Home Investment
Partnerships Act (HOME). During fiscal year 2013/2014 the City expended over $2 million in
HOME funds, and earned $251,409 of HOME program income. The City applied these funds to
complete 71 affordable units and invest in projects for an additional 200 affordable units. The
City carries out these activities through partnerships with private for-profit developers, non-profit
Adopted April 12, 2016                    Background Report                             Page 4BR-85

Stockton General Plan
housing corporations, or Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs). Eligibility
for HOME funds varies with each activity, but all recipients must be low-income households.
ESG Funds
The City of Stockton expended about $266,620 in Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program
funds during fiscal year 2013/2014. The City allocated all of its ESG funds to the following five
shelters: Gospel Center Rescue Mission, Haven of Peace, Stockton Shelter of the Homeless, St.
Mary’s Interfaith Dining Room, and the Women’s Center – Youth & Family Services. The shelters
used the ESG funds for operations and maintenance, assistance with utilities, and the provision of
essential services. The City also provided homeless prevention and re-housing with ESG funds to
Central Valley Low Income Housing Corporation.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
Congress established the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) for the purpose of stabilizing
communities that have suffered from foreclosures and abandonment by providing funding to
purchase and redevelop foreclosed and abandoned homes and residential properties. Through
three rounds of NSP funding, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
allocated approximately $6.92 billion to all states, particularly to hard-hit areas.
HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) provided targeted emergency assistance to
state and local governments to acquire and redevelop foreclosed properties that might otherwise
become sources of abandonment and blight. State and local governments can use the NSP grants
to acquire land and property, demolish or rehabilitate abandoned properties, and offer down
payment and closing cost assistance to low- and moderate-income homebuyers. Through the NSP
governments can also create "land banks"–public authorities that can acquire, hold, manage, and
develop foreclosure properties. Congress directed that NSP grant funds must be obligated for
specific activities within 18 months of execution of the grant agreement.
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the following three specific
targeting responsibilities for state and local governments implementing the NSP including:
        All of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this section shall be used
         with respect to individuals and families whose income does not exceed 120 percent of
         area median income;
        Not less than 25 percent of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under
         this section shall be used for the purchase and redevelopment of abandoned or
         foreclosed homes or residential properties that will be used to house individuals or
         families whose incomes do not exceed 50 percent of area median income; and
        Grantees should give priority emphasis in targeting the funds that they receive to "those
         metropolitan areas, metropolitan cities, urban areas, rural areas, low- and moderate-
         income areas, and other areas with the greatest need, including those with the greatest
         percentage of home foreclosures; with the highest percentage of homes financed by a
         subprime mortgage related loan; and identified by the State or unit of general local
         government as likely to face a significant rise in the rate of home foreclosures.”
Page 4BR-86                                Background Report                  Adopted April 12, 2016

                                                                                       4. Housing
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program also seeks to protect future homebuyers from
foreclosures by requiring that new homebuyers receive housing counseling and obtain a mortgage
loan from a lender who agrees to comply with sound lending practices.
HUD allocated $12.1 million during the first round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program
funding (NSP-1) to the City of Stockton. The City also received $4.2 million during the third
round of funding (NSP-3). The City used the funds to purchase and repair foreclosed properties,
offer down payment and closing cost assistance to low- and moderate-income homebuyers, and
to purchase and rehabilitate several foreclosed multifamily properties.
Section 811 Program
The Section 811 program, sponsored by HUD, provides interest-free capital advances and rental
assistance funds to private, nonprofit sponsors to help finance the development of housing for
persons with disabilities. Public sponsors are not eligible to apply for Section 811 funds. The
capital advance can cover the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of supportive housing.
The sponsor does not have to repay the capital advance as long as the project serves the target
population for 40 years. Additionally, rental assistance funds are provided for three years to cover
the difference between the HUD-approved operating cost for the development and the rent paid
by tenants–usually 30 percent of adjusted income. These three-year contracts are renewable
based on the availability of funds. The last appropriation of traditional 811 capital advances was
made in FY 2011/2012; however, funds may become available again in the future.
Section 202 Program
The Section 202 program, also sponsored by HUD, is similar to the Section 811 Program;
however, the target population for the Section 202 program is the very low-income elderly. The
same capital advance and rental assistance is available to private, non-profit sponsors of
affordable elderly housing. As with the Section 811 program, public sponsors are not eligible for
the Section 202 program.
Low-Income Tax Credits
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was created in 1986 by the Federal
Government as a method for funding affordable housing. Depending on the project, the program
gives either a nine percent or four percent income tax credit over a 10-year period to the housing
developer to help leverage the private costs of construction and rehabilitation of affordable
housing units. Since the amount of credit available to the owner often exceeds the amount the
owner can use, private investors frequently participate in the LIHTC project through a syndication
process and receive Federal tax credits in return for an upfront investment.
Applying for the LIHTC program is a competitive process. Projects are ranked relative to each
other based on criteria in the State’s Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP). The QAP considers factors
such as cost, amenities, and project location when comparing proposed projects. To qualify for
the LIHTC program, projects must also meet specific minimum requirements. These requirements
are as follows:
Adopted April 12, 2016                   Background Report                              Page 4BR-87

Stockton General Plan
        At least 20 percent of the residential units must be affordable to individuals whose
         income is 50 percent or less of the area median household income; or
        At least 40 percent of the residential units must be affordable to individuals whose
         income is 60 percent or less of the area median household income; and
        The housing units must remain affordable for a 30-year period.
State Funding Programs
Proposition 1C Funding
The Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, known as Proposition 1C,
authorized $2.85 billion in State funding for a variety of housing programs. Proposition 1C funds
have recently been allocated toward the CalHome, Infill Infrastructure Grant (IIG), Multifamily
Housing Program (MHP), Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Housing Program, and many
other housing programs. An estimated $279 million in funds are available for future NOFAs.
Multifamily Housing Program (MHP)
The Multifamily Housing Program (MHP) is intended to assist in the construction, rehabilitation,
and preservation of permanent and transitional rental housing for lower-income households.
MHP funds can be used by local governments, non-profit and for-profit organizations and
corporations, and private individuals.
Infill Infrastructure Grant (IIG) Program
Sponsored by HCD, the Infill Infrastructure Grant (IIG) Program provides funds to local
government agencies, developers, and business improvement districts to make infrastructure
improvements that are necessary to develop housing in urbanized infill areas. Infrastructure
improvements for infill development include: park creation; water, sewer, or other public
infrastructure; transportation improvements; traffic mitigation; and sidewalk and streetscape
improvements.
CalHome
CalHome provides grants to local public agencies and nonprofit developers to assist low and very-
low income households to become or remain homeowners. Eligible activities include:
predevelopment, site development, and site acquisition for development projects; rehabilitation,
acquisition, and rehabilitation of homes; and downpayment assistance, mortgage financing,
homebuyer counseling, and technical assistance for self-help.

Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) Program
The Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) Program is administered by the
California Strategic Growth Council and implemented by the Department of Housing and
Community Development. Funds can be used to fund land use, housing, transportation, and land
preservation projects to support infill and compact development that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. The AHSC Program focuses on affordable housing development and benefitting
disadvantaged communities.
Private Funding
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) directs the Department of the Treasury, the
Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board to encourage and assist the institutions they regulate to meet the credit needs of their
communities. These agencies must assess the records of their member institutions when
evaluating applications for a charter or other regulated transactions. As a result of the CRA, many
major financial institutions have elected to actively participate in funding low- and moderate-
income housing developments developed by non-profit corporations.
The Federal Home Loan Bank provides direct project financing through its member institutions as
part of its Affordable Housing Program. The Savings Associations Mortgage Company (SAMCO),
which is an organization of savings institutions, also provides financing for affordable housing
developments. The California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC) was formed to pool
the resources of the state's banks to assist in financing affordable housing. Finally, the Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) provides permanent financing for affordable housing
development by purchasing or securitizing the lender-originated first mortgages on mutually
agreeable terms.
Assisted Housing Projects in Stockton
Table 4-53 provides a list of the subsidized affordable housing stock in the city of Stockton as of
September 2015. This affordable housing stock consists of 3,253 units. All the affordable housing
developments cater exclusively to low- and very low-income households with several of the
developments providing housing for seniors and farmworkers.
In addition, there are several affordable housing projects that are planned or under construction.
Table 4-40 (see Section 3, The RHNA and Sites Inventory) shows projects that are underway and
are expected to be completed during the Housing Element Planning Period.

                                                                                                 4. Housing
    Preserving At-Risk Units
    Over the past several decades, hundreds of thousands of affordable rental housing units have
    been constructed in California with the assistance of federal, state, and local funding (loans or
    grants) that restricted rents and occupancy of units to low-income households for specified
    periods of time. Once these restrictions expire, a property owner may charge market rents. Low-
    income occupants are often displaced when rents rise to market levels.
    State law requires that housing elements include an inventory of all publicly assisted multi-family
    rental housing projects within the local jurisdiction that are at risk of conversion to uses other than
    low-income residential within 10 years of the beginning of the housing element planning period
    (December 31, 2015, through December 31, 2025).
    California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of Federally-assisted
    properties must provide notice of intent to convert their properties to market rate 12 months and
    six months prior to the expiration of their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment. Owners must
    provide notices of intent to public agencies, including HCD, the local redevelopment agency, and
    the local public housing authority, and to all impacted tenant households. The six-month notice
    must include specific information on the owner’s plans, timetables, and reasons for termination.
    Under Government Code Section 65863.11, owners of Federally-assisted projects must provide a
    Notice of Opportunity to Submit an Offer to Purchase to Qualified Entities, non-profit or for-profit
    organizations that agree to preserve the long-term affordability if they should acquire at-risk
    projects, at least one year before the sale or expiration of use restrictions. Qualified Entities have
    first right of refusal for acquiring at-risk units.
    Units are considered “at-risk” if they will be eligible for termination of a rent subsidy contract,
    mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions within the next 10-years. Table 4-54 shows the
    assisted housing projects in Stockton that are considered “at risk.” There are four affordable
    housing projects with a total of 552 units at risk of conversion before December 31, 2025:
    Steamboat Landing, Village East, Hammer Lane Village, and Silvercrest (Table 4-54).

Preservation Options
State law also requires that housing elements include a comparison of the costs to replace the at-
risk units through new construction or to preserve the at-risk units. Preserving at-risk units can be
accomplished by facilitating a transfer of ownership to a qualified affordable housing organization,
purchasing the affordability covenants, and/or providing rental assistance to tenants.
Acquisition and Rehabilitation
One method of ensuring long-term affordability of low-income units is to transfer ownership to a
qualified non-profit or for-profit affordable housing organization. This transfer would make the
project eligible for refinancing using affordable housing financing programs, such as low-income
housing tax credits and tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. These financing programs would
ensure affordability for at least 55 years. Generally, rehabilitation often accompanies a transfer of
ownership.
Table 4-55 shows the estimated costs to acquire and rehabilitate the at-risk units. Acquisition
costs are based on the 2015 assessed value of each property, and a per unit rehabilitation cost of
$50,000 is assumed. The total estimated cost to acquire and rehabilitate all of the at-risk
affordable housing projects in Stockton (i.e., Hammer Lane Village, Silvercrest, Steamboat
Landing, and Village East) is an estimated $45.3 million. This is very likely an underestimate of
the actual costs of acquisition and rehabilitation since the assessed values are likely much lower
than the market value for these properties.

Rent Subsidy
Rent subsidies can also be used to preserve affordability of housing. Through a variety of funding
sources, the City could potentially provide rental vouchers similar to those provided through the
Housing Choice Vouchers Program (formerly Section 8). The amount of a rent subsidy would be
equal to the difference between the fair market for a unit and the cost that would be affordable to
a lower-income household. Table 4-56 shows the estimated rent subsidies required to preserve
the affordability of the at-risk units. Based on the assumptions shown in the table, it would cost
the City an estimated $981,912 annually to subsidize rent for these units, or nearly $29.5 million
over 30 years.

Replacement (New Construction)
Per square-foot construction costs from recent affordable housing projects were used to estimate
the cost of replacing the at-risk units if they were to convert to market-rate housing. As shown in
Table 4-57, the estimated cost to replace the 522 at-risk units is about $128.4 million.

Summary of At-Risk Analysis
In summary, the above analyses show the costs of the different scenarios to be as follows:
         Acquisition and rehabilitation: $45,302,741
         Rent Subsidy: $981,912 annually ($29,457,360 over 30 years)
         Replacement: $128,433,924
Regardless of the method, preserving affordability of the at-risk units is costly. While providing
rent subsidies appears to be the least costly method, Section 8 funding availability is limited and
currently (2015) there are more Federal and State funding sources to rehabilitate existing or build
new affordable housing units. Ultimately, it may cost the City less to assist in either the
rehabilitation or replacement of the units rather than directly subsidizing rent using City funds.
Qualified entities to acquire at-risk properties and maintain long-term affordability are non-profit
or for-profit organizations with affordable housing development and managerial capacity. The
following are organizations that can serve as qualified entities in San Joaquin County:

Energy Conservation Opportunities
State Housing Element Law requires an analysis of the opportunities for energy conservation in
residential development. Energy efficiency has direct application to affordable housing because
the more money spent on energy, the less available for rent or mortgage payments. High energy
costs have particularly detrimental effects on low-income households that do not have enough
income or cash reserves to absorb cost increases and many times must choose between basic
needs such as shelter, food, and energy.
Local Energy Programs
The City of Stockton provides a number of programs to encourage energy efficiency.
Page 4BR-96                              Background Report                   Adopted April 12, 2016

                                                                                            4. Housing
         Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Programs. The City of Stockton provides a
          variety of programs for property owners to finance infrastructure improvements for
          renewable energy technology purchase and installation, energy and water efficiency
          improvements, and electric vehicle charging.
         The Green-Up Stockton Ordinance. The Stockton City Council adopted the Green-Up
          Stockton Ordinance (Ordinance 005‐ 11 C.S.) in March 2011 to encourage voluntary
          residential energy efficiency assessments and retrofits for existing dwelling units. The goal
          of the ordinance is to provide energy retrofits to 8,500 homes, nearly 10 percent of
          Stockton’s housing stock, and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
          by 25 percent of the retrofitted dwelling units.
New Residential Energy Standards
All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24, Part 6, of the
California Code of Regulations (Building Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and
Nonresidential Buildings). These regulations respond to California's energy crisis and need to
reduce energy bills, increase energy delivery system reliability, and contribute to an improved
economic condition for the state. They were established in 1978 and most recently updated in
2013. Through the building permit process, local governments enforce energy efficiency
requirements. All new construction must comply with the standards in effect on the date a
building-permit application is made. The standards found in Title 24 create energy savings of
approximately 50 percent over residential construction practices used prior to the standards. The
City of Stockton’s Building Department enforces Title 24 standards through its building permit
process.
In addition to Title 24 requirements, the City’s housing rehabilitation programs includes
requirements for energy efficient products with ENERGY STAR® ratings, the use of recycled
materials, and the use of items developed from renewable resources.
Subdivision Design for Heating or Cooling Opportunities
Section 66473.1 of the State Subdivision Map Act requires that the "design of a subdivision for
which a tentative map is required shall provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive or natural
heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision." Although this section does not contain any
precise standards, the State Attorney General has opined that "a tentative map of a subdivision
must be disproved if it fails to meet the design requirement of Government Code Section
66473.1."
In accordance with the provisions of the California Subdivision Map Act, Section 16.72.240 of
Stockton’s Municipal Code states that the City may require a subdivider to “provide, to the extent
feasible, for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivisions, in
compliance with Map Act Section 66473.1, including orientation of a structure for southern exposure,
shade, or prevailing winds.”

Weatherization Activities
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides natural gas and electric services for the city of Stockton.
PG&E offer a variety of programs to increase energy conservation and reduce monthly energy
costs for lower-income households. The following programs, offered by PG&E, are aimed at
increasing energy efficiency, and are available to PG&E customers in Stockton:
         Energy Efficiency Rebates for Multifamily Properties. The Energy Efficiency Rebates for
          Multifamily Properties program is available to owners and managers of existing multi-
          family residential dwellings containing two or more units. The program encourages
          energy efficiency by providing rebates for the installation of certain energy-saving
          products such as high-efficiency appliances, compact fluorescent light bulbs, attic and
          wall insulation, and efficient heating and cooling systems.
         Energy Savings Assistance Program. The Energy Savings Assistance Program provides
          qualified low-income households energy-savings improvements at no charge. The energy-
          savings improvements will increase energy efficiency of a home to decrease energy bills.
San Joaquin County Human Services Agency offers a weatherization program. The program
provides energy saving measures and repairs to homes, apartments, and mobile
homes. Households that qualify for the program include: those receiving Temporary Aid for
Needy Families (TANF), Food Stamps, SSI or SSP, Veterans and Survivors Pension, or households
with incomes that do not exceed a certain limit determined by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services. Some of the energy savings measures available are glass replacement, sash
repair, ceiling insulation, minor home repair, low-flow showerheads, door weather stripping,
water heater blanket, duct wrap, switch and outlet gaskets, caulking, refrigerators, and microwave
ovens.
In addition to the local programs described above, the California Department of Community
Services and Development (CSD) administers the Federally-funded Low-Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This program provides two types of assistance: Weatherization
Program and Energy Crisis Intervention Program. The Weatherization Program provides free
weatherization improvement services to increase energy efficiency, such as attic insulation,
caulking, water heater blankets, and heating and cooling system repairs to low-income
households. The Energy Crisis Intervention Program provides payments for weather-related or
energy-related emergencies.
Finally, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) provides weatherization grants to homeowners
similar to those offered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Human Services. The Federal
funds for the weatherization program are provided through the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The Recovery Act
provided $5 billion nationally to the DOE, of which California was awarded $185.8 million.
California’s Community Services Department oversees the program and program funds and has
partnered with over 40 nonprofit and local government providers to deliver weatherization
services to low-income households around the state. San Joaquin County’s Department of Aging
and Community Services oversees the local weatherization program.

SECTION 5: POTENTIAL HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Major Findings
       Based on analysis of the permitted densities and development standards, the City has
        found that the General Plan and Development Code facilitate a variety of housing types.
        The City allows residential development in non-residential and mixed-use zones and
        permits densities as high as 87 units per acre in the downtown area.
       The City applies more flexible development standards for infill projects to encourage and
        maximize opportunities for development of vacant and underutilized land within city
        limits. The development standards of the underlying zoning designation, such as the
        density, setbacks, height, site coverage, and parking requirements may be modified to
        create consistency with surrounding development and address physical site constraints.
        Overall, the City’s parking standards are relatively low, both for downtown infill
        development and development outside the downtown. Parking standards do not
        represent a constraint to the development of housing and allow development to achieve
        maximum allowed densities.
       Processing and permit procedures do not constitute a development constraint in
        Stockton.
       The City’s Affordable Housing Density Bonus is consistent with State law. It allows for a
        density bonus of up to 35 percent, and also allows developers that are eligible for a
        density bonus to receive up to three additional incentives.
       The City is currently (October 2015) in the process of updating the Development Code to
        be consistent with State law regarding emergency shelters. The City proposes to allow
        emergency shelters by right, without discretionary review, in the PF, IL, and IG zone. The
        City expects to adopt the Development Code amendment prior to adopting the Housing
        Element.
       According to the San Joaquin Partnership’s Regional Development Fee Comparative
        Analysis Report (June 2013), the City of Stockton’s fees for a single family dwelling were
        the second highest of all the San Joaquin County jurisdictions, but were about average for
        all 21 jurisdictions included in the analysis.
Introduction
State housing law requires the City to review both governmental and non-governmental
constraints to the maintenance and production of housing for all income levels. Since local
governmental actions can restrict the development and increase the cost of housing, State law
requires the Housing Element to “address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing”
(Government Code Section 65583(c)(3)).

Stockton General Plan
Potential Governmental Constraints
Local governments have little or no influence on the national economy or the Federal monetary
policies that influence it. Yet these two factors have some of the most significant impacts on the
overall cost of housing. The local housing market, however, can be encouraged and assisted
locally. One purpose of the housing element is to require local governments to evaluate their past
performance in this regard. By reviewing local conditions and regulations that may impact the
housing market, the local government can prepare for future growth through actions that protect
the public’s health and safety without unduly adding to the cost of housing production.
Land Use Controls
By definition, local land use controls constrain housing development by restricting housing to
certain areas of the city and by restricting the number of housing units that can be built on a given
parcel of land. The 2035 General Plan sets forth the City’s policies regarding local land
development. These policies, together with zoning regulations, establish the amount and
distribution of land allocated for different uses.
General Plan Land Use Designations
The City of Stockton 2035 General Plan establishes land use designations for all land within the
city boundaries. These land use designations specify the type of development the City will permit.
The 2035 General Plan includes nine designations that permit a range of residential development
types and densities (see Table 4-58 below), including: Residential Estates, Low Density
Residential, Medium Density Residential, High Density Residential, Administrative Professional,
Commercial, Institutional, Parks and Recreation, Open Space and Agriculture, Mixed Use, and
Village. The General Plan allows flexibility by allowing residential uses in a variety of non-
residential designations. Table 4-58 shows the General Plan designations that permit residential
developments.
For the higher-density designations (HDR, AP, and C), maximum densities differ depending on
the location. Development in the downtown is allowed at densities up to 87 dwelling units per
acre (du/ac), while higher-density areas outside of the downtown have a maximum density of 29
dwelling units per acre.

      Village Concept
      The 2035 General Plan envisions Stockton as having a vital central district and inner city
      neighborhoods surrounded by new villages. General Plan Chapter 7, Villages and Districts,
      describes the village concept. The Village (V) designation is considered a “holding” category and
      applies to new development at the periphery of the city. Unlike other designations, a specific plan
      or master development plan is required to be submitted and approved before development can
      occur, to ensure a comprehensive mixed-use proposal is developed in the Village designated
      areas. Key features of a village include a mix of single family and multifamily development around
      a village center that includes commercial, school, public, and recreational uses, which result in a
      more efficient use of land. While a very low-density residential use is allowed by the designation,
      Adopted April 12, 2016                             Background Report                                        Page 4BR-101

Stockton General Plan
the Village designation requires a mix of housing types and densities, including medium and high
density residential development.
The specific plan or master plan for the villages must use the land use designations listed in Table
4-59. The table shows the average dwelling units per acre and the maximum nonresidential Floor-
to-Area Ratio (FAR) for each of the village land use designations and the corresponding zoning
designations.

Policy DV-5.4 of the General Plan relates to the housing mix within the villages. The policy states
that the City shall ensure a mix of residential types and densities within each village. The land
area within each village designated for residential uses will be distributed as follows:
        Village Residential Estates (VRE): minimum 5 percent
        Village Low Density Residential (VLDR): 72-78 percent
        Village Medium Density Residential (VMDR): 13-17 percent
        Village High Density Residential (VHDR): 4-6 percent
The General Plan designates 13 areas (i.e., A through M) as Villages. Most of these areas are
located adjacent to the existing city limits, however Village A (Sanctuary) and part of Village K
(Tidewater Crossing) were annexed in 2009.
Zoning
The City regulates the type, location, and scale of residential development primarily through its
Development Code (Title 16 of the Stockton Municipal Code). Table 4-61 lists and describes the
zoning districts that allow residential development. The Stockton Development Code explicitly
states the permitted maximum residential density for each zoning district, including residential
zones, commercial zones, and other zones. These density standards are consistent with the
standards in the General Plan.

Table 4-62 shows which land use permit is required for different types of housing in zones
allowing residential uses. If a housing type is allowable in a particular zone, the use is subject to
one of the following land use permit requirements:
       Permitted (P). All land uses shown with a “P” in the table are allowed subject to
        compliance with all applicable provisions of the Development Code. Site Plan Review is
        required for new construction or for a change to a more intensive use, except for those
        uses that are exempt.
       Land Development Permit (L). All land uses shown as "L" in the table that require
        construction of new structures or improvements, the expansion of an existing facility, or a
        change to a more intensive use, as determined by the director, require the approval of a
        Land Development Permit.
       Administrative Use Permit (A). All land uses shown with an “A” in the tables are allowed
        subject to the approval of an Administrative Use Permit. The director has the decision-
        making authority to approve an administrative use permit.
       Commission Use Permit (C). All land uses shown with a “C” in the tables are allowed
        subject to the approval of a Commission Use Permit. The Planning Commission has the
        decision-making authority to approve a Commission Use Permit.

Infill Development Standards
The City applies more flexible development standards for infill projects to encourage and
maximize opportunities for development of vacant or underutilized land within city limits. Section
16.52.030 of the Development Code contains the infill development standards. The development
standards of the underlying zoning designation, such as the density, setbacks, height, site
coverage, and parking requirements may be modified to create consistency with surrounding
development and address physical site constraints.
If an applicant wanted to obtain flexibility in development standards on an infill parcel, the
applicant would first visit the Permit Center to determine whether or not the project met the
following criteria:
       A. Vacant and developed property, with or without existing structures, of less than a total of
            five acres, which consist of:
                  a. One legal lot; or
                  b. Two or more contiguous, commonly-owned legal lots that are not separated by a
                        public street;

       B. Bounded on at least three sides by existing urban uses or development;
       C. Served by existing water, sewer, drainage, streets, and schools; and
       D. Qualify for categorical exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act, Section
             15332, CEQA, Class 32.
In addition to the land uses allowed in Table 4-64, infill projects consisting of the land uses shown
in the table are allowed in any zoning district subject to the permit requirements shown in Table
4-62.
The City offers a preliminary project review process (Economic Review Committee, or ERC) in
which developers are given the opportunity to meet with representatives from the City’s various
permitting departments (e.g., Community Development, Public Works, and Municipal Utilities) to
provide feedback on proposed site plans, as well as information on topics such as zoning, use
permits and public improvements in an effort to assist the developer in the permitting and
development process. The ERC preliminary project review process is provided free of charge by
the City.

Conclusions
Based on analysis of the permitted densities and development standards, the City has found that
the General Plan and Development Code facilitate production of a variety of housing types. The
City allows residential development in non-residential and mixed-use zones and permits densities
as high as 87 units per acre in the downtown area. Additionally, the City has flexible development
standards to encourage the development of small infill parcels.

2035 General Plan Settlement Agreement
In September 2008, the Stockton City Council approved a Memorandum of Agreement
(Settlement Agreement) with the Attorney General (AG) of California and the Sierra Club. The
Settlement Agreement calls for the General Plan and the City’s implementing actions to address
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a meaningful and constructive manner to the satisfaction of
the City, the AG’s office, and the Sierra Club. The Settlement Agreement promotes balanced
development, including adequate infill development, downtown revitalization, housing needs,
and public transportation. The Settlement Agreement also calls for development on the urban
fringe to be revenue neutral to the City as to infrastructure development and the provision of
services, and calls for incentives for infill development. Finally, the Settlement Agreement lays out
the following housing targets and goals through the planning horizon of the General Plan (i.e.
2035).
        Goal of developing 18,400 new infill units within current (as of 2008) City limits as
         follows:
                 4,400 units in the greater Downtown area (i.e., land generally bordered by
                  Harding Way, Charter Way (MLK), Pershing Avenue, and Wilson Way)
                         - 3,000 units by 2020
                         - 1,400 additional units by 2035
                 14,000 units outside the greater Downtown area within the City limits.
While the Housing Element includes some policies and programs to implement the Settlement
Agreement, more specific implementation programs will be developed as part of a larger, separate
process. The City is currently (2015) in the process of initiating a comprehensive General Plan
Update, which will provide the implementation framework for meeting the Settlement
Agreement. The General Plan will consider strategies to create additional residential unit capacity
in the Greater Downtown Area. Examples of how this could occur include adopting less restrictive
zoning in the Downtown and Greater Downtown, or expanding the Commercial Downtown (CD)
zoning district to allow higher densities in the Greater Downtown.
The Settlement Agreement also calls for the implementation of a Green Building Program
including:
        Build It Green or green building program of comparable effectiveness for residential
         development;
        LEED Silver (or equivalent standard) for non-residential development, in a phased
         approach;
        Review requirement to stay among top 25 percent of ordinances in State;
        Green Building retrofit with 50 percent remodel;
        Explore local assessment district to help fund retrofits; and
Adopted April 12, 2016                     Background Report                            Page 4BR-109

Stockton General Plan
         Explore retrofits for CEQA mitigation.
The Settlement Agreement will support the production of housing by encouraging significant infill
housing development in Downtown Stockton and within existing neighborhoods; however, the
mandate to implement a Green Building Program could potentially add to the upfront costs of
producing housing.
Building Codes and Enforcement
Building codes and their enforcement influence the style, quality, size, and costs of residential
development. Such codes can increase the cost of housing and impact the feasibility of
rehabilitating older properties that must be upgraded to current code standards. In this manner,
building codes and their enforcement can act as a constraint on the supply of housing and its
affordability.
The City of Stockton has adopted the 2013 California Building Code (CBC). The minimum
requirements of the CBC and other model codes may have added to the cost of housing over the
years. However, governmental agencies at all levels as well as organizations representing building
officials have decided that these requirements are necessary to achieve a minimum level of health
and safety.
The City’s building codes are consistent with the codes applied in other jurisdictions throughout
California and do not negatively impact the construction of affordable housing.
Parking Standards
Since off-street parking often requires large amounts of land, parking requirements are one of the
development standards that can impact the development of compact, affordable housing. Off-
street parking requirements increase the cost of development and limit the funds available for
providing housing. Additionally, parking standards limit the ability to achieve compact, urban,
infill development. Most municipalities adopt parking standards that exceed the actual parking
needs of the population.
Stockton’s off-street parking standards for residential uses are summarized in Table 4-65. The City
requires two covered parking spaces per single family home, one covered off-street space per
second unit, one space per multifamily unit in the downtown, and one and one-half parking
space per multifamily unit outside the downtown, and two spaces per unit in townhouses and
condominiums.
The Development Code allows the Director or Commission to approve reductions or waivers to
the number of required parking spaces by a variance. To obtain a variance, the project proponent
can demonstrate a reduced need for parking because automobile use or ownership is significantly
lower than for other types of dwellings.
Overall, the City’s parking standards are relatively low, both for downtown infill development and
development outside the downtown. Parking standards do not represent a constraint to the
development of housing and allow development to achieve maximum allowed densities.

On/Off Site Improvement Requirements
The City of Stockton requires certain on- and off-site improvements to enhance the safety and
livability of its residential neighborhoods. These improvements include, but are not limited to:
curb, gutter, sidewalk, streets, driveways, and medians. The sub-divider or developer is required
to install the improvements. Once installed, inspected, and accepted, the City is responsible for
maintenance of public streets. Maintenance of the curb, gutter, sidewalk, and driveway
improvements remain the responsibility of the adjacent property owner.
Some additional on-site improvements are required for planned residential developments and
multifamily developments. For example, private streets and landscaping within a planned
residential development must meet City standards. Planned residential developments must
adhere to specific landscaping and common open space requirements. Multifamily developments
are subject to minimum on-site open space and parking requirements, as well as off-site
improvements.
The cost of residential development can vary depending on the number of on-site and off-site
improvements (e.g., roadways, bridges, utility trunk lines, storm water pumps) already in place.
Theoretically “infill” or bypassed parcels surrounded by existing development should be less
expensive to develop. However some of this cost advantage may be offset by a higher sales price
for the land, or the existence of undersized utility lines requiring the expensive paralleling of
existing lines.
The City of Stockton has not established unreasonable off- and on-site improvement
requirements.

Stockton General Plan
Open Space and Park Requirements
Open space and park requirements can decrease the affordability of housing by increasing
developer fees and/or decreasing the amount of land available on a proposed site for constructing
units. All housing units constructed in the City must pay a parkland fee to fund the development
of neighborhood and community parks. As of October 2015, the fee was $2,798 per single-family
unit and $1,712 per multifamily unit.
There are a number of different ways to satisfy open space requirements. Larger developments
can include golf courses and/or lakes as part of their overall development, while smaller
developments may choose to landscape and enhance entryways and median strips. Recreation
areas with a pool and/or tennis courts can also be included.
For multifamily projects, the City requires 100 square feet of usable, common open space for
each dwelling unit. The City also requires a minimum 40 square feet of private open space (e.g.,
patios, balcony, and decks). The area provided for private open space may be applied to the
common open space requirement.
The park dedication requirement, the park improvement fees, and the open space requirements
do not represent excessive constraints on residential development.
Processing and Permit Procedures
Similar to other jurisdictions, the City has several procedures it requires developers to follow for
processing development entitlements and building permits. Although the permit approval process
must conform to the Permit Streamlining Act (Government Code Section 65920 (et seq.)), housing
proposed in the City is subject to one or more of the following review processes: environmental
review, zoning, subdivision review, and building permit approval.
Many of the City’s review procedures are handled at the staff level. For example, site plan and
design review, minor zone modifications, and variances are conducted by the Community
Development Director, except when the site plan is part of a larger project that requires Planning
Commission review.
A use permit is a permit issued by the City for land uses that, although allowed in a specific
zoning district, have the potential to adversely affect other land uses, transportation and parking,
or other facilities in the vicinity. The use permit contains conditions to eliminate, or minimize to
an acceptable level, any potentially adverse effects of the use. The City of Stockton currently has
three types of conditional permits: Land Development Permits, Administrative Use Permits, and
Commission Use Permits.
The review of projects for appropriate and efficient development and layout of a site is an integral
part of the development approval process. All land uses shown as “L” on Table 2-2 of the
Development Code (16.20.020 Allowable land uses and permit requirements) that require
construction of new structures or improvements, the expansion of an existing facility, or a change
to a more intensive use, as determined by the Director, require the approval of a Land
Development Permit. The Director is the review authority for a Land Development Permit;
Page 4BR-112                               Background Report                  Adopted April 12, 2016

however, the Director may defer action and refer the application directly to the Planning
Commission.
The Review Authority may approve the Land Development Permit, with or without conditions or
conditionally approve an application for an Administrative or Commission Use Permit if it finds all
of the following:
     1. The proposed land use activity is allowed within the subject zoning district with the
         approval of a Land Development Permit and complies with all other applicable provisions
         of the Development Code and the Municipal Code;
     2. The proposed land use activity would be consistent with the general land uses, objectives,
         policies, and programs of the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan, Precise Road
         Plan, or Master Development Plan;
     3. The subject site would be physically suitable for the type and density/intensity of use
         being proposed including the provision of services (e.g., sanitation and water), public
         access, and the absence of physical constraints (e.g., earth movement, flooding, etc.); and
         served by streets adequate in width and pavement type to carry the quantity and type of
         traffic generated by the proposed development.
     4. The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed use at the location
         proposed would not endanger, jeopardize, or otherwise constitute a hazard to the public
         convenience, health, interest, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in
         the neighborhood of the proposed use; and
     5. The proposed permit would be in compliance with the provisions of the California
         Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the City's CEQA Guidelines.
An Administrative Permit is required for uses that have the potential for a slight impact on existing
land uses surrounding a given site. The Community Development Director is the review authority
for an Administrative Use Permit and may defer action and refer the application directly to the
Planning Commission.
Permits for uses that have the potential for a significant impact on surrounding areas, either
because of the size of the project or the nature of the use, require a Commission Use Permit. The
Planning Commission serves as the review authority for Commission Use Permits.
The decision-making authority may approve or conditionally approve an application for an
Administrative or Commission Use Permit if it finds all of the following:
     1. The proposed use is allowed within the subject zoning district with the approval of a Use
         Permit and complies with all other applicable provisions of the Development Code and
         the Municipal Code;
     2. The proposed use would maintain or strengthen the integrity and character of the
         neighborhood and zoning district in which it is to be located;

         and programs of the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan or Master
         Development Plan;
     4. The subject site would be physically suitable for the type and density/intensity of use
         being proposed including the provision of services (e.g., sanitation and water), public

     5. The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed use at the location
         proposed and for the time period(s) identified, if applicable, would not endanger,
         jeopardize, or otherwise constitute a hazard to the public convenience, health, interest,
         safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the
         proposed use;
     6. The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed use would be
         compatible with the existing and future land uses on-site and in the vicinity of the subject
         property; and
     7. The proposed action would be in compliance with the provisions of the California
         Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the City's CEQA Guidelines.
Multifamily development in the RM and RH zones are approved by the Planning Director through
an Administrative Use Permit (AUP). The purpose of the AUP is to assess potential impacts on
surrounding areas (e.g., higher traffic generation and the corresponding air quality impacts) and
examine management issues for the development. The AUP process ensures that proposed
multifamily developments are quality developments that are compatible with surrounding
neighborhoods and uses. Effective November 2, 2015 the cost of applying for an AUP is $1,135
(in 2015). The Planning Director is the Review Authority for AUPs. It is not subject to a public
hearing unless an appeal is requested (in compliance with Chapter 16.100 (Appeals)). If no
environmental documentation is required, the time frame to review and approve the AUP is
approximately 6-8 weeks, assuming that it is not subject to an appeal. If environmental
documentation is needed (i.e., initial study or mitigated negative declaration), the process takes
approximately 8-12 weeks. The AUP process has not acted as a constraint to the production of
multifamily development in Stockton. The City has not denied any multifamily projects using the
AUP process. In addition, the City has never imposed any conditions on a multifamily project
using the AUP that made the project financially infeasible. The City processes AUPs quickly and
the City has not received any complaints from the development community regarding the AUP
process.
A significant amount of multifamily development in the City has been approved as part of Specific
Plans and Master Development Plans. For example, the approved Sanctuary Master Development
Plan includes over 1,000 multi-family units in its Master Development Plan (see Table A-1). The
City has facilitated development of new multifamily housing by including the approval of
multifamily development as part of the approval process for Specific Plans or Master
Development Plans. The City has an obligation to balance the competing objectives of providing
more multifamily housing units while ensuring that surrounding land uses are not unduly
impacted.

Design Review
The City has a design review process to encourage development that is compatible and
harmonious with the design and use of surrounding properties and with the City in general. The
following types of residential development are subject to the City’s design review process:
        New single family tract development in subdivision of five or more parcels;
        New single family infill projects located within special districts;
        Additions and exterior remodeling of single family dwellings located within special
         districts visible from public right-of-way;
        New multifamily developments containing two or more dwelling units;
        Additions and exterior remodeling of existing multifamily projects; and
        Accessory structures in special districts or as part of a multifamily project greater than 120
         square feet that are visible from the public-right-of-way.
In March 2004, the City Council adopted the Citywide Design Guidelines. The Design Guidelines
are used by City staff, the Planning Commission, and the Council as adopted criteria for the
review of development proposals. The residential chapter of the Design Guidelines is divided into
three sections: single family design standards for new tract development, single family residential
design guidelines for special districts, and multifamily residential design guidelines. As a non-
discretionary action, design review is not subject to the requirements of CEQA.
The City’s design review process is codified in Title 16 of the Stockton Municipal Code
(Development Code). The procedure to be followed depends on whether discretionary approval
is required from the Planning Commission or City Council (see Table 4-66). The process for
projects that do not require any type of discretionary approval is simple in that project
applications are only reviewed by City staff. Following submittal of building plans (including
elevations), Community Development Department staff reviews the plans for compliance with the
Design Guidelines and/or standards. In reviewing the design of the project, staff uses the Design
Guidelines contained in this manual as a reference and makes a recommendation. Staff meets on
Wednesdays to review all Design Plans submitted by noon of the preceding Friday. The applicant
is informed of any inconsistency with the guidelines and provided an opportunity to amend the
plans.
For projects that require a discretionary approval (e.g., Use Permit, rezoning), the applicant
submits elevations of the proposed project at the time the discretionary application is submitted.
The project is routed to the necessary City departments for review with the Community
Development Department reviewing the project for compliance with the land use and
development regulations contained in the Development Code and the overall design of the
project. In reviewing the design of the project, staff uses the Design Guidelines as a reference and
makes a recommendation. The project, including the elevations, is then considered by the
appropriate Review Authority as identified in the Development Code.

                                                                                        4. Housing
The decision of the review body may be appealed in compliance with the requirements of the
Development Code. The decision of the Community Development Director may be appealed to
the Planning Commission and the decision of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the
City Council.
Design Guidelines are imposed throughout the city with the objective of reducing the review
process and giving developers a clear set of guidelines to use when planning a project. No
additional constraints to the development of multifamily housing are created with the
implementation of these guidelines; on the contrary, the City believes the Design Guidelines
expedite the review process for projects, as clear standards to follow will require less discretionary
review.
Summary
Processing and permit procedures do not constitute a development constraint in Stockton..
Development Fees and Other Exactions
As shown in Table 4-67, the City collects various fees from developers to cover the costs of
processing permits and providing necessary services and infrastructure. Additional fees and/or
time may be necessary for required environmental reviews, depending on the location and nature
of a project. Certain residential projects that require General Plan amendments, Development
Code changes, or other planning-related functions require fees in addition to those listed in the
table.
Planning and Building permit fees and applicable impact fees vary from project to project. The
table below shows fees for a “typical” project in Stockton with updated 2015 rates. Single family
fees are based on a hypothetical 2,000 square foot, 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom, detached single
family house within city limits. Multifamily fees are based on a hypothetical 40-unit multifamily
development on two acres.
Estimated fees in Stockton are $54,806 for the hypothetical single family unit and $26,359 for the
hypothetical multifamily unit, including City fees as well as County fees and school district fees.
Based on an estimates of typical costs to develop housing, fees represent an estimated 17 to 20
percent of the total cost of a single family unit and 10 percent of the total cost of a multifamily
unit (see Table 4-73).
Other impact fees for agriculture and open space are charged by the gross acre and designed to
mitigate for the loss of productive land. The agricultural land mitigation fee, at $14,352 per gross
acre for single family units, and at $12,841 per gross acre for multiple family units, applies when
development converts “important farmland” to private urban uses. The San Joaquin Council of
Governments collects the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat and Open Space
Conservation Plan fee to mitigate the loss of important habitat and open space.

  In March 2013 the San Joaquin Partnership released the Regional Development Fee Comparative
  Analysis report, which analyzed fee schedules (effective July 2012) from various cities and
  counties in the San Joaquin Valley. The fees analyzed included permits, plan checks, public
  facility fees, infrastructure, and other agency fees. Of the San Joaquin County jurisdictions
  analyzed, Stockton’s fees for a single family dwelling unit were the second highest after Tracy, at
  $60,720. In comparison to the 21 jurisdictions across California that were analyzed in the report,
  Stockton’s single family housing development fees were only slightly above the average of
  $54,527. Based on a recent (2015) estimate from the City of Stockton website fee estimator the
  total fees for a single family unit are $54,806.

With regards to multifamily units, Stockton had the highest fees compared to all San Joaquin
County jurisdictions at $40,383. While the City’s development fees were higher than many
jurisdictions in the county, the development fees were about average in comparison to 21
jurisdictions statewide (the average was $39,571). Additionally, based on recent (2015) estimates
from the City of Stockton website fee estimator, the development fees are $26,359 per unit of

Density Bonus
State law (Government Code Section 65915) requires local governments to grant a density bonus
to developers that agree to provide a specific percentage of affordable housing or childcare
facilities for lower-income households as part of an approved development. The law was revised
in 2005 to allow for a density bonus of up to 35 percent (on a sliding scale), which was an
increase from the previous maximum density bonus of 25 percent. The magnitude of the
incentive depends on the total share of development that is designated affordable.
Adopted April 12, 2016                      Background Report                        Page 4BR-121
Stockton General Plan
State law also imposes statewide parking standards that a jurisdiction must grant upon request
from a developer of an affordable housing project that qualifies for a density bonus. The
developer may request these parking standards, shown in Table 4-68, even if they do not request
the density bonus. These numbers are the total number of parking spaces including guest parking
and handicapped parking.

Chapter 16.40 of Stockton’s Development Code describes the City’s density bonus provisions.
The City is in compliance with State law regarding density bonus provisions and incentives for
affordable housing.
State of California, Article 34
Article 34 of the State Constitution requires voter approval for specified “low rent” housing
projects that involve certain types of public agency participation. Generally, a project is subject to
Article 34 if more than 49 percent of its units will be rented to low-income persons. Not all low-
income housing is considered a “low rent” housing project. For example, if a project is owned
and operated by a non-profit corporation receiving only federal funding, Article 34 authority is
not required. If a project is subject to Article 34, it will require an approval from the local
electorate. This can pose a constraint to the production of affordable housing, since the process of
securing ballot approval for affordable housing projects can be costly and time consuming, with
no guarantee of success.
The City of Stockton has held two Article 34 elections, and voters approved the authorization of
up to 500 units per year for ten years in each election. The last election was held in 2010. At this
time, there are still many remaining units allowed under the last election. This Article 34
authorization will expire in 2020 and the City plans to request voter approval on a future ballot
for extension of the Article 34 authorization. The City does not foresee any issues with gaining
voter approval. However, since Article 34 requires voter approval, it is a potential constraint to
the production of affordable housing.

                                                                                          4. Housing
Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Second Units
A second dwelling unit is an additional self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached
from the primary residential unit on a single lot. It has cooking, eating, sleeping, and full sanitation
facilities. Second dwelling units can be an important source of affordable housing since they can
be constructed relatively cheaply and have no associated land costs. Second dwelling units can
also provide supplemental income to the homeowner, allowing seniors to remain in their homes,
or moderate-income families to afford houses.
To encourage establishment of second dwelling units on existing developed lots, State law
requires cities and counties to either adopt an ordinance based on standards set out in the law
authorizing creation of second dwelling units in residentially-zoned areas, or where no ordinance
has been adopted, to allow second dwelling units on lots zoned for single family or multifamily
use that contain an existing single family unit subject to ministerial approval (“by right”) if they
meet standards set out by law. Local governments are precluded from totally prohibiting second
dwelling units in residentially-zoned areas unless they make specific findings (Government Code,
Section 65852.2).
The City of Stockton meets State requirements for second units. The City of Stockton allows
second dwelling units in all residential zoning districts with approval by the Community
Development Director as long as the unit meets all development standards. The Development
Code requires that the floor area of second units not exceed 30 percent of the living area of the
main dwelling for an attached unit, or 1,200 square feet of floor area for a detached unit. The
same residential development standards, including setbacks, height limits, and maximum lot
coverage apply to second units.
Manufactured Homes and Mobile Home Parks
Sections 65852.3 and 65852.4 of the California Government Code specify that a jurisdiction shall
allow the installation of manufactured homes on a foundation on all “lots zoned for conventional
single family residential dwellings.” Except for architectural requirements, the jurisdiction is only
allowed to “subject the manufactured home and the lot on which it is placed to the same
development standards to which a conventional single family residential dwelling on the same lot
would be subject.” The architectural requirements are limited to roof overhang, roofing material,
and siding material.
The only two exceptions that local jurisdictions are allowed to make to the manufactured home
siting provisions are if: 1) there is more than 10 years difference between the date of manufacture
of the manufactured home and the date of the application for the issuance of an installation
permit; or 2) if the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and regulated by a
legislative body pursuant to Government Code Section 37361.
Section 69852.7 of the California Government Code specifies that mobile home parks shall be a
permitted use on “all land planned and zoned for residential land use.” However, local
jurisdictions are allowed to require use permits for mobile home parks. The City of Stockton’s
Development Code defines mobile homes as a single family dwelling consistent with State law.
Additionally, mobile home parks are allowed in the Residential Low-Density (RL), Residential

Stockton General Plan
Medium-Density (RM), Residential High-Density (RH), General Commercial (CG), and
Commercial Downtown (CD) districts with an Administrative Use Permit.
Section 16.80.210 of Stockton’s Development Code provides specific development standards for
mobile home parks, including a minimum gross area of five acres and a minimum of 50 mobile
home spaces. The Development Code also describes the following locational criteria for mobile
home parks:
         1. Located in areas that are logically suited for multifamily development, such as
             transition areas between major traffic arterials, commercial or industrial development,
             and low-density residential development;
         2. Access to the mobile home park shall be directly to a major arterial street or within
             500 feet of freeway access ramps;
         3. Mobile home parks shall not be located where it is necessary for traffic movement
             from the park to pass through an existing or proposed residential development;
         4. Mobile home parks shall not be permitted at locations that would disrupt the logical
             expansion of conventional subdivisions or extension of street systems, utilities, or
             public improvements;
         5. Mobile home parks shall not be permitted at locations so far removed from existing
             utilities or community services, including fire or police protection, and schools so as
             to place a financial burden on the City for provision and maintenance of these
             facilities.
Stockton’s Municipal Code conforms to Government Code Section 69852.7.
Group Homes
State Law requires group residential facilities of six or few persons to be considered a single family
dwelling for the purpose of any law or zoning ordinance related to residential property use (CA
Health and Safety Code Section 1267.8). Currently (2015) licensed care homes consisting of six or
fewer individuals are allowed by right in the RL, RM, RH, CD, and PF zones. However these are
not all the zones that allow single family development – the RE zone also allows single family
dwellings by right. The Housing Element includes a program to amend the Development Code to
allow group homes for six persons or fewer in the RE zone.
Family care homes with more than six individuals require the approval of a Commission Use
Permit in the RE, RH, and CD zones, and a land development permit in the PF zone. The Use
Permit process typically takes six to eight weeks to get to a Planning Commission public hearing.
An appeal of the Planning Commission’s decision (filed within 10 days of their decision) would
typically take four to six weeks to get to a City Council public hearing. The Commission Use
Permit process is the only restriction to family care homes with more than six individuals. Group
homes in single family or two family structures are exempt from Title 24 requirements. The
Commission Use Permit has not been used to deny a family care home of seven or more
individuals in Stockton.

Housing for Farmworkers
California Health and Safety Code Section 17020 (et seq.) contains provisions relating to
employee housing and farm worker housing. Regarding employee housing, Health and Safety
Code Section 17021.5(b) states:
         “Any employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be
         deemed a single family structure with a residential land use designation for the purposes
         of this section. For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee housing shall not be
         included within the definition of a boarding house, rooming house, hotel, dormitory, or
         other similar term that implies that the employee housing is a business run for profit or
         differs in any other way from a family dwelling. No conditional use permit, zoning
         variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of employee housing that serves six
         or fewer employees that is not required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same
         zone. Use of a family dwelling for purposes of employee housing serving six or fewer
         persons shall not constitute a change of occupancy...”
Health and Safety Code Section 17021.6 also states:
         “Any employee housing consisting of no more than 36 beds in a group quarters or 12
         units or spaces designed for use by a single family or household shall be deemed an
         agricultural land use.... For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee housing shall
         not be deemed a use that implies that the employee housing is an activity that differs in
         any other way from an agricultural use. No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or
         other zoning clearance shall be required of this employee housing that is not required of
         any other agricultural activity in the same zone. The permitted occupancy in employee
         housing in a zone allowing agricultural uses shall include agricultural employees who do
         not work on the property where the employee housing is located.”
Stockton’s Municipal Code does not prohibit or constrain the provision of farm labor housing.
Employee housing for six or fewer is treated the same as any other single family home. Farm labor
housing is considered an agricultural activity and is permitted by right in all zones allowing
agricultural uses, which complies with State law.
Emergency Shelters
SB 2, passed in 2007 and in effect as of January 1, 2008, amended State Housing Element law
(California Government Code Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5) regarding shelter for
homeless persons. This legislation requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for
addressing the housing needs of homeless persons, including the identification of a zone or zones
where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit.
California Health and Safety Code Section 50801(e) defines “emergency shelters” as:
         “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to
         occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may
         be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
Adopted April 12, 2016                    Background Report                             Page 4BR-125

Stockton General Plan
The new legislation added provisions to State Housing Element Law (Section 65583(a)(4)(A)) that
require local governments to identify:
         “a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a
         conditional use or other discretionary permit. The identified zone or zones shall include
         sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelter identified in
         paragraph (7), except that each local government shall identify a zone or zones that can
         accommodate at least one year-round emergency shelter. If the local government cannot
         identify a zone or zones with sufficient capacity, the local government shall include a
         program to amend its zoning ordinance to meet the requirements of this paragraph within
         one year of the adoption of the housing element. The local government may identify
         additional zones where emergency shelters are permitted with a conditional use permit.
         The local government shall also demonstrate that existing or proposed permit processing,
         development, and management standards are objective and encourage and facilitate the
         development of, or conversion to, emergency shelters.”
The provisions go on to discuss that emergency shelters “may only be subject to those
development and management standards that apply to residential or commercial development
within the same zone” along with a list of exceptions that may be made. Local governments that
already have one or more emergency shelters within their jurisdiction or “pursuant to a
multijurisdictional agreement” that accommodates that jurisdiction’s need for emergency shelter
is only required to identify a zone or zones where new emergency shelters are allowed with a
conditional use permit.
The City of Stockton’s Development Code defines homeless shelters as:
         “A public or private building which provides immediate, short-term shelter that may
         involve supplemental services for more than six homeless individuals or family members
         without compensation.”
Emergency shelters are allowed in the Residential High-Density, Commercial Office, Commercial
General, Commercial Downtown, and Industrial Limited districts with a Commission Use Permit,
and in the Public Facilities district with an Administrative Use Permit. The Development Code
does not place any further restrictions or requirements. The City’s Development Code is
inconsistent with State law since it does not identify a zone in which emergency shelters are
allowed “by right”, without a conditional use permit. However, the City is currently (November
2015) proposing amendments to the Development Code to be in compliance with State law.
These amendments are expected to occur prior to the adoption of this Housing Element.
To comply with State law, the City proposes to allow emergency shelters “by right” (i.e., without a
commission use permit or other discretionary approval) in the Industrial Limited (IL), Industrial
General (IG), and Public Facilities (PF) districts. Emergency shelters are currently (2015) allowed in
all three zones with use permits. While the IL and IG zones allow industrial uses, the zones are
reserved for operations that are totally conducted indoors. The PF zone allows numerous other
residential uses including single family homes and multifamily units, and is therefore suitable for
emergency shelters. There are an estimated 1,176 acres of vacant land on 447 parcels within
Stockton city limits zoned IL, IG, or PF (as of 2015). About 13 acres of this land is within the
Greater Downtown area, where there is convenient access to social services and public

transportation. This vacant land is made up of a variety of parcel sizes. Parcel sizes generally break
down as follows:
        Less than 0.5 acres: 212 parcels
        0.5-1 acre: 49 parcels
        1-5 acres: 129 parcels
        5-20 acres: 48 parcels
        Larger than 20 acres: 9 parcels
Transitional Housing
While SB2 added specific new requirements for local governments to meet in terms of planning
for emergency shelter facilities, Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) also states that
“transitional housing and supportive housing shall be considered a residential use of property, and
shall be subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type
in the same zone.” State law requires cities and counties to allow transitional and supportive
housing in all zones that allow residential uses.
Transitional housing is designed to assist homeless individuals and families in moving beyond
emergency shelter to permanent housing. California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2(h)
defines “transitional housing” and “transitional housing development” as:
         “buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
         program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation
         of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
         future point in time, which shall be no less than six months.”
The City of Stockton’s Development Code allows transitional housing in the Residential High-
Density, Commercial Office, Commercial General, Commercial Downtown, and Industrial
Limited districts with a Commission Use Permit, and in the Public Facilities district with an
Administrative Use Permit. The code also requires that transitional housing facilities are not
located within 500 feet of another transitional housing facility. Because State law requires the City
to consider transitional housing as a residential use allowed in all zones that allow residential uses
and only subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
same zone, the City is not in compliance with State law. However, the City is updating its
Development Code to comply with State law. These amendments are expected occur prior to the
adoption of this Housing Element.
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing is permanent rental housing linked to a range of support services designed to
enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead fuller lives. Typically, a portion of the
housing is targeted to people who have risk factors such as homelessness, or health challenges
such as mental illness or substance addiction. Supportive housing comes in all shapes and sizes. It

multifamily development where tenants with disabilities live alongside other families with low
incomes; a small, more service-intensive building; or scattered-site apartments. Whatever the
configuration, all of the housing allows tenants to access support services that enable them to live
as independently as possible.
California Health and Safety Code Section 65582(f) defines “supportive housing” as:
          “housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and
          that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the tenant to retain the housing,
          improve his or her health status, maximize their ability to live and, when possible, to work
          in the community.”
State law (Government Code Section 65583) requires cities and counties to consider supportive
housing as a residential use allowed in all zones that allow residential uses and only subject to
those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The City’s
Development Code does not include a definition for supportive housing, nor does it allow it in all
zones allowing residential uses. Therefore, the City is not in compliance; however, it is currently
updating its Development Code to comply with State law. These amendments are expected occur
prior to the adoption of this Housing Element.
Single-Room Occupancy Units
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units can provide affordable housing for lower-income
individuals, seniors, and persons with disabilities, and can serve as an entry point into the housing
market for formerly homeless people. An SRO unit is usually small, between 200 to 350 square
feet.
SROs are a source of affordable housing in the city. As the city of Stockton has aged, downtown
hotels serving overnight visitors became residential hotels, or SROs, renting rooms by the day,
week, or month to very low-income individuals or couples. According to the City of Stockton, as
of November 2015, there were four residential hotels operating in the downtown central business
district of Stockton.
There are a number of residential hotels that are currently vacant due to habitability, housing, and
other code violations. It is unlikely that these hotels will be reopened and operated as hotels. The
City has acquired some of these hotels to create additional parking that is needed in downtown
Stockton to create an environment conducive to commercial and retail businesses and
development. The City performs annual inspections of the remaining residential hotels to make
sure that these hotels meet minimum health and safety standards.
The Stockton Development Code defines Single Room Occupancy Facilities (SRO) as “a housing
type consisting of one room, often with cooking facilities and with private or shared bathroom
facilities.” The City allows SROs in CG (Commercial General) and CD (Commercial Downtown)
zones with an Administrative Use Permit.

Housing for Persons with Special Needs
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State housing element law requires jurisdictions to analyze potential and actual constraints upon
the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities and
demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the locality from
meeting the need for housing for persons with disabilities. In accordance with SB 520 (Chapter
671, Statutes of 2001), the City has analyzed the potential and actual governmental constraints on
the development of housing for persons with disabilities.
Accessibility
The City does not provide any undue or additional constraints to the development, maintenance,
and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. The City of Stockton uses Title 24
building laws in its development of zoning, permitting processes, and building codes for disabled
housing with no additional building codes adopted. The City makes every effort to ensure
accessibility for persons with disabilities. The City is stringent in its application of Title 24
guidelines and requires all new development to meet the requirements of the law. No additional
requirements for parking are required other than those for the zone in which the housing is being
developed, and special concessions can be given to lower the parking requirements for special
needs housing.
The Building and Housing Board of Appeals deals with disputes that may arise with special needs
housing. Where issues do arise, citizens, contractors, and others can seek assistance from the
City's Building and Housing Board of Appeals. Although the Building and Housing Board of
Appeals cannot waive Title 24 requirements, the Board can make findings on the use of
alternative methods and/or materials to accommodate disabled access. As of October 2015, the
application fee required for filing with the Building Board of Appeals is $373.
The City of Stockton process to retrofit homes for accessibility follows Title 24 guidelines. Retrofits
of properties with one to two dwelling units are exempt from applying for a building permit, while
retrofits of properties over three units do require a building permit pursuant to Title 24.
The City of Stockton Building Division enforces Chapter 11 of the California Building Code, Title
24. The Code provides a mandate that 100 percent of ground floor (one story) dwelling units in
buildings consisting of three or more dwelling units be accessible by adaptability. Adaptability
includes such features as wheelchair clearances in bathrooms, hallways and kitchen areas,
adjustable lowered countertops, site access, backing for grab bars in shower/bath areas etc. The
disabled tenant, or tenant’s representative, at time of occupancy, can request of the property
owner that the adaptable provisions be converted to full accessibility. Building permit fees
associated with the Title 24 improvements would be the only fees the City would impose as part
of this process.
Reasonable Accommodation
City procedures allow for the disabled persons or his/her authorized representative, with the
consent of the property owner, to make a request for reasonable accommodation. There are no
fees associated with this request beyond normal permit fees, if required, for the actual

improvements. The City does not have a codified process for requesting reasonable
accommodation. Flexibility is allowed on a case-by-case basis to facilitate retrofitting to meet
accessibility requirements. For example, in instances where an individual has requested an
encroachment for a handicap ramp leading to a house, that encroachment has been granted. The
City is currently (October 2015) amending its Municipal Code to include a formal, codified
procedure for reasonable accommodation requests. The amendment is expected to occur prior to
the adoption of this Housing Element.
Potential Non-Governmental Constraints
The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market forces over which local
governments have little or no control. Nonetheless, State law requires that the Housing Element
contain a general assessment of these constraints, which can serve as the basis for actions to offset
their effects. The primary non-governmental constraints to the development of new housing in
Stockton are the availability of financing and development costs.
Availability of Financing
The mortgage banking crisis that began in 2008 affected the availability of construction financing
and mortgage loans. Lenders that had once offered mortgage loans more freely became much
more restrictive after 2008. Lenders required down payments of 20 percent and credit scores
higher than 680 to receive competitive interest rates. These restrictions placed homeownership
out of reach for many, although in 2013 lenders began to ease the qualifications required for a
competitive mortgage rate. As the economy continues its recovery, lenders may continue to make
mortgage loans more accessible, although they may never be as easy to obtain as they were prior
to 2008.
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher interest
rates increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of housing that a
household can afford. Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and lower monthly payments for
the homebuyer.
As shown in Figure 4-8, mortgage rates have continued to decrease nationwide since 2007,
hitting a historic low in 2013. When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by
decreasing housing prices. Similarly, when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise.
There is often a lag in the market, causing housing prices to remain high when interest rates rise
until the market catches up. Lower-income households often find it most difficult to purchase a
home during this time period.

Development Costs
Land Costs
Costs associated with the acquisition of land include both the market price of raw land and the
cost of holding the property throughout the development process. Land acquisition costs can
account for over half of the final sales price of new homes in small developments and in areas
where land is scarce.
The main determinant of land value is market demand. Builders will pay a premium for
residential land in a strong market when expected buyers are plentiful. Raw residential land sold
for well over $100,000 per acre with no site improvements during the market upswings of the
early 2000s in Stockton. During the market recession of the late 2000s, the value of land declined
as home building continued to slow.
The market is improving and land values are beginning to rise as a result. Based on a recent
(October 2015) survey of Stockton, the average price per acre was $202,286. The survey was
based on 49 residential sites listed on Realtor.com, an online real estate database. The median lot
size was 0.26 acres. There was a wide variety of locations for the land listed from infill sites,
established suburbs, and a few greenfields on the outskirts of the city.

Stockton General Plan
Site Improvement Costs
Upon securing the raw land, a residential developer must make certain site improvements to
“finish” the lot before a home can actually be built on the property. Such improvements include
rough grading, connections to existing utility and wastewater systems, construction of streets,
installation of water and sewer lines, and construction of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. Some
regulatory costs, such as agricultural mitigation and habitat conservation mitigation, factor into
finished lot costs because they are designed to mitigate for the acre(s) of land lost to development.
Site improvement costs for a single family home at six dwelling units per acre were estimated as
ranging between $45,000 and $85,000 per lot depending on size and location. Site improvement
costs for a recent multifamily development, including costs associated with a retention basin, road
improvements, utility connections, local development impact fees, phase 1, environmental impact
report, general contractor contract, survey and engineering costs, totaled about $4.6 million, or
$32,857 per unit.
Construction Costs
Housing construction costs can act as a constraint to the affordability of new housing. However,
the cost of construction varies with the type, size, location, and amenities of the development.
“Entry-level” homes have far fewer amenities than other higher-priced custom homes. According
to Building-Cost.net, a website that calculates building costs, on average an entry-level, 2,000
square foot home (1,500 SF of living space, 500 SF garage) costs $150,800 to build, or $75.40
per square foot. The increased use of prefabricated factory-built or manufactured housing, which
is permitted in all residential districts throughout the city (consistent with California State law),
may provide for lower-priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs.
According to RS Means, a supplier of construction cost information, the cost of constructing a
multifamily development in the city of Stockton is $141.24 per square foot based on a one to
three story complex with a wood frame, brick veneer, and open shop labor. A 1,200 square foot
unit would cost an estimated $169,488 to build.
Although the economy is recovering, builders are still reluctant to start new construction projects
because the market is extremely over-built, financing is difficult to secure, and interest rates are
on the rise. There is little that the City can do to mitigate the impacts of high construction costs
except by avoiding local amendments to uniform building codes that unnecessarily increase
construction costs without significantly adding to health, safety, or construction quality. Because
construction costs are similar in the City to those in other Central Valley areas, the cost of
construction alone is not considered a major constraint to housing production.
Total Housing Development Costs
As shown in Table 4-69, the total estimated development costs discussed above for a typical
entry-level single family home (2,000 square feet) is $273,825-$313,825, including site
improvements, construction costs, fees and permits (as shown in Table 4-67). Additionally as
shown in Table 4-69, a unit in a multifamily development is estimated to cost $246,042.

SECTION 6: EVALUATION
The following section reviews and evaluates the City’s progress in implementing the 2009-2014 Housing
Element. This section analyzes and effectiveness of policies and programs for the previous Housing
Element planning period. This section also contains recommendations for program changes to address
housing needs for the 2015-2023 planning period.
During the 2009 Housing Element planning period, the City’s resources were devastated by the financial
crisis. Hundreds of City employees were laid off, department budgets were cut, and City services were
reduced. Stockton became the largest City in the U.S. to declare bankruptcy. On top of the City’s
financial struggles, the State of California action to abolish redevelopment agencies eliminated the City’s
main source of funding for affordable housing.
As might be expected, the City was not able to implement many of the programs it hoped to accomplish
during the 2009-2014 planning period, and given the reduced staff and financial resources available
during the 2015-2023 planning period, this evaluation focuses on maintaining the programs that will be
most effective to meeting housing needs.

 Workshops to focus on affordable units
 STOCKTON — Nearly two years after then­Community Development Director Steve Chase said Stockton had a “broken housing element” that was failing to
 meet the needs of the city’s residents, work is ramping up to prepare a new, state­mandated document charting the city’s future residential development plans
 ahead of a year­end deadline.
 Stockton officials say that while the document is required to detail the future housing­development needs for people of all income levels, the city’s focus is on
 those statistically classified as having low, very low and extremely low incomes.
 Two housing­element workshops will be held by the city today at the downtown Cesar Chavez Main Library. The first will focus primarily on developers and
 social­service organizations, as the city seeks to learn how to spur building and how to better serve the needs of low­income residents. The second workshop
 will be an opportunity for residents to share their views.
 “The  challenge  here  is  not  necessarily  with  moderate  and  above  (income  earners),”  city  Planning  Manager  Mike  McDowell  said.  “The  market  dictates  that
 housing market. It’s low and very low that presents a challenge, to provide something affordable so people can live in and make a home here in Stockton.”
 The new Housing Element document is to be in effect until 2023. According to projections developed by the state and by the San Joaquin County Council of
 Governments, Stockton’s new document must address the need for 11,824 new housing units for people of all income levels — 5,161 of those for households
 classified as low, very low and extremely low. A household is considered low income if its income is less than 50 percent of the county’s median household
 income of $53,764.
 “Anytime we’re talking about housing elements, we’re going to definitely push for the city to work for housing for low, very low and extremely low income
 residents,” Jon Mendelson of Central Valley Low Income Housing said. “There’s a serious lack of that in the area and a serious lack of planning for that. In
 general, we feel affordable housing is talked about during these plans but the implementation tends to be overlooked.”
 Like Mendelson, Fred Sheil of STAND Affordable Housing said he will attend the Monday workshops, and he, too, sounded a note of skepticism based on
 history.
 “The housing element is an exercise, it’s a ‘we­should' document,” Sheil said. “There’s nothing that says, ‘We have to.’ It’s a wish list that has been promptly
 ignored.”
 Infill development — building in vacant spaces downtown and in Stockton’s older neighborhoods — is expected to receive significant attention in the city’s new
 Housing Element document.
 The current document says that as of six years ago, there were nearly 8,000 “vacant and underutilized sites” in Stockton. Of those, 6,188 were classified as
 “lower­income” sites — 1,560 of them downtown, 220 in greater downtown and 4,408 in the rest of the city. Updated numbers were not available Friday from
 the city.
 The task facing Stockton is to make sure developing these sites is not a losing financial proposition for builders, because if it is, they will not come.
 McDowell said the city will be seeking ideas Monday for meeting the needs of low­income residents not only by trying to clear the way for building but by
 locating new housing in transportation­friendly areas. He said the city hopes to hear from advocates about the needs of the elderly, veterans, farm workers and
 people with special needs.
 Developers  and  low­income  advocates  such  as  Mendelson  and  Sheil  say  the  city  must  provide  incentives,  subsidies  and  reductions  in  construction  fees  if
 projects are to be built.
 “In order to sell anything deemed affordable by legal standards you have to sell at a loss or have somebody else pay part of the construction costs,” John
 Beckman of the Building Industry Association said.
 Beckman suggested a good place to start would be for the city to slash builder fees for vacant lots next to homes that are 80 years old or older to $10,000 — an
 80 percent reduction. But Beckman said some projects would not pencil out even if fees were completely eliminated.
 Mendelson said measures the city could take include requiring new developments to reserve a portion of their projects for low­income residents; charging a fee
 to developers on the outer edges of Stockton that would be set aside to subsidize infill development; and offering “aggressive” bonuses to builders who develop
 high­density projects in infill areas.
 Still, Mendelson added, progress in providing housing for low­income residents will come not from the new Housing Element document itself, but from long­
 term follow­through.
 “You need a solid plan,” he said. “But what really matters is how that plan is used in the real world, whether there are going to be policies that actually direct
 resources to making affordable­housing projects a reality.”

Stockton Planning Commission
425 N. El Dorado Street, 2nd Floor
Stockton, CA 95202
RE: Draft Housing Element
Chair and members of the Stockton Planning Commission:
We have reviewed the Draft Housing Element and have the following comments.
The Draft Housing Element incorporates most of the previous policies and programs of the 2010
Housing Element. Most of these policies are fine and are of a “motherhood and apple pie”
nature. The policies are lofty and well-meaning (and largely required by State HCD mandate or
recommendation).
However, there is one glaring omission that must be rectified: adoption of an inclusionary
housing ordinance.
More than one-quarter of the jurisdictions up and down the State of California have adopted such
programs to ensure that market rate housing projects contribute their fair share of affordable
units. In fact, in many cities and counties more affordable housing is created through
inclusionary housing requirements than through any other programs, especially now that
redevelopment has been killed by the Governor.
We don’t have the time to provide background studies and examples of local inclusionary
housing ordinances, or to make a more complete argument why the lack of affordable housing is
quickly becoming a crisis in Stockton and other California cities. Please request that staff
provide such documentation to the commission before you vote to send this Draft Housing
Element on to the City Council for final approval.
We strongly urge that the Planning Commission direct staff to add a new policy supporting the
adoption of an inclusionary housing program along the lines of the text below:
                                                  1

                                                                                     Attachment B
HE-3.8 Inclusionary Housing
The City shall adopt an Inclusionary Housing program prior to December 31, 2016 that requires
new development of 20 housing units or more to provide at least 15 percent affordable housing
units within the project, or to pay an “in lieu fee” that would be used by the City or nonprofit
developers to construct affordable units.
Currently, there is no discussion in the Draft Housing Element of inclusionary housing. The only
reference is on page 148 of the background report, which notes the status of a program in the
previous 2010 Housing Element:
         “Inclusionary Housing Program. The City shall conduct a study to investigate the
         feasibility of an Inclusionary Housing Program. The study shall include an analysis of
         some of the potential requirements, such as the appropriate percentage of affordable
         units, income eligibility criteria, methods by which developers could meet the
         requirements, appropriate resale restrictions on ownership units, and time frame for
         affordability of units.
         The City studied a possible inclusionary housing program as part of Phase II of the
         Affordable Housing Strategy, however, given market conditions in the city, an
         inclusionary housing program was not implemented.”
It is time to revisit this issue.
We are watching the City’s progress (or lack thereof) on the update of the entire General Plan to
comply with the Settlement Agreement with the Attorney General’s Office and the Sierra Club.
Although the Settlement Agreement did not explicitly refer to affordable housing, a key
ingredient of any successful General Plan is to recognize the huge importance of providing
affordable housing for a city’s residents.
We cannot sit back and just hope that developers will provide for this type of housing, since we
all know that 90% of the housing built in Stockton over the past few decades has been in cookie-
cutter, single-family, market-rate subdivisions at the periphery of the city. The City must institute
a new form of smart growth in the updated General Plan that includes one of the most crucial
tools for providing homes for working families: inclusionary housing requirements.

Re: Draft Housing Element
Central Valley Low Income Housing Corp. is a nonprofit that provides housing assistance to
homeless families and individuals throughout San Joaquin County, and especially in Stockton.
After reviewing the Housing Element draft before you this week, it is our opinion that several
improvements should be suggested by the Planning Commission to create a Housing Element
that better addresses the need for housing within the City of Stockton. Those include:
• Adoption of an Inclusionary Housing policy.
  Proposed language (to add as a section to HE-3): The City of Stockton shall adopt an
  Inclusionary Housing policy prior to 2018 that requires new developments within the city of 20
  units or more to provide at least 15 percent of the units in that development at a rate considered
  “affordable” to “low-income households,” both as defined by the federal Department of
  Housing and Urban Development. Projects that do not set aside the required number of
  “affordable” units shall pay an in-lieu fee that shall be used by the City or nonprofit developers
  to construct affordable units within the City of Stockton. Only for-sale units are subject to this
  Inclusionary Housing policy.
  Reason for language: This policy would help address the neglected issue of affordable housing
  within Stockton. Residents of all income levels — but especially those with low-, very low-,
  and extremely low-incomes — are being squeezed by a lack of affordable housing within
  Stockton, as local development of the past 30 years has focused almost exclusively on market-
  rate, single-family housing. The market has failed to meet this pressing need in Stockton, and
  so an Inclusionary Housing policy is appropriate to address this need.
• Adoption of language supporting development of multi-family housing.
  Proposed language (to add to HE-2.3): The City of Stockton shall encourage the development
  of multi-family housing within the city, and will adopt specific policies to achieve this goal.
  Reason for language: This general policy would help address the lack of multi-family
  development in Stockton. The focus of development in Stockton’s recent past has been on
  single-family housing, while relatively few multi-family housing units have been created. This
  has caused a massive imbalance in the city’s housing stock, as many residents cannot afford
  single-family housing either as purchaser or renter. As with affordable housing, the market has
  failed to meet this pressing need in Stockton, so a multi-family housing policy is appropriate to
  address this need.
Our organization urges you to direct staff to add these policies to the Housing Element the
Planning Commission will recommend for the City Council’s approval. Thank you sincerely for
your consideration of these important issues.

RE: Draft Housing Element
Chair and Members of the Stockton Planning Commission:
I am writing to ask the Commission to add the adoption of an inclusionary housing ordinance to
the Draft Housing Element you sent out for review.
When the City of Stockton was reviewing its Housing Element five years ago (as mandated by
state law), I was chair of the Campaign for Common Ground’s Housing Committee. While I am
not writing as a representative of CCG, I mention this because that experience informed me as an
individual concerned citizen about housing issues in Stockton. The one thing that was
immediately clear is that the City conscientiously includes the need for affordable housing in its
plans – and such housing is not built. I understand that the City is not a builder or developer but
is determining needs and the availability of land to meet those needs. However, this approach
has not been successful in getting these needs met.
The other tool that the City has at its disposal is the creation of policies. Since merely pointing
out the need for housing for low income/extremely low income families has not spurred the
building of housing for this part of our community, the City needs to take the next step and
create a policy that goes beyond an observational wish list and adopt an inclusionary housing
ordinance in your Housing Element.
Many other cities in California have adopted such programs to ensure that market rate housing
projects contribute their fair share of affordable units. In fact, in many cities and counties more
affordable housing is created through inclusionary housing requirements than any other
programs, especially now that redevelopment funding is no longer an option.
The City needs to go beyond the 2010 Housing Element that stated that the City “shall [emphasis
added] conduct a study to investigate the feasibility of an Inclusionary Housing Program.” With
the recession and Stockton’s bankruptcy, I do not know if such a feasibility study has been
conducted. However, it is way past the time for a study since the reality is that no serious efforts
have been made to build affordable housing and the community cannot wait another five years to
have this issue addressed.
It is evident from actions proposed by the building community and adopted by the City Council
that the housing market is poised to make a return, however tentative. To be fair to all residents
of Stockton, the City needs to do what it can to ensure that housing built in Stockton meets the
needs of the entire community which has clearly not happened in the past.
                                                    1

                                                                                  Attachment B
I strongly urge the Stockton Planning Commission to recommend the adoption of an inclusionary
housing ordinance in its updated Housing Element. The time to act for all citizens of Stockton is
now. I hope the Commission will act positively in this regard.
Sincerely,
Colleen Foster

taxes, insurance, homeowner association fees, and other related costs.
Affordable Units: Units for which households do not pay more than 30 percent of income for
payment of rent (including monthly allowance for utilities) or monthly mortgage and related
expenses. Since above moderate-income households do not generally have problems in locating
affordable units, affordable units are often defined as those that low- to moderate-income
households can afford.
Annexation: The incorporation of land area into the jurisdiction of an existing city with a resulting
change in the boundaries of that city.
Assisted Housing: Housing that has been subsidized by federal, state, or local housing programs.

assistance under federal programs listed in subdivision (a) of §65863.10, state and local
multifamily revenue bond programs, local redevelopment programs, the federal Community
Development Block Grant Program, or local in-lieu fees. The term also includes multi-family
rental units that were developed pursuant to a local inclusionary housing program or used to a
quality for a density bonus pursuant to §65915.

consistent, not contradictory or preferential. State law requires consistency between a general
plan and implementation measures such as the zoning ordinance.
Contract Rent: The monthly rent agreed to, or contracted for regardless of any furnishings,
utilities, or services that may be included.
Dedication, In lieu of: Cash payments that may be required of an owner or developer as a
substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars per lot, and referred to as in lieu
fees or in lieu contributions.

e.g., a development with 100 units located on 20 acres has density of 5.0 units per acre.
Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land.
Densities specified in the General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre or per net
developable acre.
Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to accommodate
additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
parcel is zoned. Under Government Code Section 65915, a housing development that provides

Stockton General Plan
Family: (1) Two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption [U.S. Bureau of the
Census]. (2) An individual or a group of persons living together who constitute a bona fide single-
family housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, not including a fraternity, sorority, club, or other
group of persons occupying a hotel, lodging house or institution of any kind [California].
Family Income: The total income of all members of a family 15 years old and over who are
related to the householder.
Feasible: Capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of
time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors.
First-Time Home Buyer: Defined by HUD as an individual or family who has not owned a home
during the three-year period preceding the HUD-assisted purchase of a home. Jurisdictions may
adopt local definitions for first-time home buyer programs which differ from non-federally funded
programs.
General Plan: The General Plan is a legal document, adopted by the legislative body of a City or
County, setting forth policies regarding long-term development. California law requires the
preparation of seven elements or chapters in the General Plan: Land Use, Housing, Circulation,
Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety. Additional elements are permitted, such as
Economic Development, Urban Design and similar local concerns.
Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and
immeasurable.
Green Building: Any building that is sited, designed, constructed, operated, and maintained for
the health and well-being of the occupants, while minimizing impact on the environment.
Gross Rent: Contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (water, electricity,
gas) and fuels (oil, kerosene, wood, etc.) To the extent that these are paid for by the renter (or
paid for by a relative, welfare agency, or friend) in addition to the rent.
Group Quarters: A facility which houses groups of unrelated persons not living in households
(U.S. Census definition). Examples of group quarters include institutions, dormitories, shelters,
military quarters, assisted living facilities and other quarters, including single-room occupancy
(SRO) housing, where 10 or more unrelated individuals are housed.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA): The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires larger
lending institutions making home mortgage loans to publicly disclose the location and disposition
of home purchase, refinance and improvement loans. Institutions subject to HMDA must also
disclose the gender, race, and income of loan applicants.
HOME Program: The HOME Investment Partnership Act, Title II of the National Affordable
Housing Act of 1990. HOME is a Federal program administered by HUD which provides formula
grants to States and localities to fund activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable
housing for rent or home ownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people.
Homeless: Unsheltered homeless are families and individuals whose primary nighttime residence
is a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
Page 4BR-270                                Background Report                  Adopted April 12, 2016
                                                                                       4. Housing
accommodation for human beings (e.g., the street, sidewalks, cars, vacant and abandoned
buildings). Sheltered homeless are families and persons whose primary nighttime residence is a
supervised publicly or privately operated shelter (e.g., emergency, transitional, battered women,
and homeless youth shelters; and commercial hotels used to house the homeless).
Household: All those persons—related or unrelated—who occupy a single housing unit.
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is
usually described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and upper income based
upon household size, and income, relative to the regional median income. (Note: Because many
households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average
family income.)
Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more
persons. The concept of household is important because the formation of new households
generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one
additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two households.
Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population,
thereby increasing the demand for housing.
Housing and Community Development, Department of (HCD): The State agency that has
principal responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting communities to meet the needs of
low- and moderate-income households.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD): A cabinet-level department of
the federal government that administers housing and community development programs.
Housing Authority, Local (LHA): Local housing agency established in State law, subject to local
activation and operation. Originally intended to manage certain federal subsidies, but vested with
broad powers to develop and manage other forms of affordable housing.
Housing Problems: Defined by HUD as a household which: (1) occupies a unit with physical
defects (lacks complete kitchen or bathroom); (2) meets the definition of overcrowded; or (3)
spends more than 30% of income on housing cost.
Housing Subsidy: Housing subsidies refer to government assistance aimed at reducing housing
sales or rent prices to more affordable levels. Two general types of housing subsidy exist. Where a
housing subsidy is linked to a particular house or apartment, housing subsidy is “project” or “unit”
based. In Section 8 rental assistance programs the subsidy is linked to the family and assistance
provided to any number of families accepted by willing private landlords. This type of subsidy is
said to be “tenant based.”
Housing Unit: The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. A housing unit
may be a single-family dwelling, a multi-family dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a
mobile home, a cooperative, or any other residential unit considered real property under State
law. A housing unit has, at least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to sleep. It also is a
dwelling that cannot be moved without substantial damage or unreasonable cost.

Stockton General Plan
Impact Fee: A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city,
county, or other public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project
will produce.
Inclusionary Zoning: Provisions established by a public agency to require that a specific
percentage of housing units in a project or development remain affordable to very low-, and low-,
or moderate income households for a specified period.
Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or technique that carries out general
plan policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the
action and a time frame for its accomplishment.
Income Category: Four categories are used to classify a household according to income based on
the median income for the county. Under state housing statutes, these categories are defined as
follows: Very Low (0-50% of county median); Low (50-80% of county median); Moderate (80-
120% of county median); and Upper (over 120% of county median).
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over properties)
within areas that are already largely developed.
Jobs/Housing Balance; Jobs/Housing Ratio: The availability of affordable housing for employees.
The jobs/housing ratio divides the number of jobs in an area by the number of employed
residents. A ratio of 1.0 indicates a balance. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates a net in-commute;
less than 1.0 indicates a net out-commute.
Large Household: A household with five or more members.
Lease: A contractual agreement by which an owner of real property (the lessor) gives the right of
possession to another (a lessee) for a specified period of time (term) and for a specified
consideration (rent).
Low-income Housing Tax Credits: Tax reductions provided by the federal and State
governments for investors in housing for low-income households.
Manufactured Housing: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled
partly at the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
Market-Rate Housing: Housing which is available on the open market without any subsidy. The
price for housing is determined by the market forces of supply and demand and varies by
location.
Mean: The average of a range of numbers.

Mitigate, v.: To ameliorate, alleviate, or avoid to the extent reasonably feasible.
Mixed-use: Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial, institutional, and
residential, are combined in a single building or on a single site in an integrated development
project with significant functional interrelationships and a coherent physical design. A "single site"
may include contiguous properties.
Mobile Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis
and designed for use as a single-family dwelling unit and which (1) has a minimum of 400 square
feet of living space; (2) has a minimum width in excess of 102 inches; (3) is connected to all
available permanent utilities; and (4) is tied down (a) to a permanent foundation on a lot either
owned or leased by the homeowner or (b) is set on piers, with wheels removed and skirted, in a
mobile home park.
Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB): A state, county or city program providing financing for the
development of housing through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
Multi-family Dwelling Unit: A building or portion thereof designed for or occupied by two or
more families living independently of each other, including duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes,
apartments, and condominiums.
Overcrowding: Households or occupied housing units with 1.01 or more persons per room.
Parcel: A lot in single ownership or under single control, usually considered a unit for purposes of
development.
Physical Defects: A housing unit lacking complete kitchen or bathroom facilities (U.S. Census
definition). Jurisdictions may expand the Census definition in defining units with physical defects.
Poverty Level: As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are classified as
being above or below the poverty level based on a poverty index that provides a range of income
cutoffs or "poverty thresholds" varying by size of family, number of children, and age of
householder. The income cutoffs are updated each year to reflect the change in the Consumer
Price Index.
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific
tenant. A tenant receiving project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance upon
moving from the project.
Public Housing: A project-based low-rent housing program operated by independent local public
housing authorities. A low-income family applies to the local public housing authority in the area
in which they want to live.
Quantified Objective: The housing element must include quantified objectives which specify the
maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved by
income level within a five- year time frame, based on the needs, resources, and constraints
identified in the housing element (§65583 (b)). The number of units that can be conserved
should include a subtotal for the number of existing assisted units subject to conversion to non-
low-income households. Whenever possible, objectives should be set for each particular housing
Adopted April 12, 2016                    Background Report                            Page 4BR-273

Stockton General Plan
program, establishing a numerical target for the effective period of the program. Ideally, the sum
of the quantified objectives will be equal to the identified housing needs. However, identified
needs may exceed available resources and limitations imposed by other requirements of state
planning law. Where this is the case, the quantified objectives need not equal the identified
housing needs, but should establish the maximum number of units that can be constructed,
rehabilitated, and conserved (including existing subsidized units subject to conversion which can
be preserved for lower- income use), given the constraints.
Redevelop: To demolish existing buildings; or to increase the overall floor area existing on a
property; or both; irrespective of whether a change occurs in land use.
Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP): The Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) is based on
State of California projections of population growth and housing unit demand and assigns a share
of the region’s future housing need to each jurisdiction in California. These housing need
numbers serve as the basis for the update of the Housing Element in each California city and

         housing opportunities on small lots. Possible changes to the Development
         Code might include:
             Reducing the minimum lot area required for a PUD or the possibility of
              creating an alternative zoning designation for smaller lot developments of
              less than 2 acres. The purpose of this alternative zoning designation would
              be to allow different development standards to permit higher densities in
              infill areas.                                                                                                                2018/2019
             Reviewing site development standards to see if there are ways to use space
              more effectively in order to develop more units and usable open space.
             Only permitting single-family homes within RM and RH zones for isolated
              parcels that cannot feasibly be developed in a more intense fashion.
             Reviewing development standards for homes on small lots (e.g., reduced
              setbacks, parking, yard requirements).
             Removing the AUP requirement for high density residential development
              in the Greater Downtown. [Existing Program, modified based on public input]

4.4      Quantified Objectives
The City has two sets of numerical housing goals: the City’s share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) and the Quantified Objectives. The RHNA is used to ensure the City has adequate land zoned at
appropriate densities to accommodate its fair share of the regional housing needs. The quantified objectives
represent a target goals for the City to assist through Housing Element programs based on available resources
and general market conditions during the time frame of the Housing Element. Housing element law recognizes
that in developing housing policies and programs, the RHNA may exceed available resources and the
community's ability to satisfy these needs.
While the City has demonstrated adequate sites to accommodate the RHNA (see Section 3), this total housing
need of 11,824 housing units is greater than the City has available resources to facilitate. In the past, the City
relied heavily on Redevelopment Set-Aside funds to subsidize affordable housing development. When the State
of California abolished redevelopment agencies through AB 26, the primary subsidy for affordable housing
throughout California was also eliminated by State legislation. This action by the State, and the effect of the
significant economic downturn on general City revenues, has left the City with limited and very constrained
resources to meet affordable housing needs. Therefore, the City’s quantified objectives, shown below, are lower
than the RHNA.
The table below summarizes the City’s quantified objectives for new construction, rehabilitation, preservation,
and housing assistance over an eight-year time frame. These quantified objectives represent targets. They are
estimates based on past experience, anticipated funding levels, and anticipated housing market conditions.
