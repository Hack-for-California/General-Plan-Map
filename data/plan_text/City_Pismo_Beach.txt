          Pismo Beach General Plan/Local Coastal Plan
INTRODUCTION
The General Plan/Local Coastal Plan
          The Pismo Beach General Plan/Local Coastal Program is the City's constitution for physical
development and change within the existing and future city limits. The Plan is a legal mandate that
governs both private and public actions.
          The general plan is atop the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use. Subordinate
to the general plan are specific plans, ordinances and zoning laws. Zoning laws must conform to the
adopted general plan.
          State law requires every California City to adopt a General Plan that contains seven mandatory
topics called "Elements'', (Circulation, Conservation, Housing, Land Use, Noise, Open Space and Safety).
Cities may also adopt other topics, which carry the same weight as mandatory elements. This Pismo
Beach plan adds Design, Facilities, Growth Management and Parks, Recreation and access. All topics
carry equal weight and are designed to be consistent with each other.
          A large portion of Pismo Beach lies within the Coastal Zone. The Coastal Act of 1976 requires the
city to have a Local Coastal Plan certified by the State Coastal Commission. This plan is a combined
document meeting both the state General Plan requirements and Coastal Plan requirements. Certain
sections and policies that are not a part of the Coastal Plan are identified by the following distinguishing

General Plan Format
          The Plan is divided into ten topics (chapters) that are arranged alphabetically. The pages, figures
and tables of each topic are numbered to correspond to that specific topic.
          Brief background material is provided for each topic. Readers wishing more detailed background
are directed to the technical appendix. Each topic includes one or more principles. The plan's twenty-
three principles set the desired directions for the city.
          The principles are followed by a series of policies that establish more explicit directives for both
public and private actions aimed at preserving and creating a desirable Pismo Beach.
Regional Setting
          Pismo Beach is one of seven incorporated cities located within San Luis Obispo County. The
county is frequently divided into four general sub-regions: The North Coast, the Northeast County, the
South County and Central San Luis Obispo.
          The South County includes the incorporated cities of Pismo Beach, Grover City, Arroyo Grande
and the unincorporated communities of Avila Beach, Oceano and Nipomo. The area known as "Five
Cities" is part of the South County and includes the incorporated cities of Arroyo Grande, Grover City,
Pismo Beach and Shell Beach (which is actually part of Pismo Beach) and the unincorporated community
of Oceano. The City of Pismo Beach lies within the San Luis Bay Planning Area of the San Luis Obispo
County General Plan.
Characteristics of the City
                                                                                                       1

         Pismo Beach has been a popular tourist destination since the 1880's when John Price moved his
hotel from the Arroyo Grande/Avila Road--where it had been a failure, down to the beach--where it
thrived. Price laid out the town site of E1 Pismo around his hotel, and with the coming of the Southern
Pacific Railroad in 1895, and later the coastal routing of State Highway 2 (now U.S. 101) in 1912;
vacationers had easy access to the new town and the broad sandy beaches of central California.
         Today, a hundred years later, tourism is still the dominant economic activity in Pismo Beach. The
town is relatively small--7669 residents according to the 1990 U.S. Census--but visitors swell the local
population on the average by a third, and on summer holidays by two to three times. The railroad no
longer stops at Pismo Beach, but the U.S. 101 Freeway now forms the spine of the city, bringing travelers
along this route to their only contact with the ocean edge for some three hundred miles between San
Francisco and Santa Barbara County.
         Communities that are popular vacation spots often tend to be popular retirement areas as well. A
comparison of age statistics in the San Luis Obispo region shows that Pismo Beach is no exception.
According to the 1990 census, the median age for the county was 30-34 years, for Pismo Beach, 40-44
years.
         Pismo Beach stretches along the Pacific shoreline for some seven miles. Most of the city lies
within the California Coastal Zone, although recent development in the southeastern sector now extends
into the foothills beyond the zone boundary. The northwestern half of the city is confined on the northeast
by steep hillsides that rises to 1000 feet in some areas and form a magnificent open space backdrop to
the land and beaches below. The State of California controls about a mile of sandy beach within the city
limits, as well as many of the public beach areas that stretch to the south for some 20 miles. Mobile home
parks, RV parks, and camping areas extend along these beaches. North of the downtown, the shore is
lined with steep riffs to 100 feet above the water edge. Much of this area is developed with large hotels
and restaurants. The remainder of the city is residential neighborhoods: smaller beach oriented cottages
and apartments in Shell Beach and the downtown; larger, newer homes and condos east of the freeway
and in the extreme northwest sector.
         The original El Pismo town site that John Price laid out in 1886 is still the downtown section of the
city. A new pier was built in 1984 replacing one that had been built in the 1920's. The earlier pier had
replaced the old wharf built on Price's land back in 1881. The downtown is showing its age. In 1989 the
American Institute of Architects studied the downtown area under the Regional Urban Design Assistance
Team program. The development directions that the R/UDAT suggested have been explored in studies
for the Downtown Specific Plan, and relevant items are included in this update of the General Plan.
Pismo Beach has experienced considerable growth in
Focus of the General Plan Update
         This 1992 update of the General Plan replaces a plan that was adopted by the City Council more
than a decade ago. The new plan comes at a critical period for Pismo Beach. Major decisions must be
made regarding the amount, location and timing of growth; the support for housing for all income levels;
open space acquisition and preservation; the development and allocation of water resources; the
revitalization of the down- town and other older areas; the timing and sizing of roads into areas presently
beyond the city's jurisdictional boundaries; and the expansion of city services over the next twenty years
into a sphere of influence. These issues are all addressed in the plan. A few key features include:
Circulation
Expansion of U.S. 101 to 6 lanes.
Expansion of Price Canyon Road to 4 lanes.
Construction of a new Inland cross-city route from Oak Park Boulevard to Price Canyon Road.
Connection of James Way to Bello Street
Connection of Five Cities Drive to Price Street.
Conservation and Open Space:
The creation of a public open space corridor along Price Canyon Road.
The protection of private open space on the ocean-facing slopes of the foothills northwest of the Pismo
Heights area.
Extension of lateral bluff-top parks and ocean access ways.
                                                                                                    2
Design:
Adoption of 42 design guidelines to foster a more attractive Pismo Beach.
Facilities:
A program to assure public facilities (such as roads, sewer and water supply) are in place concurrent with
need.
Growth:
The addition of 975 acres to the city's sphere of influence or urban expansion area.
The continuation of policies to control the city's rate of residential growth in accordance with the
availability of services.
Land-use policies that allow up to 2,695 new dwellings, over 648,000 sq. ft. of additional commercial uses
and 1,208 new motel rooms to be developed within the next 20 year period.
Housing:
A variety of policies aimed at retaining and developing a mix of low and moderate-income housing.
Land Use:
A detailed land use plan that provides guidelines - neighborhood by neighborhood for 18 sub-areas of the
city.
Noise:
Noise standards to preserve a livable community.
Parks & Recreation:
A series of policies to expand on Pismo Beach attractiveness by completion of the ocean front parks,
access ways and trails.
Policies to require the creation of new neighborhood and community parks in the growing residential
areas northeast of U.S. Highway 101.
Safety:
Recognition that protection of life and property from hazards posed by flooding, earthquakes, bluff
erosion, slope instability and woodland fires, is a key community goal.
    Pismo Beach faces many problems relating to growth and development that must be solved on a
regional, and in some cases, statewide basis. The challenge to find solutions to these problems, however,
does not and should not preclude planning for the kind of future the city wishes to achieve.
         The General Plan has a twenty-year horizon. Undoubtedly, as with all plans, changes and
amendments will be needed along the way. Nevertheless, the plan as now updated presents a vision of
the future for Pismo Beach that is at once ambitious and yet, with dedicated civic leadership and
community support, both practical and attainable.
                                                                                                     3

C-
Circulation Element
Background
    The Circulation Element is one of the mandatory general plan elements required by state planning law.
Additionally, policies on access and transportation are required by the California Coastal Act. In order to
project long-term traffic conditions, a detailed traffic study was conducted by Associated Transportation
Engineers and is included in a technical appendix to the General Plan.
         Pismo Beach is an elongated highway oriented community. Average daily traffic volumes (ADT's)
for a peak summer month in 1990 are shown in Figure C-1. The Figure also shows projected traffic in the
year 2010, assuming a full build out of land use within the 1990 existing city limits and the proposed
urban expansion area.
Regional Facilities
         The city sits astride the four lanes U.S. Highway 101 freeway corridor. In 1990 this corridor
carried an ADT of 50,000 - 66,000 vehicles. Volumes are increasing 4.2 percent per year. Freeway
volume increases are both locally and regionally generated. However, even without local growth, the
freeway volumes will exceed the existing four-lane capacity within the 20-year (year 2010) planning
period. CALTRANS has plans to widen the freeway to 6 lanes but this widening has not yet been
programmed into the state budget.
         Two other regionally significant roads are Price Canyon Road and State Route 1. The two-lane
Price Canyon Road provides regional access to the area via its connection to State Route 227 and the
City of San Luis Obispo. The current ADT of 6,200 is increasing 6.8 percent per year, which is higher than
expected from local and regional growth. The long-term projection of 20,760 ADT would require a four-
lane facility (see Figure C-l).
         The two-lane State Route 1 (Dolliver Street) has a 1990 ADT of 14,900 entering Pismo Beach
from the south. The traffic is increasing 5.2 percent annually and is projected to increase to 28,900, which
would require a four-lane facility. However, a four lane Dolliver Street would have negative economic and
policy impacts on downtown and is not recommended.
         In addition to the capacity problems on these three major highways, there is also a problem with
how the three streets intersect as well as projected problems with the freeway off- ramps in the downtown
area. These three streets and certain freeway ramps will need to be improved to avoid long-term
congestion. Additionally, there is a problem in the inability to get directly from one end of the city to the
other without using the freeway. The only crossing of the railroad is the freeway.
Intersection Levels of Service
         Because traffic flow on urban arterials is most severely restricted at intersections, a
comprehensive analysis of Pismo Beach traffic flow must examine the operating conditions of critical
intersections during peak flow periods. In rating an intersection's ability to accommodate peak hour traffic
volumes, "Levels of Service" (LOS) A through F are used, with A indicating little or no congestion and F
indicating severe congestion. These service levels are defined in Table C-1.
         Figure C-2 shows the location of the critical intersections in the Pismo Beach area and Table C-2
lists each intersection, the type of traffic control in 1990, the 1990 level of service and the year 2010 level
of service provided the various traffic improvements recommended in the plan are completed. The 2010
level of service assumes the annexation and builds out of the sphere of influence area. In 1990, the three
                                                                                                        C-2
Oak Park Boulevard intersections indicate a LOS of D (intersection numbers 33, 34, and 35). The two
Fourth Street intersections indicate a LOS of E-F (intersection numbers 29 and 30). All other inter-
sections are C or better.
                                                                                                   C-3
                                                  Table C-1
                               Intersection Level of Service Definitions
A Conditions of free unobstructed flow, no delays and all signal phases sufficient in duration to clear
  all approaching vehicles.
B Conditions of stable flow, very little delay, a few phases are unable to handle all approaching
  vehicles.
C Conditions of stable flow, delays are low to moderate, full use of peak direction signal phase(s) is
  experienced.
D Conditions approaching unstable flow, delays are moderate to heavy, significant signal time
  deficiencies are experienced for short durations during the peak traffic period.
E Conditions of unstable flow, delays are significant, signal phase timing is generally insufficient,
  congestion exists for extended duration throughout the peak period.
F Conditions of forced flow, travel speeds are low and volumes are well above capacity. This
  condition is often caused when vehicles released by an upstream signal are unable to proceed
  because of back-ups from a downstream signal.
                                                                                                C-4
Truck Routes
         The purpose of designating truck routes in the Circulation Element is to assure that the geometric
cross section and structural section of the designated roads are adequate to service heavy and large
vehicles. In addition, truck traffic impacts adjacent land use, especially when trucks carry hazardous
materials, or when truck routes are adjacent to residential areas. While trucks may utilize any public street
for delivery of goods or services, the designation of truck routes (and prohibition of trucks from certain
streets) is desirable to limit their unwanted intrusion into certain areas.
         In the City of Pismo Beach, the U.S. 101 Freeway and State Highway One (Dolliver and a portion
of Price Street) were the only designated routes as of 1992 for transport of hazardous materials.
Designated truck routes included these two roads plus the remainder of Price Street, Five Cities Drive,
Fourth Street and Price Canyon Road/Hinds Avenue from Dolliver Street easterly.
Bikeways
         The primary bike route in the area is the Class II Pacific Coast Bike Route, which follows Shell
Beach Road, Price Street and Dolliver Street for a distance of 7 miles. There are 25 miles of Class I~
bikeways including Mattie Road and James Way.
Railroads
         The Southern Pacific Railroad travels through the southern portion of the city. Passenger service
is provided under contract to AMTRAK with a depot in San Luis Obispo and with north and south
passenger trains daily. There is no freight depot within the area; however, arrangements can be made for
carload operations at a privately owned spur in Pismo Beach.
Transit
         The cities of Pismo Beach, Arroyo Grande and Grover City have entered into a joint powers
agreement with the county to form the South County Area Transit (SCAT). The operable system is a
fixed-route bus system that provides intercommunity transit service.
         The Greyhound Bus Company provides several trips each day to San Luis Obispo. The South
County Area Transit system is scheduled to provide connection to the Greyhound system. This system
provides the intercommunity transit system for the entire South County area.
         As part of the transit service system, the SLO Rapid Transit Authority offers a vanpool for the
handicapped. The van is equipped with a wheelchair lift and operates on a dial-a-ride basis. The
"Runabout" service is available to anyone in the county and operates on a 24-hour advance notice basis.
Another transit service available in the Pismo Beach area is a ride sharing program. This is a self-initiative
system with commuter contact via a ride sharing office affiliated with CALTRANS. Taxi services also are
available:
Airports
         The nearest airport facility is Oceano County Airport, located 2-1/2 miles to the south on State
Route 1. This airport offers no commercial air carriers. It is a general aviation airport, used mainly by local
residents and recreational flyers.
         The nearest airport that offers commercial passenger service is San Luis Obispo County Airport
located 8 miles north of Pismo Beach on State Route 227. Service is provided by United, American and
Delta Airlines. The residents of Pismo Beach and the surrounding area will continue to depend on this
airport for commercial passenger services.

Principle
P-1  Balanced Transportation
     The quality of life and economic vitality of Pismo Beach is dependent upon a sate and efficiently
     operating circulation system providing for pedestrians, bicycles, trucks, automobiles and public
     transportation. Specific aspects of this system include:
     a.      Visitor Traffic
             Because Pismo Beach is a visitor-oriented community, good access is essential. This
             includes highways, air and rail service. It is imperative that good access via U.S. 101 be
             maintained.
     b.      Local Traffic
             Local streets should be designed to operate at Level C or better during peak hours. A
             lower standard may be used for the downtown area.
     c.      Pedestrian and Bicycle
             Pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths are important elements of the circulation system
             and shall receive at least the same emphasis and attention in future planning as facilities
             designed for the automobile.
     d.      Visitor Parking and Traffic
             Some street parking and traffic for regional daily visitors is accepted within the known
             constraints that the demand for beach parking may often exceed the supply when the
                                                                                                  C-8
                weather and beach conditions are attractive. Within this context, however, the volume
                and regularity of parking and traffic intrusions in the residential areas should be
                minimized where practical.
      e.        Transportation Design
                The City will strive for safety, environmental sensitivity and energy efficiency in all
                transportation designs and improvements. The circulation system should be
                comprehensible, complete and capable. Comprehensible means the users can
                understand the intent or function of the various streets in the system and find their way
                in the city. Complete means that the total journey is considered and accommodated on a
                variety of different streets, each designed to serve a particular function. Capable means
                each individual component of the total system is capable of carrying, safely and
                economically, the traffic expected to use the facility.
Policies
C-1   Street Classification Plan and Design Standards
      Streets shall be classified and designed as shown in Figure C-3. Functional characteristics of
      each classification are described in Table C-3. Cross sections define the general right-of-way
      width and configuration for each street and highway. The cross sections designated under this
      section will normally be required. Specific plan or special (alternative) section streets may also be
      adopted deviating from these standards. Wherever such alternative cross section configurations
      are used, each will be so designed as to create an orderly transition from one to the next. Each
      alternative cross section must further the goal of providing safe and efficient circulation, as well as
      an aesthetically pleasing urban form. Where streets are to be constructed by developers, the city
      shall not permit installation of less than a full street section. See related policies:

C-2   Freeway U.S. 101--6 lanes
      CALTRANS shall be encouraged to expand U.S. 101 to 6 lanes as early as possible but not later
      than the year 2000. New lanes shall be added within the existing median whenever possible. All

C-3   Price Canyon Road-4 lanes
      The County of San Luis Obispo and the City of Pismo Beach shall undertake a design study of
      the Price Canyon corridor. Such study shall establish the right-of-way line for a future four-lane
      Price Canyon Road and shall implement the scenic highway designation of this road. Where
      feasible, the road shall include a variable width median to emphasize a rural, open space design
      element and a Class II bicycle lane. Related polities:

C-4  State Route 227
    CALTRANS in cooperation with San Luis Obispo County and the City of Arroyo Grande shall be
    encouraged to upgrade State Route 227 to a high standard so that this road can adequately
    perform its function within the state system. The San Luis Obispo County Plan sets forth
    improvements for this road as follows:
    "This route should be reconstructed to modern standards between Arroyo Grande and the town of Edna (located in the San
    Luis Obispo Planning Area to the north). Improvements should consist of two lanes of improved alignment and should occur
    within the existing right-of-way wherever possible. As a long-term proposal, Highway 227 should also be extended southerly
                                                                                                                   C-9
of its present junction with the Branch Street shopping area in Arroyo Grande. The extension should then continue
southwesterly to an interchange at U.S, Highway 101 in the vicinity of the present Traffic Way interchange, then continue
west of the freeway to eventually connect into Valley Road.”
                                                                                                                C-10

                                                    Table C-3
                                    Functional Characteristics of Streets
Freeways – 200’ + ROW
Freeways are the largest circulation elements on the Circulation Plan. These major regional circulation
routes carry traffic to other regional areas and connect Pismo Beach to a national circulation network. The
freeway system has limited access only at designated locations, thus allowing traffic to flow uninterrupted
over greater distances.
Major Arterial – 102’ ROW
These arterials carry the heaviest local traffic through the planning area. Access should be limited on
these routes to permit efficient, high volume traffic circulation. These routes may have raised medians,
and accommodate up to 6 lanes. Turn channelization will also be provided. Access to adjacent property
may be limited to a greater extent than as in Secondary Arterials.
Secondary Arterial – 84’ ROW
Secondary arterials represent the smallest of 4 lane arterial highway classifications. Generally they
provide routes for through traffic across the city/county. Left or giht turn channelization may be provided
Arterial – 60’ to 72’ ROW
Minor Arterial – 60’ to 72’ ROW
Minor Arterials are two-land facilities which, due to their location and termini, function as arterial routes.
They generally serve built-up areas which do not generate four-lane traffic volumes, but have appreciable
amounts of through traffic. They may have a continuous left-turn lane and/or additional turn lanes at
intersections.
                                                                                                       C-11

Industrial/Commercial Collector –64’ ROW
Industrial commercial collectors are designed for industrial and commercial traffic and land use. Their
width accommodates both moving and parked trucks within the roadway. This classification is the
minimum width considered adequate for industrial streets, and is the preferred width for commercial
streets.
Collector Street – 60’ ROW
Collector streets connect local streets to secondary arterial streets. Several neighborhoods may be
accessed by a collector street. This classification is the minimum width considered adequate for
commercial streets. Widening may be required at intersections to provide for turn channelization and/or
transit bus stops.
Local Street –56’ ROW
These local streets are the smallest in the hierarchy of roadway classifications. Local streets are designed
to serve individuals subdivisions and neighborhoods within residential areas. They are inappropriate for
use in nonresidential land use areas, due to their lack of adequate width of parking and travel lanes,
especially for trucks. Standards may be reduced below the 56’ ROW when specified and approved in
Specific Plans or when existing conditions warrant.
C-5      State Highway One
         CALTRANS should be encouraged to improve State Highway One to secondary arterial
         standards from south of Pismo Creek, through Grover City and Oceano, to the intersection of
         Valley Road.
C-6      Freeway Frontage Roads
         New frontage roads parallel to U.S. 101 are proposed as follows:
         Bello Street to James Way on the east side of U.S. 101 (minor arterial).
         Price Street to Five Cities Drive on the west side of U.S. 101 (minor arterial). The new frontage
         roads shall include bridges that span the full width of the Pismo Creek channel. Refer to related
         policy:
                  Land Use Element         LU-M-2           Frontage Road
C-7      Downtown Pismo Beach--Street Connectors
         CALTRANS, in cooperation with the City of Pismo Beach, shall be requested to participate in a
         detailed design study of the U.S. 101 freeway ramps, frontage roads and intersections relating to
         downtown. Amongst other items, this study shall analyze the following alternatives:
         a.       Review of all freeways on and off ramps within or near downtown, including right-of-way
                  requirements for new ramps.
         b.       Widening of Price Canyon Road along its present alignment into the city and over the
                  freeway to Price Street.
         c.       The use of both Dolliver Street and Price Street to carry traffic through downtown.
                                                                                                    C-12

C-8        Highway System Plan and Traffic Improvements
           a.         Improvements to Maintain Service Standards
                      The planned future street and highway network, shown in Figure C-3, reflects numerous
                      projects to create additional capacity and to improve traffic flow. The most significant of
                      these projects are listed in Table C-4. The projects contained in this plan create the
                      additional capacity that is needed to accommodate the increased traffic volumes that will
                      be generated by the growth allowed in the land-use element. Implementation of these
                      improvements will achieve the level of service standards of this plan.
           b.         Categories of Improvement Projects
                      The categories of projects include new roads, extensions of existing streets, creation of
                      additional travel lanes on some roads, interchange reconfiguration/reconstruction,
                      improvement of street and intersection geometrics, and signalization.
           c.         Local Measures to Finance Traffic Improvements
                      1.             The city shall establish and maintain traffic impact fees applicable to new
                                     development to aid in financing the costs of the planned off-site circulation
                                     improvements.
                      2.             Approvals of new development shall be conditioned upon the developer
                                     constructing improvements of street frontages adjacent to the project and/or new
                                     public streets to be located within the project area.
                      3.             Approvals of new large-scale commercial or residential projects may require the
                                     developer to prepare and implement a transportation/parking management plan.
                                                                                                                                      C-13
              4.       New or amended specific plans approved by the city shall include within their
                       circulation elements the measures that will be employed to finance and
                       implement the planned circulation system and off-site traffic improvement
                       projects.
              5.       The city shall participate in countywide efforts to establish regional traffic impact
                       fees and other measures to implement those highway improvement projects that
                       provide regional or statewide benefits. Any such regional fees should equitably
                       reflect the proportionate share that development within the City contributes to the
                       total need for the improvement projects.
     d.       Flexibility in the Timing of Improvements
              The timing of the various street and highway improvements identified in Table C-4 will be
              contingent upon the actual locations and amounts of future growth, actual traffic
              conditions experienced at the various locations within the city, as well as the availability
              of outside funding to supplement local revenues set aside for these purposes.
C-9  Truck Routes
     a.       Hazardous Materials
              The truck routes for hazardous materials shall be limited to U.S. 101. The City shall
              request CALTRANS to remove Route 1 as a designated hazardous materials route.
     b.       Other Truck Routes
              Designated truck routes shall be:
              Price Canyon Road
              State Route 1
              U.S. 101
C-10 Bikeways Plan
     Bikeways Plan Bikeways shall be located and classified as shown in Figure C-4. To the extent
     possible, bikeways shall tie into state routes and routes of adjoining communities. Permitted land
     uses adjacent to bicycle routes are shown on Figure LU-2, land use map. Population density and
     settlement patterns adjacent to the bikeways are identified in the Land Use Element. Bicyclists
     may utilize other methods of transportation as identified in the other Circulation Element policies.
     Public review and comment on the City's bikeway plan occurred throughout the General Plan
     update process, in which a minimum of 4 public hearings were held.
C-11 Bikeways Encouraged
     Bikeways shall be encouraged within the City and adjoining jurisdictions as a complement to
     Pismo Beach's visitor and recreation emphasis, to reduce automobile trips and for the
     convenience of visitors and residents. The City's bikeway plan will be coordinated with the San
     Luis Obispo Area Coordinating Council and Regional Transportation Agency and the County of
     San Luis Obispo regional transportation plan.
     The City Shall install bicycle storage facilities in public areas such as the beach and in parks and
     in other public facilities to encourage bicycle use. Bicycle storage facilities shall be considered as
     a required condition of approval for new development applications for proposed commercial hotel
     and major residential projects. Bike lanes shall be located near restrooms, drinking water, public
     telephones and air for bicycle tires.
     In the renovation and/or new construction of City Hall, the City shall consider the installation of
     lockers, showers and secure bicycle storage facilities.
                                                                                                    C-14
C-1
C-12 Pedestrian Circulation
     Sidewalks shall be required for all new developments in residential and commercial areas.
     Normally the sidewalk shall be located so that a landscape strip or trees are located between the
     sidewalk and the vehicle travel way. Techniques shall be encouraged to create a pleasant
     walking experience including concern for views, paving materials, landscape, street furniture and
     pedestrian scaled lighting. All new sidewalk area shall be designed to accommodate the
     handicapped. The City and CALTRANS shall study the feasibility of adding a pedestrian crossing
     of US 101 between the Spyglass and Mattie Road interchanges. Also, the City shall install (or
     cause to be installed) sidewalks or footpaths along all collector or arterial streets that connect with
     commercial centers, public gathering areas and schools. See also policies:

C-13 Parking
     Parking for both residents and visitors shall be provided as part of new development. Additional
     designated parking spaces for beach access may be required as a condition of approval of new
     hotel or other commercial development adjacent to the oceanfront. In-lieu fees for commercial
     uses shall be encouraged rather than on-site parking in the central commercial area. In- lieu fees
     may also be considered for residential uses in order to encourage ground floor, street facing
     residential dwellings. Parking shall be provided within the vicinity of the coastline for recreational
     uses. However, within the downtown area, day use parking for the beach shall primarily be
     located at the north or south end of downtown rather than at the pier.
                                                                                                   C-16
     In order to assure that development projects will not adversely affect the availability of existing
     parking for shoreline access, an adequate quantity of on-site parking spaces to serve the full
     needs of the development shall be required, except as noted above for the down- town area.
     Exact parking standards shall be established by City ordinance, but minimum parking ratios for
     new developments shall not be less than:
          •   Hotels, motels: 1 space per unit (corrected 02/06/14)
          •   Multi -unit residential: 1.5 spaces per unit
          •   Single-family residential: 2 spaces per unit
          •   Commercial: 1 space per 300 sq. ft. of gross floor area
          •   Restaurants: 1 space per 100 sq. ft. of dining area
     New development projects located within one-quarter mile of the beach or bluff edge shall be
     evaluated to assess their impact on the availability of parking for public access to the coast. If a
     project would result in a reduction of shoreline access parking, the project may be required to
     provide additional parking spaces to accommodate public access. See also policies:

C-14 Comprehensive Transit Services
     The City shall support the availability of transit service as a means to reduce automobile
     congestion, to pro- vide transportation for those who have no other form of transportation, as a
     means to reduce air pollution, and as a service to visitors. Such support should include, but not
     be limited to, South County Area Transit (SCAT), Greyhound bus service, van pools, shuttle bus
     systems, dial-a-ride and cab services.
C-15 Multimodal Transfer Areas
     The City will work with CALTRANS, CCAT, the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments
     (SLOCOG), and the commuting public to develop a multimodal transfer area that will incorporate
     auto parking areas, bike parking, bus, transit, pedestrian bike paths, and park and ride pick-up
     points for carpooling.
C-16 Van Pools/Ride Share
     The City shall encourage and support vanpools and ride sharing. A special program should be
     developed in cooperation with the visitor industry to encourage vanpools and ride sharing for
     hotel and related workers. Appropriate locations shall be designated for ride share parking lots.
C-17 Inter City Rail Service
     The existing Southern Pacific Railroad tracks through Pismo Beach shall be considered as an
     asset for potential long-term usage. Such usage might include, but not be limited to providing
     regional commuter rail to San Luis Obispo.
C-18 Downtown Traffic
     To discourage traffic in the downtown area and reduce the need for additional parking facilities,
     the City shall work with the hotel/motel industry to 1) provide free (or very low rent) bicycles for
     guests, and 2) to develop a trolley system for summer months, weekends, and special events.
C-19 Express Bus or Transit Service
     The City will work with appropriate transportation agencies and major employers to establish
     express bus or transit service to San Luis Obispo and Northern Santa Barbara County.
                                                                                                  C-17

C-20 Subdivision Planning
     As an element of the subdivision and specific planning process, the City will require pedestrian
     and bicycle pathways that provide "short-cut" links through the development and that connect to
     commercial areas, bus stops, schools, parks and collector and arterial roads. Where possible,
     pathways of one development should connect with those of adjacent developments.
C-21 Airports
     The City supports the continued availability of the Oceano County Airport for general aviation
     services and the San Luis Obispo County Airport for commercial passenger service.
                                                                                              C-18
CO-
Conservation and Open Space Element
Introduction
    California Planning Law requires the general plan to include both a conservation Element
and an Open Space Element. Because these elements are so interrelated, they have been
combined for the Pismo Beach General Plan. Several issues that are mandatory under state
law are not applicable to the city including forests and harbors.
Natural Resources
        The conservation issues focus on the natural resources of Pismo Beach including air,
water, biology, archeology and physical geography. The intent of policies is to guide the
management of these resources to enhance the quality of life of residents and visitors and
to prevent waste, haphazard exploitation, destruction, or neglect. Because the supply of
natural resources is limited, the importance of conservation planning cannot be
underestimated. The residents and visitors to Pismo Beach depend heavily on natural
resources, whether they be water, dean air, the scenic and recreational qualities of the
community, or gas or electricity for cooking. Responsibility for conservation of natural
resources lies not only with the City Council, Planning Commission and other governmental
bodies, but depends on the wise use of natural resources by every resident and visitor.
        Pismo Beach is located in a special environmental setting on a narrow marine terrace
bordered by the beach and ocean on one side and the hills on the other. It is the only
community in central California where Highway 101, the ocean, and the community
converge in close proximity. The major physical factors and resources affecting the
community's development include soil and landforms, such as the sandy beaches, coastal
bluffs and surrounding hills, the surface and ground- water resources, climate, air quality,
unique biological habitats and the Pacific Ocean. These resources make up the special
essence of Pismo Beach's environment. They are highly inter-related and must be viewed in
context with one another when considering development within the city. These unique inter-
related resources are what make Pismo Beach Pismo Beach.
Open Space
        Open space is one of man's most important nonrenewable resources; a premium
space that, once destroyed, can only be recovered by expending tremendous energy and
cost. Pismo Beach relies heavily on its scenic, natural setting to maintain its economic life
stream of vacationers and tourists, not to mention retirees and families who desire to live in
Pismo Beach because of its amenities. Table CO-1 compares Pismo Beach's open spaces to
six open space categories.
Biotic Habitants
        Although open space lands are traditionally viewed as unimproved, and park and
recreation land as improved, in reality the distinction often is blurred and lands serve dual
functions. This has what may be called a value multiplying effect. For example, not only
does the beachfront have recreational and economic values, but also cultural, scenic and
biological values.
        The natural resource conservation areas discussed in the Conservation Element host
a large number of diverse plant and animal species--from tide pool organisms to shore birds
and terrestrial mammals. A listing of these animals and the associated plants of the various
habitats are contained in the Technical Appendix to the General Plan.
        Protection of animal species is dependent on protection of habitat. The Element
discusses the most important habitat areas and states policies for their protection.
                                                                                          CO-2

Principles
The Conservation and Open Space Element is based on a few key principles. These
principles impact the entire General Plan and are also the basis for 30
conservation and open space policies that are considered essential to the quality
of life of Pismo Beach. Topics are discussed in the following eight categories.
(Water is discussed in the Public Facilities and Services Element.)
    • Air Quality
    • Archaeology
    • Butterfly Habitat
    • Coastal Foothills
    • Pacific Ocean, Tidal Zone, Coastal Cliff
    • Pismo Creek/Price Canyon
    • Pismo Marsh (Ecological Preserve)
    • Soils and Drainage
P-2     Natural Resources--Key Foundation of the City
        Pismo Beach is the ocean, beaches, hills, weather and related ecosystems.
        Conservation and protection of these resources shall be the key focus of the General
        Plan. The unique geographical character of Pismo Beach is recognized as the
        foundation for all other aspects of the community. These physiographic
        characteristics enhance the quality of life of residents and visitors and shall not be
        wasted, destroyed, or neglected. They are generally nonrenewable and provide many
        of the scenic, historic, economic, recreation, open space and ecological values for the
        community.
P-3     Resources and Open Space Belong to Everyone
        Pismo Beach is an integral part of the larger California coastal community, linked by
        shared resources that are prized by the state, national and even international
        community. Congenial and cooperative use of these resources by both residents and
        visitors is recognized. Solutions for co- operative use shall always be based on
        retaining the area's fragile charm and resources.
P-4     Clean Air--A Must
        Pismo Beach shall cooperate with the San Luis Obispo Air Pollution Control District
        and all regional jurisdictions to meet or better both federal and state clean air
        standards. Clean air is not a negotiable feature of the community.
P-5     Guaranteed Water Supply
        The well-being of Pismo Beach is dependent on a reliable source of clean water which
        shall be available, expanded, and protected at all times.
P-6     The Big Three
        The three primary resources and open space for Pismo Beach are:
               The Ocean--A Resource For Everyone
                The ocean, coastal cliffs, and shoreline resources are vital to Pismo Beach for
                their wildlife habitat, recreational use, open space, scenic value and the city's
                overall economy. These natural assets will be protected and made available to
                all.
               The Foothills
                                                                                            CO-4

               If is recognized that the freeway foothills northwest of Pismo Heights are both
               a visual and open space asset to the community as well as a sensitive
               environmental resource. The city shall pre- serve the area's native flora and
               fauna and pre- serve the foothills as an undeveloped visual back- drop for the
               city.
              Pismo Creek/Price Canyon--A Public Resource
               Pismo Creek/Price Canyon and environs are a key natural resource/open
               space area and the major inland entrance to the city. It shall be managed as
               a public resource for the community.
Air Quality (See Principle P-4)
Background
        Overwhelmingly, the citizens of Pismo Beach have stated that one of the greatest
assets of the community has been dean air and a pleasant climate. Traditionally, Pismo
Beach and other communities in San Luis Obispo County have used dean air as an attraction
for visitors and new residents. Unfortunately, a side effect of increased population and
tourism has been increased traffic and commuting, and the consequent degradation of
regional air quality.
        The state Air Resources Board has designated San Luis Obispo County a
nonattainment area under the standards of the California Clean Air Act of 1988.
Nonattainment occurs in the levels of ozone and respirable particulate matter. The standard
for sulphur dioxide was achieved in 1990 by a narrow margin; however the region must
make considerable effort if this standard is to be maintained. From 1988 - 1992, the City of
Pismo Beach, along with other cities and the county, worked with the Air Pollution Control
District (APCD) to develop a revised Air Quality and Attainment Plan, referred to as the
"Clean Air Plan".
        Pismo Beach is in an air quality basin known as the Coastal Plateau. This plateau is
five to ten miles wide and varies in elevation from sea level to about five hundred feet.
Primary factors affecting air quality are the quantity, type and location of pollutant
emissions, topographic features, and the prevailing meteorological conditions. The weather
in Pismo Beach is characterized by inversions (a high warm air mass trapping a cooler air
mass adjacent to the land and preventing vertical movement of the air). Frequently, these
inversions severely limit the dispersion of pollutants from population centers on the coastal
plain.
        Stationary sources of pollutants in the region are con- trolled through the permit
processes and monitoring of the APCD. In the Pismo Beach area, major stationary sources
include the Avila tank farm, UNOCAL and the oil wells in Price Canyon. Smaller sources
include gas stations and dry cleaning establishments. The APCD monitors vapor recovery
equipment and processes at these sources.
        However, 50% of the ozone pollution in the region is caused by automobiles. Vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) has almost doubled in relation to population growth over the last ten
years, evidencing a major increase in the amount and distance of commuting. APCD reports
that 30% of the VMT are commuter miles. Additionally, increases in respirable particulate
matter are also caused by automobiles (on paved as well as unpaved roads) and by dust
from construction, demolition, and grading activities. The maintenance of air quality also is
addressed in the Coastal Act of 1976. Policies relating to air quality are contained in section
30253.3 of the Coastal Act, which states that new developments shall:
                                                                                          CO-5

        ...be consistent with requirements imposed by an air pollution control district or the
        state air resources control board as to each particular development.
        Also, section 30253.4 states that new development shall:
        ...minimize energy consumption and vehicle miles traveled.
        The objective of the APCD Clean Air Plan is to bring ozone to levels better than the
state standards, and to maintain them at those standards by December of 1997. At a
minimum, this will require a 40% reduction in emission of reactive organic gases (ROG) and
oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the primary precursors to ozone formation. In order to achieve
and maintain these standards over the long term, Pismo Beach, along with other
jurisdictions must adopt and implement a land use planning strategy that will reduce air
pollution. Additionally, the City must work with citizens, developers, businesses and regional
agencies to effectuate transportation management programs to reduce reliance on
automobile travel.
        To a considerable extent, the following policies will over-lap and complement
concerns raised in the Circulation, Land Use, and Housing Elements of the General Plan.
Policies
CO-1 Siting of Multifamily Projects
        In order to provide easy pedestrian access to commercial areas, the City shall
        encourage the location of multifamily projects in dose proximity to transit routes and
        to commercial centers. Mixed-use development shall be encouraged in most
        commercial zones. The land use map shall also consider neighborhood commercial
        development in reasonable proximity to residential areas.
CO-2 Jobs/Housing Balance
        A mismatch of jobs to affordable housing in the existing city limits, as well as in
        developments that may occur in annexation areas could cause unnecessary
        commuting and consequently excessive energy consumption and air pollution. The
        City shall require the prevention or mitigation of these conditions as an element of
        environmental review. Mitigation may include inclusionary affordable housing and
        worker housing as called for in the Housing Element. Transportation management
        measures such as vanpools or carpools, subsidized transit passes, or other incentives
        to reduce automobile travel may be required. See:

CO-3 Grading, Construction, Demolition
        The City shall require contractors to strictly adhere to APCD guidelines regarding
        dust and combustion emissions from construction and grading. Specifically, the City
        will ensure that the grading site is frequently watered, and that netting is used until
        new vegetation is established. Additionally, the City will require that dirt be
        transported in trucks with liners and covers over the loads. Construction work may
                                                                                            CO-6
        be halted when excessive winds create air pollution problems. Related General Plan

CO-4 Trip Reduction
        In order to reduce pollution, the city shall emphasize various procedures to reduce
        the number of vehicle trips in the community. Techniques shall include, but not be
        limited to, transportation management measures such as vanpools, carpools, and
        subsidized transit passes; jobs/housing balance (Policy CO-2); bikeways and facilities
        (Policies C-12, C-13, and C-22); pedestrian facilities (Policy C-14); and transit

Background
        Archaeological sites resulting from thousands of years of human settlement along the
coast are among the most fragile of resources. Protection of these resources is established
in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the California Public Resources Code,
and the California Health and Safety Code.
        The Central Coast area, including Pismo Beach, was the home of the Chumash
people at the time of early explorations and settlements by Europeans. Evidence of the
culture and occupations by the Chumash may be found at numerous sites in the vicinity of
Pismo Beach. Most of the city's archaeological data comes from studies conducted as part of
the CEQA process. Additionally, a general map showing the status of archaeology within the
city has been prepared and is used in the processing of development proposals.
Policies
CO-5 Protect Archaeological Resources
        Archaeological and paleontological resources are declared to be important to be
        conserved. The City shall have available a map that identifies the possible location of
        archeological resources.
        As part of the CEQA process for all new development projects, all known or potential
        archaeological resources shall be fully investigated by a qualified archaeologist
        recognized by the state Historic Preservation Office. Appropriate protections shall be
        determined as part of the review process including:
        a.      Locations within the city known to have a high probability of occurrence of
                archeological sites shall be zoned in the Archeological Resources overlay
                district.
        b.      Sites of statewide or national significance shall be nominated for inclusion in
                the Registry of California Historic Landmarks or National Historic Landmark
                Program.
                                                                                           CO-7
        c.      Specific recommendations prepared by the archaeologist shall be incorporated
                into project approval including: avoidance of portions of sites containing
                resources, minimizing the impacts of the development on the archaeological
                resources, preserving a full archaeological record, and/or partial site
                dedication, and providing a native American monitor onsite to observe
                excavations in locations where there is a possibility of discovery of human
                remains.
CO-6 Construction Suspension
        Should archaeological or paleontological resources be disclosed during any
        construction activity, all activity that could damage or destroy the resources shall be
        suspended until a qualified archaeologist has examined the site. Construction shall
        not resume until mitigation measures have been developed and carried out to
        address the impacts of the project on these resources. See policies:

Butterfly Habitat
Background
        At Meadow Creek, on the south side of the city within the state park North Beach
campground, is a circular grove of eucalyptus trees, which is a habitat for the monarch
butterfly. Each year massive numbers of these beautiful butterflies come here to make their
winter homes.
        The time the butterfly’s duster in Pismo Beach is the most sensitive part of the
monarch's life cycle. The specialized monarch butterfly habitat is of important scientific and
educational interest and an open space resource for residents and visitors alike.
                                                                                           CO-8

Policies
CO-7 Preserve Monarch Butterfly Habitat
        The City shall cooperate with the state Department of Parks and Recreation to
        preserve and enhance the butterfly habitat. Specific actions shall include but not be
        limited to:
                a.     If any tree is removed or lost due to disease or          threat to life or
                       property, it shall be replaced with          appropriate species. Refer to
                       policy:
                       Design Element         D-12     Special Tree Preservation
                b.     Development within the park adjacent to the butterfly habitat shall
                       have a minimum setback of 50 feet.
                c.     The City shall pursue, with Grover City and the Southern Pacific
                       Railroad, mutual regulations to preserve the groves on the east side of
                       Dolliver Street that supplement and support the habitat.
                d.     The City should request the state Department of Parks and Recreation
                       to place appropriate signing and develop adequate visitor parking for
                       the Monarch Butterfly Reserve.
Coastal Foothills            (See Principle P-6)
Background
        The city has three major coastal foothill areas, the Oak Park Heights area, the
Northwestern Freeway Foothills and Price Canyon Foothills. Future annexations will also
occur in the foothills area. These areas provide a significant visual and open space backdrop
to the city and four major wildlife habitats. The majority of the habitat is heavily grazed
open lands, followed by oak woodlands, riparian, and chaparral.
                                                                                              CO-9
        The Oak Park area drains into the sensitive Pismo Marsh habitat. Due to residential
development and grazing, only islands of native chaparral vegetation remain. The eastern
portion of this area, which drains into the marsh, contains open land, oak woodlands and
riparian area and forms a complex habitat that is particularly sensitive to certain
disturbances.
        The Freeway Foothills, which is the predominant land- form in the northwestern
portion of the community adjacent to the U.S. 101, is a significant visual asset. The hills are
generally grassland with pockets of oak woodlands and coastal scrub. Barrancas or finger
canyons, which line the surface of the hills, add visual texture as well as valuable habitat to
the foothills.
        The Price Canyon foothills drain into Pismo Creek and form the major inland entry to
the city. The habitat consists of open grazing land, oak woodlands and riparian areas
surrounding the creek.
        Terrestrial wildlife in the various foothill habitat areas include a variety of rodents,
such as ground squirrels, mice and gophers, foxes, weasels, opossum, deer, and
occasionally mountain lions. Bird species include meadowlarks, finches, sparrows, turkey
vultures, and predators such as owls, hawks, and falcons. Wildlife populations are generally
more numerous in the steeper canyon areas, which retain moisture and provide protective
cover. No rare or endangered species are known to occur in the various foothill habitats.
         Topography strongly affects the use of land and natural features. It influences the
formation of soil types and the possibility for soil erosion. It guides the location of plant and
animal communities, and directs the location and rate of surface water run-off. Moreover,
slopes have been a controlling influence in the shaping of Pismo Beach as a city. Steep
slopes have traditionally constrained urban development, and city policies have prohibited
development on slopes over 30% in all areas except Pismo Heights. Disturbance of the
hillsides and natural drainage patterns, and removal of vegetation can result in slope
instability, landslides, and increased erosion. Siltation caused by slope disturbance may
lower downstream water quality.

       The City, in cooperation with San Luis Obispo County, the State of California, private
       foundations and private interests, shall work to create a coastal foothill open space
       area as conceptually shown in Figure CO-1. This open space area shall for all time
       preserve the ocean facing slopes overlooking U.S. 101 as an undeveloped natural
       area and as a scenic backdrop to the city of Pismo Beach and the Shell Beach area.
       (See Parks and Recreation Element PR-13, Pismo Creek/Price Canyon Regional Park
       and Open Space.)
       To accomplish this purpose the city shall:
       a.      Support retention of the existing restrictive low development intensity land
               use and resource policies of the county as they apply to these lands.
       b.      Request that any development reviewed by the County be requested to locate
               building sites outside the designated open space area.
        c.     Encourage and support efforts to acquire the area as permanent open space

       All the land above the 200 ft. contour line, in the ocean facing slopes of the coastal
       foothills northwest of Pismo
       Heights facing U.S. 101 shall be designated as permanent open space (Policy CO-8).
       Development standards for parcels, which extend above the 200 ft. contours, are as
       follows:
               a.       The maximum permitted number of dwelling units shall be calculated
                        on the basis of the amount of land up to the 250 ft. contour but shall
                        exclude any such lands with on an existing natural slope greater than
                        30%.
               b.       No building pads or structures shall be permitted above the 200 ft.
                        contour. Until such time that properties in this area request annexation
                        to Pismo Beach, the City shall request the County of San Luis Obispo
                        to maintain the open areas of the ocean-facing slopes as described
                        herein.
               c.       A scenic or open space easement prohibiting any development above
                        the 200-foot contour shall be required to be dedicated to the City as a
                        condition of approval of any development           below the 200 foot
                        contour.
CO-10 Slopes Over 30%--Permanent Open Space
                                                                                            CO-11

No buildings or grading shall be permitted on existing natural slopes over 30%. The
areas over 30% shall be retained as permanent public or private open space.
Building and grading on existing legal lots of record in the Pismo Heights Planning
Area that exceed the 30% slope limitation may be approved provided that requrests
for development are accompanied by engineered plans ensuring structural stability
over the life of the residence and the development can be accommodated in
accordance with the resource and hazard protection standards of the certified LCP
(including but not limited to the Safety (S-10 – S-15), Conservation (CO-11 – CO-
14, CO-31), and Land Use (LU-P-1 – LU-P-10) elements/policies of the General
Plan/Local Coastal Plan and the Hazard Protection and View Consideration Overlay
Standards of the Zoning Ordinance (Sections 17.078 and 17.096). Grading shall be
limited to the minimum amount necessary to construct the least environmentally
damaging alternative for building sites with a slope in excess of 30%. Development
shall be directed to the least-steep portions of the site, taking into account other
resource constraints.
Best Management Practices (BMPs) shall be incorporated into the project design in
the following progression:
       Site Design BMPs (any project design feature that reduces the generation of
        pollutants or reduces the alteration of the natural drainage features, such as
        minimizing impervious surfaces or minimizing grading);
       Source Control BMPs (practices that prevent release of pollutants into areas
        where they may be carried by runoff, such as covering work areas and trash
        receptacles, practicing good housekeeping, and minimizing use of irrigation
        and garden chemicals);
       Treatment Control BMPs (a system designed to remove pollutants from runoff
        including the use of gravity settling, filtration, biological uptake, media
        adsorption or any other physical, biological, or chemical process).
Site design and source control BMPs shall be included in all new developments.
Where the development poses a threat to water quality due to its size, type of land
use or proximity to coastal waters (or proximity to a creek, channel or storm drain
system that leads to coastal waters) and the combination of site design and source
control BMPs is not sufficient to protect water quality, treatment control BMPs shall
be implemented.
Where post-construction treatment controls are required, the BMPs (or suites of
BMPs) shall be designed to infiltrate and/or treat the amount of storm-water runoff
produced by all storms up to and including the 85th percentile, 24-hour storm event
for volume-based BMPs, and/or the 85th percentile, 1-hour storm event, with an
appropriate safety factor (i.e., 2 or greater), for flow-based BMPs. The term
treatment includes physical, biological ponds and adsorption media. The actual type
of treatment should be suited to the pollutants generated by the development.
This provision shall not be construed as a guaranteed right to development of the
entire lot but rather the minimum necessary to provide a reasonable economic use of
the site and to avoid a taking of property. No future subdivisions that result in
additional lots whose only building sites would be on a greater than 30% in slope or
                                                                                    CO-12

       within environmentally sensitive habitat, ESHA buffer, riparian areas, finger canyons,
       or native chaparral vegetation shall be permitted. 1
CO-11 Development Regulations--Slopes Under 30%
       Development in all foothill areas with slope under 30% shall comply with the
       following:
       a.      Erosion. A drainage and erosion control plan shall be required prior to
               approval of discretionary permits. Erosion control methods shall be
               implemented and maintained during and after construction
       b.      Landscaping. After completion of construction and before occupancy of the
               structure, landscaping shall be installed per approved landscape plans.
               Landscape plans shall include the following:
              All cut and fill areas shall be revegetated predominantly with native species
               that require little water and blend with the natural landscape; and
              Landscaping and trees shall be planted to soften and partially obscure
               structures from the view shed below. Attention shall also be given to
               conserving the views from the development.
              Development approvals shall incorporate a landscape management plan,
               which shall include a monitoring program.
       c.      Sensitive Habitats. Development in the coastal foothills shall minimize
               removal of natural vegetation and shall preserve sensitive habitats.
               Development adjacent to areas considered to have environ- mentally
               sensitive habitat(s) shall be designed to minimize impacts that could degrade
               the habitat.
       d.      Grading. Development shall be designed to minimize grading and emphasize
               natural landforms. Techniques shall include contour grading, use of daylight
               cuts and fills, use of 3:1 and 4:1 slopes, and generally limiting cuts and fills to
               no more than 15 ft. in height.
       e.      Views. Development shall be planned to take advantage of views of the
               ocean and surrounding hills. Such views shall not only be from private
               properties but also from the public streets and open space systems.
CO-12 Finger Canyon Preservation
       It is essential to protect the finger canyons and their specialized vegetation. No
       disturbance except footpaths, trails, seating, picnic areas, or approved road or utility
       construction shall be permitted in these areas. Any construction shall minimize
       grading and restore the barranca to its natural appearance.
CO-13 Oak Tree Protection
       Native species of oak (e.g. Quercus agrifolia, Quercus lobata, Quercus chrysolepis)
       should be preserved within the City of Pismo Beach, both as an aesthetic resource
       benefiting the entire community and for their ecological value. The following polities
1
  Amendment approved 09/07/2004: City Council Resolution R 2004-052
                                                                                         CO-13

shall apply to protection of oak trees when considering discretionary planning
permits:
a. Applicability
The following requirements shall apply to all native oak species, except scrub oak
(e.g. Quercus dumosa), measuring at least 6 inches in circumference at 4.5 ft. above
natural grade.
b.      Management Plan Required
        All applications for development on parcels, which contain oak trees, which
        meet the criterion in “a.” shall include a proposed vegetation management
        plan. A registered arborist or landscape architect that is experienced in oak
        tree preservation shall prepare this plan. The plan shall include the following:
        1.      A site plan showing the location of all existing trees by diameter,
                species and location, groves of oaks that will not be disturbed by the
                development may be shown by location only.
        2.      Identification of all existing trees that are proposed to be removed.
        3.      Identification of all existing trees that will have proposed grading or
                construction, which encroaches within the tree protection zone as,
                defined below.
        4.      Identification of the protective measures that will be undertaken to
                avoid or reduce adverse effects on existing trees during grading,
                construction and following completion of the development project.
        5.      A monitoring and reporting program to verify compliance with the
                management plan.
c.      Removal of Trees
        Oak trees may be removed only under these conditions:
        1.      A tree is diseased and a registered arborist or landscape architect
                experienced in oak tree preservation has evaluated its condition and
                determined that protective measures would no longer be effective in
                reversing the decline of the tree.
        2.      The location of a tree presents a clear hazard to        the public safety.
        3.      The location of a tree creates a demonstrably severe hardship to
                logical or harmonious configuration of the development for which no
                alternative design solution is feasible. This      provision shall pertain to
                individual trees and shall not be used as a basis to allow removal of a
                grove of oak trees. Any tree removed for this reason shall be replaced
                as specified in the City's tree protection ordinance and standards.
d.      Construction Adjacent to Trees
        1.      A tree protection zone shall be established for each tree that may be
                affected by the proposed development. The extent of this zone shall be
                calculated as one foot of radius for each inch of trunk diameter
                (measured at 4.5 feet above         natural grade).
        2.      Disturbance of the natural grade of the earth within the protection
                zone by grading, trenching, compacting or filling should be avoided.
                Such disturbances may be permitted only when necessary for logical
                or harmonious development and a registered arborist or landscape
                                                                                      CO-14

                      architect determines that such activities will not adversely affect the
                      health and survival of the tree.
              3.      Special measures such as fencing shall be required for tree protection
                      during construction.
              4.      Landscape plans shall not include irrigated plantings within the tree
                      protection zone.
      e.      Tree Protection Ordinance and Standards
              To implement the details of this policy, the City shall prepare an oak tree
              protection ordinance and accompanying standards and guidelines for
              protection of oak trees.

CO-14 Riparian Habitat
      Riparian habitat is the environment associated with lands adjacent to freshwater
      sources perennial and intermittent streams, estuaries, marshes, springs, seeps. The
      habitat is characterized by plant and animal communities that require high soil
      moisture in excess of that available from precipitation. Among the major plants
      associated with riparian habitat in the Pismo Beach area are sycamore, cottonwood,
      willow and occasionally oak. Large riparian areas occur along the banks of Pismo
      Creek, Meadow Creek, and Pismo           Marsh, although smaller areas can be found in
      the planning area.
      It is the policy of the City to preserve riparian habitat under the following conditions:
      1.      As part of discretionary planning permits, a biotic resources management plan
              shall be required.
      2.      The biotic resources management plan shall include standards for project
              development, which will avoid habitat disturbance.
      3.      The standards specified in the biotic resource management plan shall be
              utilized to determine the extent of development. The minimum standards that
              may be specified in the biotic plan for the preservation of habitat shall
              include:
           •   Preservation of groupings of trees in which at least ten trees with a minimum
               six-inch diameter (measured four and one half feet above natural grade) will
               be preserved.
           •   Plants may be removed from the habitat areas if diseased or if they present a
               hazard to public safety. A professional horticulturist or a certified landscape
               architect must certify such conditions. Plants removed for these reasons must
               be replaced with at least four minimum 15-gallon specimens of each species.
           •   No significant disruption of riparian vegetation will be permitted. In addition,
               a minimum riparian buffer area shall be identified for each riparian habitat
               area at the time of development review. Except as specified in Policy CO-21
               for Pismo Creek, in Policy CO-22A for Planning Area R and Policy CO-23 for
               Pismo Marsh, the minimum width of the buffer area shall be as identified by
               the biotic resources management plan and generally not less than 25 feet.
                                                                                          CO-15

                 Except for in Planning Area R, development standards for the minor riparian
                 habitat areas and their respective buffer areas shall be the same as provided
                 in Policy CO-21 with respect to kinds and locations of allowable uses.
                 Development standards for Planning Area R are set forth in Policy CO-22A.
Pacific Ocean, Beach and Coastal Cliffs (See Principle P-6)
Background
         The Pacific Ocean is the most significant single natural resource and open space for
Pismo Beach. It provides a number of unique opportunities. It is valued for its scenic
beauty. The community's lineal physical form and related circulation pat- terns reflect the
residents' strong desire to be as dose as possible to the water. Historically, the community's
economic basis was the ocean, and today the cities major economic and employment
source-visitor service- still depends on the ocean. The coast is also Pismo Beach's most
vulnerable complex of natural resources due to the intensity and types of uses to which it is
subjected. The city's shoreline can be divided into four tidal zones as described as follows.
1. Southern Beach Community
         The beach from the southern city limits to approximately three miles north is
predominantly under the ownership of the State of California, controlled by the state
Department of Parks and Recreation and managed by Pismo Beach. The beach is used for
both passive and active recreational and educational purposes.
         At the southern end of the city are sand dues that are considered part of the coastal
strand community, which is composed mainly of beach and primary dunes. Since the plant
life must adapt to constantly shifting sand conditions created by the winds, plants that are
low growing and often succulent are typical of the plant community. They have the ability to
bind sand into small-stabilized hills, usually only a few feet high.
2. Northern Rocky Beach Areas
         The rocky beach areas, cliffs and rocky points extend from northwest of the pier to
the northern city limits. The cliffs northwest of the pier are fronted by sandy beach and are
eroding from wave activity during storms, drainage from the cliff tops, and related
development activities.       Proceeding northerly from the Dinosaur Caves area to the Sunset
Palisades area and including Shell Beach are marine terraces. These are actually old wave-
cut platforms that have been uplifted. Beaches in this area have been formed by sand being
deposited on top of the wave-cut platforms by the ocean currents. The more resistant rock
that has withstood the effects of the waves also remains.
         The Dinosaur Caves area and the surrounding islet contain roosting areas for the
endangered brown pelican; seal haul-out areas, resident and migrating shorebird feeding
areas, and significant habitat for marine organisms.
         In the Shell Beach area, a sand, small rock and cobble beach occurs at the base of
the cliffs. Offshore are rocks, islets, and reefs. This area contains abundant marine life and
is an important habitat area.
          These coastline characteristics occur up to the South Palisades area, where narrow
intermittent sandy pocket beaches with flat offshore rock reefs occur. The rocky points and
reefs along the Sunset Palisades area is a particularly valuable habitat for shorebirds,
invertebrates and vertebrates. Potential conflicts exist between recreational use of the rocky
beach area and the wildlife. Habitat preservation is of primary importance for the rocky
islets and reefs in the Dinosaur Caves area, some of the coastline along Shell Beach, and
the coastline in the Sunset Palisades area north of Florin Circle.
3. Intertidal Zone
                                                                                         CO-16
         The intertidal zone lies between the high tide and low tide lines. It is covered and
uncovered by water twice each day. In the Pismo Beach area, the intertidal zone is
characterized generally by semi sheltered coast and open bays where the force of the surf is
somewhat dissipated before it can crush the more fragile life forms.
         Within the boundaries of Pismo Beach, the State Lands Commission, which has
jurisdiction over all matters concerning the area’s wildlife populations, owns the intertidal
zone most notably the populations of the Pismo clam. A variety of bird species also feed in
the intertidal zone.
         The intertidal zone in the southern half of Pismo Beach is a most valuable
recreational resource area. During tow tides, it was in the past used intensively by
clammers. Under the protection of the state Department of Parks, the Pismo dam has again
begun to be found in the intertidal zone. Due to the return to this region of the sea otter,
there is only a limited possibility that the clam beds will ever be re-established in the size
that once existed.
         At high tides, this zone is popular for surf fishing. At all times, the intertidal area is a
popular spot for bird watching, pleasure walking, and jogging. It is characterized by a
rockless substrate, fine sand, and an unusually hard surface caused by constant heavy tidal
action. In the northern half of the city, the intertidal area is rocky near the shore. Its ground
surface is characterized by rocks and pebbles.
         Some conflict exists between utilization of the rocky intertidal zone for recreational
uses, and preservation of the natural resources. Currently, it appears that the resources are
not in jeopardy because the more sensitive intertidal areas are located where public access
is limited.
4. Sub tidal Zone
         The sub tidal zone lies between the mean-lower low tide line and the point at which
the ocean reaches a depth of 100 feet. At present the subtidal land between the mean high
tide line and the three-mile limit, which marks the boundary of federal waters, is under the
jurisdiction of the State Lands Commission.
         The sub tidal zone within the area of Pismo State Beach is characterized by a sand or
mud bottom and is relatively level. The sea otter is an inhabitant of this area. This once
endangered animal has recovered under federal, state and local protection.
         In the northern half of the city, the sub tidal area is rocky near the shore. In this
location are kelp beds, which are recognized for their prime habitat value. Although the sub
tidal zone is beyond city jurisdiction from a legal standpoint, the city nevertheless has an
indirect responsibility for activities that affect the natural resources of the area.
         Among the mammals identified offshore in the sub tidal area are the endangered
gray whale, the humpback whale, sperm whale, Pacific right whale, fin whale, North Pacific
pilot whale, dali porpoise and Pacific white sided dolphins.
         If the federal government leases offshore land on the outer continental shelf, the
potential exists for conflict between the resource values of the sub tidal zone and
exploratory or permanent oil drilling operations. Tidal and current action in the vicinity of
Pismo Beach would rapidly carry spilled crude oil towards the shore, thus jeopardizing both
recruitment clam stocks and inhabitants of the lower intertidal levels. Accidental tanker
spills from an offshore tanker terminal sited in this area could also have similar adverse
impacts. An additional potential impact of oil spills from offshore activity would be the
degradation, at least temporarily, of the recreational value of the higher sub tidal zones.

      The ocean shore is, and shall continue to be, the principle open space feature of
      Pismo Beach. Ocean front land shall be used for open space, recreation and
      related uses where feasible and where such uses do not deteriorate the natural
      resource.
CO-16 Drilling, Filling, Dredging, Diking
      The drilling, filling, diking or dredging of open coastal waters shall be prohibited,
      except as may be specifically permitted as part of beach restoration, pier
      maintenance, utility pipes and cables, or wetlands restoration.
CO-17 Man-made Changes
      Shoreline structures, including piers, breakwaters, channel dredges, pipelines,
      outfalls and similar structures shall be sited to avoid significant rocky points and
      intertidal and sub tidal areas. The design and construction of revetment devices and
      other shoreline structures shall be prepared by qualified engineers in accordance
      with city standards which will avoid or minimize disturbance of sensitive coastal
      ecological resources. See Policies S-3 and S-6 in the Safety Element regarding
      standards for shoreline protection structures.
CO-18 Beach Access
      Due to public safety and habitat protection considerations, the construction of
      vertical access ways to the ocean along the rocky coast area shall be limited to those
      areas with sandy beaches. Prior to any approval for new access to the shoreline, the
      request shall first be evaluated in terms of protection of sensitive shoreline resources
      and safety. (See Park and Recreation Element, Access Component.)
CO-19 Oil
      Offshore drilling or other activities, which may endanger the ecological resources of
      the coast, shall be prohibited within the city boundaries, which extend outward into
      the ocean for three miles. These activities       shall also be discouraged in nearby
      offshore areas beyond the city's boundaries.
CO-20 Clam Beds
      The clam bed preserves within the City of Pismo Beach shall be protected.
                                                                                         CO-18
Pismo Creek/Price Canyon
(See Principle P-6)
Background
   Pismo Creek, an intermittent stream 5.5 miles in length, originates near the Community
of Edna in the San Luis Valley. The creek flows southerly via Price Canyon, bisects the city
and empties into the ocean south of the downtown area. The actual creek bed, which is dry
most of the year, is approximately 5 feet deep and 10 to 12 feet wide. The bottom is gravel
and sand-silt with some boulders in the slow moving portions of the stream. At high tide,
salt water flows into Pismo Creek for nearly a half mile upstream. During low tide, a sand
bar separates the mouth of the creek from the ocean, creating a small lagoon.
        Fish surveys in the 1970s determined that the creek contains species found in both
marine and fresh water habitats. Species included rainbow trout, speckled dace, prickly
scuplin, threespined stickleback, and brown bullhead. The tidewater goby, starry flounder,
jacksmelt, and white surfperch were found to inhabit the estuary at the mouth of the creek.
Other than resident and migratory waterfowl, little wildlife inhabits the creek side area south
of Highway 101, due to its developed character. North of the highway, various terrestrial
and bird species may be found, including deer, raccoons, opossums, rodents, reptiles and
amphibians.
        At Price Canyon, the streambed is well shaded by sycamores, oaks, willows, nettles
and poison hemlock. Steep hillsides of chaparral and oak woodland slope down to the lush
vegetation growing along the edges of the creek. Some of the vegetation has been cut back
in the area of the city's sew- age treatment plant. The creek's south bank, from west of the
railroad and U.S. Highway 101 crossing to the mouth of the creek, has been graded. Pismo
Creek provides habitat for two federally listed species, steelhead trout and the California
                                                                                        CO-19
red-legged frog. The existing creek, riparian, and estuary areas provide valuable habitat for
both protected and unprotected species. In order to accommodate the trout, a fish ladder
has been constructed south of the concrete railroad bridge crossing.
        Although the city owns small pockets of the creek and adjoining land, most of the
creek and Price Canyon is under private ownership and therefore is subject to development
pressure. Within the city limits, the creek's alignment has been altered by railroad and
freeway construction. Over a period of time nature has also changed the creek's alignment.
Impacts to the creek have been loss of habitat, pollution and siltation. Additionally, what
was once solid ground has been eroded. Property may be subject to inundation during
severe storms. The result has been additional berming, flood control improvements, and
some channeling of the creek.
        Price Canyon lies between the 101 Freeway and Highway 227, a distance of 4.5
miles. The valley varies in width between 200 - 2000 ft. It is edged on both sides by hills
rising to 500 - 600 ft. in elevation. Within the city limits the southern part of the valley is
developed with the PG&E facility and housing. The northern portion is undeveloped. Outside
the city limits the entire valley is undeveloped except for an extensive oil well facility near
the intersection of Price Canyon Road with Highway 227.
Policies
CO-21 Pismo Creek Protection
        Pismo Creek shall be retained in its natural state and protected from significant
        alterations. The following measures shall be employed to accomplish this intent:
        a.      Streamside Protection Zone--There shall be a minimum streamside
                protection zone to conserve the environmentally sensitive habitats of the
                creek. This buffer zone shall be measured from the outer          edge of the
                riparian vegetation or, where there is no riparian vegetation, from the top of
                the creek bank. The minimum width of the buffer shall be as follows:
                West Bank       100 feet/Cypress northward to City limits
                                 25 feet/Cypress to the ocean
                East Bank       100 feet/U.S. 101 northward to City limits
                                 50 feet/U.S. 101 to Dolliver Street
                                 25 feet/Dolliver to the ocean
                A lesser buffer may be permitted if: 1) the minimum widths set forth above
                would render a parcel inaccessible or unusable for the purpose designated in
                the land-use plan; or 2) there is a showing by an applicant through the
                resource assessment study identified in item "h" that a lesser buffer will not
                result in loss of, or adverse effects on, streamside vegetation or the biotic
                quality of the stream. Alternative mitigations shall be required where lesser
                buffers are authorized. No new construction or vegetation removal, except for
                normal maintenance, shall be allowed in the buffer zone with the exception of
                public roadways or bridges identified in the Circulation Element, paths, trails,
                fences, flood control structures, and other similar structures deemed not to
                adversely affect the creek.
        b.      Open Space--The sandpit and channel where Pismo Creek enters the ocean
                and those portions of parcels located within the creek channel shall remain as
                open space and no structures or fill shall be permitted thereon.
                                                                                           CO-20
      c.      Conservation Dedication--Any new development shall be required to
              dedicate as a condition of any discretionary approval, an easement for the
              protection of the streamside area consisting of 25 feet or more from the top
              of the creek bank. In addition, new development shall provide access
              amenities adjacent to the creek for the city to use as a greenbelt and/or
              recreation corridor.
      d.      Structures in the Stream Corridor--No structures shall be located within
              the stream corridor except: dams; structures necessary for flood control
              purposes; bridges, when supports can be located outside of critical habitat; a
              public pathway and pipelines, when no alternative route is feasible.
      e.      Limitations on Development--All development, including dredging, filling
              and grading, within the stream corridor shall be limited to activities necessary
              for flood control purposes, bridge construction, water supply projects, or lying
              of pipelines, when     no alternative route is feasible. When such activities
              require removal of riparian plant species, revegetation with local native plants
              shall be required. Minor clearing of vegetation shall be permitted for hiking
              and equestrian trails, bike trails, view points, etc.
      f.      Minimize Impacts All permitted construction and grading within stream
              corridors shall be carried out in such a manner as to minimize impacts from
              increased runoff, sedimentation, biochemical degradation, or thermal
              pollution.
      g.      Channeling--No concrete channeling or other major creek alteration shall be
              permitted, unless no viable alternative exists.
      h.      Resource Protection Plan-A Resource Assessment and Protection Plan shall
              be required and approved concurrent with city action on projects located on
              parcels which have a portion within the streamside protection zone. The plan
              shall include appropriate measures to protect the creeks biological and visual
              aspects.
CO-22 Price Canyon Open Space and Study Area
      Any development in Price Canyon and the surrounding hills shall emphasize the open
      space aspects of the Price Canyon corridor. Preferred views from Price Canyon Road
      shall be of open space rather than development.
      Pismo Beach, in cooperation with San Luis Obispo County and affected property
      owners, shall prepare a visual and open space study for the Price Canyon corridor as
                                                                                         CO-21
illustrated in Figure CO-2. This plan shall focus on retaining the corridor as a scenic
entrance to Pismo Beach and an open space corridor separating Pismo Beach from
the Route 227 corridor. See related policies:

       Based on the City’s priority to preserve watershed and water resources, riparian
       areas, and scenic and natural resources, the following standards shall apply to lands
       designated as Watershed and Resource Management. These standards shall apply to
       the biotic resources management plan required by Policy CO-14 for protection of
       riparian habitat.
       a. Setbacks from waterways.
           All structures and development including but not limited to residences, patios and
           porches, garages, storage areas and structures, motor vehicle, mobile home and
           recreational vehicle parking areas, roads and driveways, studios and workshops,
           public and private recreational facilities, paved areas including equestrian,
           walking and biking trails, walls, barns and fences shall be located at least one
           hundred fifty (150) feet or more from the boundary of any wetland and/or from
           the top of all stream banks.
       b. Restrictions on structures in a Stream Corridor.
           No structures shall be located within a stream corridor except dams, structures
           necessary for flood control purposes, bridges when supports can be located
           outside of critical habitat, unpaved pathways, and pipelines. These exceptions
           apply only when it is demonstrated that no alternative is possible.
       c. Restrictions on activities in stream corridors.
           All development, including dredging, filling and grading, within a stream corridor
           shall be limited to activities necessary for flood control purposes, bridge
           construction, water supply projects, improvement of fish or wildlife habitat, or
           laying of pipelines, when no alternative route is available or possible. When such
           activities require removal of riparian plant species, revegetation with local native
           plants shall be required.
       d. Prohibition against barriers to fish passage.
           Development and structures allowed in a stream corridor under b. and c. above
           shall not obstruct fish passage or create a fish barrier.
       e. Setbacks from sensitive habitat areas.
           Except under the circumstances listed in b. and c. above, all structures and
           development as list in b. above, and all subdivision, removal of natural
           vegetation, and grading are prohibited within sensitive habitats and shall be
           located at least one hundred (100) feet from the outside boundary of any and all
           sensitive habitat areas including but not limited to riparian habitat areas. For the
           purposes of the Watershed and Resource Management land use designation,
           sensitive habitat means any riparian area and any other area in which plant or
           animal life are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or
           role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human
           activities and developments.
       f.  Location of wetlands, waterways and sensitive habitats.
           All plans and maps including but not limited to development plans, building plans,
           grading plans, and subdivision and vesting tentative maps must show the precise
           location of all wetlands, all waterways and all sensitive habitats on the parcel and
           the required setbacks in those areas.
                                                                                         CO-23

Pismo Marsh
Background
        Pismo Marsh, also known as Pismo Lake Ecological Preserve, is primarily a fresh
water marsh with associated riparian habitat. However, an unusual area of salt marsh
vegetation exists in the southwest portion of the preserve. The elevation of the preserve
ranges from near sea level to approximately 32 feet. The 54acre marsh is entirely within the
Pismo Beach city limits and is presently under the ownership and management of the
California Department of Fish and Game. The preserve's management does not presently
allow any interpretive, educational or passive recreational access to the marsh. Since the
preserve is completely surrounded by privately owned land within both Pismo Beach and
Grover City limits, the state has no authority over adjacent land uses.
        The marsh's configuration has changed over the years. Its original water source,
Pismo Creek, no longer feeds it. Meadow Creek, with a drainage basin of over 3800 acres, is
now the primary source of water. Although the marsh is not entirely natural, it is an
extremely valuable resource. The diverse plant communities provide excellent habitat for a
wide range of wildlife species. The California Department of Fish and Game has estimated
that as many as 59 species of birds, 24 species of mammals and four species of reptiles and
amphibians may be found in the relatively undisturbed lake habitats. Therefore, it plays an
extremely important role as habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. It also provides a vital link
in the Pacific Flyway used by numerous species of migratory birds.
        Development has occurred nearby and contiguous to the marsh resulting in direct
impacts to the marsh. Increased runoff, erosion, sedimentation and disturbance to the
habitat areas have occurred. The most damaging to the preserve is increased
sedimentation. This decreases open water areas and circulation necessary to support marsh
vegetation and migratory birds. Pesticides and other toxic substances, nutrient- laden
agricultural runoff, and urban wastewater could also constitute problems in maintaining
water quality and wildlife habitat. Commercial and residential developments adjacent to the
marsh have turned their backs to it rather than recognize it as an important visual and open
space asset.
Policies
CO-23 Marsh Protection Program (Buffer Zone)
        Pismo Marsh shall be retained in its natural state and protected from significant
        alteration. The City shall encourage the development of a resource protection
        program for Pismo Marsh in coordination with the state Department of Fish and
        Game and Grover City. As a protection mechanism, the City shall require a 100-foot
        buffer between the environmentally sensitive areas and new development. All buffers
        shall be measured from the landward most edge of the riparian vegetation or where
        there is no riparian vegetation, from the top of the marsh bank. Within the buffer, no
        structures, diking, filling, or dredging shall be permitted below the 45' contour,
        except structures required for flood control or the protection of public health and
        safety. Lesser buffers may be permitted if the minimum marsh buffer standards set
        forth above cannot be achieved because the small size or irregular shape of the
        existing parcels proposed to be developed would render such parcels inaccessible or
        unusable for the purposes for which they are designated in the City's certified Local
        Coastal Plan. Reductions in the proposed minimum marsh buffer standards shall be
                                                                                          CO-24
      based upon the criteria for establishing buffer areas contained in "Statewide
      Interpretive Guidelines for Wetland and Other Wet Environmentally Sensitive Habitat
      Areas" adopted by the State Coastal Commission on February 4, 1981. These criteria
      include:
      1.       Susceptibility of the parcel to erosion;
      2.       Use of natural topographic features to locate development;
      3.       Use of existing cultural features to locate buffer zones;
      4.       Lot configuration and location of existing development; and
      5.       Type and scale of development proposed. Any reduction in the minimum
               buffer width shall include alternative mitigations (such as planting of
               appropriate vegetation or design modifications) to alleviate potential impacts
               stemming from the reduced buffer width (such as increased noise, light or
               sedimentation) to protect adjacent riparian vegetation and creek channels.
               Development al- lowed in the buffer areas shall be limited to access paths,
               fences necessary to protect habitat areas, and similar uses which have either
               beneficial effects on wildlife or no significant adverse effects. No principal
               structures (whether attached or detached) shall be permitted.
CO-24 Visual and Interpretive Access
      The unique ecological system of Pismo Marsh needs to be made available to the
      community as a whole. Since protection of the habitat is the primary concern of the
      Department of Fish and Game, physical access to the preserve has generally been
      prohibited by the state. Therefore it is essential to make the marsh available visually.
      Private developments adjacent to the marsh shall use it as a key visual and open
      space feature of the development. Pedestrian spaces shall be oriented to the marsh
      and view corridors to the marsh provided. Additionally the state Department of Fish
      and Game, in cooperation with Pismo Beach and Grover City, shall be encouraged to
      develop the potential of Pismo Marsh as an educational and passive recreational
      resource.
CO-25 Development Adjacent to the Marsh Buffer
      New development adjacent to the marsh, but above the 45 ft. contour, shall be
      limited to compatible uses that will not result in adverse impacts such as additional
      sediment, runoff, and other disturbances.
CO-26 Watershed Protection
      Runoff from any new development projects within the Meadow Creek watershed,
      which drains to the marsh, shall be evaluated with a hydrology report to determine if
      its runoff exceeds the existing volume rate of flow or suspended solids content.
      Existing rates should not be exceeded unless restoration plans are developed. The
      utilization of permeable ground materials to the greatest extent possible is
      encouraged as one method of limiting increased runoff. Erosion control measures,
      such as distillation basins and energy dissipaters, shall be incorporated within any
      grading plan as necessary.
CO-27 Department of Fish and Game
                                                                                           CO-25
        The City shall consult with the California Department of Fish and Game with regards
        to projects design and mitigation measures when a private development could
        potentially affect the marsh. See related polities:

Soils and Drainage
Background
        Pismo Beach's development patterns have been strongly influenced by its physical
geography.
        Soil, the combination of weathered minerals and decaying organic material, covers
the earth in a thin layer. Soil is affected by both natural and human actions. Urban
development often increases soil loss through removal of protective vegetation. Paved
surfaces can create excessive runoff. Structures can cause the surface and subsurface
materials to become compacted, thereby reducing permeability of the soil and decreasing its
saturation potential.
        There are no prime soils or agricultural production within the current city limits.
Within the proposed sphere of influence there are two small areas of class II soils totaling
25 acres.
        The runoff of surface water and the land's drainage pat- tern, also play important
roles in soil erosion and in supporting various plant and animal communities. The principal
water features in Pismo Beach, Pismo Creek, Pismo Marsh, and the Pacific Ocean have all
been discussed within this chapter. Secondary features include the valleys of the coastal
foothills and their intermittent streambeds.
Policies
CO-28 Natural Drainage Channels
        Drainage channels shall remain in a natural open space state with minimal or no use
        of concrete channels. Dredging, filling and grading within stream corridors shall be
        limited to activities necessary for flood control purposes, bridge construction, water
        supply projects, or laying of pipelines when no alternative route is feasible.
        Revegetation and restoration of the natural setting shall be required.
        Alteration of existing drainage patterns shall be prohibited unless special studies
        prove that the proposed alteration will not cause any adverse impacts down- stream
        or to other aspects of the environment. Prior to approval of any new development, a
        detailed analysis of surface water runoff patterns shall be undertaken to determine
        storm drain needs and identify mitigations for any with possible adverse
        environmental impacts. No runoff that will negatively affect the Pismo Marsh shall be
        permitted.
CO-29 Mining
        Mineral resources of commercial value are not known to exist within the city. Mining
        and removal of materials (sand, gravel, and other minerals) for commercial use shall
        be prohibited.
                                                                                          CO-26
Design Element
Amended:
CC Resolution 2004-052
CC Resolution 2011-072
Background
           The Design Element is an optional general plan topic under the state planning law. In addition to
analyzing broad community wide design features, the Element also is important for state Scenic
Highways and for protection of scenic and visual qualities of the city as required by the Coastal Act of
1976.
           In a recently published guide to the nation's most attractive and "livable" non urban counties, San
Luis Obispo County and the quality of its small town life is rated at the top of the list.' Such a rating may
not come as a surprise to longtime county residents or to the newcomers who have recently retreated to
the area from the congestion of California's large cities. It is, however, an indication of the national
importance placed on the scenic, small-town qualities of California's Central Coast.
           For both residents and visitors, the aesthetic encounter with the landscape of the Central Coast is
presented along the corridors of the principal roadways, and is complemented by the sense of scale and
"fit" of the townscapes within this rural environment. In the Pismo Beach area, the two scenic corridors
that interact both with the town and the natural backdrop of open space are U.S. 101 and Price Canyon
Road.
                                                                                                            D-1
         U.S. 101 sweeps westward from the inland valleys of the coast range and reveals to the freeway
traveler a splendid, if brief, view of the coastline a view the roadway has with-held from the traveler for
many miles, the only ocean view between the Golden Gate Bridge and Gaviota, a distance of 310 miles.
         This highway is commonly known as "El Camino Real". It is one of the major scenic highways in
the United States; the scenic qualities are among the best in the world. The highway dominates the City
of Pismo Beach, and it is precisely the spectacular qualities of the U.S. 101 corridor along the central
spine of the community that gives the city a special identity and defines its sense of place. The scenic
views provided are the Pacific Ocean and shoreline on one side, the Santa Lucia Range (Pismo Hills) on
the other, plus the corridor view of the highway itself. It is estimated that 55,000 cars per day traveled this
route in 1990.
         Price Canyon Road winds through an opening in the Santa Lucia Mountains and presents the city
of Pismo Beach and the ocean as its final destination. It is a scenic entrance to the city and is one of the
best examples of a rural scenic road in the county.
         The sensitive management of the Pismo Beach landscape is the focus of the Design Element: the
preservation of the steep mountain backdrop that forms the abrupt east wall of the U.S. 101 corridor; the
rural transition along Price Canyon from the more developed San Luis Obispo valley area to the town and
the coast; the openness of the view lines and the framing of those views; the attention to the details of the
built environment, and, of course, the ocean.
         The Design Element sets policies for the city under the following topics:
         Building and Site Design                     Signs
         Colors                                       Special Design Studies
         Historic Buildings                           Streets
         Landscaping                                  Utilities
         Lighting                                     View Corridors
         Scenic Highways
Principles
P-7      Visual Quality is Important
         The visual quality of the city's environment shall be preserved and enhanced for the aesthetic
         enjoyment of both residents and visitors and the economic well being of the community.
         Development of neighborhoods, streets and individual properties should be pleasing to the eye,
         rich in variety, and harmonious with existing development. The feeling of being near the sea
         should be emphasized even when it is not visible. Designs reflective of a traditional California
         seaside community should be encouraged.
Policies
Building and Site Design Policies
D-1      Creative Site Planning
         In order to allow for creative site planning, the city Zoning Ordinance may allow modification of all
         dimensional requirements except for density and size of parking spaces. Minimum access
         standards for emergency vehicles shall be maintained at all times. Within particular specific plan
         areas, all dimensional requirements may be modified. Specific criteria and findings shall be
         developed for when these modifications would be permitted. See related policy:
                           Land Use Element           LU-H-4       Residential Guidelines
                                                                                                           D-2
D-2     Building and Site Design Criteria
        a.      Small Scale
                New development should be designed to reflect the small-scale image of the city rather
                than create large monolithic buildings. Apartment, condominium and hotel buildings
                should preferably be contained in several smaller massed buildings rather than one
                large building. Building mass and building surfaces such as roofs and exterior walls shall
                be highly articulated to maintain a rich visual texture and an intimate building scale.
                Maximum height, setback, and site coverage standards to achieve the desired small-
                scale character will be regulated by City ordinance. Except where specified otherwise by
                this Plan or further limited by the implementing ordinance, the maximum height
                standard for new buildings shall not be more than 25 feet above existing natural grade in
                Neighborhood Planning Areas A through J, and Q; and not more than 35 feet above
                existing natural grade in the remaining portions of the Coastal Zone.
        b.      Entrances
                To residential buildings, to individual dwelling units within the building, and to commercial
                structures should be readily identifiable from the street, parking area, or semipublic areas
                and designed to be of a pedestrian scale.
        c.      Views
                Views to the ocean, creeks, marsh, and surrounding hills should be preserved and
                enhanced whenever possible. The feeling of being near the sea should be emphasized,
                even when it is not visible.
        d.      All Facades
                Architectural features shall be consistent throughout a development, even when a portion
                of the development is hidden from public view.
        e.      Walls
                Project perimeter walls should complement surrounding architecture and neighborhood
                environment and should avoid monotony by utilizing elements of horizontal and vertical
                articulation.
        f.      Driveway Widths
                         Driveway widths shall be kept narrow in order to retain a pedestrian street scale.
                                                                                                         1
                Minimum and maximum driveway widths shall be as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance .

        g.      Support Structures
                The city shall establish guidelines for architectural review of the appearance of support
                structures allowable for homes jutting over steep slopes.
D-3     Subdivision Design Criteria
        a.      Pedestrian Paths
                Pedestrian paths that connect to the public pedestrian systems shall be required in all
                developments and dearly delineated with signage compatible with surrounding
                development.

  Amendment finally approved (accepting Coastal Commission modifications) by the City Council 9/7/04:
City Council Resolution R 2004-052
                                                                                                         D-3
    b.       Views Through the Site
             Projects should be designed to preserve some of the significant views enjoyed by
             residents of nearby properties, which could be blocked by the project. Especially on
             larger sites, clustering the buildings or creating new public viewpoints can preserve
             portions of these views.
    c.       One Story/Two Story
             In subdivisions care should be exercised in how one story and two story houses are
             related. For example, developers should not build single story houses on every other lot
             to be later in-filled with two story houses.
    d.       New Residential Tracts
             In new residential tracts, developers should be encouraged to sell a scattering of lots to
             individual builders to provide more variety in the development. The City may require such
             conditions as part
             of a Specific Plan or a tentative map approval.
    e.       Hillside Subdivisions and Related Roads
             Subdivisions in hillside areas shall be designed subject to the following criteria:
                   compatibility with the natural terrain
                   minimizing highly visible road cuts
                   preservation of existing natural features, such as trees, native vegetation,
                        ridgelines, and drainage courses
                   minimizing grading and alterations of natural landforms

D-4 Multifamily Residential Design Criteria
    The city shall develop specific design guidelines for multifamily residential projects. The objective
    of such guidelines is to ensure that the residential streetscape is animated by the presence of
    dwellings and pedestrian activity, and does not become a lifeless procession of blank walls,
    parking lots, parking garages, drive- ways and garage doors. The goal is a pedestrian friendly
    environment that diminishes the impact of the automobile.
    Criteria and direction for these guidelines shall be as follows:
    a.       Unit's Relation to Street
             Generally the street frontage should consist of residential units with windows, doors,
             balconies and porches facing and in reasonably dose proximity to the street, both in
             terms of height (i.e., units at street level, rather than raised) and in distance from the
             street (minimum set back). This type of orientation reinforces the traditional beach, active
             street environment and also increases street safety with "eyes" on the street. Whenever
             possible street level frontage should consist of residential units rather than parking lots or
             parking structures.
    b.       Architectural Elements
                                                                                                        D-4

               Architectural elements such as porches, bay windows, balconies, entrances and windows
               all signal human habitation and are essential ingredients in creating street-level interest
               and human scale and shall be required in new developments on all stories.
     c.        Building Articulation
               Building surfaces shall be articulated by creating changes in plane or height or shape to
               break down the bulk and scale of larger building masses and create a respectful
               transition between the existing neighborhood context and the new structure. Offsets
               should be meaningful in relation to the size of the building and shall normally not be less
               than 2 feet. Street facades limited to two stories shall be required where such a limit
               reinforces the existing neighborhood character. Upper stories, when allowed, should be
               set back from the front facade of the lower story.
     d.        Utilities
               Utilities such as gas meters, electrical meters and panels, fire control panels, telephone,
               CATV panels, and similar devices shall normally be screened from conspicuous public
               view in a manner, which does not conflict with city and safety regulations. Mechanical
               equipment, tanks, ducts, elevator enclosures, cooling towers, or mechanical ventilators
               shall be contained within an enclosed pent- house or other portion of a building having
               walls and roofs with construction and appearance similar to the main building.
     e.        Trash Areas
               Trash areas shall normally be screened from public view on all sides by a six-foot solid
               wall or fence and shall normally not be located in the front yard. A chain link fence with
               slats does not qualify as a solid fence. Trash areas shall be surrounded by
               complementary landscaping. See related policies:
                         Land Use Element          LU-H-4            Residential Guidelines

Colors Policies
D-5  Utilities and Fences
     Utility structures such as water tanks and poles and safety fences such as chain link shall be
     painted dark earth tone colors with a light reflective value of less than 40% in order to blend into
     the landscape. White, blue, green and similar colors often chosen shall not be used. The City
     shall request the oil company in Avila to paint the large oil storage tanks a more appropriate color.

      The City shall review and amend, as appropriate, its comprehensive street tree-planting program.
      Whenever feasible, street trees shall be located adjacent to the curb with the sidewalk between
      the trees and the buildings. This provides a pedestrian scale to the street and creates a
      psychologically safe and pleasant walking area. Specific areas in the city that need street trees
      include:
               Land Use Element          LU-L-5                      Trees

     Street rights-of-way outside the curb line and front yards shall not be paved except for driveways
     or parking spaces officially approved by the City. The City shall not approve parallel parking that
     is outside      the normal area needed for travel ways and related street parking. Examples
     include:
              Circulation Element         C-14                     Parking
              Land Use Element            LU-H-7                   Street and Front Yard Paving
              Land Use Element            LU-J-8                   Street and Front Yard Paving
D-16 Tree Maintenance
     A Landscaping Program for each new subdivision and commercial development shall be
     required. The program shall include the maintenance of mature trees and conditions for their
     removal. The City shall require adherence to good landscaping practice; that is, consider
     compatibility with soils, climatic conditions, topography, existing developments, appearance and
     maintenance as well as resistance to disease, shape, life span, availability and height in relation
     to scenic obstruction.
                                                                                                      D-7
D-17  Native and Drought Tolerant Landscaping
      Native and drought tolerant landscaping with drip irrigation shall be required within all new and
      rehabilitated development requiring discretionary approval in conformance to city water
      conservation policies.
D-18  View Corridor Protection
      Trees should be planted in locations that frame but do not block important view corridors, such as
      views to the ocean. Trees shall be shown on landscaping plans and for new developments
      subject to city review and approval. In view corridors and on bluff-top lots, tree species should be
      limited to low-growing canopies that will not impair views from nearby properties. (See related
      Policy D-39, 40 & 41 under View Corridors.)
D-19  Special Landscape Areas
      A number of areas in the city lend themselves to special street tree treatment or themes. These
      include:
      a.       Oak Park Boulevard
               Oak Park Boulevard is the dividing line between Pismo Beach and Arroyo Grande and
               also serves as the southern entry to the city. A distinctive row of trees should be planted
               on the Pismo Beach side of the boulevard to announce the start of Pismo Beach and
               serve as a ceremonial entry point. Trees should be tall, and 35 ft. on center. For the most
               dramatic effects the trees should be tall and narrow. Possible species to be studied
               include Monterey cypress and Canary Island pine.
      b.       Shell Beach Road Shell Beach Road connects many of the city's neighborhoods and is
               an important visual spine. The heavy use of Monterey cypress trees has already created
               a distinctive corridor. Care should be taken in the street tree program to not block views
               of the ocean.
      c.       Downtown
               Streets within downtown should have a carefully planned street tree program. Particular
               attention should be given to Price Street, Dolliver Street and Pomeroy Street.
D-20  Special Landscape Features
      Special landscape features shall be preserved including but not limited to:
      a.       The large rock in the 101 Freeway center divide.
                        Circulation Element      C-2               U.S. 101 Freeway
      b.       Rock formations in the Judkins School and Boosinger Park areas.
      c.       Dinosaur Caves.
                        Parks, Rec & Access      PR-20             Boosinger Park
D-21  City Entryways
      A landscape plan shall be developed for all city entryways as shown in figure D-l, Entrance Sign
      Locations.
Lighting Policies
D-22  Pedestrian Scale Street Lights
      Pedestrian-scaled streetlights shall be used throughout the community in new developments
      except for safety lighting used for intersection lighting. The City shall also consider a program of
                                                                                                        D-8
     assessment districts to retrofit existing neighborhoods with pedestrian scaled streetlights.
     Examples include:

Scenic Highways Policies
D-23 U.S. 101 Freeway
     The U.S. 101 Freeway, also known as E1 Camino Real, is hereby designated as a Pismo Beach
     scenic highway. The portion of this highway within Pismo Beach provides travelers with the only
     ocean view between the       Golden Gate Bridge (San Francisco) and Gaviota, a distance of over
     300 miles. The scenic views include the City and ocean on one side and the Pismo Foothills on
     the other. To implement this policy the City shall:
     a.      Request CALTRANS to designate the U.S. 101 Freeway as a state Scenic Highway.
     b.      Request San Luis Obispo County to designate the U.S. 101 Freeway as a County Scenic
             Highway.
     c.      Require design review of all projects within 200 feet of the edge of the CALTRANS right-
             of-way for their visual qualities as seen from the road.
     d.      Require that new commercial signs, sound walls and other new developments be
             modified in height, size, location or design so that existing "blue water' ocean views from
             U.S. Highway 101 will not be blocked, reduced or degraded; the same policy shall also
             apply with respect to existing open views from U.S. Highway 101 to the scenic upper
             slopes, generally above the 200 ft. contour, which provide the visual backdrop for the
             City. Exceptions will be allowed only for 1) residential or visitor serving commercial
             structures where no other use of the property is feasible, and 2) signs, utility structures
             and public buildings where there is no feasible alternative and all appropriate miti-
             gation measure are applied to minimize adverse visual impacts.
     e.      Review proposals for new landscaping within or along the highway right-of-way to insure
             that these ocean and hillside views will not be blocked by the proposed plantings.
     f.      Require that new structures shall not be placed on ridgelines or slope breaks where they
             would profile against the sky, as seen from U.S. Highway 101; and that cut slopes, fill
             slopes, paving and structural development on hillsides in excess of 30% slope will not be
             allowed in public views from the highway.

D-24 Price Canyon Road
     Price Canyon Road for a distance of 4.7 miles from the intersections with Highway 227 to U.S.
     101 is hereby designated as a Pismo Beach scenic highway. Price Canyon Road is a scenic
     entryway to Pismo Beach from the interior of San Luis Obispo County. Scenic views consist of
     steeply sloped hillsides with oak woodland and streamside riparian vegetation. Its character is
     derived from the undeveloped rural nature of the canyon that it traverses. To implement this
     policy the City shall:
     a.       Request San Luis Obispo County to designate Price Canyon Road as a County Scenic
              Highway.
     b.       Conduct a special design study of this corridor (see Conservation Element CO-22, Price

D-25 State Highway 1/Dolliver Street
     State Highway 1/Dolliver is hereby designated as a Pismo Beach Scenic Highway. State Highway
     1 is a scenic entryway to Pismo Beach from the south accessing the butterfly habitat, the State
     North Beach Campground and numerous private campgrounds and RV Parks. Its character is
     derived from the large eucalyptus trees and recreation environment. The street becomes urban
     as it enters downtown but retains a visitor’s destination and recreation impression. To implement
     this policy the City shall:
     a.       Request CALTRANS to designate State Highway 1/Dolliver Street as a State Scenic
              Highway.
     b.       Request San Luis Obispo County to designate State Highway 1/Dolliver Street as a
              County Scenic Highway.

     d.       Require design review for development on all properties abutting the road right-of-way.
D-26 Shell Beach Road
     Shell Beach Road is hereby designated as a Pismo Beach Scenic Highway. Shell Beach Road is
     the scenic road that ties together much of Pismo Beach. Its character is derived from the views of
     the ocean on one side and the foothills on the other. To implement this policy the City shall:
     a.       Conduct a special design study of this corridor.
     b.       Require design review for development on all properties abutting the road right-of-way.
                                                                                                    D-10

D-27 Ocean Boulevard
     Ocean Boulevard is hereby designated as a Pismo Beach Scenic Highway. Ocean Boulevard is
     one of the few streets along the coast that closely parallels the top of the ocean bluffs. Its
     character is derived from the dramatic views and dose proximity of the street to the ocean and
     coastal bluffs. To implement this policy the City shall:
     a. Conduct a special design study of this corridor.
     b. Require design review for development on all properties abutting the road right-of-way.
D-28 Visual Quality
     Any new development along city-designated scenic highways should meet the following criteria:
     a.      Development should not significantly obscure, detract from nor diminish the scenic quality
             of the highway. In those areas where design review is required, or the protection of public
             views as seen from U.S. Highway 101 is an issue or concern, the City shah require by
             ordinance a site specific visual analysis. Such analysis shall utilize story poles, photo
             montages, or other techniques as deemed appropriate in order to determine expected
             visual impacts, prior to approval of new development; documentation shall be retained for
             evaluation of permit conformance.
     b.      Development in the foothills area shall seek to maximize scenic values, paying special
             attention to minimizing erosion hazards. Holding of designated buildable areas in open
             space shall be en-          couraged through bonuses and transfer densities.
     c.      The City shall adopt a comprehensive grading ordinance to reflect the scenic highway
             necessities.
     d.      The existing city setback and height regulations are necessary for the protection and

View Corridors Policies
D-38 Side Yard View Corridors
     Where side yards provide a view from the street to the ocean or a view to attractive hills and
     valleys, the side yards should be maintained as open visual access corridors the width of the
     required side yard setback. These areas shall be open to the sky and free from all visual
     obstructions including trees and shrubs (except for a see through gate or fence) from the front
     property line to the rear property line. Design review shall be required to implement this
     recommendation. Existing structures are exempted from this policy. Examples include:

D-39 Focal Point Sites
     Properties at the end of streets, “T" intersections and street bends often present unusual design
     opportunities and visual impacts on the communities due to their unique locations (see Figure D-
                                                                                                           D-14

D-40   Street Layouts
       New streets shall be laid out so as to emphasize views. In many cases this means streets should
       be perpendicular to the view as shown in Figure D-4. For example, streets perpendicular to the
       ocean should be open at the end toward the ocean and not blocked with landscaping or buildings.

       Figure D-3 maps areas of the city where special concern for urban design is necessary. These
       sites and features shall be included in the Zoning Ordinance, Architectural Review Overlay Zone.
       Categories of concern include:
       a.      Focal Point Sites (See Policy D-39)
               These sites are generally at ends of streets or where Streets curve.
       b.      Special Design Considerations
               These sites are similar to focal point sites but tend to be linear in nature.
       c.      Street Ends
               New buildings or structures on parcels at these street ends shall be sited so as to not
               block views, or to minimize view impairment when no feasible siting alternative exists.
D-42   Scenic Views Adjacent to the City
       The City shall encourage the County to retain the Ontario Hill and the hillsides adjacent to
       Highway 101 and Price Canyon Road as open space or grazing land and prohibit development
       on slopes over 30%.
                                                                                                     D-15

Facilities and Services Element
Introduction
          The manner in which public facilities and services are provided in California jurisdictions, as well
as the manner in which these are funded, has changed considerably in the past few years. Both
population growth and technological changes have required a more regional approach to the planning
and provision of some facilities and services that were once the exclusive concern of municipalities. At
the same time, fiscal constraints and legislative actions have shifted funding methods from a reliance on
the general obligations of taxpayers to greater emphasis on individual development to "pay its own way."
The Facilities and Services Element is a guideline to indicate future needs as the city continues to
develop; funding to meet these needs will come from a variety of sources that must be considered in the
capital improvement planning process and the annual budget process. The Element is linked to the
Growth Management Element, which correlates facility and service needs with projected population and
visitor growth and the annexation of areas in the sphere of influence.
          The need for public facilities and services of the dry are greatly affected by the intermittent
presence of a transient population. The city's Vertex Cost Allocation Study estimates an average dally
tourist population in the city at 3,265 (2 persons per hotel unit, 56% occupancy rate). However, this is only
an average. The occupancy rate can be as high as 90% during summer months. Day visitors can bring
total population in the city to 20,000 - 30,000 people during summer weekends and special events. Given
the highly fluctuating nature of the visitor population, both the design of facilities as well as the level of
staffing must be flexible in order to respond to the variations in demand.
          During the summer of 1988, the City of Pismo Beach established a strategic planning process to
identify issues resulting from growth of both the resident population and the tourist industry. This strategic
planning process entails an ongoing review of departmental needs and achievements, and a goal-setting
process for each of the various city services. Strategic planning workshops provide a forum for discussion
with the City Council and the public in which staffing and capital facility requirements can be evaluated in
terms of available and proposed funding sources. The strategic planning process has become the context
for setting the five-year Capital Improvement Program and the annual budget expenditures. The Facilities
and Services Element of the General Plan provides a long-term policy framework within which
incremental facility, equipment, staffing and service needs can be structured.
          Along with the initiation of the strategic planning process, the city also completed studies of the
direct and indirect ser- vice costs of the various city departments. As a result, certain city departments
have revised, and in some cases initiated, user fees for more efficient cost recovery for services. A study
of impact fees to meet the service needs created by new development is to be completed in 1992. The
impact study will bring the city into conformance with recent state legislation (AB 1600), which requires
the city to demonstrate the connection between an impact fee and the cost of facilities that will serve new
development.
          In the following discussion, not all services and facilities are under the direct control of the
municipal government; however, the policy commitments of the city greatly affect the ability of other
                                                                                                      F-2
agencies to provide appropriate levels of ser- vice to Pismo Beach residents and visitors. Circulation and
recreational facilities are not included in this element since they are discussed in the Circulation Element
and the Parks, Recreation and Coastal Access Element. Topics are arranged alphabetically and each
section contains background and policies. Topics are:
                  City Administrative                Schools
                      Services - City Hall           Solid Waste
                  Fire Services                      Wastewater Services
                  Library Services                   Water Services
                  Police Services
Principles
P-8     Facilities Concurrent With Need
        The City shall ensure that public facilities are available to adequately serve all new and existing
        development concurrently with new construction. For existing facilities requiring upgrading and/or
        replacement, the City shall plan for adequate funding of these improvements to preclude
        interruptions or deterioration of service that may imperil the health and welfare of the residents
        and visitors to Pismo Beach.
General Policies
F-1     Equity of User Fee Structures
        The City shall emphasize a balance of revenues to costs for user fee programs that fund the
        maintenance of facilities and the provision of services, while considering the equity between
        ability to pay in relation to benefits received.
F-2     Impact Fees Required
        The City shall establish impact fee programs to the extent that a nexus can be demonstrated
        between the cost of providing a facility or service and the needs created by new development.
F-3     Cost Recovery
        The City shall review annual updates of the Vertex cost recovery studies to determine appropriate
        user fee levels for city facilities and services, including pro-ration of city-wide overhead costs
        where feasible. Overhead pro-rations, including those for special assessment districts, will be
        used to reimburse General Fund expenditures.
                                                                                                   F-3
F-4       Capital Improvement Planning
          In order to effectively plan and budget for needed facilities and the upgrade of service
          deficiencies, the City shall update the five-year Capital Improvement Plan annually.
F-5       Public Facility Locations
          Public utilities and public works facilities, which are not dependent on the ocean, shall be located
          away from the oceanfront. These facilities should be screened from public view and shall be
          designed in a manner that is compatible with the surrounding landforms.
City Administrative Services--City Hall
Background
          Perhaps the most "visible" public facility in Pismo Beach is the city hall--the focus of contact
between the residents of the city and the local government.
          The city hall was built as a school in the 1920's and was purchased from the school district for
use by the city when the building was condemned for use as a school after the November, 1952
earthquake. The building houses the city administrative offices, council chambers, the Finance, City
Clerk, Community Development (including Planning, Building, Recreation and Redevelopment), Public
Works, Fire and Police Departments. The main fire station is on adjoining property.
          The building is constructed of un-reinforced masonry and is potentially hazardous in the event of
another earthquake. In addition to the danger to people in and around the building from structural failure,
of particular concern is the potential disruption of the city's emergency communication system, housed in
the police dispatch center, and the telemetry connections, which operate the water and sewer systems.
          State law (SB 547) requires that by 1993 the city hall should both be strengthened and brought
up to code, or it should be demolished.
          In addition to the safety problems of city hall, the building is too small to adequately
accommodate the existing and anticipated space needs of the various departments. At the present time
several alternatives for building safety and expanding space needs are being considered:
     •    Renovation of the existing structure to bring it up to code.
     •    Renovation of all or a portion of the structure and the addition of new office space.
     •    Demolition of the structure and construction of a new city hall either on the same site or
          elsewhere in the city.
          A citizen's review committee has analyzed these alternatives and evaluated future space needs
and building costs. The committee's recommendation is to build an entirely new city hall on the present
site; the existing fire station would remain. The proposed structure would contain about 28,500 square
feet.
          In conformance with the notice issued under the Pismo Beach Municipal Code, final decision on
retrofitting or new construction of the city hall must be made by 1992. A variety of financing alternatives
are possible such as: a possible state grant of up to $750,000 from Prop. 122 funds, which have been
appropriated for retrofitting public buildings or new construction if retrofitting is not feasible; the sale of
certificates of participation; and impact fees.
Policies
F-6       State Funding
          The City shall make application to the state for grant funds set aside through Proposition 122 for
          retrofitting, or if appropriate, new construction of the city hall.
F-7       Impact Fees
          The City shall consider the establishment of an impact fee to reimburse the city for the benefit of
          city hall to new development.
                                                                                                       F-4

Fire Services
Background
         The Pismo Beach Fire Department is a combination full-time and paid call (volunteer) system.
The authorized staffing of 37 includes 7 full time and 30 part time positions. The part time positions are
limited to less than 1000 hours per year.
         The department provides a wide range of programs, which include fire suppression, emergency
medical services, training disaster preparedness, fire prevention, weed abatement, cliff and ocean
rescue, and hazardous materials response. In addition, the fire department runs a seasonal lifeguard
program from May through September.
         All fire department personnel have been trained as emergency medical technicians. In addition,
the department operates a semi-automatic defibrillation program, which requires specialized training.
About two thirds of the emergency requests the department receives annually are for emergency medical
services.
         As of 1992 department personnel are not authorized to transport victims. This service is provided
by Five Cities Ambulance, which transports patients to either Arroyo Grande Community Hospital or
hospitals in San Luis Obispo depending on the nature of the injury or illness. In 1992 the City was
considering a paramedic program, which would include transport of victims.
         The department maintains two fire stations: station one is located next to city hall and station two
is located on Shell Beach Road next to Seacliff Drive. A third site has been identified to service the
continuing development in the Oak Park area. This site is located at the junction of Ventana Drive and
James Way. Station construction is programmed in the Capital Improvement Plan for 1993-94. However,
the site will be reevaluated prior to construction to insure long-term use.
         The existing personnel are adequate to service the existing city areas at the current service level.
However, funding mechanisms will need to be established in annexation areas to provide funding for the
personnel and equipment to maintain the new and existing fire stations that will service these areas.
  Policies
F-8      Fire Prevention
         To prevent loss of life and property damage, the City will maintain fire prevention inspections and
         public education programs.
F-9      Water for Fire Suppression and Emergency Reserve
         The City will require all new development to provide water for fire protection by gravity flow with
         sufficient storage to meet I.S.O. requirements. The City will maintain a minimum two-day water
         supply in the city reservoir system for fire suppression and other emergency needs.
F-10     Response Time
         The City should maintain personnel, equipment and facilities to achieve a minimum four-minute
         response time 95 percent of the time on medical emergencies. The City should also maintain
         same for a minimum acceptable response time of five minutes 95 percent of the time for all other
         emergency service calls to all areas of the city.
F-11     Paramedic Program
         In order to meet the anticipated increase in demand for emergency medical services, the City
         shall consider the development of a paramedic program.
                                                                                                  F-5
F-12     New Developments/Impact Fees
         The City shall require all new development proposed in the city and annexing properties to pay
         fees for additional equipment and fixed facilities as needed to service the new development. In
         annexation areas the city will consider the need for additional fire stations, equipment and
         manpower. The City may also require the formation of fire protection districts to fund fire
         suppression and emergency medical services. Water facilities for fire suppression shall be in and
         serviceable prior to flammable construction.
 F-13 Employee Housing/Housing Subsidy
         In order to insure adequate paid-call personnel, the City will consider providing employee housing
         or a subsidy to those interested in service to the fire department. (See Housing Element Policy H-
         8, Equity Sharing.)
F-14     Fuel Clearance
         All structures shall have fuel cleared for a minimum of 30 feet in moderate to high hazard areas
         as may be specified by the Fire Department. Additional setbacks from property lines may be
         required in relation to severity of wild-land fire hazards.
Library Services
Background
         The City of Pismo Beach does not provide library services to city residents. This service is
provided by the San Luis Obispo City-County Library system, which presently maintains a small
neighborhood library (700 sq. ft., 4500 volumes) in the Shell Beach area. More extensive services are
provided Pismo Beach residents at the South County Regional Library, located in Arroyo Grande,
approximately five miles from Pismo Beach. The main library of the system is in the City of San Luis
Obispo, and provides a bookmobile and other out- reach services as well as a larger collection and more
extensive reference resources than are available at the South County branch.
         The San Luis Obispo City-County Library has completed a study of long-range facility needs.
Among the recommended actions regarding the most efficient provision of services to the county as a
whole are certain recommendations that would affect the residents of Pismo Beach. The study proposes
an enlargement of the South County Regional Library from its present size of 12,000 sq. ft. to 20,000 sq.
ft. by 1994. Concomitant with this proposal for expansion of the regional facility is a recommendation to
close the Shell Beach neighborhood library. However, no actual decision on this closure has been made.
Pismo Beach residents would be served only by the expanded South County facility, the bookmobile
service, and the main library in the City of San Luis Obispo.
         Since the provision of library services is not a function of the government of Pismo Beach,
derisions regarding the growth of the system are not issues to be covered directly in the city's General
Plan. However, the funding of the proposed system expansion may affect development within the city as
well as on properties being considered for annexation. Of the many forms of funding the improvements
(state bond monies, federal grants, a local capital improvement bond issue, a special sales tax levy)
development impact fees are one form under consideration.
Policies
F-15     Shell Beach Library
         The City shall encourage the San Luis Obispo City-County Library to continue operation of the
         Shell Beach neighborhood library.
F-16     Library Impact Fees
         The City shall assist the Library in the development of an impact fee program as the Library
         determines necessary to help meet the service needs arising from new development.
                                                                                                  F-6
Police Services
Background
          The demand for police services in Pismo Beach is determined not only by the needs of the
resident population, but by the exceptional circumstances created by the presence of a large fluctuating
transient population. This transient population consists of both overnight visitors residing in the hotels,
motels and recreational facilities within the city limits and adjacent city and county areas, and day visitors
attending special events and the city's beaches and other recreational areas. Visitors staying the night in
Pismo Beach can increase the resident population by some 7000 people. Special events, which occur on
more than 30 weekends during the year, contribute additional day visitors to the city's service population.
Several of the largest events, which occur during the summer-swell the total city service population to
20,000-30,000 people. Given the high demand for police services created by this large population, police
staffing needs in Pismo Beach exceed the levels expected for a less tourist-oriented community with an
equivalent resident population.
          Historically, the flexibility of response needed to meet the demands of a fluctuating tourist
population has been achieved in three ways: full utilization of paid reserves, overtime for full-time
employees, and prioritizing the urgency of conflicting demands for assistance. The department has a
three level service spectrum: Level I services are emergencies as well as current investigative cases;
Level II services are the general maintenance of order; Level III services are community based
educational programs or responses to non-threatening situations such as parking violations, residential
lock-outs, etc. The department must meet increased demands for service during heavy visitor periods by
reducing the services provided in Levels II and Ill of the service spectrum. This manner of meeting
intermittent increased demand for service decreases the level of service available to full-time residents for
non-emergency needs.
          The importance of maintaining an adequate level of police service, as with all municipal services,
must be considered as new development and population growth occurs. However, requirements for
additional personnel and equipment are rightfully the functions of the capital improvement planning
programs and the annual city operating budget rather than the general planning process. Nevertheless,
the provision of a new police facility capable of providing adequate space and fixed equipment to meet
increased service demand over the long range is indeed an important aspect of the General Plan.
          The ability of the department to effectively meet service demands is becoming increasingly
difficult given the inadequacy of the existing police facility. The potential for communication shut down
could occur in the event of earthquake or other disaster. As noted under the City Hall section of this
Element, the City Council must determine in 1992, the manner in which the space needs of the police
department will be met.
Policies
F-17      Staffing Requirements
          The City shall maintain a level of police staffing that will permit the department to give adequate
          attention to calls for service, to patrol and prevention, and to administrative requirements. New
          patrol units may need to be established in future annexation areas.
F-18      Emergency Response
          The City shall attempt to maintain a police response time to emergency situations (Level I), of no
          more than (5) minutes.
F-19      Capital Improvement Planning
          The City shall include necessary depreciation and replacement of all police vehicles and
          equipment in the capital improvement planning process.

F-20       Public Information
           The City shall maintain public information and school educational programs in crime prevention
           and drug education, and shall assist residents and businesses in developing neighborhood and
           commercial protection programs.
F-21       New Developments/Impact Fees
           The City shall require all new development proposed in the city and annexing properties to pay
           fees for additional equipment and fixed facilities as needed to service the new development. This
           may include the purchase and installation of radio repeater systems.
F-22       New Facility
           The City shall replace the existing, inadequate police facility with a new central facility that will
           provide protection for the department's emergency operations, as well as adequate space to
           meet anticipated staff needs over the life of the General Plan.
Schools
Background
           Pismo Beach school students in grades K-12 are served by two school districts: San Luis Obispo
Coastal Unified School District and Lucia Mar Unified School District.
San Luis Obispo Coastal Unified School District
           Pismo Beach students living north of Spyglass Drive attend Bellview Santa Fe Elementary
School, located on San Luis Bay Drive. This is a small rural school with a current enrollment of 66. The
school site can be expanded as needed with portable classrooms, and the district does not anticipate the
need for a new school. Junior high school students attend Laguna Junior High in the City of San Luis
Obispo, and the San Luis Obispo High School serves high school students from this area. Currently the
district does not foresee the need for a new junior high or high school.
Lucia Mar Unified School District
           Most of the Pismo Beach K-12 students are served by the Lucia Mar School District, which
includes the surrounding communities of Nipomo, Oceano, Grover City, Arroyo Grande as well as Pismo
Beach. District enrollment is expected to almost double in the next ten years, and over half of the
enrollment growth is projected to occur in the Nipomo area.
    At present, the district maintains two schools in Pismo Beach: Shell Beach Elementary and Francis
Judkins Junior High. With the completion of Mesa Elementary in September 1990, the enrollment of Shell
Beach Elementary was reduced from 650 students to 300. The new elementary is located on Halcyon
Road, adjacent to Arroyo Grande, and will draw students from the southern section of Pismo Beach. The
district projects a need for a new elementary school to be built in the Nipomo area in approximately five
years; another elementary school will be needed in the Oak Park area, either in the city of Pismo Beach
               1
or adjacent
           Francis Judkins Junior High School is projected to be at capacity in the next three years. A new
middle school is planned for the Nipomo area to be built during 1993-94. A bond issue to fund
construction of the middle school will appear on the ballot. This new school in Nipomo will free up
capacity in the Francis Judkins School by drawing away students from other communities who presently
attend school in Pismo Beach.
            High school students who reside in Pismo Beach within the Lucia Mar District attend Arroyo
Grande High School. The district does not anticipate constructing a high school in Pismo Beach in the
foreseeable future. Arroyo Grande High School is expected to reach capacity in 1997, and a new high
school will be needed in the Nipomo area by 2005. The new high school will reduce enrollment at Arroyo
1
   School capacity is a somewhat flexible concept. State standards consider amount of playground area; Lucia Mar standards are 30 students per
classroom. School capacities can be extended through the use of portable classrooms as well as class scheduling. Decisions regarding the need for
new schools are based on long- range enrollment trends rather than immediate capacities.
                                                                                                                                F-8
Grande High School; Pismo Beach students will continue to attend Arroyo Grande after the new school is
built.
         The district has completed a study of projected enrollment through the year 2000. Rather than
use a standardized projection of students per dwelling unit by size of unit, the district was divided into
zones with student yield projected by unit type for each zone. This method allows the district to more
accurately assess the student yield and anticipate construction and site needs in the review of
environmental impact reports.

Solid Waste
 Background
         The City of Pismo Beach contracts with the South County Sanitary Services for weekly waste
pickup from residences and businesses. Waste is transported to the Cold Canyon landfill on State Route
227. The closest state-licensed toxic waste disposal site is in Casmalia, near Lompoc in Santa Barbara
County. The 1986 San Luis Obispo County Solid Waste Management Plan indicates that the Cold
Canyon site will reach capacity by 1995. Thereafter, either the existing site will be expanded, or a new
site must be developed.
         The recent passage of AB 939 mandates that waste produced in California jurisdictions be
reduced by 50%. The City has negotiated with a private recycling contractor to provide curbside pick-up
of recyclables-glass, aluminum, newspaper-to meet the requirements of AB 939.
         Planning for the disposal of solid waste is a function of the County and Area Coordinating Council
in conjunction with the Solid Waste Management Advisory Committee. The current (1986) management
plan is already outdated; the closure of one landfill site earlier than anticipated by the plan has impacted
other county sites. The County is selecting a consultant to prepare a new plan; final recommendations are
expected in 1993.

         In order to preserve the unique setting between the sea and the undeveloped coastal hills and the
         availability of essential resources including clean water and clean air in the City's "sphere of
         influence" and "area of interest" upon which Pirmo Beach’s residents, visitors, and tourist
         economy depend, the City shall request that landfill and transfer sites not be located within these
         land areas. Landfills and transfer sites should be located more distant from urban expansion, as
         appropriate.
F-28     Recycling
         The City shall maintain a curbside recycle program to minimize impacts on regional solid waste
         disposal sites.
Wastewater Services
Background
         The wastewater disposal system in Pismo Beach is composed of the collection system, the
treatment plant, located adjacent to Pismo Creek, and the ocean outfall, operated jointly with the San Luis
Obispo County Sanitation District and located near Oceano. Certain deficiencies exist in the collection
system; however, these are continuously being corrected as old sewer lines are replaced and lift
equipment upgraded. Planning for the improvement of the collection system is ongoing in the city's
Capital Improvement Plan. The 1991 capacity of the treatment plant is 1.3 mgd. The 16" force main
carrying treated effluent from the treatment plant to the ocean outfall in Oceano has a capacity of 3.5
mgd; the outfall itself has a capacity of 8.5 mgd.
         Average daily flow has remained fairly constant with the 1991 average flow at 1.05 mgd.
However, the demand for wastewater treatment and its volume of flow is variable in the course of the day,
with instantaneous peaks at certain hours. Additionally, depending on wet weather conditions and/or high
visitor demand, flows can range from .8 mgd to a high in excess of 2.00 mgd. Plant operations are
sufficiently flexible to accommodate occasional high demand.
         The treatment plant operates under a joint State of California/National Environmental Protection
Agency order that stipulates standards for the quality of the effluent. These standards are currently being
met. The plant has been operated since 1976 by a private company contracting with the city; however, in
1990, the City Council determined to return the operation to the control of the city staff.
          The treatment plant has an expansion capacity of 1.4 mgd with modification to the aerated grit
removal tank and aeration tanks. There is sufficient space at the existing plant site to accommodate
expansion to 2.0 mgd. For a build-out of the 1991 city limits, a flow of 1.4 mgd is projected. At a three
percent growth rate, 1991 plant capacity of 1.3 mgd would be reached in 1998. These figures are based
on the yield of single-family dwellings. Yield from other uses cannot be determined until specific plans are
pre- pared. Impacts from commercial development should be monitored. However, with a site expansion
capacity to 2 mgd, the existing plant site should be adequate through the life of the plan.
          User fees fund general maintenance and the correction of deficiencies in the existing system;
system expansion to accommodate growth is funded by impact fees on new development. State law (AB
1600) states that impact fees can- not be used for operations and maintenance, and further requires that
the city demonstrate dear connection between impact fees and the cost of the needed expansion.
Policies
F-29     Treatment Plant Expansion
         The City shall plan for treatment plant expansion when average dally flow reaches 75% of current
         capacity; expansion shall be completed before the plant reaches 90% of current capacity. When
         90% capacity is reached, approval of developments requiring additional waste-water treatment
         capacity shall be limited to essential public services, public recreation, commercial recreation,
         and visitor- serving land uses. No development shall be approved which would individually or
         cumulatively exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment system.
                                                                                                  F-10

F-35    Annexations
        The City shall evaluate the cost effectiveness of extending connections to the existing treatment
        plant to serve properties considered for annexation. In some cases, annexing properties may be
        most effectively served by independent tertiary treatment plants that will allow reclamation for
        landscaping and recharge use.
Water Services
Refer to Principle P-5
Background
        One of the long-term and primary constraints for Pismo Beach is the availability and quality of
water. The city depends on 3 sources for potable water as shown in Table F-1.

        Pismo Beach is allowed to extract 700 ac. ft./yr, of water from the Arroyo Grande water basin by
gentlemen's agreement between the various agencies.
                                                                                                 F-11
          The city is entitled to 886 acre-feet of water per year (ac.ft./yr.) from Lake Lopez. In the past, the
city has purchased surplus water from the reservoir and should continue to do so since it is the least
expensive water source. However, since there is no assurance that the surplus water from Lake Lopez
will be available in drought conditions or continue to be avail- able to meet the city's demand for water,
Lopez surplus water should not be relied on for growth.
          Pismo Beach has recently drilled two new wells in the Meadow Creek water basin. The long-term
yield and reliability of these wells is undetermined at this time. In 1989 these wells yielded 412 ac.ft, and
maximum production at current water levels would be 620 ac.ft, per year. The long-term yield from these
wells may be much lower based on a substantial lowering of the water table in the summer of 1989. A
conservative scenario estimates the yield at 300 ac.ft./yr.
          In 1989, the demand for water in the city was 2058 acre-feet. The city's legal entitlement from
Lake Lopez (without surplus water) and the available water from the existing well fields are inadequate, if
the city is to reserve 5% of the available water for emergency uses.
          In November 1989, the Public Works Director concluded that the city had over-committed the firm
available water supplies of the city. This situation had come about through underestimates of water usage
for certain commercial developments; underestimates of the amount of irrigation water used by residential
developments on large lots; reliance on an expected yield of 700 acre feet per year from the Meadow
Creek wells that is unproven; and lack of a peaking source to meet summer demand. This over-
commitment precipitated an in- terim urgency ordinance by the City Council requiring stringent
conservation measures. In effect, the ordinance restricts the issuance of building permits only to those
applicants who can demonstrate that their projects will decrease current demand on the existing water
supply at a ratio of 1.5:1. This is accomplished through retrofitting of existing development with water
conserving fixtures. Exceptions are permitted only to projects supported by proven and assignable water
from sources other than those of the city.
          User fees fund the operations and maintenance of the water system. Expansion of the water
system to service new growth is funded by connection and development fees.
           Clearly, to service proposed development that has already received water commitments, as well
as future growth, the city must both find additional water supplies and continue to impose strict
conservation requirements. A new peaking well was completed in the Arroyo Grande basin in 1991. In
1991-92, funding is proposed for the development of a new water source to service the continuing Oak
Park development.
          Future water sources are a matter of the cost per acre-foot to the city, the quality of water
produced, and the reliability of deliveries. At the present time, the most cost-effective and proven quality
of water is from the State Water Project. The City has requested an annual allocation of 2000 acre-feet
per year from this proposed source. However, assuming distribution into San Luis Obispo County is
approved, it will take several years to bring the water on line. Other local sources are proposed for
consideration, although the yield and quality of these are not yet established: sustained pumping of the
Meadow Creek wells #9 and #10 to determine long term yield; runoff from Pismo Creek; and wastewater
reclamation for irrigation purposes. Desalinization, while technically feasible, is so expensive (up to ten
times the cost of the proposed state water) that it does not at present appear a reasonable option for the
city. However, the City should monitor future cost effective advances in desalinization technology to
evaluate alternative development costs, as additional water sources may be needed. Annexations of
areas in the sphere of influence shall require a proven source of water before development can be
approved. This will require two to three years of sustained pumping and quality analysis to verify the yield.
Policies
F-36      Water Management Program
          The City shall prepare and annually review a comprehensive water management program that
          shall include, but not be limited to:
          1. Groundwater Depletion Analysis - Since the city relies on groundwater for a significant
             portion of its potable water, the depletion of the groundwater basin by over-drafting the supply
             shall be avoided at all times.
                                                                                                    F-12
     2. Additional Water Sources--The City should pursue a variety of alternative additional water
         sources that will be sufficient to support the General Plan. New development should be
         allowed only as additional long-term proven water sources become available.
               When total annual water use reaches 90% of projected available supplies (based on
        known safe yield levels determined by the Groundwater Depletion Analysis, plus available
        entitlements from Lake Lopez and the State Water Project), approval of developments
        requiring increasing water supplies shall be limited to essential public services, public
        recreation, commercial recreation, and visitor- serving land uses. No development shall have
        building permits issued which would individually or cumulatively exceed the capacity of the
        City's water supply systems. Projects that are dependent on the availability of water supplies
        from the State Water Project shall be paced in accordance with the projected         connection
        schedule, and shall not be approved until a firm delivery date has been established and
        construction on the delivery line(s) commenced. Interim individual water wells will not be
        permitted where depletion of the City's existing groundwater resources could result.
     3. State Water Project-The City reaffirms its interest in participating in the State Water Project.
        Participation in the project shall be evaluated against costs of alternative sources such as
        surface water from Pismo Creek, additional groundwater sources, water reclamation and
        desalination.
     4. Water Conservation Program-The consumption of water should be minimized by the
        adoption of a water conservation ordinance that will set mandatory standards to reduce the
        consumption of potable water as well as include incentives for water conservation such as a
        tiered water rate program.
F-37 Water Reserves
     The City shall maintain water reserves at 5% over aver- age daily demand at all times and
     maintain a summer peaking supply of 130% over average weekly demand.

     The City shall require a minimum storage capacity in conformance with San Luis Obispo County
     standards for fire and other emergency needs prior to approval of development projects.
F-39 Water Conservation--New Development
     The City shall require water-conserving features in all new development (i.e. low-flow fixtures,
     drought-tolerant landscaping, automatic timing for irrigation, etc.).
F-40 Annexation Areas
     The City shall require all areas considered for annexation to demonstrate sustained new long
     term water sources sufficient to provide for planned development prior to approval of
     annexations. The demonstration of the sustained new long term water source shall required two
     to three years of sustained new production and quality analyses from the source.
F-41 Alternate Water Sources
     The City shall investigate alternative water sources, including desalinization, to increase existing
     supply, and shall continue to support the expansion of the State Water Project into San Luis
     Obispo County.

Growth Management Element
Background
           William Reilly's comments concerning citizens' views on growth (see cover page) were made
almost two decades ago, but his message still voices the concerns of many citizens and their local
governments today. This is especially true in California, where voters across the state have unleashed a
plethora of growth control initiatives at the ballot box over the last few years. Generally these initiatives
are angry reactions to changes that have already occurred. The challenge to local government, however,
is to develop a proactive plan for the long range needs of the city - one that will assure that the very
qualities that attract growth are not destroyed for existing and future residents.
           Growth management must be a part of a larger effort to shape the community for the future - to
assure not only the preservation of natural, scenic and cultural resources, but to assure as well that the
less economically advantaged are not forced to bear the economic burden of growth management policy.
It is in this larger context that all the policies of the Pismo Beach General Plan have been prepared as a
collective set of growth management guidelines for the development of an environmentally sound and
economically balanced city. The purposes of the Growth Management Element are to:
           1. Establish the 20 year and ultimate boundaries for the physical growth and development of the
community.
           2. Provide policies for future annexations of additional lands into the city.
           3. To manage the amount and timing of growth in accordance with the ability to maintain
acceptable levels of service and quality of life for existing and new residents.
Growth History
           Growth concerns have been an element of planning in Pismo Beach for some time. Although the
city's growth rate between 1970 and 1980 had averaged 3% on an annual basis, by 1980 a dramatic
increase in development applications was beginning to occur. The city determined that the 1980 General
Plan should maintain an annual growth rate not to exceed the 3% of previous years. This was to be
accomplished by limiting the issuance of building permits to no more than a 3% annual increase.
However certain exceptions were permitted to the 3% rule and consequently by 1988, the city determined
that growth had actually been occurring at over 4% annually and that the impacts of this growth were
having deleterious effects on certain city facilities and services. In 1989, the City Council convened a
citizen advisory committee to study and propose solutions to planning and growth problems in the city.
The advisory committee identified fourteen critical issues, ranging from problems with sewer inadequacies
and traffic congestion to the need for a new city hall. The City Council unanimously adopted an urgency
ordinance which provided "Prohibitions and limitations upon the acceptance and processing of certain
development applications pending full City review of current city ordinances and regulations which could
be in conflict with the city's review of the General Plan/LCP and zoning regulations.' This ordinance is in
effect until January 1,1993.
           Also in 1989, the Public Works Director informed the City Council that city water resources had
been over-committed to already approved development applications. Hence a fifteenth "critical issue" was
added to the previous list, and the Council amended the Municipal Code, adding chapter 13.06 instituting
mandatory water conservation measures. The Council further determined that even though an applicant
was eligible to receive a building permit under the growth management priority listings, the permit would
be issued only when the applicant could demonstrate that a project would either conserve water at a
savings ratio of 1.5:1, or that it would be served by a proven new water source.
Sphere of Influence Area
           The Cortese/Knox Local Government Reorganization Act of 1985 sets forth the rules and
regulations under which Pismo Beach may expand its adopted city limits. The legislative intention of this
law is to encourage orderly growth and development, which is considered essential to the social, fiscal,
and economic well being of the state. It recognizes that the logical formation of local agency boundaries is
an important factor in promoting orderly development. Within the legislation, the Local Agency Formation
                                                                                                          GM-2
Commission (LAFCo) is given the sole and exclusive authority for the annexation of additional territory to
a city.
        Before LAFCo may approve a territorial annexation, it must develop and adopt the "sphere of
influence" for the local agency. A sphere of influence is described as a plan for the probable ultimate
physical boundaries and service area of a local agency.
        The San Luis Obispo County LAFCo adopted the Pismo Beach Sphere of Influence in 1983. This
area was coterminous with the existing city limits except for Ontario Ridge and 2400 feet of freeway
frontage along Mattie Road. The Sphere was amended in 1987, to add the Los Robles del Mar property
on Oak Park Boulevard.
Extended Planning Area
        California planning law requires the city to adopt a general plan within its city limits and also for
any land outside its boundaries that in its judgment bears relation to it’s planning. This is a means by
which the city can communicate its concerns for the future of lands under the jurisdiction of the County or
neighboring cities. One way to do this is through the designation of an "extended planning area" which
may extend beyond the city limits and the sphere of influence area.
Principles
P-9     Quality of Life
        The focus of the Pismo Beach General Plan shall be to provide a high quality of life for Pismo
        Beach citizens and visitors. Quality of life factors shall include:

P-10 Urbanized Areas Should Be In Cities
     Urbanized areas should be located within cities in order to provide citizens with urban levels of
     ser- vice and to focus on local issues with local controls. Areas located outside of cities should be
     developed only with agriculture, rural or resource uses.
P-11 Pro-Active Planning
     To the extent that areas surrounding Pismo Beach will be urbanized in the future, the city shall
     take a pro-active, rather than reactive, role to planning these areas. In the pro-active mode, the
     city shall establish the goals it wishes to achieve for each area, include the area in the cities
     expanded planning area and sphere of influence area, and program annexations in a systematic
     way in concert with overall city policy.
                                                                                                      GM-4

Policies
GM-1 Residential Growth Rate
      The city's residential growth rate shall be managed to assure that the amount of new
      development annually is commensurate with the availability of public services and infrastructure
      and will not result in a deterioration of the quality of service to existing or new residents.
      a.        The issuance of building permits for new residential units shall not exceed 3% per year,
                based on the number of units estimated by the California Department of Finance to exist
                within the city as of January 1 of the preceding year.
      b.        A Growth Management Status Report shall be prepared by the city staff and provided to
                the City Council at least every three years, commencing in 1995. The report shall include
                the number of residential permits issued and the status of services and infrastructure.
GM-2 Financing
      All new development within Pismo Beach shall be required to pay its proportionate share for
      existing or proposed public facilities. (See Facility Policy F-2)
GM-3 Pismo Beach Extended Planning Area
      Pismo Beach's Extended Planning Area shall include the approximately 18,500 acres within the
      boundary shown on Figure GM-1. This boundary defines an area wherein future changes are
      likely to have an impact on the city. It is the city's policy to review all proposals affecting this area
      and to communicate the city's position on these matters to the applicable derision-making body.
      More specifically:
                                                                                                          GM-5
     a.       San Luis Obispo County shall be requested to refer all planning studies and applications
              for development permits located in this area to the City of Pismo Beach prior to taking
              any action.
     b.       The City shall request San Luis Obispo County to retain all lands within the extended
              area in land use policy categories requiring a minimum of 20 to 320 acres per parcel.
              To implement this policy, the County should take the following actions:
              Oak Park Road Area. The existing Residential Suburban (RS) category allowing 1 du/1
              to 5 acres should be changed to Residential Rural allowing 1 du/5 to 20 acres until
              such time as this area is annexed to Arroyo Grande or Pismo Beach.
              Squire Canyon. The San Luis Bay Area Plan of the County General Plan allows 1
              dwelling unit per 3 acres for this area. It should be changed to require 5 to 20 acres per
              dwelling unit.
              Avila Beach. The urban land use categories within Avila Beach shall be recognized as
              pre-existing categories but should not be expanded to additional land area.
              Other Areas. All other areas in Pismo Beach's Extended Planning Area should be
              retained in their land use categories existing in 1992.
     c.       Pismo Beach shall work to achieve mutually beneficial goals with the County, other cities
              in the South County area and various interested agencies in addressing area-wide or
              regional issues of concern, such as traffic, water supply, transit, waste management, air
              quality, and others.
GM-4 Future Urban Development in the Sphere
     The Land Use Element shall contain policies, which define the future types of land uses and
     development that will be permitted on lands within the urban expansion boundary, and the
     standards for density and building intensity.
GM-5 Area Of Interest/Future Additions to the SOI
     The "Area of Interest" shown on Figure GM-3 shall define those land areas that are outside the
     initial SOI or urban expansion area, but which may be appropriate to be included in the SOI in the
     future.
     a.       The City shall comprehensively evaluate the boundaries of the SOI at least every five
              years, but more often if appropriate. Such evaluations shall address, among other
              factors, whether the supply of land is adequate to accommodate projected housing needs
              allocated by the SLOCOG.
                                                                                                    GM-6
b. The initial comprehensive evaluation of SOI boundaries shall be undertaken no later than
   1995.
c. Any owner of property located within the Area of Interest may request the City to consider
   an amendment of the SOI boundary to add their lands to the SOL Any such proposal
   shall also identify the requested land use designations and any other necessary or
   appropriate amendments to the various elements of the General Plan.
d. In considering such requests, and at each periodic comprehensive evaluation, the City
   Council shall determine whether the public interest would be served by designating
   additional lands to be provided municipal services and developed with urban uses.
e. An amendment of the SOI to include additional lands shall be subject to environmental
   review pursuant to CEQA.
f. A proposal to amend the SOI to include additional lands may be considered concurrently
   with an annexation request. Such requests for concurrent processing shall be subject to
   the provisions of Policy GM-8.
g. Requests to amend the SOI boundary and to initiate a specific plan study had been
   submitted to the City by the owner of property "A" prior to the date of adoption of this
   plan. Although it was premature to include these lands within the SOI at the time of
   adoption of this plan, it is the intent of the City to consider these requests beginning in
   1993.
h. At the time of adoption of this plan, the city was considering potential sites for a new City
   Hall. Among the alternatives being considered was a portion of property "D." If this site is
   ultimately selected, it is the intent of the City to consider a request to amend the SOI and
   annex this area at the time that derision is made.
                                                                                           GM-7

     and criteria:
     a.       Annexation Study and Procedures
              The City, or experts under contract to the City, shall prepare a detailed annexation study
              addressing ail of the items identified herein. The costs of preparing the annexation study,
              including city administrative costs, shall be borne by the property owner(s) requesting the
              City to consider the annexation.
              1.       A Comprehensive Study of Fiscal Impacts to the City.
                       A comprehensive and detailed analysis of the fiscal impacts of the annexation
                       shall be prepared, addressing the full range of revenues and expenditures. One-
                       time capital costs of facilities as well as recurring operating costs and revenues
                       shall be evaluated.
              2.       Study of Fiscal Effects on Other Governmental Entities/Tax Agreements
                       The effects of the annexation upon other taxing entities should be analyzed.
                       Proposed tax-sharing agreements will be prepared.
              3.       General Plan Amendment
                       An accompanying amendment of the Land-Use Element, and other elements if
                       necessary, shall be prepared for review and adoption, which states detailed City

GM-7 Golf Course Development and Annexation (Parcel 4)
     As of the date of adoption of this plan, the City of Pismo Beach was conducting a study of the
     feasibility of developing a public 18 to 27 hole golf course and other recreational facilities on
     parcel "4." If it is deter- mined that these facilities are feasible and the City elects to proceed, the
     preparation of a "master plan" and a related EIR for the development of this property should be
     undertaken. The master plan and pre-zoning shall be completed prior to requesting LAFCo final
     action on annexation of the property
                                                                                                          GM-9

                                                           programs that will serve all
                                                           socioeconomic groups. To these

                                                            accomplishes six objectives:
                    1) Identifies adequate sites for a range of housing options;
                    2) Provides guidance for developing adequate and affordable housing;
                    3) Addresses constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs;
                    4) Defines approaches to conserve and improve housing conditions;
                    5) Promotes housing opportunities for all persons; and
                    6) Preserves and enhances Pismo Beach’s natural environment.
                The following discusses the context for housing policy in the City of Pismo
                Beach (City), the organization of the Housing Element, relationship to other
                elements of the General Plan, and the public participation process employed
                in the preparation and adoption of the Housing Element.
                A. Community Context
                The City is a coastal community of approximately 8,600 persons located in
                San Luis Obispo County, midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
                The City was founded in 1891 and incorporated in 1946. Pismo Beach is
                well known for its natural beauty and spectacular ocean views, tourism, and
                small-town character. See Figure 1.

                                                                                  Introduction
                 
                Since City adoption of the last Housing Element in 1992, the City has
                undergone significant changes. The City experienced a building boom during
                the remainder of the 1990s and early 2000s. Many new hotels were
                constructed, improving the City’s tourism industry and employment base.
                Housing supply also increased with the construction of many new single-
                family homes. From 2003 through 2006, the median sales price for a single-
                family home nearly doubled. At the peak of the housing boom in 2006, the
                median home price was almost $900,000 and affordable only to above
                moderate income households. Over the last couple of years, the rate of
                construction and housing prices has dropped. Although the price of housing
                has not dropped as significantly in Pismo Beach as in other parts of
                California, prices decreased about nine percent from 2007 to 2008. The
                median sales price for a single-family home in Pismo Beach at the end of
                2008 was $784,000 down from $857,500 in 2007.
                The City has also witnessed the significant conversion of housing to vacation
                homes, whereby seasonal homes have increased to nearly 20 percent of the
                entire housing stock. At the same, the number of new apartment projects
                has been limited.
                For the current planning period of the Housing Element (2007-2014), the
                City faces many challenges: balancing employment and housing
                opportunities; matching the supply and demand for housing; enhancing the
                affordability of housing for all segments of the population; ensure that
                adequate water and public services; and conserving natural resources that
                distinguish Pismo Beach. The 2007-2014 Housing Element sets forth a
                strategy to address these issues and provide guidance for local government
                decision-making.
                B. Organization of the Housing Element
                The Housing Element update is a seven-year plan for the period from
                January 1, 2007, to June 30, 2014. The Housing Element consists of the
                following major components:
                        1) Introduction to the Housing Element, including the planning
                            context in Pismo Beach, General Plan consistency, and the public
                            participation process (Chapter 1).
                        2) An analysis of the City’s population and housing characteristics
                            and trends, including special housing needs (Chapter 2).
                        3) Review of potential governmental, market, and environmental
                            constraints which impact the City’s ability to address its housing
                            needs (Chapter 3).

         Introduction
                 4) An evaluation of land and financial resources available to address
                     Pismo Beach’s housing goals (Chapter 4).
                 5) An evaluation of the previous 1992 Housing Element, its
                     effectiveness, progress in implementation, and appropriateness of
                     goals, objectives and policies (Chapter 5).
                 6) Housing goals, policies and programs to address the City’s
                     identified housing needs (Chapter 6).
         The Housing Element is meant to address the City’s housing needs. One of
         the main goals of the Housing Element is to increase affordability of housing
         in an equitable manner. This is often referred to as “affordable housing”.
         However, the City recognizes that the high cost of housing in Pismo Beach
         makes it difficult for the local workforce to afford housing. In fact, teachers
         or nurses supporting a family could fall into the lower income categories.
         Therefore, in order to better describe the housing needs, “affordable
         housing” and “workforce housing” are used interchangeably in the
         document.
         C. Relationship to General Plan Elements
         California Government Code requires that all of the elements of a general
         plan be consistent, so that no conflicts exist. The most important aspect of
         consistency among general plan elements is that policies and implementation
         measures in the General Plan elements support one another to achieve the
         goals and vision of the General Plan.
         The Pismo Beach General Plan contains ten elements – seven mandatory
         elements and three non-mandatory elements. The General Plan was last
         updated in 1993. The 2007-2014 Housing Element policies and programs are
         consistent with and build upon the policies and programs set forth in the
         other nine elements of the General Plan. For example, residential
         development capacities established in the Land Use Element are
         incorporated and consistent with the Housing Element; and environmental
         constraints in the Housing Element are consistent with the
         Conservation/Open Space Element and the Facilities Element.
         Consistency between the Housing Element and the updated General Plan
         will be evaluated as the process unfolds. Whenever an element of the
         General Plan is amended, the City considers the impacts of the amendment
         on the other elements to ensure consistency is maintained.
                                                                     City of Pismo Beach

                                                                                  Introduction
                 
                D. Public Participation
                Government Code states that "the local government shall make a diligent
                effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the
                community in the development of the housing element, and the program
                shall describe this effort." To that end, the City held stakeholder interviews
                over a three-day period and several meetings with the Planning Commission
                and City Council to provide opportunities for residents and interested parties
                to discuss constraints to affordable housing production, to recommend
                housing strategies, and to comment on the Draft Pismo Beach Housing
                Element. These meetings and interviews are discussed in more detail below.
                Notification for the meetings was published in the local newspaper in
                advance of the public hearing. In addition, a display ad was published in the
                San Luis Obispo Tribune on Friday, March 20, 2009. This hearing notice
                included the three public meeting dates in April and May 2009. Videos of
                the meetings are also available on the City’s website.
                The City also received several emails and letters regarding the Housing
                Element update. These comments have been taken into account in the
                preparation of the Housing Element, and are included as Appendix A.
                Copies of the draft 2007-2014 Housing Element have been provided to the
                local school districts and the Chamber of Commerce. The Public Hearing
                Draft Housing Element is also available on the City’s website
                (www.pismobeach.org).
                1. Stakeholder Interviews
                On March 25th, 26th, and 31st twelve stakeholder interviews were conducted.
                These provided an opportunity for key stakeholders to provide input on a
                one-on-one basis. The City invited the following parties:
                  - City Council Members                   - Economic Opportunity
                                                                Commission (EOC)
                  - Planning Commissioners
                                                           - Habitat for Humanity
                  - Local developers
                                                           - Homeowner’s Associations
                  - Affordable housing providers
                The following issues/topic areas were most important to those participating
                in the interviews:
                    - Affordable housing is important to the community

         Introduction
             - The high cost of housing and land is a challenge in Pismo Beach
             - Consider changes to the Zoning Ordinance to promote workforce
                  housing
             - Develop incentives for both non-profit and for-profit housing
                  developers
             - Identify appropriate properties for potential affordable housing
             - Take advantage of infill properties and City-owned properties
             - New construction should incorporate sustainable design features
             - Capitalize on slow down in the economy
         2. Public Meetings
         The City held four public meetings to solicit input on the Housing Element.
         Prior to completing the draft 2007-2014 Housing Element, the City
         conducted two meetings with the City Council on February 17, 2009, and
         April 7, 2009. These meetings were held to discuss State law requirements,
         local housing conditions, the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, and
         strategies to improve affordable and workforce housing in the City.
         After the release of the Public Hearing Draft Housing Element, the City held
         one meeting with the Planning Commission on April 14, 2009, to discuss the
         draft document and proposed policies and programs. The Planning
         Commission is highly in favor of the City promoting affordable and
         workforce housing. The Commission had several insightful comments and
         recommendations that have been taken into account. These include:
             - The importance of understanding the affordability categories and the
                  types positions that fit into each category. For example, if a teacher
                  or nurse is supporting a family, they may fall into the low-income
                  category. Along this line, the Commission also recommended the
                  use of the term “workforce” housing instead of affordable housing.
             - Due to the high cost of housing in Pismo Beach, the Commission
                  recommended that the City focus on rental housing rather than for-
                  sale housing to meet the City’s “fair share” of housing needs.
             - To meet the needs of aging baby boomers, the Commission
                  recommended promoting senior housing and suggested that the City
                  use a recent senior project in Arroyo Grande as a possible model.
             - Investigate creative ways to revise parking standards to reduce costs
                  of construction and rents.
                                                                       City of Pismo Beach
Page 1-6                                                       2007-2014 Housing Element

                                                                                   Introduction
                 
                    - The Commission also recommended that the City consider increasing
                        the residential density in the C-1 Zone (residential uses are allowed in
                        the C-1 Zone as part of a mixed-use project).
                    - In order to encourage more residential uses in the downtown area,
                        the Commission recommended allowing another story in downtown
                        projects, if a certain number or percentage of affordable units are
                        included in the development.
                    - The Commission also discussed the implications of the Coastal Act
                        on proposed changes to the Zoning Code and the difficulty in
                        meeting State timelines for program implementation when Coastal
                        Commission approval is required.
                On May 19, 2009, a joint City Council and Planning Commission public
                meeting was held to discuss the Public Hearing Draft Housing Element and
                to provide additional comments prior to releasing the document to the
                California Department of Housing and Community Development for review.
                Most of the comments and recommendations made by the City Council and
                Planning Commission were related to the Housing Element’s policies and
                programs. In general, the City Council and Planning Commission aimed to
                reinforce the City’s commitment to:
                     - Encourage and incentivize workforce housing;
                     - Encourage and incentivize senior housing;
                     - Encourage and incentivize green building practices; and
                     - Promote public outreach, notification, and participation.
                On December 1, 2009, the city Council held a public meeting to discuss
                comments received from the California Department of Housing and
                Community Development on the June 1, 2009 Housing Element draft. The
                Council concluded with directive to respond to HCD comments with
                revisions to the draft. Specifically the Council identified multiple properties
                for very and low and low income housing development and a commitment
                to necessary General Plan and Zoning code amendments to accommodate
                higher density development.

                                                Community Profile
                Pismo Beach is located in San Luis Obispo County, bordered by the Pacific
                Ocean, Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Avila Beach, and San Luis Obispo
                county rural lands. Located along the beach and cliffs with spectacular ocean
                views, the City is a popular vacation destination. Pismo Beach resident
                population totaled 8,603 in 2008 and seasonal tourism reaches up to two
                million visitors annually.
                A. Demographic Characteristics
                Population, employment, and household characteristics all affect the supply
                of and demand for housing in Pismo Beach. These characteristics are
                analyzed in this section to provide the basis for developing a successful
                housing program tailored to the needs of this community.
                1. Population Growth
                Between 1990 and 2000, San Luis Obispo County experienced substantial
                population growth, averaging 11 percent in incorporated communities. As
                shown in Chart 2-1, the population growth in Pismo Beach reflected those
                trends, increasing 12 percent to 8,551 residents by 2000. In recent years,
                population growth in Pismo Beach has slowed dramatically, adding less than
                one percent (52 residents) since 2000.

         2. Age Characteristics
         Pismo Beach residents have a median age of 47 years, nearly 10 years higher
         than the County median age. As shown in Chart 2-2 and Chart 2-3, the
         number of residents in each age group below 44 remained stable or declined
         between 1990 and 2000, while population increased in age groups above 45
         years. This reflects, in part, the high cost of housing in Pismo Beach, its
         large share of vacation homes, and affordability issues for most households,
         except higher-earning older households.

                3. Race and Ethnicity
                As shown in Chart 2-4, in 2000, Whites comprised 91 percent of the
                population in Pismo Beach, compared to 85 percent in the County. Between
                1990 and 2000, the White population declined as a share of all residents,
                coupled with slight increases in all other minority groups. The large increase
                in “other” is due in part to a new 2000 Census category that allows
                respondents to identify themselves as two or more races.

                4. Household Type
                Household composition and size are often interrelated factors. As seen in
                Chart 2-5, in 2000, 55 percent of households in Pismo Beach are families, 35
                percent are single persons, and 10 percent are other households. Between
                1990 and 2000, the distribution of household types remained nearly the
                same, albeit a significant numerical increase in single persons and other
                families. Nonetheless, the small average household size of two persons
                indicates that few families have children.

         B. Economic Characteristics
         Economic characteristics play an
         important role in defining housing needs
         in Pismo Beach. Economic characteristics
         include the types of business, the
         occupations held by residents, and the
         associated income. These characteristics
         provide insight into the types of housing
         residents can afford and job-induced
         housing demand.
         1. Business and Economy
         Pismo Beach has a robust local economy built around the tourism and retail
         industries. The 2002 special Census reported 289 businesses in Pismo Beach,
         comprising of retailers (32 percent), accommodation and food services (27
         percent), professional services (12 percent), and health care and social
         assistance (eight percent). Note: As of March 2009, the 2002 Census is the most
         current data available on business types. State industry data is reported below.

         The City’s service-related and tourism-oriented industries create unique
         challenges for providing housing to low-income employees working in
         restaurants and hotels. The City’s tourist marketing website
         classiccalifornia.com boasts 29 hotel and motels with 1,900 rooms, and 62
         food and beverage establishments. As tourist-oriented businesses continue to
         grow, so too will the need for low-income employees and appropriate housing.
         City Program HE-12 suggests that the City consider using a portion of the
         transient occupancy tax to create a housing fund for the development and/or
         rehabilitation of rental housing affordable to service industry employees.
                                                                               City of Pismo Beach

                1990. Service-related occupations rose by seven percent, and all other
                occupation categories decreased. All occupations showed a four percent

                Household income is an important indicator of the ability to afford housing.
                Chart 2-8 indicates that the income distribution of Pismo Beach residents is
                roughly equivalent to the County, although the City’s median household
                income ($46,396) was nine percent higher than the County in 2000.
                However, since the City’s average household size is significantly smaller than
                that of the County, the average income of Pismo Beach residents is higher on
                a per-capita basis.

         C. Housing Characteristics
         This section addresses the housing characteristics in Pismo Beach. Housing
         factors evaluated include housing types: tenure and vacancy rates, age and
         condition, housing costs, and affordability.
         1. Housing Type
         According to the 2000 Census, Pismo Beach had 5,493 housing units, a 21
         percent increase from 1990. From 1990 to 2000, housing increased 13
         percent in the County. As shown in Chart 2-9, single-family attached and
         detached residences continue to comprise nearly two-thirds of all housing.
         Mobile homes and recreational vehicle parks comprise a sizable 20 percent of
         the housing stock. Multiple-family housing comprises the remaining 17
         percent of housing units in Pismo Beach. City records indicate about 337
         housing units have been constructed since 2000.

                2. Tenure and Vacancy
                Housing tenure refers to the occupancy of a housing unit – whether the unit
                is owner-occupied or renter-occupied. Housing tenure is influenced by
                demographic factors (e.g., household income, composition, and age of the
                householder) as well as the cost of housing. Chart 2-10 shows that between
                1990 and 2000, the homeownership rate increased from 57 percent to 63
                percent due, in part, to the significant increase in single-family residences.

                As a resort community, Pismo Beach also has a significant amount of
                housing set aside for non-year round occupancy. In 1990, Pismo Beach had
                394 vacant homes (nine percent of total units) identified as seasonal,
                recreational or occasional use. As shown in Chart 2-11, by 2000, 1,041
                homes (19 percent of total units) of the housing stock were occupied on a
                transient basis. This trend represents a shift in the utilization of housing
                from permanent to seasonal use.

                Vacancies play an important role in Pismo Beach. A certain number of
                vacant units help moderate housing costs, increase options for prospective
                residents, and provides an incentive for unit upkeep and repair. Optimal
                vacancy rates range from 1.5 to 2.0 percent for ownership units and 5.0 to
                6.0 percent for rental units. Pismo Beach’s declining vacancy rates among
                for-sale units is partly responsible for soaring home prices. Rental vacancy
                rates, however, are still fairly high at 10 percent in 2000.

         3. Housing Conditions
         As illustrated in Chart 2-12, Pismo Beach has a significant stock of older
         homes: 50 percent of homes are over 30 years old and 31 percent are over 50
         years old. A general rule is that structures older than 30 years begin showing
         signs of deterioration and require reinvestment. Unless maintained, homes
         older than 50 years may require major renovations to ensure that plumbing
         and electrical systems, roofing, and insulation are sound. Older homes also
         have a higher prevalence of lead-based paint hazards.

         Despite the age of housing stock, housing is generally well maintained in
         comparison to other communities. This may be due to the high household
         income levels and high housing values in the City. However, some
         exceptions apply. With the large number of homes occupied on a seasonal
         basis, some property maintenance may be postponed by the owners. Also,
         some absentee property owners purchased homes for later use intending to
         rebuild or renovate upon their retirement. However, the number of
         substandard units is negligible.
         Two housing condition surveys were conducted in March 2009 (one for
         mobile homes, the other for all other units) to determine the number of units
         considered to be substandard in quality or in need of repair or replacement.
         City staff identified areas to survey. The survey was conducted through a
         windshield study that rated the physical condition of a unit in one of the
         following categories:
             -    Foundation,
             -    Roofing,
             -    Siding/Stucco,
             -    Windows, and;
             -    Electrical.
         Units were evaluated by determining whether they were in need of minor,
         moderate, or substantial repair or if they were dilapidated and in need of
                                                                      City of Pismo Beach

                replacement (See Chart 2-13). Although most of the units were found to be
                in sound condition, four units were found to be in need of moderate repair
                and 40 units were found to be in need of minor repair (most of these were
                mobile homes that were considered to be in need of repair due to the age of
                their construction materials). No units were found to be in need of
                substantial repair or dilapidated.

                According to the survey results, the majority of housing in need of repair was
                located near Wadsworth, Longview, and Placentia Streets. A map showing
                the general locations of housing units found to need minor or moderate
                repair can be found in Appendix B.
                4. Housing Costs
                Pismo Beach’s shorelines, recreational amenities, and proximity to job
                centers have contributed to high housing prices. According to the California
                Association of Realtors (CAR), from 2003 to 2006, the median price of
                homes in Pismo Beach nearly doubled. As shown in Chart 2-14, this price
                escalation well outpaced county home prices. Although home prices have
                not decreased at pace with national or county averages, from 2006 to 2008
                home prices fell approximately 10 percent from their peak in 2006.
                According to CAR, homes in Pismo Beach sold for a median price of
                $784,000 in 2008, well beyond the affordability of the majority of first-time
                home buyers and moderate income households. Early reports in 2009
                indicate that home prices continue to decrease; however a 60 percent
                decrease would be required before a median priced home would be
                achievable for a moderate income household purchase.

          Mobile homes are the most affordable housing option in Pismo Beach. A
          survey of mobile home sales in 2009 showed that mobile home prices range
          from $72,500 to $387,950, with a median sales price of $155,900. Unlike
          previous years when mobile home prices were affordable to only above-
          moderate income households, mobile home prices in 2009 are affordable to
          all income levels. Additional costs associated with leasing the land add to
          total housing costs. Mobile Home residency in Pismo Beach is limited to
          seniors; there are no family mobile home parks in the City.
          In contrast to home prices, rental prices are more affordable in Pismo Beach.
          This may be due to the high vacancy rates and the seasonal occupancy of
          many rental homes. Chart 2-15 shows housing rental units posted on
          Craigslist in the Pismo Beach and Shell Beach area from February 24, 2009 to
          March 23, 2009. As the Chart indicates, there is a wide range of housing unit
          types and prices. In addition, several housing units, mostly multi-family, were
          listed as fully furnished.

                5. Housing Affordability
                Even with the decline in housing prices in the last few years, average home
                prices in Pismo Beach are higher than those in surrounding communities.
                According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), in the
                fourth quarter of 2008 the San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles metropolitan area
                ranked third in the nation as the least affordable metro area. Furthermore,
                Pismo Beach has the highest priced housing in the County.
                To estimate and plan for the supply of affordable housing, the Department
                of Housing and Community Development (HCD) defines four income
                groups based on a percentage of the County Median Family Income (MFI).
                For 2009, the MFI for San Luis Obispo County was $70,800 for a family of
                four. The income groups are defined as follows:
                - Very Low Income Households earn less than 50 percent of County MFI
                - Low Income Households earn 50 to 80 percent of County MFI
                - Moderate Income Households earn 80 to 120 percent of County MFI
                - Above-Moderate Income earn 120+ percent of County MFI
                Household income limits are adjusted by household size. Chart 2-16 shows
                the 2009 income limits by household size for San Luis Obispo County.

                Housing affordability in Pismo Beach can be inferred by comparing the cost
                of renting or owning a home with the income levels of households of
                different sizes. Chart 2-17 shows the annual income ranges for very low,
                low, and moderate-income households and the maximum affordable
                payment based on the standard of 30 percent of monthly household income
                going towards housing costs.

          As illustrated in Chart 2-17, only above-moderate income households can
          afford a single-family home, a condominium, or even a mobile home.
          Moderate-income households can afford no more than $2,000 in rent each
          month, enough to afford a market rate rental unit. Lower income
          households cannot afford to rent market-rate units without potential
          overpayment or overcrowding.

          6. Housing Problems
          A continuing priority of communities is maintaining quality of life. A key
          measure of quality of life is the extent of “housing problems.” According to
          the federal government, the term “housing problems” refers to overpayment
          and overcrowding. Housing overcrowding refers to a situation where there
          are more people than the number of rooms. Housing overpayment refers to
          spending more than 30 percent of income for housing costs. Chart 2-18
          shows the prevalence of housing overpayment in Pismo Beach by tenure and
          income category. As the chart shows, 87 percent of very low income renters
                                                                                City of Pismo Beach

                percent of all homeowners overpay.

                Escalating housing prices have edged out lower and moderate-income
                families who can no longer afford housing in the community. Residents may
                also choose to pay more for housing, leaving limited financial resources to
                pay for other necessities. According to the Census, between 1990 and 2000
                the percentage of homeowners overpaying for housing remained stable at 31
                percent. However, the number of renters overpaying for housing increased
                from 38 percent to 44 percent during the same time period.
                The prevalence of housing overpayment is most severe for lower income
                households. Among renters, 87 percent of very low- and 61 percent of low-
                income households overpay for housing. Among homeowners, 52 percent
                of very low- and 43 percent of low-income households overpay for housing.
                Overcrowding can occur when housing costs are so high relative to income
                that families double up or reside in smaller units, which tend to be more
                affordable, to devote income to other basic living needs. Overcrowding also
                tends to result in accelerated deterioration of homes, a shortage of off-street
                parking, increased strain on public infrastructure, and additional traffic
                congestion. However, as illustrated in Chart 2-19, only 72 households (less
                than two percent) lived in overcrowded conditions (all renters).

          Extremely low income households earn less than 30 percent of the County
          median household income. Chart 2-20 indicates that there are 230 renter and
          190 owner very low income households in the City. The RHNA for Pismo
          Beach estimates the need for 36 very low income housing units between
          2007 and 2014, of which 50 percent should be for extremely low income
          households. Therefore, it is projected that an additional 18 extremely low
          income households will be added to the City.

          8. At-Risk Units
          The City has one affordable housing project owned by People’s Self Help
          Housing, the Seahaven Apartments, which provides 12 units of affordable
          housing for lower income households. In October 1998, the project was
          rehabilitated with financing from State HCD Home and local CDBG
          funds. The affordability controls extend for thirty years, from 1998 through
          2027. Thus, Seahaven Apartments is not at-risk of conversion during the
          planning period. Should the project become at-risk, the City will consider
          providing technical and financial assistance to continue the affordability
          controls on the project. There are no other units that are considered at-risk
          for conversion (see Program HE-26).
          D. Special Housing Needs
          Certain groups encounter difficulty finding affordable housing due to special
          circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment
          type and income, family characteristics, medical condition or disability,
          and/or household characteristics. Chart 2-21 lists special needs populations
          data available in the Census. In addition to the information shown in the
          Chart, this section also addresses the homeless and farmworkers. The

                As illustrated in Chart 2-22, 1,506 Pismo Beach households (36 percent)
                were headed by seniors (persons age 65 years and older) in 2000. Seniors
                typically have special needs due to disabilities, health care needs, and fixed
                income. With respect to their housing status, 223 senior households rent
                homes and 1,283 senior households own their homes. An additional number
                of seniors live with family members or in a retirement home. Of the 2,081
                Pismo Beach non-institutionalized seniors, 30 percent have a disability.

                Although many seniors own their homes, one-third of senior homeowners
                live in mobile home parks. The 2000 Census reports that mobile homes sold
                for a median price of $370,000 – $100,000 less than the median price of
                single-family residences. Maintaining and repairing a residence with a fixed
                retirement income can be problematic. Renters face many of the same
                housing affordability issues, except they are more susceptible to displacement
                due to changing rental costs. While only 17 percent of senior homeowners
                overpaid for housing, 53 percent of senior renters overpaid.

          As illustrated in Chart 2-23, senior households by income group are on par
          with the general Pismo Beach population. Approximately half of all senior
          households earn very-low and low incomes, and the other half earning
          moderate and above-moderate incomes.

          2. Large and Female-Headed Households
          State law identifies large families with children and female-headed
          households as having special needs due to their income challenges, child care
          expenses, and need for affordable housing. According to the 2000 Census,
          Pismo Beach is home to 1,293 female-headed households and 139 large
          households with five or more members. Fifty-five percent of the female-
          headed households are age 65 or less.
          In 2000, 42 percent or 542 female-headed households rented; 751 owned.
          The median family income for female-headed households with children was
          $31,250, compared to $66,429 for married-couple families. In 2000, 17
          percent of the City’s female-headed families with dependent children lived in
          poverty. Of the 139 large households, 50 households (36 percent) were
          renter occupied.
          3. Persons with Disabilities
          Persons with disabilities have special housing needs because of employment
          and income challenges, need for accessible and appropriate housing, and
          higher health care costs. A disability is defined broadly by the Census Bureau
          as a physical, mental, or emotional condition that lasts over a long period of
          time and makes it difficult to live independently. The 2000 Census defines
          five non-work disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, and go-outside-
          home. Chart 2-24 shows the number and percentage of persons with
          disabilities in the City.

                Disabled persons have special needs in that many earn very low incomes, have
                higher health care costs, and are often dependant on supportive services.
                Living arrangement needs for disabled persons depend on the severity of the
                disability. Many persons live independently or with other family members. To
                maintain independent living, disabled persons may need special housing design
                features, income support, and in-home supportive services. Pismo Beach does
                not have residential care The Community Care Licensing Division of the State
                Department of Social Services indicates that 60 facilities are located
                countywide; however, none are located in Pismo Beach.
                4. Homeless Persons
                Homelessness is a pressing issue in San Luis Obispo County. In 2006, the
                County’s Continuum of Care (CoC) documented 2,408 homeless persons of
                which 515 are chronically homeless. The homeless population in San Luis

          Community Profile
          Obispo County consists of both families and individuals. In 2006, the CoC
          documented 1,060 homeless persons in family households with children.
          Beyond the need for housing, they are likely to have other needs, such as
          support services. Pismo Beach is home to less than 25 homeless people.
          As there is no homeless shelter in Pismo Beach, the Police Department
          refers homeless persons to the Maxine Lewis Memorial Shelter in San Luis
          Obispo, the only homeless shelter in the County. The Shelter provides 49
          beds nightly year-round. An additional 15 to 30 beds are added through the
          Interfaith Coalition for the Homeless. The Shelter offers meals, showering
          facilities, message services, case management, information referral, and
          specialized health screenings. Case managers help clients stabilize their
          income or benefits to secure housing, and find appropriate resources to meet
          personal goals. In addition, case managers collaborate with numerous local
          agencies to address such client issues as mental health, drug and alcohol
          addiction, and family preservation.
          5. Farmworkers
          Farmworkers are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
          through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers
          work in the fields, processing plants, or support activities on a year-round
          basis. When workloads increase during harvest periods, the labor force is
          supplemented by seasonal or migrant labor. Farmworkers’ housing needs
          arise from their limited income and unstable nature of their employment.
          Although the County is located within a large agriculture region, the City is
          located within the urban boundary of coastal communities, which is not
          suitable for agricultural uses. Agricultural zones, however, surround the City,
          with wine grape production to the east and broccoli and strawberry
          production two miles south. As of the 2000 Census, only 13 residents in the
          City were working in the agricultural sector, all of whom were male.
          According the San Luis Obispo County Department of Agriculture,
          agricultural revenue for the County reached $653 million in total sales in
          2007, a $23 million (four percent) increase from $630 million in 2006. The
          sale of wine grapes accounted for the largest percentage of total sales with
          $141 million in revenue (22 percent). This is followed by the sale of
          Broccoli, which accounted for $77 million (12 percent) in total revenue.

Housing Constraints
                                                             Government policies and
                                                             regulations impact the price and
                                                             availability of housing and, in
                                                             particular, the provision of
                                                             affordable housing. Constraints
                                                             include residential development
                                                             standards, fees and taxes, and
                                                             permitting procedures. Providing
                                                             infrastructure and services also
                                                             increases the cost of producing
                                                             housing. One of the greatest
                constraints to affordable housing production is the chronic shortage of State
                and federal financial assistance.
                This Chapter addresses potential nongovernmental and governmental
                constraints and focuses on mitigation options available to the City.
                A. Market Constraints
                Land costs, construction costs, and market financing are major variables in
                the cost of housing and hinder the production of new affordable housing.
                Although many constraints are driven by market conditions, jurisdictions
                have some leverage in instituting policies and programs to alleviate the
                constraints.
                1. Land and Construction Costs
                Land costs in Pismo Beach are relatively high due to the demand for housing,
                lack of vacant land, and proximity to the ocean. A review of realtor websites
                in March 2009 provided 11 vacant lots for sale within the City. Of that
                sample, those in single-family residential neighborhoods were selling for $23
                to $115 per square foot. Beachfront lots were selling at much higher rates,
                starting at $287 per square foot. As a result, there will be an emphasis on
                higher priced housing to recuperate the cost of land and construction, unless
                land cost is mitigated with public assistance.

         Constraints Analysis
         Another major cost associated with building a new house is building
         materials, which can make up 50 percent of the sales price. Construction
         costs per square foot for a good-quality wood frame single-family residential
         unit is roughly $110, while custom homes cost much more. Homes being
         built in Pismo Beach are typically high-end custom homes. Costs for wood
         frame, multi-family unit construction average about $95 per square foot.
         2. Availability of Financing
         The availability of financing affects the ability to purchase or improve homes.
         In Pismo Beach, 242 applications for conventional mortgage home loans
         were received in 2007, of which 60 percent were approved by lenders and

         Reflecting the City’s high housing costs, there were no applicants recorded
         for government assisted home purchase loans such as VA, FHA, and
         FSA/RHS, given the sales price limitations on these programs.
         Most applications for home purchase loans were filed by upper income
         households, an expected result given the high price of housing in Pismo
         Beach. The approval rate was over sixty percent among upper income
         applicants, but lower for lower and moderate income households.
         B. Governmental Constraints
         Local policies and regulations impact the price and availability of housing and
         in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site
         improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing
         procedures, and various other issues constrain the maintenance, development
         and improvement of housing. Currently the City does not have in place a
         standardized development concessions list established for affordable
         housing. Program H-19 provides further detail.

                1. Land Use Controls
                The Land Use Element of the Pismo Beach General Plan sets forth policies
                for residential development. These land use policies, coupled with zoning
                regulations, establish land allocation for different uses. Housing supply and
                costs are affected by the amount of land designated for residential use, the
                density at which residential development is permitted, and the standards that
                govern the character of development.
                Development within Pismo Beach is governed by two zoning codes: the
                1983 Zoning Code applies to areas within the Coastal Zone and the 1998
                Zoning Code applies to property outside of the Coastal Zone. The 1983
                Zoning Code covers approximately two-thirds of the community.
                Chart 3-2 summarizes the General Plan land use designations and the zoning
                districts that either allow by right or conditionally permit residential
                development.

                2. Provisions for a Variety of Housing
                Pismo Beach provides for a wide range of housing types throughout the
                community. The following describes the major provisions in the Zoning
                Code allowing residential uses.
                Conventional Housing
                Single-family homes are permitted in all residential zones, except for the R-4,
                PR, and CD-M zones, where such housing is permitted conditionally.

2007-2014 Housing Element                                                                             Page 3-3
         Constraints Analysis
         Pursuant to State law, manufactured housing placed on a permanent
         foundation is considered a single-family dwelling and is permitted in all
         zoning districts that allow single-family housing subject to architectural
         review. Within the Coastal Zone, mobile home parks are permitted with the
         M-H zone. Outside of the Coastal Zone, mobile home parks are
         conditionally permitted in the RSL, RSM and RR zones.
         Within the Coastal Zone, multi-family housing of less than four units is
         permitted in the R-3 and R-R zones, but conditionally permitted in the R-2,
         P-R and R-4 zone. Multi-family housing of four or more units is permitted
         in the R-3 and R-R zones and is conditionally permitted in the P-R and R-4
         zones. Outside of the Coastal Zone, the Zoning Ordinance permits multiple
         family developments in the RR-L and RR-H zones. Multi-family
         development is conditionally permitted in the CD-M and CD-V zones.
         Mixed-Use Development
         Pismo Beach allows mixed use development within several areas of the City.
         As identified in the Pismo Beach Zoning Code, the intent of mixed-use
         development is to provide a continuous frontage of retail shops and
         commercial business establishments at the street level, while providing
         opportunities for downtown living on the second floor and/or to the rear of
         the lot. The development of mixed use provides new employment and
         housing opportunities for residents.
         Within the Coastal Zone, apartments as secondary uses are conditionally
         permitted within the Retail Commercial (C-1) zone. Apartments are
         permitted on the second floor or rear of C-1 buildings in conjunction with a
         permitted business. Outside the Coastal Zone, the CD-C, CD-M, and CD-V
         zoning districts allow mixed-use development provided the entire ground
         floor street frontage is dedicated exclusively for commercial uses. Mixed-use
         development standards require the entire ground floor street frontages be
         nonresidential. However, within single-story structures, residential uses are
         permitted on the rear half of the lot, occupying less than 40 percent of the
         ground floor area.
         Secondary Dwelling Units
         Secondary units are defined within the Pismo Beach Zoning Code as
         dwelling units that are added to, attached or detached from a single-family
         dwelling unit on the same parcel. Secondary dwelling units provide quarters
         for independent living areas, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation facilities.
         Secondary units are permitted in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-R, and P-R Coastal Zones
         and outside the Coastal Zone within the RSL, RSM, and RR zones. The only
         exception is in Pismo Heights, where the City Council adopted required
         findings. Secondary units are permitted on lots/parcels where there is one
                                                                      City of Pismo Beach
Page 3-4                                                      2007-2014 Housing Element
                                                                             Constraints Analysis
                existing or planned residence. There is no minimum parcel size for lots that
                allow secondary units. Secondary dwelling units require no discretionary
                approval, with the exception of hillside developments. Secondary units
                proposed on a thirty percent or greater slope do require approval of a CUP
                by the Planning Commission. Parking requirements for secondary units are
                shown in Chart 3-7.
                Housing for People with Disabilities
                The Lanterman Development Disabilities Services Act declares that mentally
                and physically disabled persons are entitled to live in normal residential
                surroundings. A State-authorized, certified, or licensed family care home,
                foster home, or group home serving six or fewer disabled persons or
                dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is considered a
                residential use that is permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can
                impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards or require variances
                on these homes than those required for homes in the same district.
                The 1983 Zoning Code for the Coastal Zone conditionally permits family
                care facilities serving six or fewer residents in residential zones and
                conditionally permits larger facilities, called group care facilities, in the R-3
                and R-R zones. Outside the Coastal Zone, the 1998 Zoning Code permits
                residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons by right in all residential
                zones and conditionally permits larger facilities in the same zones. Program
                HE-24 proposes amending the 1983 Zoning Code for the Coastal Zone to
                allow small residential care facilities in all residential zones.
                Transitional Housing and Emergency Shelters
                Temporary emergency shelter for the homeless is typically defined as a
                residential facility, lodging house, or dwelling where no rent is paid, which
                provides temporary accommodation to homeless persons and/or families.
                The 1998 Zoning Code permits emergency shelters by right within the RSM,
                CRS, CG, CS, CD-C, CD-M and CD-V zones. The City currently has over
                2.27 acres of vacant CD-M commercial land that can accommodate the
                development of an emergency shelters. The Zoning Code is silent on the
                provision for transitional facilities. State legislation SB 2 requires that
                transitional housing and supportive housing be considered residential uses
                subject to the same restrictions that apply to the equivalent housing types in
                the same zone.
                To ensure consistency with State law, Program HE-29 proposes to make
                transitional and supportive housing subject to the same requirements as
                residential uses.

                The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential
                development primarily through the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations are
                designed to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as
                well as implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Code also
                serves to preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods. Charts 3-5
                and 3-6 summarize residential development standards in Pismo Beach.

                Development standards are generally the same for proposed projects within
                or outside the Coastal Zone. Within the Coastal Zone, densities range from
                one to four units per acre in the low density zones to 30 units per acre in
                high density zones. Minimum lot sizes are 5,000 square feet except for
                20,000 square feet in the R-4 zone. With the exception of the P-R district,
                maximum building coverage is 55 percent. No buildings can exceed 35 feet
                in height, with building height limited to 25 ft in the R-1 and R-2 zones. The
                General Plan specifies nine Height Limitation (HL) overlay districts to
                protect hillside, canyon and coastal views. With the exception of a 15-foot
                height limit in one sub-district and oceanfront sites, the height limit in most
                districts is 25 feet.
                In the Coastal Zone, multi-family residential use is permitted by right in the
                R-R zone and is conditionally permitted in the R-4 zone while mixed use
                development is permitted in the Downtown Commercial Core. Outside the
                Coastal Zone, multi-family projects are permitted in the RR zone and 2nd
                story residential is conditionally permitted in two commercial districts.
                The Planned Residential (PR) zone allows for flexibility in design and
                structures best suited to the site and to accommodate environmental
                constraints. Single- and multiple-family housing is permitted subject to a
                conditional use permit. Densities within the P-R zone are often set by the
                General Plan, typically no more than 8 units per acre. Any proposed
                development in the PR zone must comply with the applicable Specific Plan.
                Finally, although the City’s Zoning Code permits a wide range in housing
                types that facilitate different housing price levels, single-family homes are

          Constraints Analysis
          allowed in multiple family zones. This provision could potentially constrain
          the City in encouraging the production of multiple family housing in higher
          density residential zones where necessary to meet City production goals. To
          address this potential constraint, Program HE-19 proposes to prohibit single-
          family housing from being built in the multiple family residential zones,
          unless the lot cannot physically accommodate more than one unit.
          Parking Standards
          The City’s parking requirements are based upon unit type and size. Shown in
          Chart 3-7, parking requirements are typically two spaces per single-family
          residential unit. Multi-family residential units have a reduced requirement
          based on the size of unit, but generally average two spaces per unit after
          accounting for guest parking. Reductions in parking spaces are allowed for
          uses that serve tenants with low vehicle-ownership rates, such as senior
          housing, rooming homes, and convalescent homes. Program HE-4 proposes
          the adoption of an exceptions ordinance and greater flexibility in the Density
          Bonus program to allow for such flexibility. Additionally, Program HE-25
          proposed to clarify parking standards for secondary units (referred to as both
          secondary dwelling units and secondary residential units in the City’s Zoning
          Code).

          In highly dense residential environments, open space between housing units

                decks, fenced yards, and similar spaces shall also be provided at 75 square
                feet per bedroom. Requirements may be modified through either Site Plan
                and Architectural Review or the Conditional Use Permit approval. No
                analogous provision applies for residential projects in the coastal zone.
                Adequacy of Density and Development Standards
                Densities of 20 units per acre or more are preferable for affordable rental
                housing. Moreover, projects should also incorporate amenities such as open
                space, common areas and community space that are vital to livability and
                appeal.
                A more critical factor than achievable densities in creating affordability is
                access to financing that can write-down (reduce the book value of an asset)
                the cost of the land and, if possible, any required off-site improvements.
                Depending on the desired affordability, it may be necessary to write land
                costs down to zero. Of equal importance is to ensure that the parcel is large
                enough to achieve a certain construction and management "critical mass."
                Small in-fill type development projects, while necessary and attractive, are
                difficult to develop, finance and manage over the long-term. Typically,
                projects should be at least 30 to 40 units.
                The Zoning Code provides density and development standards to facilitate
                affordable housing. Multi-family projects can be built at 22 to 30 units per
                acre in medium and high density residential zones. An apartment project at
                24 units per acre in the R-3 district and a 12-unit condominium project at
                28.5 units per acre in the R-4 district were built within the last seven years.
                Both projects achieved maximum density while complying with current open
                space, height, and parking space requirements in the Zoning Code.
                To achieve density increases the City implements the State’s density bonus
                program (Government Code 65915) through Chapter 17.26 of their 1998
                Zoning Code, updated in 2000. The requirements of Chapter 17.26 allow for
                a density increase of up to twenty-five percent over the maximum allowable
                residential density under the Zoning Code and General Plan. Density bonus
                requirements’ were not established in the 1983 Zoning Ordinance; therefore
                no specific standards exist for projects within in the Coastal Zone.
                Two recent legislative actions, SB 1818 and AB 2280, have recently been
                passed, that amended the State density bonus program. SB 1818 became
                effective in January 2005. Under SB 1818, applicants are eligible for a range
                of density bonuses up to 35 percent, based on the percentage of affordable

          units in a development. Applicants are also eligible for an innovative new
          land donation density bonus. Jurisdictions are required to offer at least one to
          three incentives (reductions in parking, for example), based on the
          percentage of affordable units in a development. SB 1818 also limits parking
          requirements that may be imposed by the Zoning Code’s parking standards.
          AB 2280 became effective in September 2008. The bill institutes various
          changes to the density bonus law, most notably the bill amends the timing
          for density bonus requests, clarifies density bonus requirements for senior
          housing, and institutes a 10 percent across the board increase in the
          percentage of affordable units that must be included in a project to qualify
          for incentives.
          The City’s zoning requirements in both the Coastal Zone and inland areas
          have not been updated to be consistent with SB 1818 and AB 2280.
          Therefore, Program HE-4 proposes to bring the City into compliance with
          current State density bonus law.
          Program HE-20 also proposes a housing incentive program to further
          encourage the development of affordable and higher density market rate
          housing. The Program considers the following provisions:
              - Exceptions to regulations encouraging the use of current substandard
                   lots;
              - Lot consolidation provisions to allow the assemblage of parcels into
                   larger sites to accommodate affordable housing; and
              - Density bonus provisions and specification of modifications in
                   development standards to facilitate maximum density.
          4. Development Fees
          The City charges various fees and assessments to cover the costs of
          processing permits and providing services. Impacts fees are also charged to
          cover the cost or providing municipal services or mitigating project impacts.
          These fees are summarized in Chart 3-8. The total amount of fees varies
          from project to project based on location (within or outside of Coastal Zone)
          and the cost of mitigating environmental impacts. The school district
          charges impact fees to pay for school construction projects; however these
          fees are controlled by the school district.
          City records provided examples of fees charged on new housing projects.
          Two projects submitted between 2008 and 2009 were reviewed - a 2,000
          square foot single family residential project and four-plex apartment
          building/office project. Fees ranged from approximately $30,800 to $35,700
          per unit. Impact fees comprised the largest share. (See Chart 3-9.)
                                                                       City of Pismo Beach

          (see Chart 3-10). Given the prices of housing in the City and fees in other
          jurisdiction, fees for residential development are not a significant factor in

          Inclusionary requirements and fees also add to housing development costs.
          For residential projects of five or more units, the developer can either 1) pay
          an in-lieu fee equal to or greater than five percent of the building permit
          value; or 2) dedicate land or build affordable units of equal value to the fee.
          Commercial projects greater than 5,000 square feet must either 1) pay an in-
          lieu fee of at least two percent of the building permit value; or 2) build an
          affordable unit or dedicate land equivalent to the in-lieu fee. (Note: The
          projects in Chart-10 were less than five units and did not incur an
          inclusionary in-lieu fee.)
          5. Building Codes and Site Improvements
          Building codes and site improvements can also increase the cost of
          developing housing, particularly affordable rental housing. The following

                Building Codes and Enforcement
                Pismo Beach implements the 2007 edition of the California Building Code
                and other model construction codes, with amendments adopted by the
                California Building Standards Commission. These model codes establish
                standards and require inspections at various stages of construction to ensure
                code compliance and minimum health and safety standards. Although these
                standards and the time required for inspections increase housing production
                costs and may impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties, the
                codes are mandated for all jurisdictions in California. The City has not
                adopted local amendments to the model codes that increase housing costs.
                Building inspectors are responsible for ensuring that proposed projects meet
                State and local codes.
                Site Improvements
                The City requires on-site and off-site improvements for new housing
                projects. Many areas of Pismo Beach are highly developed and already have
                infrastructure in place to serve smaller infill residential projects. Thus, the
                on-site and off-site improvements are minimal. Larger developments, like
                the Los Robles annexation area, are governed by Specific Plans. Fees also
                pay for many types of improvements to serve residential properties.
                For unimproved areas not governed by a Specific Plan, the General Plan and
                City standards direct on-site and off-site improvements. For instance, local
                streets typically have a 56-foot right-of-way and a 36-foot curb-to-curb
                width, but exceptions allow for smaller roadway widths as appropriate.
                Collectors have a 60-foot right of way with a curb-to-curb width of 40 feet.
                Sidewalks five feet in width are generally required on both sides of the street,
                as well as an additional five-foot wide easement for future street widening.
                For small infill developments, the City does not usually require fire hydrants,
                streetlights and signals, but would require these amenities for larger Specific
                Plan areas. In subdivisions, street trees are required every 30 feet.
                Developers are also required to install water and sewer lines. For small infill
                projects, developers simply install the laterals from the street main to the
                actual home. These on- and off-site improvement standards are typical for
                most communities and do not pose unusual constraints for housing
                development.
                6. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
                As a coastal community with unique environmental and topographical
                constraints, the City of Pismo Beach requires different levels of review for
                housing projects depending on the type, size, and location. Project reviews
                ensure that the proposed project meets applicable City regulations, State

          four units typically take two months from submittal of the application

          three to six months to complete.

          Zoning Clearance
          The 1998 Zoning Code requires zoning clearance for all developments. For
          conventional single-family homes on existing lots of record and multi-family
          projects, City staff will approve the project over-the-counter unless the
          development requires an exception or modification. The zone clearance
          process is intended to verify that proposed structures or land use complies
          with the permitted list of activities allowed in the zoning district and the
          development standards applicable to the type of use. This process is
          completed within 10 working days. The process is the same for proposed
          projects in the coastal zone and outside the coastal zone.

                                                                             Constraints Analysis
                Site Plan and Architectural Review
                Site Plan and Architectural Review is required for proposed new housing for
                site design, including location of structures, landscaping, ingress/egress,
                parking and loading, grading and architectural design. Planning staff
                determines whether the application complies with site planning standards.
                The standards are objective in nature with graphic illustrations and
                descriptions. The process takes only 10 days. The process is the same for
                sites in the coastal zone and outside the coastal zone.
                Projects on slopes exceeding 15 percent, mixed use projects, or projects
                seeking discretionary land use decisions require Planning Commission
                approval. The Planning Commission can approve the application, with or
                without conditions, when the proposed project meets four criteria: 1)
                consistency with allowable uses in the Zoning District; 2) consistency with
                the General or Specific Plan; 3) compliance with CEQA requirements; and 4)
                compatibility with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity. This
                process is typically completed within 30 days after staff approval.
                Conditional Use
                As indicated earlier, certain residential uses require a conditional use permit. The
                Planning Commission is responsible for reviewing and approving the permit
                after a recommendation by City staff. The Commission may grant the permit
                when the proposed use is in accordance with the provisions of the General Plan
                and the Zoning Code and appropriate conditions are met. Conditional use
                permits are required for certain special needs housing (e.g., residential care
                facilities, condominiums and mixed-use projects) as well as multi-family units in
                certain zones. The CUP process typically takes two months.
                Coastal Development Permit
                Properties within the Coastal Zone encompass the majority of the City. The
                City has a Local Coastal Plan (LCP) that was approved by the Coastal
                Commission in 1993. Therefore, approval of development projects within
                the coastal zone can be performed locally. Proposals for residential
                developments within the Coastal Zone are subject to the coastal
                development permit noticing requirements. Applications for development
                within 300 feet of the ocean or the first through road require Planning
                Commission review. Development in the balance of the Coastal zone area
                may be approved by City staff. In each case there is a 30 day review period
                for application completeness, with action on the application to occur within
                60 days for single family homes.

          Environmental Review Process
          State regulations require environmental review of discretionary project
          proposals (e.g., subdivision maps, specific plans, use permits, etc.). The
          timeframes associated with environmental review are regulated by CEQA. In
          compliance with the Permit Streamlining Act, City staff ensures that
          proposals are reviewed within the CEQA guidelines timeframes.
          7. Housing for People with Disabilities
          California law requires jurisdictions to analyze potential and actual
          constraints on housing for persons with disabilities, demonstrate efforts to
          remove impediments, and include programs to accommodate housing
          designed for disabled persons. Review of the Municipal Code, permitting
          procedures, development standards, and building codes revealed the
          following findings.
          Land Uses and Housing
          The City permits a wide variety of housing types in the community, including
          conventional single- and multi-family housing, mobile homes, emergency
          shelters, residential care facilities, and other types of housing. To comply with
          State law, this Housing Element proposes to amend the Zoning Code to
          permit, by right, residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons and
          transitional housing in residential zones in a manner consistent with State law.
          Development Regulations
          The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations which
          addresses access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with
          disabilities. The City also requires compliance with the 1988 amendments to
          the Fair Housing Act, which requires a minimum percentage of dwelling
          units in new housing projects to be fully accessible to the physically disabled.
          No additional accessibility or visitability standards above State and federal
          law are required. Housing occupied by people with disabilities is treated like
          any other residential use. No unique restrictions are in place, such as
          minimum distances, special conditions for disabled housing, noticing
          procedures, special use permits, or other regulations that could constrain the
          development, maintenance, or alteration of housing for disabled persons.
          Process for Reasonable Accommodation
          Accessibility improvements to existing structures, such as a ramp, are usually
          handled ministerially by City staff. Attached features such as a ramp may
          project 20 percent into the setback and 40 percent into interior street-side
          setback. The fee for this process averages less than $100.
                                                                           City of Pismo Beach

                Chart 3-13 reviews not only the 1983 Zoning Ordinance and 1998 Zoning
                Code, but also land use policies, permitting practices, and building codes to
                ensure compliance with State and federal fair housing laws for persons with
                disabilities. To further fair housing opportunity compliance, Program HE-30
                proposes the development of a reasonable accommodation provision in the
                Zoning Code.

          Constraints Analysis
          8. Energy Conservation
          Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy
          conservation and green building features, contributes to reduced housing
          costs. Energy efficient design for sustainable communities reduces
          dependence on automobiles. Additionally, maximizing energy efficiency
          reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In response to recent legislation on global
          climate change, local governments are required to implement measures that
          cut greenhouse gas emissions attributable to land use decisions (see
          discussion on Global Climate Change below). The Housing Element
          programs can support energy efficiency that benefits the market and the
          environment by:
              - Establishing a more compact urban core, bringing residents close to
                  work and services, therefore reducing automobile trips and reducing
                  emissions;
              - Implementing passive solar construction techniques that require solar
                  orientation, thermal massing, and other energy efficient design
                  standards; and
              - Encouraging the use of solar water heating and photovoltaics.
          Executive Order S-E-05 initiated the first steps in establishing greenhouse
          gas emission reduction targets in California. This was followed by the
          California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), which required the
          California Air Resources Board (CARB) to establish reduction measures.
          There are several areas where programs for energy conservation in new and
          existing housing units are supported by the City:
              - Through application of State residential building standards that
                  establish energy performance criteria for new residential buildings
                  (Title 24 of the California Administrative Code).
              - Through appropriate land use policies and development standards
                  that reduce energy consumption, such as promoting more compact,
                  walkable neighborhoods, with housing close to jobs, community
                  facilities and shopping; planning and zoning for mixed-use and
                  higher density development; and permitting cluster units.
              - Through encouraging the use of solar energy. The Planning
                  Commission (Section 17.105.140, 1993 Code) has the authority to
                  encourage and/or require projects to provide either passive or active
                  solar systems for water heating and air conditioning where feasible.
          Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides a variety of energy conservation
          services for residents and provides several other energy assistance programs
                                                                       City of Pismo Beach

                for lower income households. These programs include their Energy Watch
                Partnerships and the Charitable Contributions Program.
                The Energy Watch Partnerships help residents lower their energy bills and
                promote cleaner energy production. Through this program, PG&E has
                extended the reach of effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, and
                provided information about demand responses programs, renewable energy
                and self-generations opportunities.
                The Charitable Contributions Program gives millions of dollars each year to
                non-profit organizations to support environmental and energy sustainability.
                Projects include residential and community solar energy distribution projects,
                public education projects, and energy efficiency programs. The goal is to
                ensure that 75 percent of the funding assist underserved communities, which
                includes low income households, people with disabilities, and seniors.

                housing types.
                Energy Consumption
                Residential water heating and heating/cooling are major sources of energy
                consumption. With the application of energy efficient design and the use of
                solar power systems, home heating and cooling can be operated on a more
                efficient and sustainable level.
                By encouraging solar energy technology for residential heating/cooling in
                both retrofits and new construction the City can play a major role in energy
                conservation. There are two distinct approaches to solar heating: active and
                passive. The best method to encourage use of solar systems for heating and
                cooling is to not restrict their use in the zoning and building ordinances and
                to require subdivision layouts that facilitate solar use.
                Residential water heating can be made more energy efficient through the
                application of solar water heating technologies. Solar water heating uses the
                sun to heat water, which is then stored for later use, a conventional water
                heater is needed only as a back-up. By cutting the amount of natural gas
                needed to heat water by 50 to 75 percent per building, solar water heating

          Constraints Analysis
          systems can lower energy bills and reduce green house gas emissions. The
          City has the opportunity to implement solar technologies with the help of
          recent legislation. The Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007 (AB
          1470) has created a $250 million, ten-year program to provide consumer
          rebates for solar water heating systems.
          Global Climate Change
          The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere regulates the
          earth’s temperature and is known as the “greenhouse effect”. Without these
          natural gases, the Earth’s surface would be approximately 60 degrees
          Fahrenheit cooler. Emissions from human activities such as electricity
          production and automobiles have elevated the concentration of these gases
          in the atmosphere, this is referred to global warming or more recently termed
          - global climate change. Examples of greenhouse gases include carbon
          dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons. The increased
          consumption of fossil fuels (wood, coal, gasoline, etc.) has substantially
          increased atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. New housing development
          contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, but careful site planning and design,
          and the selection of environmentally friendly building materials and
          equipment can significantly reduce these emissions.
          There are significant areas where Pismo Beach can do more to encourage
          energy conservation in new and existing residential development to reduce
          the demand on energy. There are a variety of energy efficiency and
          greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies that can be integrated into land
          use decisions related to housing. Chart 3-14 lists strategies to address energy
          conservation and global climate change, developed by the California
          Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Action Team.
          Through these and other conservation measures, the City seeks to help
          minimize the percentage of household income required for energy costs as
          well as minimize the production of greenhouse gases. Programs have been
          included to incorporate newly adopted state energy efficiency standards and
          to encourage alternative energy efficient technologies.

Chapter 4
Housing Resources
                Chapter 4 addresses the resources available for development, improvement,
                and preservation of housing in Pismo Beach. This includes:
                    - An evaluation of the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation.
                    - A sites inventory and analysis, which is an inventory of land suitable
                        for residential development.
                    - A summary of potential infrastructure and environmental constraints
                        to residential development.
                    - An overview of financial and administrative means for developing and
                        implementing City housing programs.
                A. Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                California law requires the Department of Housing and Community
                Development to project statewide housing needs and allocate the need to
                each region in the State. After consulting with the San Luis Obispo Council

2007-2014 Housing Element                                                              Page 4-1

         Housing Resources
         The following sections describe the RHNA for the current 2007-2014
         planning period and for the previous 2000-2006 planning period. Because
         the City did not adopt a Housing Element for the previous period, the City
         must identify adequate sites to meet the current and the previous RHNA.
         Since adequate sites are not available to meet the RHNA for the previous
         planning period, the City has included Program HE-1 to rezone adequate
         sites by August 2010 (Government Code Section 65584.09). This date for
         compliance is established by the State.
         The City has also included Program HE-2 to identify sites for the current
         RHNA that can be developed within the planning period. This requirement
         is in addition to the requirement to identify specific sites to accommodate the
         previous RHNA (2000-2006). The jurisdiction may not count capacity on
         the same sites for both planning periods.
         The “adequate sites” programs (HE-1 and HE-2) must commit the City to
         accommodating 100 percent of the shortfall of sites necessary to
         accommodate the housing needs for very low- and low-income households
         for both planning periods. Further, the Programs must ensure the City’s
         Zoning Code allows multifamily residential uses “by right”. In addition,
         Chapter 724 requires that the adequate sites programs provide minimum
         densities of at least 20 units per site. Each site must accommodate at least 16
         units. Moreover, when relying on program(s) to accommodate the regional
         share need for lower-income households, Chapter 724 requires that at least
         50 percent of the low- and very low-income regional housing need be
         accommodated on sites designated exclusively for residential uses.
         1. 2000 – 2006 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
         Chart 4-1 illustrates the 2000-2006 RHNA (530 units) and the units
         permitted and/or constructed during that timeframe (955 units). All single-
         family units (852) are above moderate-income households. All multi-family
         units are considered moderate-income households. Nineteen secondary units
         were permitted between 2000 and 2006, of which 9 are considered low-
         income units and 10 are considered moderate-income units (see Section B.2
         below for an analysis of secondary unit potential). After accounting for
         permit activity since 2000, the City has a remaining RHNA of 254 units.
         Local governments can employ a variety of development strategies to meet
         their RHNA housing production goals, as provided in Government Code
         Section 65583(c)(1)). In addition to identifying vacant or underutilized land
         resources, local governments can address a portion of their adequate sites
         requirement through the provision of secondary units.
                                                                        City of Pismo Beach

                As Chart 4-1 indicates, the City has a remaining unaccommodated 2000-2006
                RHNA of 254 units of this 243 are very low and low-income units. These
                lower income units will be addressed by implementing Program HE-1 to
                rezone for higher density residential development. See discussion below
                under Pending Projects and Opportunity Sites for analysis of sites available
                to meet the remaining very low and low income RHNA.

                2. 2007 – 2014 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
                The City’s RHNA for the 2007-2014 planning period (157 units) is shown in
                Chart 4-2. Since the planning period began on January 1, 2007, planning and
                building permits issued since then can count toward the City’s current
                RHNA. As shown in Chart 4-2, 59 building permits (all above moderate-
                income) have been issued since January 1, 2007. In addition, two secondary
                units were permitted (considered to be affordable to low-income and
                moderate-income households). See Section 4.B.2 for an analysis of
                secondary unit potential and affordability.
                The vacant land inventory (Section 4.B.1 below) identifies the potential for
                373 units. While most of these are expected to accommodate above
                moderate-income households, the vacant land inventory identified 18
                potential moderate-income units in the downtown core due to their typically
                smaller size. In addition, the vacant land inventory shows that 16 units can
                be accommodated in higher density zones (these have been allocated to
                seven very low-income housing units and nine low-income housing units).
                A review of City planning permit records indicates that 4.2 secondary units
                are constructed, on average, every year (see Section 4.B.2 for an analysis of
                secondary unit potential). Using this historical average, it is assumed that 23
                secondary units will be permitted between January 1, 2009, and June 30,
                2014. Based on these historical trends, affordability thresholds, and current
                market rates, it was estimated that 11 low-income and 12 moderate-income
                secondary units will be constructed by 2014.

         In addition to the above building potential, the Oak Park project was
         approved by the City Council on January 6, 2009. The site consists of
         approximately 10.6 acres of undeveloped commercial property located north
         of Highway 101 adjacent to the Pacific Coast (OSH) shopping center. The
         site is located in the General Commercial Zone of the Toucan Terrace
         Planning Area. The project includes approximately 57,000 square feet of
         mixed commercial space and 76,000 square feet of residential development.
         The residential component is 50 units in the following configuration: five
         single-family residences, five duplex units, eight live/work units, one 20-unit
         apartment building, one 12-unit condominium building, and one mixed use
         residential/commercial retail building. Of the 50 residential units, four will be
         deed restricted to meet the housing needs of very low-income (two units)
         and low-income households (two units).
         After accounting for permit activity since January 2007, vacant land, and
         secondary units potential, the City has an unmet RHNA of 27 very-low
         income and 2 low-income units. The City has included Program HE-2 to
         identify sites for the current RHNA. The City has identified opportunity sites
         that could accommodate a total of 486 affordable units based on reasonable
         development scenarios presented in Section B.3 below.

         B. Sites Inventory and Analysis
         Local governments can employ a variety of development strategies to meet
         their RHNA housing production goals, as provided in Government Code
         Section 65583(c)(1)). In addition to identifying vacant or underutilized land
         resources, local governments can address a portion of their adequate sites
         requirement through the provision of secondary units. This section
         summarizes the vacant land inventory, secondary unit potential, and pending
         projects and opportunity sites.
                                                                       City of Pismo Beach

                                                                           Housing Resources
                1.       Vacant Land Inventory
                State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the
                importance of an adequate land supply by requiring that each housing
                element “. . . identify adequate sites… to facilitate and encourage the
                development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels . . .”
                (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1)). If an adequate supply of new
                housing is to be provided, enough land must be zoned to allow for the
                construction of a variety of housing at densities that will satisfy the objectives
                of the housing element. The land must also have access to appropriate public
                services, such as water, sewage, storm drainage, and roads.
                The vacant land inventory (Chart 4-3) identifies the potential for 373 units.
                The City has over 59 acres of low-density vacant land located in the C-1, PR,
                R-1, R-2, R-4, and RSL Zones that can accommodate 357 residential units.
                While most of these sites are expected to accommodate above moderate-
                income households, the vacant land inventory identified 18 potential
                moderate-income units in the Downtown Core due to their typically smaller
                size (see Appendix D). The vacant land inventory also shows 0.67 acres of
                high-density land in the R-3 zone that can accommodate approximately 16
                higher density units. These have been allocated to seven very low-income
                and nine low-income housing units (see Chart 4-2).
                Maps showing the location of vacant land can be found in Appendix C and a
                detailed table of the vacant land inventory can be found in Appendix D.

         Housing Resources
         Vacant land sites in Chart 4-3 are located in zones allowing residential uses
         and are clear of environmental constraints that preclude development.
         Development potential was determined in concert with the City’s knowledge
         of the sites. It was assumed that vacant single-family parcels could support
         one unit per parcel.
         2.       Secondary Unit Potential
         Over the past five years, the City annually permitted 4.2 secondary units on
         average. Using this historical average, it is assumed that 23 secondary units
         will be permitted between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. Based on the
         size of the units and rents in the City, the City estimates that half of these
         units (approximately 11) could be affordable to low-income households and
         half could be affordable to moderate-income households (approximately 12).
         See affordability limits in Chart 2-17 and current market rates in Chart 2-15.
         According to the research, market rents range from about $800 to $2,000 for
         different size units. This range is affordable to low and moderate-income
         households.
         The Pismo Beach secondary unit program encourages secondary units and
         provides flexibility in their development. The program is designed to assist
         homeowners in purchasing a home, provide security for people living alone,
         provide quarters for relatives, make more efficient use of infrastructure,
         increase the diversity of people living in neighborhoods, and provide an
         opportunity for low and moderate renters. As an incentive, secondary units
         may use the same utility connections as the primary residence. Secondary
         units are permitted in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-R, P-R, RSM, and RSL zones
         (secondary units are not permitted in the Pismo Heights District above the
         intersection of Longview and Stratford) on any lot size if they meet the
         following standards:
              - The lot must meet the required number of parking spaces for the
                  primary residence;
              - One additional parking space is required for the secondary unit;
              - Units must not be used for transient rental;
              - The combined footprint of the primary and secondary units must not
                  exceed the allowable lot coverage of the site;
              - The secondary unit must not exceed the size of the primary
                  residence;
              - All secondary units must meet Title 24 requirements for
                  conservation; and
                                                                       City of Pismo Beach

                          regulations that apply to the property, including the general plan and
                          coastal plan zoning ordinance.
                3. Pending Projects and Opportunity Sites
                The following is a description of current pending projects or sites that in the
                future could provide 486 housing unit opportunities. These sites exceed the
                total accommodated RHNA for the current and previous planning periods
                (272 total units).
                Affordable Housing Project – Lot 72, Tract 2554
                An affordable housing project is proposed on 0.75 acres of a 2.75-acre site
                located off of Highland Drive near Pismo Creek. The site has ocean views,
                is connected to downtown via a public bike path and is zoned Open Space
                with a low-density residential General Plan designation. The property would
                be rezoned and a General Plan amendment processed to allow exclusively
                high-density residential development at at least 20 units per acre. As
                proposed, the project is 21 units in seven two- and three-story apartment
                buildings with three units in each (15 three-bedroom units and six two
                bedroom units). Although affordability thresholds are to be determined, the
                project would be limited to very low- (4 units), low- (11 units), and moderate-
                income (6 units) units. The property owner has contacted the City and is
                willing to work with the City on an affordable housing project.
                City-Owned Site on Ocean View Avenue
                The City of Pismo Beach owns approximately .5 acre of useable land area
                adjacent to Pismo Creek that is accessed from Ocean View Avenue and is a
                part of a larger parcel that includes Pismo Creek, the Pismo Beach sewer
                treatment plant, and the Pismo Beach sports complex off of Frady
                Lane. Pismo Creek bisects the property to create an Ocean View Avenue
                frontage for a portion that is suitable for residential development. Because
                this portion of the property is partly located in the flood plain and is subject
                to a creek side buffer, 10 units will be developed. The developable portion
                of the site for housing is currently designated in the General Plan for High
                Density Residential. However, because the area is a part of a larger parcel
                that includes government facilities, the property is zoned for government
                uses. The City's Zoning Code conditionally permits housing in this zone, but
                it is limited to "publically subsidized low cost housing" which is 1) operated
                on a non-profit basis; 2) provides educational or health care services; or 3)
                provides recreational or visitor serving opportunities.

         Housing Resources
         To provide greater opportunity for housing development, a Zoning Code
         amendment to change the zoning to allow exclusively residential
         development at a minimum of 20 units per acre will be processed for
         consistency with the General Plan high-density designation for that portion
         of the .5-acre property located on Ocean View Avenue. This will provide the
         potential for 10 dwelling units, a realistic number of units given the site’s
         flood plain location and creek buffer constraints. The entire parcel will be
         subdivided to establish a separate parcel for that portion of the property
         located between Ocean View Avenue and Pismo Creek.
         City owned parcel at 360 Park Avenue
         The City owns a .65-acre parcel located adjacent to Pismo Creek. It has a
         General Plan high-density designation and Resort Residential zoning which
         will accommodate a 30 unit per acre density. Twenty affordable housing units
         could be developed at this location. Site amenities include convenient access
         to transportation and services downtown and pedestrian access to the Pismo
         Creek trail and a public park.
         Parcels Zoned R-2 in Pismo Heights & Franklin/Wilmar/Harbor
         View area
         Currently the areas (74 lots) noted in Figure 2 below include a Resort
         Commercial/Medium Density (9-15 units per acre) General Plan designation
         and a Zoning Code R-2 (two and three family residential) designation. The
         City may process a General Plan and Zoning Code amendment for these
         areas to a high density allowing exclusively high-density residential at a
         minimum of 20 units per acre. This change would accommodate the
         addition of an additional 155 high-density dwelling units.

                PG&E property
                The PG&E property consists of 25.27 acres, 22.4 acres of the parcel are
                located outside the coastal zone in the Commercial Service (CS) zoning
                district. Of the subject 22.4 acres, 2 acres are currently utilized, leaving a
                balance of 20.4 vacant acres available for development. The City will amend
                the CS zoning district to permit high-density residential development.
                Assuming half of the 20.4 acres property (10.2 acres) would develop as
                housing at 20 units per acre, it could result in the potential for 204 dwelling
                units. Water and sewer service is available to this area; and access to the site
                can be achieved at the end of Bello Street or Price Canyon Road. An
                amendment to General Plan policy LU-6 (identifying industrial land uses)
                would also be required to add housing as a potential permitted land use. The
                General Plan amendment will specify protection of sensitive habitats
                surrounding Pismo Creek and Pismo Marsh and require that industrial uses
                onsite comply with regulations and standards regarding air pollution, noise,
                waste disposal, vehicle access, and light and glare to ensure compatibility with
                residential uses.
                2251 Shell Beach Road
                The subject undeveloped one-acre site is currently identified in the City’s
                General Plan as a Medium Density residential area with Planned Residential
                zoning. Currently 15 units could be developed on the site. The City may
                process General Plan (to High Density, 16-30 units per acre) and Zoning
                Code (to R-3, multi-family) amendments to increase the potential of the site
                from 15 units to 30 units (some portion of the property must be dedicated to
                right of way expansion.
                1990 and 1996 Mattie Road in the Freeway Foothills Area
                These undeveloped sites comprise 2.6 acres currently designated Low
                Density in the Mattie Road Specific Plan area with a maximum density of 8
                units per acre. The sites are zoned Planned Residential, which provides for a
                variety of land use densities reflective of the General Plan and Specific Plan
                densities in place. With the current General Plan (1-8 units per acre) and
                Specific Plan (8 units per acre) permitted land use densities, approximately 21
                units could be accommodated. The City may process General Plan and
                Specific Plan amendments in the area to allow exclusively high-density
                residential development at a minimum of 20 units per acre. At higher
                densities the sites could accommodate 52 dwelling units.

                   Los Robles Del Mar Planning Area
                   The Los Robles Del Mar Planning Area is outside the City, but is in the City's
                   sphere of influence for future annexation. The property encompasses two
                   parcels and may be able to accommodate future residential growth. Land Use
                   element policy LU-N-23c encourages the specific plan and proposes a
                   density bonus of up to 100 percent. The site is intended for future
                   annexation, and with available water, could support approximately 312 units,
                   of which 60 could be affordable. The description of this planning area is
                   included for informational purposes and the City is not relying on sites in this
                   area to meet the Regional Housing Needs Allocation.
                   Price Canyon Planning Area
                   The Price Canyon Planning Area is more than 3,000 acres and presents
                   opportunities and associated challenges for future residential development.
                   The planning area consists of the Mankins Ranch, the Oak Park Area, a
                   PG&E parcel (a separate parcel from the one discussed above), the Arroyo
                   Grande Oil Field, the Tiexiera and Guidetti parcels and the Wilde property.
                   A projected 634 households, 1,586 residents, and 613 new jobs could be
                   added to the City at buildout. Much of the planning area is currently in
                   Williamson Act contracts. However, these contracts are anticipated to expire
                   and will not constrain development. The project has run into annexation
                   challenges due to lack of an adequate long-term water source. Much of the
                   land is in the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) or Area of Interest. The
                   description of this planning area is included for informational purposes and
                   the City is not relying on sites in this area to meet the Regional Housing
                   Needs Allocation.
                   Chart 4-4 lists opportunity sites noted above that could eventually be
                   suitable for higher density low and very low-income residential development.

                 Demolitions
                 Higher density housing construction has occurred on underutilized sites. A
                 review of building permits issued from 2001 through 2008 indicates that six
                 older single-family dwellings were replaced with higher density units,
                 including 15 multifamily units and 18 condominiums (see Chart 4-5). A
                 significant number of older single-family residences were also demolished
                 and replaced by newer and typically larger single-family residences.
                 Since 1982, it is estimated that 135 units have been demolished in the Coastal
                 Zone and 90 replacement units have been constructed in the Coastal Zone.
                 Approximately one-third of the demolished units or 45 units were low and
                 moderate-income units.

          C. Infrastructure and Environmental
                 Constraints
          Pismo Beach has a variety of infrastructure and environmental constraints
          that need to be addressed to accommodate new residential development,
          such as the hillsides, flooding, water supply, sewer system, roads, and other
          infrastructure. This section discusses these potential constraints to future
          residential development within Pismo Beach.
          1. Infrastructure Analysis
          Infrastructure adds to the cost of new construction (e.g. major and local
          streets; water and sewer lines; and street lighting). In most cases, these
          improvements are dedicated to the City, which is then responsible for their
          maintenance. Water and sewer service capacity is discussed below. An
          analysis of other site improvements is conducted in section 3.B.5.
          Water Service
          The City receives 2,836 acre-feet of water per year (AFA), which includes
          1,240 AFA from the State Water Project, 896 AFA from Lopez Reservoir,
          and 700 AFA from City wells #5 and #23. The City also has nine reservoirs
          that can provide storage for 5.21 million gallons. In 2008, the City’s surface
          and well water production was 2,207.98 acre-feet, which is approximately 82
          percent of capacity. The City has completed a Water System Master Plan
          which forecasts that demand can be met assuming contracts for water remain
          stable. Should a water shortage become imminent, the City will comply with
          State law requiring a priority permit allocation system for lower-income
          housing.
          Wastewater
          The City’s wastewater disposal system is composed of the treatment plant
          adjacent to Pismo Creek and the ocean outfall near Oceano, which is
          operated jointly with the San Luis Obispo County Sanitation District. In July
          2006, the Pismo Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant completed a $12 million
          upgrade and expansion project. The upgraded plant is now equipped with an
          advanced secondary treatment designed to accommodate and treat flows
          expected at full buildout of the City. The wastewater treatment facility has a
          design capacity of 1.9 million gallons per day (mgd), with a peak flow up to
          six mgd. The Plant operates at 27 percent capacity, which results in an
          average daily flow of 1.6 mgd. According to the General Plan EIR, average
          daily flow for residential use is 98 gallons per capita per day. Based on the
          average household size of 2.02 persons, the daily flow is 0.0002 mgd per
                                                                        City of Pismo Beach
Page 4-12                                                        2007-2014 Housing Element

                                                                             Housing Resources
                household. The average daily flow of the projected housing need (RHNA) is
                well within the capacity of the upgraded wastewater treatment system.
                2. Environmental Issues
                Environmental constraints to residential development typically relate to
                unsuitable soils, sensitive biological and coastal wildlife, topographic
                constraints, the potential for natural hazards, and the presence of hazardous
                wastes or other factors. This section analyzes the potential for natural and
                manmade hazards.
                Topography
                Pismo Beach’s topography includes perpendicular bluffs, gently sloping
                marine terraces, and steep hillsides. Slopes exceeding 30 percent grade are
                generally retained as permanent public or private open space (one notable
                exception is the Pismo Heights Planning Area). In the Coastal Zone portion
                of Pismo Heights the maximum slope that can be graded is 20 percent. The
                City has adopted Hillside Regulations to preserve and protect hillside areas,
                situate projects with the least environmental and visual impacts, and preserve
                significant features of the natural landscape. The City Hillside Development
                Standards apply to slopes of 10 percent or greater or sites where access will
                cross such slopes. The Planning Commission must approve a Development
                Permit or Coastal Development Permit prior to issuance of a building
                permit, grading permit, or tentative map approval. Projects must also comply
                with erosion, landscaping, grading, habitat protection, and viewshed
                requirements.
                Natural Hazards
                Land areas subject to hazards associated with steep slope, slope stability and
                drainage issues are designated by a Hazardous Overlay and Protection Zone.
                Geologic reports for development within this zone may be required and
                reviewed by the appropriate decision-making body prior to approval. The
                City has bluff setback requirements for all types of development in order to
                retain structural integrity for a minimum of 100 years and to minimize the
                effects of erosion, geologic instability or destruction of the site. For
                development on single-family residential lots subdivided prior to 1981, the
                minimum setback is 25 feet from the top of the bluff. For all other
                development, a site specific, geological study is required.
                Flooding hazards stem from Pismo Creek/Price Canyon, the Meadow
                Creek/Pismo Marsh drainage ways, and from the ocean. The flood plain
                maps in Appendix E show that substantial developed areas in the
                commercial core and Pismo Creek Planning Area could be subject to

          flooding from a 100-year storm. The majority of the Meadow Creek flood
          plain, contained within the Pismo Beach Ecological Preserve, is protected
          from residential development. Following flooding in 1971, however, the U.S.
          Army Corp of Engineers improved the Pismo Creek Channel. New projects
          are subject to the requirements of the City’s Flood Plain Overlay Zone and
          FEMA regulations.
          Pismo Beach is located is a seismically active area however there are no
          known active faults underlying the City itself. The only fault known to occur
          in Pismo Beach is the San Miguelito Fault, which lies along the east bank of
          Pismo Creek. However, this fault is considered inactive. The greatest
          potential of seismic risk is associated with the San Andreas Fault located 40
          miles to the east. The Nacimiento fault is a secondary source of strong
          ground shaking but would have a negligible effect on Pismo Beach. The
          potential for liquefaction, landslides, and tidal waves is present throughout
          the community if an earthquake was to occur. The City has adopted various
          building codes and development review procedures to reduce such hazards.
          Coastal Foothills
          As established in the General Plan Policy CO-9, all land above the 200 ft.
          contour line is designated as permanent open space. In this designation, the
          maximum permitted number of dwelling units is calculated on the basis of
          the amount of land up to the 250 foot contour but excludes lands on existing
          natural slopes greater than 30 percent. No building pads or structures are
          permitted above the 200-foot contour. A scenic or open space easement
          prohibiting development above the 200-foot contour is required to be
          dedicated to the City as a condition of approval of development below the
          200-foot contour.
          D. Financial and Administrative Resources
          Developing affordable housing in a high-priced market, such as in Pismo
          Beach, requires access to local, State, and federal funding, as well as,
          organizations with the expertise to build and manage affordable housing.
          Pismo Beach has the following financial and administrative resources
          available for affordable housing development and conservation.
          1. Financing Resources
          State Funding Sources and Information
          The Department of Housing and Community Development identifies and
          provides detailed information on grants and loans available for affordable
                                                                        City of Pismo Beach

                Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside
                As required by State law, the Pismo Beach Redevelopment Agency (RDA)
                sets aside 20 percent of all tax increment revenue generated from
                redevelopment projects. The Agency’s set-aside funds must be used for
                activities that increase, improve, or preserve the supply of affordable
                housing. Housing developed under this program must remain affordable to
                targeted income groups for at least 55 years for rentals and 45 years for
                ownership housing. The RDA Implementation Plan specifies that
                redevelopment set-aside funds will be used for land acquisition, gap
                financing, and other projects that support the production of affordable
                housing.
                As of April 2009, the balance in the Low and Moderate Income Housing
                Fund was $1,881,000. A Home Improvement program for low to moderate
                income individuals was established with $800,000 of this funding and as
                discussed further, to date 80 homeowners have been assisted. Another
                $1,000,000 was utilized to purchase property for the development of 20
                affordable housing units at 360 Park Avenue.

          Inclusionary Housing Fee Funds
          The City’s inclusionary housing program offers the option of paying a fee in
          lieu of building affordable housing. Fees deposited into the account must be
          used in the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing.
          As of October 2009, the Fund has a balance of $1,855,000 Program HE-22
          proposes to use these funds for land acquisition, construction of new
          housing, or the rehabilitation of existing housing. Program HE-22 also
          propose revision to the Inclusionary Ordinance to encourage more onsite
          affordable housing development.
          2. Administrative Resources
          Housing Authority of San Luis Obispo County
          The Housing Authority of San Luis Obispo County was created to provide
          housing assistance for the County's lower-income residents. The Housing
          Authority administers the Section 8 rental assistance program and manages
          public housing developments. The Housing Authority also administers the
          Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, Security Deposit Program, and other
          programs. Currently, the County Housing Authority provides 30 Section 8
          vouchers to very low-income households in Pismo Beach, and 13 persons are
          on the waiting list.
          People’s Self-Help Housing
          People's Self-Help Housing (PSHH) is a diverse, nonprofit organization
          committed to furthering opportunities for decent, safe, affordable housing
          and support services in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura
          Counties. PSHH has two primary programs – Self Help Homeownership
          Program and a Rental Housing Development and Construction Services
          Program. Since its inception in the 1960s, PSHH has developed more than
          1,000 homes and 1,200 rental units and assisted in the rehabilitation and
          repair of more than 3,000 housing units. PSHH currently owns and operates
          the only affordable project in Pismo Beach, Sea Haven Apartments, which
          has 12 low-income units. It was purchased in 1998 with assistance from the
          City CDBG funding.
          PSHH also provides free seminars to residents on the Central Coast
          including those aimed at first time homebuyers and foreclosure prevention.
          Community Action Partnership (CAP)
          CAP (formerly known as the Economic Opportunity Commission, EOC)
          provides a wide variety of social services in San Luis Obispo County. Their
          divisions are Homeless Services, Head Start, Health Services, and Energy
          Conservation Services. CAP operates the Maxine Lewis Memorial Homeless
          Shelter and the Prado Day Center in San Luis Obispo. They also operate
                                                                        City of Pismo Beach

                                                                          Housing Resources
                Head Start and Migrant Head Start programs and two health centers in San
                Luis Obispo and Arroyo Grande. The Energy Conservation division
                provides weatherization and home repairs throughout the County. The City
                of Pismo contracts with CAP for their Home Improvement Program. This
                program was established in August 2008 and provides up to $20,000 in home
                repairs, alterations, and clean up for very-low and low-income homeowners.
                80 households (56 very-low income and 24 low income) have been served to
                date. The repairs include structural repairs and modifications to improve
                safety and accessibility. The City allocated $800,000 of Redevelopment Funds
                for this program. About 90 percent of the funds have been spent so far and
                it is anticipated the program will be extended. Program HE-24 proposes
                enhancements to the Home Improvement Program.

                                                           in the 1992 Housing Element. This
                was the last Housing Element adopted by the City, although the Department
                of Housing and Community Development did not certify it. The City did
                not adopt a Housing Element for the 2000 to 2006 housing allocation cycle.
                Chart 5-1 shows the Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the 1992
                Housing Element, which had a planning period between 1991 and 1999. The
                City does not have permit records available back to 1991. However, in 1998
                People’s Self Help Housing preserved 12 low-income units in the Seahaven
                project, which was purchased to prevent its conversion into condominiums.

         Housing Opportunity
         The 1992 Housing Element focused on expanding housing opportunities to
         low and moderate income persons and persons with special housing needs.
         To achieve this goal, the 1992 Housing Element contained a program to
         adopt an inclusionary housing ordinance. The inclusionary housing program
         was adopted in 2000 and applies to residential projects of 5 units or more
         and commercial projects of 5,000 square feet or greater.
         For residential projects the following requirements apply:
                For every 10 residential units built, one affordable unit shall be built,
                 or
                For any project with 5 or more residential units in-lieu fees shall be
                 paid equal to 5% or more of the building permit’s value, or
                For every 10 residential units built, one existing unit or piece of
                 property equal to or greater than the in-lieu fee in value shall be
                 dedicated for affordable housing, or
                A combination of the above methods subject to City Council
                 approval.
                If the project involves subdivision of residential lots only the
                 following is required:
                      o Dedication of the number of lots equal to 10% of the total,
                         or an equivalent land area, to the City for future development
                         of low and moderate income housing, or
                      o Pay in-lieu housing fees established by the City ordinance, or
                      o A combination of the above methods subject to City Council
                         approval.
                      o Projects with more than 1 unit but less than 20 units shall be
                         required to either provide affordable units at the same
                         percentages as in the first bullet above, or pay in-lieu fees
                         established by the City ordinance. If affordable units are
                         developed they can be built on a different site, if allowed by
                         the City.
                      o The percentage of housing set aside shall apply to the entire
                         development and be proportionally included in annual
                         phasing.
         For commercial projects the following requirements apply:
             For every 5,000 square feet of commercial area, one affordable unit
                 shall be provided, or
             For a commercial building 5,000 square feet or greater, in-lieu fees
                 shall be paid equal to or more than 2% of building permit value, or
                                                                       City of Pismo Beach

                         For every 5,000 square feet of commercial area, provide 1 used
                          dwelling or real property equal to the value of, or more than, the
                          applicable in-lieu fee, or
                         A combination of the above methods subject to City Council
                          approval.
                Additional details regarding the existing Inclusionary Housing Ordinance can
                be found in Zoning Ordinance Section 17.26. Since its adoption, developers
                have consistently chosen the in-lieu fee option because of the high costs
                associated with affordable housing. Program HE-22 proposes to revise the
                inclusionary ordinance to increase the inclusionary fee to more closely reflect
                the actual cost of producing affordable housing, adopt additional financial
                and regulatory incentives to help offset costs for developers, and encourage
                or require more onsite development of affordable housing. One benefit of
                amending the inclusionary housing will be the construction of affordable
                housing throughout the community.
                Methods for analyzing the in-lieu fee include a gap analysis, which would
                evaluate the difference or “gap” between what lower income households can
                afford and the construction and land costs for a given project(s). Another
                part of evaluating the ordinance would be to compare the Pismo Beach
                ordinance to the requirements of inclusionary housing ordinances in
                surrounding jurisdictions. Outreach to the development community will also
                be a part of the process of reviewing the ordinance. Input from the
                development community could provide valuable guidance about which
                inclusionary requirements are feasible and which incentives are the most
                effective given current market conditions.
                In 1998, the City adopted a new Zoning Code1, which is applicable to areas
                outside the City’s Coastal Zone. The 1998 Zoning Code implemented City
                housing programs and expanded housing opportunities by: 1) permitting
                emergency shelters by right in commercial zones; 2) permitting residential
                care facilities serving 6 or fewer persons by right in all residential zones; and
                3) conditionally permitting larger residential care facilities in all residential
                zones. The 1998 Zoning Code also permitted senior housing by right in all
                residential zones and permitted mixed-uses by right in commercial zones.
                The City plans to update the Zoning Code to allow for transitional housing
                in accordance with SB 2 (see Program HE-29).
                1
                  The Coastal Commission did not certify the 1998 Code due to differences surrounding
                policies on bluff lots. Thus, the City currently operates under two Zoning Codes – the 1983
                Zoning Code applies to the coastal zone and the 1998 Zoning Code applies outside the
                coastal zone.

         Housing Sites
         The feasibility of producing affordable housing is not only a function of
         housing demand and land values, but it is also dependent on appropriate
         zoning, development standards, water and sewer services, and other factors.
         While the City’s Zoning Code has sufficient density and development
         standards to enable affordable housing, vacant or underutilized sites in higher
         density zones are limited. The City proposes Programs HE-1and HE-2 to
         accommodate the RHNA requirements and to diversify the housing stock.
         Program HE-20 proposes a lot consolidation/merger and exceptions
         ordinance to allow the aggregation of smaller residential sites into larger sites
         to facilitate innovative and creative housing.
         Housing Preservation
         The 1992 Housing Element included four programs to preserve or replace
         affordable housing lost through demolition or conversion. These programs
         covered: 1) conversion of rental housing to condominiums; 2) conversion of
         rental mobile home spaces to ownership spaces; 3) demolition of rental
         housing within and outside the coastal zone; and 4) preservation of existing
         affordable housing in Pismo Beach. The City has implemented the Home
         Improvement Program with RDA Low and Moderate Income Housing
         Funds. The City continues to support housing preservation and these
         programs in the Housing Element update.

                                                         Pismo Beach. Housing programs
                                                         define the actions the City will use to
                                                         enact policies and achieve housing
                                                         goals. Proposed programs include
                                                         providing adequate sites for a variety
                                                         of housing types, density bonus
                                                         incentives, minimum densities,
                                                         inclusionary housing, redevelopment
                agency funding, maintaining the existing housing stock, housing for special
                needs groups, funding strategies, strategies for irregular parcels, fair housing,
                and energy conservation. In order to make adequate provisions for the
                housing needs of all economic segments, Pismo Beach has developed the
                following goals:
                    1) Identify sites with appropriate zoning and services to facilitate and
                        encourage the development of a variety of alternative housing types
                        for all income levels;
                    2) Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of
                        lower income and moderate-income households;
                    3) Address and, where appropriate and legally permissible, remove
                        governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
                        development of housing for people of all income levels and needs;
                    4) Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable
                        housing stock, which may include addressing ways to mitigate the
                        loss of dwelling units demolished by public or private action;
                    5) Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race,
                        religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial
                        status, or disability; and
                    6) Preserve the unique environmental features of Pismo Beach and
                        ensure that there is adequate water, wastewater treatment, roads,
                        parks, and other necessary infrastructure for new housing
                        development.

         Goals, Policies, & Programs
         Additionally, the following policies have been developed to complement the
         goals above:
             1) Provide a range of residential densities in the General Plan and
                 Zoning Code that permit a variety of housing types, including single
                 family homes, condominiums, rental apartments, mobile homes and
                 manufactured housing;
             2) Promote efficient land use patterns and encourage more intense
                 development near services;
             3) Encourage residential development of high architectural and physical
                 quality that is compatible with neighboring land uses;
             4) Maintain an inventory of sites suitable for housing to accommodate
                 the City’s share of regional housing needs;
             5) Seek appropriate private, local, State, and federal funding to
                 implement housing programs and construct housing units for very
                 low-, low-, and moderate-income households;
             6) Maintain and expand relationships with non-profit housing providers
                 with the goal of providing more affordable housing;
             7) Assume a leadership role in attaining the goals of the City’s Housing
                 Element and encourage public participation by all economic segments;
             8) Provide incentives to developers (profit and non-profit) for
                 affordable housing such as modified parking standards to minimize
                 the cost of parking;
             9) Consider programs to provide workforce housing in Pismo Beach
                 particularly for those in the service industry;
             10) Utilize redevelopment set-aside funds and other State and federal
                 funds, to assist in creating affordable housing and rehabilitating
                 unsound housing structures;
             11) Promote smaller, rental units and a variety of housing types, such as
                 courtyard housing, studios, and live/work units;
             12) Promote the continued maintenance of existing mobile home parks;
             13) Accommodate and promote the development of special housing
                 needs, such as shelters for the homeless, transitional housing, housing
                 for seniors, large families, female-headed households, and housing
                 for persons with physical, developmental, or mental disabilities.
             14) Provide a point of contact for referral of discrimination complaints;
                 and
             15) Promote energy conservation and ensure that all new development
                 complies with State law regarding energy use and conservation.

               HE-1. 2000-2006 Regional Housing Need
               Under State law, the City must meet the unaccommodated need from the
               previous planning period (2000-2006). This requirement is in addition to the
               requirement to identify sites to accommodate the RHNA for the new
               planning period (2007-2014) (see Program HE-2). The jurisdiction may not
               count capacity on the same sites for both planning periods.
               In order to meet the 2000-2006 RHNA, the City shall amend the General
               Plan and Zoning Ordinance, as necessary and shown on Chart 4-4, to
               accommodate 243 residential units “by right” at a minimum of 20 dwelling
               units per acre. The sites rezoned must be able to accommodate a minimum
               of 16 units per site. At least half (50 percent) of these sites shall be zoned for
               residential uses only. The applications can be subject to design review as
               long as the project does not trigger the CEQA review process.

         In order to meet State law requirements (Government Code Sections
         65583(c)(1) (A) and 65583(c)(1) (B)) to address the 2007 – 2017 RHNA, the
         City shall amend the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, as necessary,
         and shown on Chart 4-4 to provide adequate sites for 29 very low and low-
         income units at a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre “by right” on
         certain sites or in certain zones. The sites rezoned must be able to
         accommodate a minimum of 16 units per site. At least half (50 percent) of
         these sites shall be zoned for residential uses only. The applications can be

         HE-3. Alternative Sites
         Under limited circumstances, State law allows local governments to count
         existing units toward meeting their regional housing need. Under the
         alternative sites analysis, a local government may take credit for existing units
         that will be: 1) substantially rehabilitated, 2) converted from non-affordable
         to affordable (multifamily rental housing of 4 or more units), or 3) preserved
         at affordable housing costs to low or very low-income households. As new
         projects, code enforcement actions, and other opportunities arise, the City
         will investigate ways to meet their housing needs through rehabilitation and
         preservation of existing units.

         The City will encourage and assist developers to utilize the density bonus
         provisions of the state Government Code that allows an increase in the
         number of units in the underlying zone in return for construction of lower
         income housing (extremely low, very low, and low-income units). The City
         will also amend the Zoning Ordinance (both the 1983 and 1998 Zoning
         Ordinances) to comply with changes in the State Density Bonus law
                                                                        City of Pismo Beach

               As a means to ensure the quality of homes and neighborhoods, the City will
               continue to operate the code enforcement program on a complaint basis,
               whereby the Building Department investigates complaints and ensures that
               property owners comply with City codes. Pismo Beach’s housing is
               maintained and generally in good condition. In addition, because of the high
               cost of land and significant escalations in housing prices over the past few
               years, property owners are rehabilitating older properties or demolishing
               units and rebuilding them.

         Public Lands: Properties that are not needed for other public purposes or
         may accommodate residential development as a secondary but permitted use
         will be available for affordable housing development (extremely low, very
         low, and low-income units). The City will process an amendment to General
         Plan policy LU-4 to include housing in the Public and Semi-Public land use
         category and as a permitted use in the corresponding Government zoning
         district.
         Surplus land owned by other public agencies will also be reviewed for
         affordable housing prior to sale or transfer (e.g. school district sites). Such
         lands acquired by the City will be offered for sale or lease to private or
         nonprofit organizations.
         Industrial lands: Properties that are not needed for industrial purposes or
         may accommodate residential development as a secondary but permitted use
         will be available for affordable housing development (extremely low, very
         low, and low-income units). The City will process an amendment to General
         Plan policy LU-6 to include high-density (16-30 units per acre) housing in the
         Industrial Land Use category; and as a permitted use in the corresponding
         Commercial Service zoning district outside the Coastal Zone.
         Commercial land: Properties in Commercial areas will be available for
         affordable housing development (extremely low, very low, and low-income
         units) as a secondary use. General Plan policy LU-5b already identifies
         secondary dwelling units as permitted in the non-resort commercial areas. A
         1983 Zoning Code amendment will be processed to identify affordable
         housing units as a permitted but secondary use in the 1983 Zoning Code.
         As opportunities for implementation of this program arise, it will help
         achieve the quantified objectives in Programs HE-1 and HE-2.

               As an incentive to providing workforce and affordable housing in the
               downtown core, modifications to building lot coverage, lot size, parking
               requirements and setbacks will be permitted without a variance for residential
               or mixed-use projects with a finding that a certain percentage of units are
               affordable to lower or moderate-income households. In particular, the City
               will evaluate the multifamily parking requirements then review and revise
               multifamily parking requirements for one bedroom and studio units to
               ensure requirements do not unduly constrain housing development. The City
               will also amend the Zoning code to provide specific standards and criteria for
               the modifications as referenced in Policy HE-17.

          affordable housing throughout the City. Incentives included in the permit to
          encourage workforce housing could include expedited permit processing or

          The Pismo Beach Zoning Code allows the construction of single-family
          residences in multiple family zones. This practice does not always result in
          the most efficient use of resources and may hamper the City’s ability to
          achieve its regional housing needs goals. Thus, the Zoning Code should be
          amended to prohibit new single-family homes in medium and high-density
          residential areas, unless a lot is substandard in size and cannot accommodate
          more than one unit. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include
          minimum densities in the R-2, R-3, RS-M, RR-L, R-4, RR, and RR-H districts
          to preserve the limited supply of multi-family zoned land for multifamily
          uses.

               Pismo Beach was subdivided many years before the formal adoption of a
               Zoning Code. Many lots within the community are substandard when
               current standards are applied. It is common to seek a variance to develop a
               parcel in certain areas. Moreover, a number of contiguous, often small and
               irregularly shaped, lots are “underutilized”. The Zoning Code could be
               amended to facilitate and encourage the development of quality market rate
               and affordable housing on these lots. The City will develop an exception
               process for nonconforming lots that includes a flexible approval process and
               development standards. Lot consolidation regulations could also help to
               merge otherwise substandard and underutilized sites.

               In 1998, the City updated the Zoning Code for the entire City. However, the
               Coastal Commission did not certify the 1998 Zoning Code due to policy
               differences on bluff lots and development. Thus, Pismo Beach currently
               operates under two Zoning Codes (1983 and 1998). The City’s 1983 Zoning
               Code applies to the two-thirds of the community located within the Coastal
               Zone. The City will continue to work with the Coastal Commission on
               revisions to the 1998 Zoning Code in an attempt to obtain certification.
               Developing a consolidated code will assist developers and property owners
               to identify development requirements, as well as, provide a more streamlined
               approach to the approval process.

               over five units, commercial projects exceeding 5,000 square feet, and
               subdivision of 10 or more residential lots. Inclusionary in-lieu fees can be
               used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of housing affordable
               to very low, low, and moderate-income households.
               The City shall amend the Inclusionary Ordinance to: 1) encourage the
               production of affordable housing on site by providing development

          of building affordable housing; 3) specify a minimum percentage of units
          affordable to low versus moderate income households; 4) promote smaller
          units; and 5) Provide City discretion to require on-site construction.

Background
         The Land Use Element establishes the framework for development of the city, providing for the
general distribution, location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open
space, recreation, natural resources and other uses of public and private land.
         The Element includes both land use plan maps and a text. The policies and maps have been
harmonized with all other elements and policies of the General Plan. All elements of the General Plan
carry equal weight and the Land Use Element does not supersede other elements. In addition to policies
that apply to the entire city, the Land Use Element also contains specific policies for 18 individual
neighborhood Planning Areas.
         Table LU-1 summarizes existing development within the city and Table LU-2 summarizes a
projection of additional development that could be accommodated at full build out, based on land use
policies. Few cities actually ever completely build out so the number indicated can be considered
maximum. Data is shown for planning areas, which are illustrated in Figure LU-1.
         In 1990, the city contained approximately 4,587 dwellings in single-family, duplex, multi-family,
condo and mobile homes, with a U.S. census population of 7,669. Build out shows a potential of 2,696
additional units for a total of 7,283 units. The build out analysis includes a potential for another 2,103 units
within the 1990 city limits plus another 593 units within the Sphere of Influence. Complete build out would
result in a population of about 13,000. From a residential perspective, the existing city limits are 69% built
out.
         The existing city includes 1,831 hotel and motel rooms with a potential of another 1,208 units for
a total of 3,039. In other words, from a hotel perspective, the city is 60% built out. These uses would only
be added as the market creates a demand.
         In the category of retail, service and office uses, the city currently has 953,542 sq. ft. of building
area. Build out projects a potential for 648,000 additional sq. ft. for a total of 1,601,542 sq. ft. In other
words, from a commercial perspective, the city is 60% built out.
         Within the Sphere of Influence area there is land available for an additional 593 dwelling units.
         At a 3% annual growth rate the entire city, including the Sphere of Influence area, would be 100%
residentially built out by the year 2005.
                                                                                                    LU-2

Principles
P-13     Natural Resource Preservation
         All land use proposals shall respect, preserve and enhance the most important natural resources
         of Pismo Beach; those being the ocean and beaches, hills, valleys, canyons and cliffs; and the
         Pismo and Meadow Creek streams, marsh and estuaries. (See related principles and policies in
         the Conservation Element.)

   Amended: R 98-71
                                                                                            LU-5
P-14 Immediate Ocean Shoreline
     The ocean, beach and the immediate abutting land are recognized as an irreplaceable national
     resource to be enjoyed by the entire city and region. This unique narrow strip of land should
     receive careful recognition and planning. The purpose of the beach is to make available to the
     people, for their benefit and enjoyment forever, the scenic, natural, cultural, and recreational
     resources of the ocean, beach and related up-lands. (See related principles and policies in the
     Conservation Element.)
P-15 Visitor/Resident Balance
     The California coast is an extremely desirable place to live, work and recreate that belongs to all
     the people. As such, congenial and cooperative use by both residents and visitors is recognized.
     Such use should capture the best attributes of the city and creatively determine the acceptable
     place, scale, intensity, rate and methods for development consistent with resource protection and
     public benefit.
P-16 Historic Ambiance
     Pismo Beach contains the historic ambiance of the small California beach town. This is
     particularly evident in downtown and Shell Beach. Although hard to define, the preservation of
     this ambiance is important and the city shall encourage its preservation. This ambiance provides
     a link with the past, creates a pleasant experience, and adds to community diversity.
Policies
LU-1 Land Use Maps
     Land uses shall be regulated as shown on the Land Use Map, Figure LU-2 and the maps for
     individual neighborhood planning areas. In case of conflict, the maps for the individual planning
     areas shall take precedence. Land-use categories applicable to the Downtown area are stated in
     the policy section for that sub-area.
LU-2 Residential Uses
     Residential land uses include the categories of Low, Medium and High density. Specific policies
     for residential uses are:
     a.       Variety of Residential Land Uses Encouraged
              In order to provide a variety of housing choices for all income groups and create
              residential areas with distinctive identity a wide variety of densities and housing types
              shall be encouraged.
     b.       Cluster Development Encouraged
              Cluster developments are encouraged where they provide increased open space, better
              visual qualities, and additional preservation of sensitive sites, decreased cost of
              municipal services or an opportunity to provide affordable housing.
     c.       Churches
              Churches may be allowed on lands in the residential categories as set forth in the Zoning
              Ordinance. Normally a conditional use permit should be required.
     d.       Densities
                                                                                              LU-6
               Permissible housing densities are established within three broad categories shown in
               Table LU-3.
                                                   Table LU-3
                                  Housing Categories and Density
                        Category                           Density
                        Low Density                        1 to 8 units per ac.
                        Medium Density                     9 to 15 units per ac.
                                                                                  2
                        High Density                       16 to 30 units per ac.
               These densities are maximums. It may not be desirable or appropriate to meet these
               densities in any specific situation. The maximum number of dwelling units shall be
               determined for individual parcels as follows:
               • Gross parcel area is computed in square feet or acres.
               • The amount of parcel area that is unbuildable is calculated, including but not limited
                    to acres with slopes greeter than 30%, existing roadways, waterways.
               • Net buildable parcel area is calculated as a-b.
               • The maximum number of units or lots is the product of the density factor and the net
                    buildable area.
               Population density is estimated as follows:
                     2.05 persons/unit within the 1981 city limits
                     2.5 person/unit in sphere of influence
               See also Conservation/Open Space Element CO-l, Siting of Multi-Family Projects
               Planning Area R within the City’s sphere of influence is designated as Watershed and
               Resource Management. Within the Pismo Beach Watershed and Resource Management
               land use designation permissible housing density is two family units per parcel with a
               minimum parcel size of 40 acres.
       e.      Density Bonuses
               In return for provision of housing that is affordable to lower income households, the City
               may permit a residential density bonus of 25% over the number of units otherwise
               allowed by the housing density categories shown in Table LU-3. (see Policy H-2)
               For housing projects which are (1) located in the medium or high density residential use
               categories and (2) restricted to elderly households, the bonus may be increased to 50%
               above the density shown in Table LU- 3 for the applicable category, provided that 50 % of
               the total units in the project are affordable to very low income elderly households. (See
               Policy H-3)
LU-3   Public and Semipublic Land Use
       The Public and Semipublic category shall designate land in public ownership that should be
       developed for public use and various public facilities. This category does not include public parks.
LU-4   Resort Commercial Land Uses
       The Resort Commercial land use shall allow various visitor services including motels, hotels and
       R.V. Parks. Floor area ratios shall not exceed 1.25. Specific policies for these uses are:
       a.      All Income Levels
               Resort commercial activities shall be promoted catering to visitors of all income levels.
       b.      Conversion Prohibited

           Conversion of visitor-serving lodging to other non-visitor-serving types of uses shall be
           prohibited unless the cost of rehabilitation is greater than 50 percent of the market value
           of the structure or the city finds, based upon supporting data, that the existing use can no
           longer be made economically viable. Where conversion is allowed, the city may require
           on or off site replacement of the lost visitor serving lodging. (See related Housing
           Element H- 13, Older Motels and Cottages.)
     c.    R.V. Parks Restricted
           R.V. parks shall be restricted to the Pismo Creek Planning Area "L".
     d.    Non-visitor-serving Uses
           The Resort Commercial category is specifically intended to be set aside for visitor-serving
           uses. Residential and/or non-visitor-serving commercial uses may be permitted on lands
           designated within this category only if one of the following findings is made:
     1.    The size, shape or location of the parcel make it inappropriate for a visitor-serving use; or
     2.    The use is low-or moderate-income housing that is clearly subordinate and accessory to
           an on-site hotel or motel use and is established for, and limited to occupancy by,
           employees of the hotel, motel or other nearby visitor-serving establishments. Uses, which
           shall be specifically prohibited, include office space for general or medical businesses,
           and non-retail commercial services.
     e.    Condominium Hotels Permitted
           The subdivision of hotels into airspace condominium units may be permitted with the
           approval of the City Council, provided that such units are clearly designed as hotel
           rooms or suites rather than dwelling units and are restricted to occupancy on a
           transient basis. Approvals of any such subdivision shall be subject to conditions that will
           assure the development functions primarily as visitor accommodations. Such conditions
           shall require recordation of enforceable deed restrictions limiting occupancy by any
           individual to a maximum of 30 calendar days per year, cumulative; compel participation in
           a rental program open to the general public on the same basis as non-condominium
           hotels; and discourage design features, which would be characteristic of long-term
           occupancy
LU-5 Commercial Land Uses
     The Commercial land use designations shall allow visitor- serving, neighborhood and regional
     commercial uses. Floor area ratios shall not exceed 2.0. Specific policies for these uses are:
     a.    Attractive and Stimulating Surroundings
           Commercial areas should be enjoyable places in which to shop and work. This means
           providing pedestrian scaled design, landscaping of building and parking lots, street trees,
           screening unsightly storage areas and banning out of scale advertising.
     b.    Secondary Residential Uses Encouraged
           Residential uses are encouraged on upper floors in all commercial areas. Secondary
           residential use may be required in selected areas. See also:

     c.    Drive-Thrus Prohibited
           In order to maintain and promote a more pedestrian-oriented beach community
           character, as well as to reduce the high volume of vehicle trips attracted by drive-thru
           establishments, the City shall prohibit any new development of drive-thru services in
                                                                                                  LU-8
                restaurants, banks, dry cleaners and other business establishments in all planning areas
                                                  3
                located within the Coastal Zone .
LU-6   Industrial Land Use
       The Industrial land use designations shall permit nonpolluting, warehousing, distribution,
       assembly and light manufacturing uses. Floor area ratios shall not exceed 1.5. Specific polities for
       these uses are:
       a.       Pismo Creek & Pismo Marsh Impacts
                Industrial development shall not adversely impact the sensitive habitats of Pismo Creek
                or Pismo Marsh.
       b.       Industrial Standards
                Industrial uses shall comply with industrial regulations and standards, including: air
                pollution, noise, waste disposal, access for delivery vehicles and light and glare. These
                uses should be designed to present a pleasant appearance and shall include appropriate
                landscaping.
       c.       Open Storage Yards
                Open storage yards of material and equipment are discouraged and subject to design
                review, may be prohibited.
LU-7   Child Care Facilities
       The City may grant a density bonus or provide other incentives for developers of commercial or
       industrial projects to include a childcare facility within their project.
LU-8   Open Space
       Open space land use designations include public parks and private lands intended to remain in
       open space or private parks. Open space lands shall not be developed intensively with buildings
       or other structures.
LU-9   Chumash Cultural Resources Preservation
       Appropriate measures for Chumash Cultural Resources Preservation shall be provided with
       future development of private and public property, including California Environmental Quality Act
       compliance and meaningful consultation with local Chumash groups, as noted on the native
       American Heritage Commission’s “California Tribal Consultation List.” Archeological studies shall
       be performed by members of the Register of Professional Archaeologists, and should follow the
       Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.
LU-10 Watershed and Resource Management (WRM) land uses
       The Watershed and Resource Management (WRM) land use designation is added to the
       City of Pismo Beach General Plan. The WRM land use designation is not part of the City
       of Pismo Beach Local Coastal Plan.
       The Watershed and Resource Management designation is intended to preserve and
       manage areas that provide watershed functions related to Pismo Beach’s water resources
       and to areas that provide natural, recreational, and scenic resources. The Watershed and
       Resource Management land use designation provides the special use limitations and
       standards that are essential for proper the preservation and management of watershed and
       water resources, and natural, recreational, and scenic resources as intended.
       a.       Land uses within areas designated as WRM are limited to those described below
                and are divided into (1) “permitted uses” for which no conditional use permit is
                required and (2) uses that require a conditional use permit.

Neighborhood Planning Areas
Background
          The City has been divided into 18 Neighborhood Planning Areas as shown on Figure LU-3.
Specific background and policies applying to each area are indicated in the following sections.
The Bluffs/Sunset Palisades
Planning Areas – A-1 & A-2
Background
The Bluffs/Sunset Palisades area is an ocean oriented, low profile residential neighborhood with a
backdrop of the coastal foothills. The planning area is almost totally developed in low-density residential
use with only a few scattered vacant residential lots. It includes the Ontario Ridge area, now known as
The Bluffs, which was annexed to the City in 1990 and has been developed since 1992.
The Bluffs
The bluff top area along the ocean fronting Bluffs subdivision consist of a 9-acre open space/recreational
parcel under ownership of The Bluffs homeowners association but with public access rights. The base of
this bluff area includes an intertidal habitat and natural resource area, which should be protected. There
is no public access to this sensitive area. Damage by wave conditions is possible and bluff erosion is an
ongoing process. Fifty-three acres of land on the upper slopes of The Bluffs are in permanent open
space.
Sunset Palisades
The Sunset Palisades neighborhood extends from Highway 101 to the ocean and is comprised of land on
both sides of Shell Beach Road, 6 acres of private open space in a gated community as well as the 5.7
acre Palisades public park. Archaeological resources are evident in the area.
The property between Shell Beach Road and U.S. Highway 101 has historically been utilized as open
space with limited residential development. This area is subjected to high noise levels from both U.S.
Highway 101 and Shell Beach Road.
The bluff tops along the Sunset Palisades stretch of coast are primarily under private ownership.
Homes along these ocean fronting bluffs have provided their own stairways to small beaches. Some of
these have been damaged in past storms. Seawalls to protect an existing structure are permitted only if
there is no other less environmentally damaging alternative.
The Bluffs Policies
LU-       Concept
  A-1     The Bluffs is designated Low Density residential Development and Open Space with an
          emphasis on preservation of the natural setting and with public access and recreation along the
          ocean bluffs.
LU-       Upper Slopes and Hillsides
  A-2     The upper slopes and hillsides of The Bluffs are subject to an open space easement and
          restricted to agricultural open space for limited cattle grazing. No structures are permitted in this
          area. See Conservation/Open Space, Coastal Foothills.
LU-       Blufftop Park
  A-3     The bluff top park, owned by The Bluffs homeowners association includes public walking and
          bicycle trails and public parking spaces to assure public access to the bluff-top and lateral
          access across the entire Bluffs area. The Bluffs Drive area shall remain clearly and
          conspicuously posted for public access and use. The management of lateral bluff-top access
                                                                                                LU-16

     within the City should be coordinated with the County of San Luis Obispo to assure continuity of
     access to the Cave Landing Road area. Extremely steep, unstable bluffs preclude vertical access
     to the beach from within the City.
LU-  Hillside Development Regulations
 A-4 Development shall be prohibited on lands with slope in excess of 30 percent and above the 200
     ft. contour.
LU-  Bluff Protection and Setbacks
 A-5 Setbacks for the public road and public pedestrian walkway and bikeway shall at a minimum meet
     a 50-year bluff erosion setback; setbacks for residential development shall meet a 100-year bluff
     erosion set- back plus 20 feet.
Sunset Palisades Policies
LU-  Concept
 A-6
     Sunset Palisades, an area of existing homes with scattered vacant lots, is designated for Low
     Density Residential development. The emphasis is on maintaining coastal views, open space and
     protecting the coastal bluffs and intertidal habitat area. Infill development shall be compatible with
     the existing community.
LU-  Height of Structures
A-7
     a.       E1 Portal Drive, Indio Drive
              No structure shall exceed 15 feet in height when measured from the highest point of the
              site natural grade to the highest point of the structure; Nor shall any such structure
              exceed 25 feet, in height, when measured from the highest point of the roof above the
              center of the building foot print to the elevation of the natural grade directly below that
              point.
     b.       Remainder of Planning Area
              No structure shall exceed 15 feet in height as measured from the height of the center of
              the finished building pad grade as designated in the final tract Grading Plan at the time of
              recordation.
LU-  Open Space
 A-8
     The area between Shell Beach Road and the 101 Freeway shall remain in permanent open
     space. No further land divisions shall be in this approved area. Density transfers, public
                                                                                              LU-17
      acquisition or other methods shall be utilized to achieve the open space goal. Properties for
      density transfer need not be in the same ownership. Density transfer on a 3:1 basis may be
      allowed to any location in the city. Any development that may be approved on-site shall be
      required to maintain the open space character. The amount of site area that may be developed
      with improvements shall not exceed 5,000 sq. ft. or 60% of gross site area whichever is lesser.
LU-   Side Yards Views
 A-9
      Properties on the west sides of Indio Drive, Florin Street, and Hermosa Drive shall be subject to
      the Design Element D-38, Side Yard View Corridors.
LU-   Noise
 A-10
      Any development on lots adjacent to U.S. Highway 101 or Shell Beach Road shall provide
      mitigation to reduce exposure to excessive noise levels. (See Noise Element for standards.)
LU-   Beach Access and Bluff Protection
 A-11
               The coastal tidal and subtidal areas should be protected by limiting vertical access-ways
               to the rocky beach and inter-tidal areas. Lateral Beach access dedication shall be
               required as a condition of approval of discretionary permits on ocean front parcels
               pursuant to Policy PR-22. No new public or private beach stairways shall be allowed.
               Damaged nonconforming stairways utilized for ocean emergencies, animal rescue, fire
               fighting access or public safety may be repaired if a hazardous condition results from the
               damage. Any damaged stairway will be assessed by a city inspector to determine the
               presence of a hazardous condition. All structures shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet
               from the top of the bluff in accordance with the requirements of Policy S-3. Appropriate
               erosion control measures shall be required for any project along the bluff tops.
LU-   Topaz Street and Encanto Street
 A-12
      The Topaz Street and Encanto Street undeveloped accesses shall be developed as coastal
      viewpoints rather than as stairways. (See Park & Recreation Element, Figure PR-43, No. 2 & 3.
      See also Design Element D-13, Freeway Landscaping.) Low-lying drought tolerant prickly
      vegetation, which will deter undesignated access paths, should be planted at the top of the bluff.
      Park benches are recommended to encourage use of these areas as viewpoints. Attractive
      railings should be used to protect the bluffs rather than chain link fencing. The Topaz cul-de-sac
      may be eliminated in favor of a pocket park or expanded viewpoint. The access points should be
      maintained so that the landscaping of abutting properties does not intrude on them.
                                                                                           LU-18
LU-1
South Palisades
Planning Area B
Background
          The South Palisades Planning Area includes clustered multi-family and single family residential
development. Each parcel in this area includes 60 percent of open space, preservation of views from
U.S. Freeway 101 to the ocean, and a 100 ft wide lateral access dedication to the City for public parks
and open space along the entire cliff.
          The ocean bluffs range in height from 40-50 feet at the north end to 80 feet at the south end of
the planning area. San Luis Obispo County has an easement from the toe of the bluff to the mean high
tide line. A sandy beach extends for most of the length of the oceanfront in this area. One public stairway
to the beach below exists and one more public stairway is planned.
LU-       Concept
  B-1
          The South Palisades area is designated for Medium Density Residential development. The entire
          area is one neighborhood with an emphasis on open space and scenic corridors. A 100 ft wide
          lateral bluff-top open space area/access-way is the focus for the area.
LU-       Open Space
  B-2
          The area between Shell Beach Road and the 101 Freeway shall be retained as permanent open
          space. No further land division shall be approved in this area. Density transfers, public acquisition
          or other methods shall be used to achieve the open space goal. Properties for density transfer
          need not be in the same ownership. Where the same owner owns properties on both sides of
          Shell Beach Road, no development shall be allowed between Shell Beach Road and the 101
          Freeway. Where a structure already exists within the open space area, it will be permitted to
          remain until the parcel in the same ownership is developed. At that time, the building shall be
          either moved out of the open space or demolished. Density transfer on a 3:1 basis may be
          allowed. Any development that may be approved on-site shall be required to maintain the open
          space character. The amount of site area that may be developed with improvements shall not
          exceed 5,000 sq. ft., or 60% of gross site area, whichever is lesser.
LU-       Lateral Bluff-top Open Space and Access
  B-3
          The width of the lateral bluff-top conservation/open space and access dedication requirement set
          forth in Policy PR-23 shall be increased to a distance equal to the 100-year bluff retreat line plus
          100 ft. for all development on the shoreline in this planning area. Future park improvements and
          trail/bicycle path amenities shall be funded by new development in this area.
LU-       Road System
  B-4
          A loop road system is required and will provide public access to the linear bluff-top park and
          visual access to the ocean. Where the loop system is infeasible due to bluff retreat, a cul-de-sac
          may be constructed for remaining parcels that have not yet been subdivided. The loop road
          system or cul-de-sac will be funded by future development and shall provide for public parking, as
          well as bicycle paths, which shall connect with the bluff top trail along the lateral blufftop
          conservation/open space and access dedication requirement noted in Policy LU-B-3. The number
          of public parking spaces available to serve the bluff-top park shall be maximized, and if a cul-de-
          sac system is planned, the number shall be no less than what would have been provided if a loop
          road configuration was constructed (including by providing public off-street parking, if necessary).
          Future development in this area shall be subject to the requirements of Design element Policy D-
          40.
                                                                                                  LU-20
LU-  Visual Access
 B-5
     Development of the South Palisades area shall protect visual access to the ocean and to
     dominant coastal landforms. Specifically, the size and location of structures shall retain to the
     maximum extent feasible intermittent views of the ocean from U.S. Highway 101. To accomplish
     these design objectives, the following standards shall be incorporated into the Specific Plan:
     1.       The building pads for all development shall be at or below existing grade.
     2.       Residential units shall be predominantly attached and clustered.
     3.       A minimum of 60 percent of each of the existing parcels within the planning area as of
              1992 shall be retained in open space. 4. Structures immediately landward of the required
              bluff setback shall not exceed 15 feet in height from the existing natural grade.
     4.       Structures immediately landward of the required bluff setback shall not exceed 15 feet in
              height from the existing natural grade.
     5.       Heights of structures other than those identified in subsection 4 above shall not exceed a
              maximum of 25 feet above natural grade. Two story structures shall be permitted only
              where it is determined that views of the ocean will not be blocked or substantially
              impaired. A visual analysis of potential view blockage shall be required for each
              development proposal.
     6.       Road right-of-way widths shall be complemented by an additional building setback of a
              minimum of 20 feet.
     7.       Open space shall be arranged to maximize view corridors through the planning area from
              public viewing areas to protect and maintain views of both the ocean and coastal foothills,
              as well as the visual sense of the coastal terrace landform. Accordingly, common open
              space shall have continuity throughout the development and shall not be interrupted by
              fences or other structures. (See also Design Element D-40, Focal Point Sites.)
LU-  Stairway Access to the Beach
 B-6
     One new stairway access to the beach shall be provided. (See Parks, Recreation & Access
     Element, Table PR-4 and Figure PR-3.) All developments within the South Palisades Planning
     Area shall contribute fees for construction of the stairways. The city may require, as a condition of
     approval of development projects, the installation of beach stairways, with reimbursement as fees
     are collected.
     As part of the public access at the drainage swale, parking spaces should be provided in several
     small lots. (See Parks, Recreation & Access Element, Figure PR-3, Access #6 and Policy PR-26,
     Specific Access Points.)
LU-  Special Environmental Conditions
 B-7
     Due to the sensitive nature of the South Palisades area, all developments shall include
     archaeological analysis, surface water runoff analysis, and U.S. Highway 101 noise mitigation.
     Geologic reports for development near the bluffs shall also be required. See also:

LU-  Public Parking
 B-8
     All existing public on-street and off-street parking spaces, including the 255 spaces identified in
     this area in a 2008 field survey, shall be maintained. Additionally, adequate signing notifying the
     public of the public parking opportunities and identifying the location of the access-way shall be
     provided.
                                                                                           LU-22
North Spyglass
Planning Area C
Background
The North Spyglass Area contains three major hotels, (the Dolphin Bay Resort, Cliffs
Hotel, Spyglass Inn) A key aspect of the area includes a 50 ft. wide lateral access at
the top of the bluffs and the stairway and related public parking at the northern
barranca. A bluff top trail spans the entire planning area which provides access to a
stairway to the beach adjacent to the Cliffs Hotel and the South Palisades Planning
area.
At the base of 50 ft. bluffs is a narrow sandy beach accessible during normal tide. Bluff
erosion is severe and development in this area requires a bluff erosion study and
consistency with Policy S-3.
Policies
LU-    Concept
 C-1
The North Spyglass Planning Area is oriented to visitor-serving hotel uses with related
public and private beach access and open space. The area is designated Resort
Commercial and Open Space.
                                                                           LU-23
LU-     Lateral Bluff-top Open Space and Access
 C-2
The width of the lateral bluff-top conservation/open space and access dedication requirement set forth in
Policy PR-23 shall be increased to a distance equal to the 100-year bluff retreat line plus 50 ft. for this
planning area. Future development of the Spyglass Inn will include a requirement for a path between
Spyglass Drive and the public lateral access.
                                                                                          LU-24
LU-     Views
 C-3
        Ocean views from U.S. Highway 101 and Shell Beach Road shall be protected to the maximum
        extent possible in the review and approval of development projects. View corridors shall be
        provided within any proposed development project.
LU-     Special Environmental Conditions
 C-4
        Due to the sensitive environmental features of the North Spyglass Planning Area all development
        applications shall include archaeological analysis, water run off and erosion analysis, and

Shell Beach
Planning Area H
Background
Planning Area H, with the exception of scattered vacant lots, is essentially developed. However, there is a
trend to expand or replace small beach cottages on small lots with large houses that are not always
compatible with the character of the community. Shell Beach embodies much of the historic ambiance
and flavor of small California beach towns.
A variety of retail and service uses front Shell Beach Road, including several small motels. The area
includes a small public library, a private recreational facility and the Shell Beach Veterans' building. The
Shell Beach ocean bluffs are significant recreational resources containing Eldwayen Ocean Park and
Margo Dodd Park which are the aesthetic focus of the community, along with Dinosaur Caves Park which
is located in the adjoining Dinosaur Caves Planning area. The parks and development on top of the bluffs
are seriously endangered by erosion.
Four beach access points are located in the Shell Beach Planning area, and Ocean Blvd and the trail at
the end of Ocean Blvd to Boeker street includes pedestrian and bicycle access.
Policies
LU-      Concept
  H-1
Shell Beach Road is bordered by a narrow commercial strip backed by a narrow band of High Density
Residential. Behind the High Density residential area to the Ocean, a medium density land use
accommodates single family homes in the area. The focus of this area is a more traditional beach
community with small single-family lots, street activity, and views of the ocean to the west, and the
                                                                                            LU-34
foothills to the east. The emphasis is on assuring that new and expanded homes are compatible with the
scale, bulk, and character of existing neighborhood.
LU-       Shoreline Qualifies
  H-2
          The unique shoreline qualities of Shell Beach shall be protected by:
          a.        Maintaining and improving public access along the bluff-tops.
          b.        Pursuing all available sources to provide the necessary funds to improve and maintain
                    the parks along the Shell Beach bluffs.
          c.        Instituting measures, such as signing and policing, to prohibit removal of tide-pool marine
                    life.
          d.        Designating the vista point at the end of Boeker Street as a bird observation area and
                    leaving it in its natural state for neighborhood use.
          e.        Making drainage pipes in the park areas as inconspicuous as possible and landscaping
                    park areas with drought resistant, low maintenance plants.
          f.        Continuing the program of erosion and animal control to protect the park areas.
LU-       Commercial Revitalization
  H-3
          a.        For the Shell Beach Road commercial strip, a funding plan shall be prepared for
                    amenities such as but not limited to signage, street trees, sidewalk improvements,
                    pedestrian scale street lights, public parking, and public art.
          b.        The city shall consider the use of Grant funds to provide for the plan and for low interest
                    loans for commercial revitalization.
LU-       Residential Guidelines
 H-4a
a.        Scale of Structures.
New residential development should be designed to reflect the small scale image of Shell Beach rather
than large monolithic buildings. Buildings should be designed with vertical, horizontal and roof articulation
of building faces.
b.        Orientation of doors, windows, and balconies to street.
Street frontage should consist of residential units with windows, doors, balconies and porches facing and
in reasonably close proximity to the street, both in terms of height (i.e., units at street level, rather than
raised) and in distance from the street (minimum set back). This type of orientation reinforces the
traditional beach and street active environment and increases street safety with "eyes" on the street.
(See Design Element D-4, Multi-family Design Criteria.) Where two-story buildings are proposed, the
second story shall be stepped back a minimum of 30% along the front elevation.
c.        Incentives for single level development
Incentives for one level development will only be provided for proposals compatible with the surrounding
area with building articulation and site design reflective of the Shell Beach small- scale image. While a
20’ setback to a garage is required, incentives for single level development without a requirement for a
variance include:
          -expanded total building area in excess of that specified in the implementing ordinance
          -front, side, and rear yard setbacks reduced from that specified in the implementing ordinance
          -a single car garage
                                                                                                 LU-35

LU-      Commercial Development Guidelines
 H-4b
a.       Scale of Structures.
New commercial development design shall reflect Shell Beach’s small scale image. Buildings shall be
designed with building elevation vertical, horizontal and roof articulation.
b.       Building Articulation.
Multiple story buildings shall include step backs of 7 feet or more for a second floor and 10 feet or more
for a third floor. Noncontiguous step backs shall be required for a minimum of 30% of the front elevation
frontage of each floor above the first floor.
 c.      Orientation of doors, windows, and balconies to street.
To reinforce interaction between the pedestrian and the commercial environment, street frontage adjacent
to Shell Beach Road shall include windows, doors, balconies, and where applicable, paseo entries.
d.       Public areas.
Public seating areas such as plazas, paseos, patios are required for development of projects over two or
more contiguous lots and single lots of 6,000 s.f. or greater. Similarly, seating areas are encouraged for
single lot development. Where public areas are not provided adjacent to the right of way, buildings shall
be placed at or within 8’ of the public right of way.
e.       Interior lots.
New development or redevelopment of commercial structures adjacent to Shell Beach Road, which are
not adjacent to a side street, shall participate in a parking in-lieu fee program for the Shell Beach
commercial area. Parking on site is not required.
f.       Trash hidden from view.
Trash disposal facilities shall be screened from public view.
g.       Public art. Public art, subject to City approval, shall be included in new development and
expansion of 30% or more of existing lot area for additions or reconstruction of existing development.
h.       Incentives without a variance from the implementing ordinance.
-For commercial/residential mixed use projects, expanded total building area and reduced parking for
mixed use projects
-For commercial projects 50% smaller than the maximum permitted, a portion of the parking requirements
in the implementing ordinance may be waived.
LU-      Bluff Setback and Protection
 H-5
The bluff top setback for development shall exceed the Policy S-3 and Coastal Zone Code Section
17.078.050 requirement for a 100 year bluff top setback retreat with the addition of a 10’ buffer. The
minimum bluff top setback shall be no less than 25 feet from the top of the bluff. A geology report shall
be required for any development near the top of the bluff to ensure that adequate bluff setbacks and
protective measures are provided. Appropriate erosion control measures shall be required for any project
along the bluff-tops and shall specify methods for maintenance.
Should the bluff top setback requirement render infeasible the opportunity to develop a reasonably sized
project, front yard setbacks may be reduced to less than 15’ identified in the implementing ordinance
without a requirement for a Variance. The setback to the garage shall be no less than 20’ and reduced
front yard setbacks shall comply with the California Building code.
For this area, site specific geologic studies required in Policy S-3 shall include an analysis of appropriate
planting material along the coastal bluffs.

approved by the city. The City shall not approve parallel parking that is outside the normal area needed
for travel ways and related street parking. (See Design Element, Policy D-15, Front Yards and Street
Right-of-Ways.)
c.       Shell Beach Road improvements
Shell Beach Road improvements should retain the existing curb and gutter flow line and profile of the
street and ADA compliance through use of bulb outs and street corner improvements. Additional
improvements will include a multi-use trail, benches, decorative light poles, bike racks, public art, trash
receptacles, and receptacles for recyclable material. A variety of paving changes and textures with street
furniture and decorative lights and street trees will enhance this area.
Existing public sidewalks and street amenities shall be maintained, and future improvements shall be
maintained in perpetuity.

         a.       Bluff-top Conservation and Open Space Area Required
                  All development, except for public access facilities, shall be set back from the top of the
                  bluff as shown schematically in Figure LU-13. The extent of the bluff-top conservation
                  and open space zone shall be a distance equal to the 100-year bluff retreat line plus an
                  additional 50 feet. The extent of the 100-year bluff retreat shall be established through a
                  site-specific study conducted by a qualified registered geologist. Permissible public
                  access facilities within this zone shall be limited to paths or walkways, bicycle racks,
                  observation decks or platforms, benches, picnic tables, and landscaping. Any facilities
                  shall be a safe distance from the edge of the bluff, as determined by the geological study.

         b.       Landscaping
No landscaping shall, when mature, exceed the height of approved structures on the site nor cause
additional view obstruction. All landscaping shall consist of drought tolerant, and to the greatest extent
feasible, native species. Extensive lawns or other large areas of grass exceeding two acres in size shall
be prohibited. Total lawn or grass area shall not exceed 3 acres. Lawns and other grass areas should be
located on the parts of the site nearest Shell Beach Road and Cliff Drive. No lawns or other areas of
grass requiring irrigation shall be allowed closer than 150 feet from the bluff edge and the hole leading to
the sea cave. Any landscaping within 150 feet of the bluff edge and the hole leading to the sea cave shall
                      1
be drought tolerant.
         c.       Public Access Facilities and Bluff Top Erosion
Public access facilities shall be designed and constructed to be easily moved to a more landward location
if they become endangered by bluff erosion. For the pusposes of this policy, public access facilities
                                                                                                              1
means public paths, walkways, bicycle racks, observation decks or platforms, bences, and picnic tables.
         d.       Protection of Scenic Highway Corridor
                  The height, bulk and scale of any development on the Dinosaur Caves property shall not
                  detract from the ocean view from U.S. Highway 101. Heights of all structures shall be
                  below the elevation of the nearest freeway travel lane. All structures and landscaping
                  shall be designed to avoid any significant impairment of seaward views from highway

Motel District
Planning Area J
Background
         Planning Area J is developed with seven hotels (Shorecliff Inn, Whalers Inn, Knights Rest,
Seacrest, Tides, Motel Pismo and Kon Tiki) and a small neighborhood of single-family residences and
apartments.
         The northern part of the area has rocky cliffs, about 70 feet high, which are undercut by unstable
wave tunnels or sea caves. In the center of the area and at its southerly boundary are barrancas with
riparian vegetation. The southern area has a sandy beach owned by the State Lands Commission and
managed by the State Department of Parks and Recreation.
         The Elmer Ross Beach is located to the north of the Shorecliff Inn. Access to this man-made
beach is via a spiral staircase down the edge of the cliff north of Shorecliff Inn. Public parking is provided
at the inn for beach users. The inn also has two tennis courts located on the bluff top that are open to the
public when not in use by motel guests. The inn also has a scenic bluff-top walk with two gazebos that
are open to the public when not in use by motel guests.
         There is also a public stairway to the beach at the end of Wilmar Street, and some of the motels
have semi-public stairs to the beach. This portion of the city is highly used by out-of- town visitors,
primarily because of the concentration of motels and the dose proximity to the downtown area and
beachfront.
Policies
LU-      Concept
  J-1
         The Motel District shall be designated for Resort Commercial, Medium Density Residential and
         Open Space. The area shall serve as a key focus for Pismo Beach's visitor-serving industry with
         special consideration given to ocean views and bluff access. Retention or upgrading of the
         existing motel uses is a major emphasis of the plan.
LU-      Bluff Setback and Protection
  J-2
         Development along the bluffs shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the top of the bluff.
         Geology reports shall be required for any development to ensure that adequate bluff setbacks are
         provided. Appropriate erosion control measures shall be required for any project along the bluff-
         tops and shall specify methods for maintenance, including landscaping and setbacks.
LU-      Lateral Bluff-top Access and Open Space
  J-3
         The lateral bluff-top access dedication requirement set forth in Policy PR-23 shall apply except
         that the width may be up to 25 additional feet beyond the 100-year bluff retreat lines, depending
                                                                                                LU-40
     upon the size of the parcel and the location of existing structures. It shall be the intent to develop
     a continuous bluff-top path within the lateral open space area; development approvals shall
     require installation of pathway segments in a manner that connects with adjacent segments.
LU-  Development Conditions
J-4
     a.        Vertical and lateral public access-ways to the beach and along the bluff-top, respectively,
               shall be required as a condition of development permits if not already adequately
               provided, except where the configuration of the bluff makes vertical access infeasible or
               satisfactory vertical access is already provided nearby as shown on Table PR-4 and PR-
               5.More frequent vertical access-ways may be required to serve particular concentrations
               of hotel and motel units.
     b.        New structures should be carefully sited and designed to provide ocean corridor and/or
               over- views from U.S. Highway 101. A visual analysis for such views shall determine the
               extent of building height for properties fronting Price Street
LU-  Barrancas
 J-5
     The barrancas shall be left in natural open space and used as view corridors to the ocean.
LU-  Archaeology
 J-6
     An archaeological reconnaissance shall be required prior to approval of any development project
     in this planning area. See also:

LU-  Underground Utilities and Street Improvements
 J-7
     The existing overhead utilities on Price Street should be placed underground. The city shall
     pursue the formation of assessment districts for street improvements including landscaping and
     undergrounding of utilities on Wilmar, harbor view and Franklin Street. (See Design Element,
     Policy D-37, Underground Utilities.)
LU-  Street and Front Yard Paving
 J-8
     Street rights-of-way and front yards on Franklin Drive, Wilmar Avenue and harbor View Street
     shall not be paved except for driveways or parking spaces officially approved by the city. The city
     shall not approve parallel parking that is outside the normal area needed for travel ways and
     related street parking. (See Design Element, Policy D-15, Front yards and Street Right-of-Way.
LU-  Lateral Access
 J-9
     In order to access the Wilmar Avenue stairs, development approvals for properties between
     Franklin Drive and Wilmar Avenue or between Wilmar Avenue and Harbor View Street shall be
     required to dedicate a pedestrian pathway easement between the streets. Where developments
     have already blocked this access the city should consider acquiring land as necessary and
     constructing a pedestrian path. (See Parks, Recreation & Access Element, Policy PR-5, Path
     System.)
                                                                                             LU-41
Downtown Core
Planning Area K
Background
          The Downtown Core area encompasses downtown Pismo Beach, an important visitor-serving
center of the city. Many motel and hotel uses are located here, primarily along Price, Pomeroy and
Dolliver Streets and the oceanfront. The majority of commercial uses are between Dolliver Street and the
ocean and Main and Stimson Streets.
          Property landward of the ocean is gently sloping; however, the bluff and beach areas are varied
in their physical characteristics. The bluffs along the northern portion of the area are about 40 feet high
and have eroded to such an extent that Cypress Street has been turned into a one-way street, and a
portion of the road has been closed. The bluffs begin to decline in elevation until they reach about five
feet at the pier.
          The Pismo Creek estuary and lagoon at the southern end of downtown is a sensitive wetland
habitat. High tides occasionally reach the seawalls located at the pier parking lot and northward; none of
the sandy beach can be used in the Commercial Core during some high tide periods in the winter months.
The sandy beach provides excellent habitat for dams. Near shore, fish species are also prevalent in this
stretch, thus making Pismo Beach a popular surf fishing area.
          The state beach forms the major recreation area in the City. There are eleven major public
access points to the wide sandy beach in the downtown area. These are located at ends of streets and off
public roads along the bluff tops. Some of the motels and condominiums have private or semiprivate
access to the beach; however, all of these private accesses lead to public beach areas. Public lateral
access exists along the entire state beach.
          In addition to the sandy beach, the city has a two-acre park complex adjacent to Pismo Creek
consisting of the Ira Lease Park to the east of State Highway 1 and the Mary Harrington Park to the west
of Highway 1.
          The Commercial Core is a major tourist destination in the City. The sandy beaches provide
opportunity for surfing, swimming, walking, surf fishing and other beach-oriented recreational activities.
The close proximity of tent camping, motels and recreational vehicle park and related commercial
services provides the necessary overnight lodging to support the attractive beach areas.
          In the 1980's the 1983 Pismo Beach General Plan/Local Coastal Plan, the 1984 Waterfront
Revitalization Plan and a 1989 study provided by a regional Urban Design Assistance Team (R/UDAT)
addressed future revitalization of the downtown. In 1991, the city embarked on the creation of a
downtown specific plan to pull together the many ideas from these plans. This specific plan includes land
use policies, design guidelines, a streetscape program and public facility improvements to enhance public
access to the beach and develop a more pedestrian-oriented downtown.
Principles
P-17      Downtown Focus for Residents and Visitors
          Downtown Pismo Beach shall be a city focal point with a blend of cultural, commercial,
          professional, residential and recreational uses catering to both visitors and residents of all ages.
          Tourism and visitor services shall be emphasized, carefully and conscientiously blending
          shopping, recreational and cultural activities for the visitor, with housing, retail and professional
          services needed by the residents of the community.
          The downtown area of Pismo Beach serves residents year-round, and in this context the
          downtown must remain inviting and pleasant to the citizens of the community. New development
          and revitalization of downtown should enhance the quality of life for the residents as well as better
          serve the needs of visitors.
P-18      People-Pedestrian Scale
          Downtown should be a “people downtown”. It should be a “walk-able” environment, identifying
          pedestrian routes throughout the commercial and visitor services districts, with obvious and
          convenient accessibility to an oceanfront boardwalk, the pier and a Pismo Creek trail. The entire
          area should be walk-able with pedestrian and bicycles given equal weight with the automobile.
                                                                                                   LU-42

     Development and public facilities should create interesting places that entice people to walk.
     Parking areas should be subordinate to an active pedestrian scaled street life.
P-19 Historic Preservation
     Downtown Pismo Beach contains much of the historic ambiance of the entire community. While
     hard to define, the preservation of this ambiance is the key to a revitalized downtown. Major
     buildings in the area should be identified as local landmarks and encouraged to be restored and
     pre- served. Downtown's historic role in the community should be emphasized, providing a link
     with the past, creating a pleasant ambiance, and adding to the architectural diversity of future
     new development.
                                                                                         LU-43

       Development shall comply with the following policies:
a.     Oceanfront Boardwalk
       A continuous pedestrian boardwalk along the planning area ocean frontage to Pismo Creek shall
       be established. This boardwalk shall include pedestrian amenities such as, but not limited to,
       seating, lighting and landscaping. Properties adjacent to the future board walk location shall be
       required to dedicate up to 20 feet of the ocean frontage of the property for the boardwalk.
       Installation of the boardwalk may be required as a condition of approval of development projects.
       The amount of dedication shall be subject to the size of the ocean-facing parcels and the area
       required to minimize bluff erosion identified in geologic studies submitted with development
                                                                             4
       applications. The boardwalk will connect into the Pismo Creek trail.
b.     Pismo Creek Trails
       A creekside trail system shall be developed on both sides of Pismo Creek from its mouth at the
       ocean inland to a location deemed to be feasible and reasonable within the Planning Area R
       based on agreements with land owners. Public improvements such as trash cans and seating
       may be included with the development of the creek trails. Except for Planning Area R, dedication
       of a portion of properties adjacent to Pismo Creek for a public pathway shall be required with new
       development applications. These dedications shall include the buffer zone as identified in the
       conservation and open space element. Within Planning Area R creek trails shall be subject to and
       consistent with all policies, requirements and standards including but not limited to setbacks
       applicable to the Watershed and Resource Management land use designation. Except for in
       Planning Area R, development approvals by the City shall require the installation of trail
       improvements. See also: Conservation Element Policies 2, 22 and 22A.
c.     Interpretive Panels or Signage
       Appropriate interpretive panels shall be provided for the pier, boardwalk and Pismo Creek trail.
       These may be required as a condition of approval of development projects. Funding should be
       sought from a variety of sources.
d.     Downtown streets perpendicular to the ocean
       Streets in the commercial core area, which end at the ocean, may be developed into cul-de-sacs
       compatible with public safety standards for safe turn-around. Owners of oceanfront properties
       shall participate in the cost of developing cul-de-sacs on a per development basis. Participation is
       defined as the construction of all improvements on the owner’s side of the street along the
       property frontage.

        The City shall provide improvements to the Addie Street parking lot, which will include, but shall
        not be limited to, landscaping in the parking lot and extension of the boardwalk along the ocean
        frontage to the Pismo Creek Trail.
        The structure located in Mary Herrington Park on the west bank of Pismo Creek shall either be
        removed and replaced with additional parking and/or a picnic area or upgraded or replaced, to
                                                                                                4

LU-     Districts
   K-3
        Downtown shall have four districts or land use categories as shown in Figure LU-K-1. The
                                                                                            4
        policies for each District and their permitted land use are described as follows:
LU-     Mixed Residential (MR) District
K-3.1
        The Mixed Residential or MR District shall permit a mixture of hotels and motels along with
        apartments, condominiums and other similar residential uses. Restaurants may be permitted
        when secondary to onsite hotel use. It is expected that the visitor-serving uses will gravitate
        toward the beach and the major thoroughfares. Small convenience markets that serve the daily
        needs of residents and visitors would be allowed in this district.
 4
LU-     Central Commercial (CC) District
K-3.2
        The primary land use focus for the Central Commercial District is commercial, recreational and
        cultural. Commercial uses shall be oriented towards visitors (i.e. gift shops, clothing stores,
        restaurants). Residential uses may be considered as part of mixed use project applications.
        Notwithstanding the Zoning Code requirements precluding expansions of existing nonconforming
        structures and land uses, a legal nonconforming residence in the Central Core Commercial
        district used solely as a permanent residence may itself be expanded up to 50% of the total
        building area existing as of May 18, 1993.” This 50% expansion limitation shall be limited to
        residences permitted as such, not to hotels that might have converted to residences over time . 5
        A pedestrian orientation will be promoted for all development in this district. The pier and
        boardwalk provide the focus for pedestrian activities in this very "walk-able" downtown
        commercial area.
        Improvements in the Commercial Core may include reconfiguration of the pier parking lot for a
        more cohesive traffic flow from Pomeroy to Hinds and maximum use of the pier parking lot;
        dedication of a portion of the property adjacent to the city parking lot for vehicles and pedestrian
        access between those two streets; and a cohesive streetscape program to complement and
                                                              4
        encourage the pedestrian emphasis of downtown.
LU-     Mixed Use (MU) District
K-3.3
        The Mixed Use or MU District will provide for a wide variety of land uses including visitor lodging,
        commercial retail, restaurants, service uses, offices, and residential uses. The more intensive
        commercial uses and visitor-serving uses shall be encouraged to locate along the major
        thoroughfares. Mixed-use projects are encouraged throughout the district.
LU-     Open Space District
K-3.4

   Amended R-2006-045
                                                                                               LU-45

Open Space is the designated land use for the beach, Mary Herrington Park, and Ira Lease Park.
The pier and the beach will provide the catalyst for development of a boardwalk along the beach
from Main Street to Pismo Creek. Passive recreational uses are permitted in these areas.
The extension of the Pismo Creek trail from Cypress Street to Highway 101 will be located along
the west bank of Pismo Creek adjacent to Mary Herrington and Ira Lease Parks. Pedestrian and
bicycle uses will be permitted along the trail adjacent to these parks.
                                                                                  LU-46
Pismo Creek
Planning Area L
Background
          The Pismo Creek Planning Area consists of a year-round mobile home park (236 spaces), three
recreational vehicle parks with 996 spaces, the state Department of Parks and Recreations North Beach
Campground with 103 campsites, and related RV storage and repair.
          The area includes the sensitive wetlands habitat at the mouth of Pismo Creek, riparian vegetation
along side the creek; sand dunes along the beach front and a monarch butterfly habitat area.
           The major beach accesses are through the Pismo Coast Village Trailer Park and the North
Beach Campground. The accesses are open to general use but are not marked. Both the trailer park and
campground have constructed access ways over the delicate dune vegetation to reduce unnecessary foot
traffic through this sensitive area. The public campground and the semiprivate trailer parks have
recreational facilities for use by guests only. The beach is open for public recreational use but there are
no restrooms, parking lots, fire rings or recreation equipment available for free public use.
                                                                                              LU-47
Policies
LU-   Concept
 L-1
      The Pismo Creek area shall be designated Resort Commercial, Mobile Home Park and Open
      Space with land uses oriented to visitor-serving activities.
LU-   Pismo Creek
 L-2
      The creek area should be preserved in its natural state with special attention given to preserving
      scenic, recreational and education resources. More specifically:
      a.       The City should protect and enhance the riparian woodland along Pismo Creek for the
               purpose of improving the scenic quality as well as its ecological value.
      b.       The City should recommend to a state agency that the property adjacent to Pismo Creek
               mouth and those portions of properties located within the creek channel be acquired for
               open space or recreational use.

     remaining parcel within the city that has good visual and physical access to Pismo Marsh. The
     City Redevelopment Agency should consider buying this parcel to assure the benefits of the
     marsh can be shared by the entire city. After providing for both vertical and lateral access, the
     Agency could lease the remainder of the site for a restaurant and/or low and moderate income
     housing. Should the site be developed privately, any future use of this parcel shall require open
     space facilities for both public and private viewing of the Pismo Marsh. Uses shall be oriented to

LU-  Specific Development Criteria
N-21
     a.      Open Space
             The hillside between Reef Court, Coral Court and the railroad shall be kept in open space
             and not        used for a road access. Steep slopes, canyons and oak woodlands shall
             also be retained in open        space.
     b.      James Way Extension
             Right-of-way needed for the James Way extension across the railroad to Bello Street
             shall be dedicated as part of any development in the vicinity. (See Circulation Element,
             C-7, Freeway Frontage Roads.)
     c.      Low and Moderate Income Housing
             The flat area at the intersection of James Way and the railroad shall be encouraged as
             a site for low and moderate income housing. In the event that 100% of housing units
             developed on the parcel is affordable (as defined by the State of California criteria for low
             and very low income housing), a density bonus of up to 100% may be authorized by the
             city. This bonus would be inclusive of the density bonuses outlined in policies H-2 and
             H-3 of the Housing element.
     d.      Office/Commercial
             No retail commercial development shall be approved in this planning area. Land
             immediately north of Ventana Drive, that is shown as commercial in the land use map,
             may be considered for a low scale, service oriented, office development.
                                                                                         LU-60
Los Robles Del Mar
Subarea N-4
Background
         The Los Robles del Mar sub-area consists of 180 acres located along the northeastern edge of
Pismo Beach, adjacent to the Toucan Terrace sub-area. The sub-area is undeveloped and comprised of
two separate property ownerships of 154 acres and 26 acres. The area is outside the City boundaries as
of 1991, but is a part of the City of Pismo Beach Sphere of Influence. The sub-area is bounded by the
City of Arroyo Grande along Oak Park Boulevard to the east, and the County of San Luis Obispo to the
north and northwest, and the City of Pismo Beach to the south.
         The terrain of the sub-area is generally coastal hillside in character, and contains several areas of
steep slopes of greater than 30%. Portions of the site are spotted with Coastal live oaks with the
northernmost portion of the site being heavily wooded.
Policies
LU-      Concept
 N-22    The Los Robles Del Mar sub-area is designated as a low density residential area for future
         development of residential dwellings and a private school.
                                                                                               LU-61
LU-    Specific Plan Requirement
 N-23
       No annexation or development shall be approved in the area until the city adopts a
       comprehensive Specific Plan for the entire subarea. Such plan shall include the following
       features:
       a.      Maximum Residential Densities
               The maximum permissible residential density for the 180 acre area is 2 units per area of
               developable site area. Developable site area shall be computed as that area of the
               property with slopes under 30%
       b.      Development Characteristics
               Residential development shall consist of a variety of housing types and lot configurations.
               Clustering of home-sites and a variety of residential structures shall be permitted. Both
               residential and school development shall be undertaken in a manner that is compatible
               with oak tree preservation, the rural character of the surrounding area, slope stability,
               view enhancement and other natural features of the sub-area. Special design standards
               that ensure environmentally sensitive construction shall be required, and no development
               shall be permitted on slopes of 30% or greater. Greenbelts shall be provided for public
               access for pedestrian, equestrian, and bikeways through the subarea, and landscape
               buffers will be provided between residential and school land uses.
       c.      Affordable Housing
               Development of affordable housing is especially encouraged on these two parcels.
               Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Plan, the area may include a high
               density residential component provided that all units in the high density component are
               affordable to elderly, low, or very low income households provided, however, that the
               overall density of the entire 180-acre area shall not exceed the gross density specified in
                                                 7
               Policy LU-N-23, subdivision (a).
       d.      Public Facilities
               A proven water supply and facility fees and/or facility improvement requirements related
               to sewage collection and treatment, fire protection and others, shall be addressed
               through the specific plan for the area.
       e.      Special Large Lots and Rural Estates
               The northern oak wooded edge of the 154-acre parcel shall consist of large lots. This
               area shall be designed with housing units located in rearings free of oak trees. The
               specific plan for this subarea shall outline special hillside street, subdivision and
               development standards to minimize development impact on this densely wooded
               section of this parcel.
       f.      Park and Recreation Facility Dedication
               The 154-acre parcel shall provide park and recreation facilities for use by future residents
               in the subarea and city residents at large. These facilities shall include, but not be limited
               to, small "pocket parks", playing fields, or some other type of active recreational facility.
               These park areas shall be located in areasof the site that will provide useable and
               functional park space and must be accessible to the handicapped. The specific plan will

Industrial
Planning Area 0
Background
         The Industrial area is located east of the downtown and the 101 Freeway. The area includes the
city's sewage treatment plant, Little League fields, and the large P.G. & E. trans- port and storage facility
and a private park.
         Pismo Creek runs through the planning area. Part of the area is subject to flooding. The Little
League fields have poor access off Route 1. A historic bridge connecting to the Price Canyon area has
been dosed due to structural problems.
Policies
LU-      Concept
 O-1
         The Industrial area should be designated for Industrial, Public/Semipublic and Open Space. The
         open space and recreation development of Pismo Creek should be a key feature of the area.
                                                                                              LU-64
LU- Pismo Creek Linear Park
O-2
    Pismo Creek and adjacent land should be developed as part of a comprehensive linear park as
    specified in the Park & Recreation Element, Policy PR-13 and the Design Element D-24, Price
    Canyon Road.
LU- Environmental Considerations
O-3 Development should implement the following special environmental considerations:
    a.        Archaeology
              An archaeological reconnaissance shall be required as a part of any development project
              in this planning area.
    b.        Erosion Control
              Appropriate erosion control measures should be implemented for any construction along
              the creek; development designs must contain appropriate erosion control measures that
              specify methods for maintenance.
    c.        Flood Control
              Areas immediately adjacent to Pismo Creek and subject to flooding shall be retained in
              open space.
LU- PG&E Lands
O-4
    The PG&E. lands should be heavily landscaped, particularly to soften the view from Price Canyon
    Road.
    For the long term, the PG&E site is too prominent and central a site to be used for this open
    storage use. PG&E should be encouraged to consider other more appropriate long-term uses of
    this site, such as for administrative offices. Any changes in use of the PG&E land shall require a
    specific plan. Alternative uses that may be considered without a change in the General Plan are:
    -Low and Moderate Income Housing
    -Resort Commercial

Freeway Foothills
Planning Area Q
Background
          The Freeway Foothills Planning Area consists of the foothills lying adjacent to and east of U. S.
Highway 101. Land use in the area consists of two partially developed planned residential developments,
a restaurant and small shopping complex, a small undeveloped holding at the northern end of the area,
and the ll6-acre Mattie Road annexation area, (currently outside the city limits but within the LAFCo
adopted Sphere of Influence Area), and a few scattered single family dwellings.
          This area is highly visible from U.S. Highway 101 above Shell Beach and Sunset Palisades. The
foothills provide an important visual and open space backdrop for the entire northern one-half of the city.
The planning area itself has spectacular ocean views.
          The planning area is physically separated from the other city areas by U.S.Highway 101. Only
two accesses exist which connect to Mattie Road from Shell Beach Road/Palisades Drive and Price
Street. These accesses are via freeway under- passes.
                                                                                              LU-70
Policies
LU-   Concept
 Q-1
      The Freeways Foothills area should be designated for Low and Medium Density Residential,
      Open Space and Commercial with an emphasis on preservation of the foothills and open space.
      See:
               Conservation/OS                     CO-8              Regional Open Space/Park
LU-   Specific Plans Required
Q-2
      All development should take place under four (4) specific plans, one each for the three
      geographically separated subareas, i.e. Baycliff Village, Spyglass Ridge, an unnamed small
      parcel to the north and one for the Mattie Road annexation area.
LU-   Minimize Impact On Foothills
Q-3
      Development shall be designed to minimize the impacts on views to the foothills from public view
      areas (including U.S. Highway !01, lateral beach access ways, public beaches and the city pier)
      and the visual intrusion of the development into the adjacent U.S. Highway 101 coastal travel
      corridor. Specifically, the size, location and massing of structures, including soundwalls, shall not
      obscure the scenic backdrop provided by the foothills to visitors, passing motorists, and residents
      or detract from the ocean vista and coastal landforms. To accomplish these design objectives, the
      following development standards shall be incorporated into the specific plans:
      a.       All development shall be on or into existing grades. Multi-parcel residential site terracing
               and similar mass grading will not be allowed. Each permitted structure shall provide for
               individual adaptation to the existing landform, rather than modification of the landform to
               accommodate a particular design.
      b.       Residential units shall be clustered and located off the top of ridges, knolls or hummocks
               a sufficient distance to retain the silhouette profile of the topographic feature.
      c.       A minimum of 60 percent of the planning area shall be retained in open space. A scenic
               or open space easement prohibiting any development above the 200 foot contour shall
               be required to be dedicated to the City as a condition of approval of any development
               below the 200 foot contour.
      d.       No principal structures (such as a recreation building) shall be placed closer than 50 feet
               to the right of way of Mattie Road.
      e.       Heights of all structures shall be limited to three (3) levels and not exceed 25 feet in
               height above existing natural grade, with substantial setback of floors to reduce the
               appearance of bulk.
      f.       No buildings or grading shall be permitted on slopes over 30%. The areas over 30% shall
               be retained as permanent public or private open space. Development may be permitted
               on slopes with existing natural gradients up to 30 percent; however, in no case shall
               development be permitted above a footprint elevation of 200 feet above mean high tide.
               Density may be calculated on land up to the 250 contour, but in no case on lands with
               existing natural slopes greater than 30 percent.
      g.       Transfer of density may be permitted within this planning area to retain areas of open
               space, provided that the total number of permitted units is not increased.
                                                                                              LU-71
    h.     Colors used on building and structures shall be in keeping with Design Element D-6,
           Foothill Development.
    i.     Oak trees shall be preserved as specified in Conservation Element CO-13, Oak Tree
           Policy.
    j.     The right-of-way, open space and fences along Mattie Road shall be landscaped and
           improved to enhance the views in this area. See:
                      Design Element            D-6                 Foothill Development
    k.     Development of the commercial area shall include provisions for a bus turnout and
           shelter.
    l.     The annual number of building permits issued for this planning area shall be limited so
           that water demand does not at any time exceed available water supply. Available water
           supply shall be determined by combining the proven annual safe yield amounts available
           from the City's groundwater sources with the amounts currently deliverable from Lake
           Lopez and the State Water Project, less currant demand and commitments elsewhere in
           the City and less the projected amount needed to support full buildout of coastal zone
           priority uses (i.e. public service facilities, visitor serving commercial development) within
           the City.
LU- Environmental Considerations
Q-4
    Development shall consider the following special environmental considerations:
    a.     Water runoff and erosion.
           Developments shall provide necessary structures to carry surface water runoff from the
           property without impacting adjacent property or development between the freeway and
           the ocean. Project designs shall contain appropriate erosion control measures and
           specify methods of maintenance. Runoff control plans designed by a licensed engineer
           qualified in hydrology and soil mechanics shall be required for all development on slopes
           greater than 10 percent to mitigate any increase in peak runoff.
    b.     Archaeology
           An archaeological reconnaissance shall be required prior to the approval of specific
           plans in this area.
    c.     Noise
           Development shall provide mitigations to reduce excessive noise levels within the
           development. (See Noise Element.)
    d.     Vegetation
           Natural vegetation and fire retardant vegetation that harmonizes with existing vegetation
           along the hillscape should be utilized. Exposed cut and fill slopes shall be re-vegetated
           prior to occupancy. A planted barrier (visual screen) between U.S. Highway 101/Mattie
           Road shall be created. Such a screen shall consist of dense indigenous (native) species
           to create a random effect in height and density. This visual screen should minimize the
           visibility of "hardscape" such as road pavement and buildings, but it will have a natural
           "wood-land" effect as opposed to that of a typical wind-break.
    e.     Passive Open Space Areas
           Passive open space areas shall be maintained by the future owners, and can have
           limited recreational use.
                                                                                           LU-72
LU-  Recreation and Open Space
 Q-5 Public and private recreation and open space shall include:
     a.      Public Park
             A one-acre public park in the extreme northwest portion of the planning area shall be
             dedicated for public parkland. This area, comprising the sides and bottom of a small
             canyon shall be improved as small park/picnic area that will provide new public
             recreational opportunities where none now exist. A small pullout area and a small bay (s)
             for parallel parking for the public shall be provided on Mattie Road along the frontage of
             the park.
     b.      Hiking Trail
             A public hiking trail shall be provided in the canyon south of the Spyglass interchange as
             part of any adjacent future development, and shall be located to facilitate a future hillside
             or ridgetop connection to the Pismo Creek trail corridor via the Pismo Beach Coastal
             Ridge Path.
     c.      Private Recreation
             All condominiums and townhouse development shall include private recreational facilities.
     d.      Hillside Preservation
             The two hillocks within the Spyglass Ridge Specific       Plan shall be preserved in
             permanent open space.
     e.      Passive Open Space Areas
             Passive open space areas shall be maintained by the future owners, and can have
             limited recreational use. Within such designated Open Space areas, easements for public
             hiking trails shall be recorded prior to commencement of the associated residential or
             commercial development. Such easement shall provide for hillside or ridgetop lateral
             access between the eastern and western boundaries of the site, and may be secured as
             a floating easement until such time as the alignment of connecting trail segments on
             adjacent properties is identified. In addition, on properties which include the Coastal
             Ridge, a public hiking trail shall be provided between the nearest public road and an
             appropriate ridgetop vista point as a condition of development of such property: if the
             landform precludes a reasonable on site location for such a connecting hiking trail, this
             requirement may be satisfied through provision of a comparable trail within an adjacent
             Specific Plan area or a proportional deposit of funds with the City sufficient to establish
             an equivalent trail link.
LU-  Mattie Road Specific Plan
Q-6  Area 1
     1.      All development shall be below the 200 ft. elevation.
     2.      Density shall only be calculated for land below the 250 ft. elevation resulting in 231
             dwelling units and 1.2 acres of commercial area, or alternative land uses resulting in the
             same number of vehicle trips.
     3.      As part of any development plan approval, land above the 200 ft. contour should be
             dedicated in permanent open space.

Price Canyon Area
Planning Area R
Background
         In October 2011 the San Luis Obispo Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) expanded
the boundary of the Price Canyon Area Planning Area R by adding parcel 5. Figure LU-25 has been
amended to reflect the current Price Canyon Area Planning Area R sphere of influence. The area consists
of four parcels numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5 which, according to the LAFCO are made up of approximately
182, 258, 471 and 250 acres respectively for a total of approximately 1,161 acres.
         The Price Canyon planning area includes a narrow valley along Pismo Creek with steeply rising
hills and with occasional rock outcroppings on either side.
                                                                                        LU-74

LU-   Designation of Planning Area R as Watershed and Resource Management.
R-1
      The Price Canyon area within Planning Area R, as shown on Figure LU-25 is designated as
      “Watershed and Resource Management” (WRM). The designation of Planning Area R to
      Watershed and Resource Management is intended to carry out the principle that protection of
      sensitive environmental resources is a priority in this area. The designation reflects the lack of a
      confirmed long-term water supply to support urban development on these lands and the desire
      and intention of the people of the City of Pismo Beach to protect Planning Area R in Price Canyon
      for its watershed, habitat, agricultural, scenic, and recreational values.
LU-   The City Council may approve development within Planning Area R to avoid an
R-2   unconstitutional taking.
     During the 30 year period after this initiative measure becomes effective, the City Council may
     waive development standards and conditions within the Watershed and Resource Management
     (WRM) designation and/or amend the General Plan pursuant to its usual procedures without a
     vote of the people to allow for development and uses within Planning Area R not allowed within the
     Watershed and Resource Management designation where both of the following findings are made
     and are supported by facts in the record.
     a. Application of the WRM designation and/or the standards and conditions within
       the WRM designation to the land would constitute an unconstitutional taking of a
       landowner’s property.
     b. The waiver of standards and/or conditions, or a redesignation of land use as a
        result of a finding of an unconstitutional taking, allows a waiver, amended use,
        additional use, or redesignation only to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a
        taking of a landowner’s property.
                                                                                            LU-75

Noise Element
Background
         State planning law has long recognized that cities must plan for the protection of their residents,
workers and visitors from the annoying and sometimes harmful effects of excessive noise in the
environment. Further, planning is necessary for the protection of public and private land values and
investments, both for uses that are noise sensitive, such as residences, churches, schools and for uses
that are noise- producing, such as highways and certain forms of industry.
         Although a noise ordinance is a very necessary piece of regulatory armament with which the city
can curb intrusive noise events, control of the noise environment is best achieved if the City takes a
proactive approach--that is, a planning approach that permits investigation and mitigation of a potential
problem before it is allowed to occur. Long range control of noise is effected through proper zoning to
separate incompatible uses, site design, building orientation and construction, and through the project
review process to ensure the compatibility of a project with the noise environ- ment of the city.
         In order to determine the existing noise environment in Pismo Beach, a community noise survey
was conducted during August 1990 by Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc. under contract to San Luis Obispo
County. Maximum noise levels ranged from 63-70 dB and generally were due to traffic. Minimum levels
were from traffic and wind and ranged from 25 to 40 dB. Based on these measurements, background
noise levels in terms of Ldn were estimated to range from 41 to 57 dB.
         Brown-Buntin Associates developed existing and projected noise contour data for the major
transportation routes in the county. Traffic data was provided by CALTRANS, the county and the cities.
Estimates for future traffic volumes for certain county and city roadway segments are based on growth
rates of comparable roadways since these data were not available from the jurisdictions. The noise
contours affecting Pismo Beach are presented on Table N-1 and are displayed in Figures N-1 and N-2.
The Technical Appendix should be consulted for a more detailed analysis and adjustments made for
topography.
         The measurement of noise, and particularly the measurement of potential noise from, or affecting,
a proposed project requires the use of sophisticated equipment and considerable technical expertise. To
assist the city in making preliminary assessments of potential problems as well as potential solutions, the
County of San Luis Obispo has provided all cities in the county with a Technical Reference Manual that
supplies specific technical information for individual jurisdictions and an Acoustical Design Manual that
can be used as an aid to site design review. Both documents are included in the Appendix to the General
Plan. The Technical Reference Manual has been adopted as part of that plan.
 Principles
P-20     Noise Levels
         The City will take actions to ensure that residents and workers in the city and visitors to the city
         will not be subjected to excessive levels of noise. Further, the City will protect the long term
         values of both public and private investment by preventing the deterioration of properties as a
         result of incompatible noise intrusion.
Policies
N-1      Control of Noise
         The City shall emphasize land development techniques that address the control of noise either at
         its source or through careful location and orientation of receiving uses. Only secondarily should
         noise be controlled by barriers in the transmission path or by the acoustical design of buildings.
N-2      Land Use Compatibility-Transportation
         The City shall require all new development to meet the noise requirements of the compatibility
         guidelines in Table N-2.
         For areas where the noise environment is conditionally acceptable for a particular land use,
         development shall be allowed only after noise mitigation has been incorporated into the design of
                                                                                                   N-2
    the project to reduce noise levels to levels specified in polities N-3 and N-4. For areas where the
    noise environment is unacceptable for the development of a given use, development is usually
    not appropriate and shall be allowed only upon the completion of an environmental impact report
    and the adoption of an overriding social-economic impact statement.
N-3 Location of New Development & Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
    New development shall not be permitted where the noise level, due to existing stationary sources,
    exceeds the standards of Table N-3; or the noise levels from existing or projected transportation
    noise exceeds the standards of Table N-4, unless effective noise mitigation measures have been
    incorporated into the develop- ment to reduce noise exposure to acceptable levels.
N-4 Location of Noise Producing Uses and Transportation Sources
    Mitigation shall be required for proposed stationary noise sources on or adjacent to lands
    designated for noise-sensitive uses so that the noise levels do not exceed those set forth in Table
    N-3.
    Noise created by new transportation sources shall be mitigated so as not to exceed levels
    specified in Table N-4 within the outdoor activity areas and interior space of existing noise
    sensitive uses.
N-5 Technical Reference Manual
    To meet the requirements of the Government Code regarding technical information to be included
    in the Noise Element, the San Luis Obispo County Technical Reference Manual is herein adopted
    by reference.

Introduction
                                                     The Park and Recreation Element is an optional element
                                            of the General Plan. It also includes an Access Component,
                                            which is required by the Coastal Act. The Element should be
                                            viewed in the context of the background, principles and policies
                                            found in the Conservation and Open Space Element, much of
                                            which is integral to recreation and access concerns.
                                                     Pismo Beach has always relied on the Pacific Ocean and
                                            the beach to be its chief recreational resource. Although it is true
                                            that the ocean is a major resource for the community, this attitude
                                            has resulted in a deficiency of neighborhood and community park
                                            acreage in the city and a lack of recreational facilities.
                                                     As Pismo Beach continues to develop and its resident
                                            population grows, it is important for the city to develop a more
                                            comprehensive park and recreation program. Although the
                                            community has the unique resource of the ocean, which may
                                            reduce its need for parkland, it also has demonstrated a high
                                            need for recreational facilities such as ball-fields and tennis
                                            courts. Both factors must be included when developing Pismo
                                            Beach's parkland standards and recreation programs.
         A number of national trends affect the Park, Recreation and Access Element. Recreation is
increasingly viewed as an important factor in maintaining health -- both physical and mental. It is
perceived as more than just weekend activity. Recreation is an integral and necessary element of life to
be incorporated into a daily routine. Two demographic trends also impact park and recreation demands.
First, the American population and that of Pismo Beach are aging. This trend can be expected to increase
demand for parks designed to accommodate the physical abilities and to be responsive to the activity
preferences of these "seniors". Another factor is the single (without partner) adult. Single adults need
recreational pursuits that provide opportunities to meet other people. In addition, single parents need
nearby recreational facilities and activities for their children, especially supervised after-school or summer
programs.
         Park and recreation facilities also play an important role in the city's visitor industry. Although the
beach has been the primary focus, an increasing number of visitors are looking for a variety of activities.
         The city contains both state and local parks and recreational areas. Pismo State Beach, under
the direction of the state Department of Parks and Recreation, comprises 1.5 linear miles of the city's only
major sandy beach (approximately 60 acres) and is the major recreational area of the city. The city has
approximately 315 acres of additional public park area either developed or proposed. Forty percent of the
park area is within the Coastal Zone. The city has a total of 106 acres of open space with another 229
acres proposed.
         Table PR-1 and Figure PR-1 summarize the city's existing and proposed parks, recreation and
related open space lands.
                                                                                                            PR-2

Principles
P-21  Parks and Recreation Are Necessary For a Park Healthy Environment and Quality of Life
      The preservation and development of parks, recreation programs and coastal access facilities are
      considered vital to:
      a.      Making the city an enjoyable and beautiful place to live, work, play and visit.
      b.      Providing park and recreation amenities for residents and visitors.
      c.      Maintaining a balanced healthy environment and quality of life for residents and visitors.
      d.      Supporting the area's economy.
P-22  Public Shoreline Access
      The continued development and maintenance of public access to the Pismo Beach coastline shall
      be considered an integral and critical part of the city's parks and recreation program.

Park and Recreation Standards and Plans
PR-1  Opportunities For All Ages, Incomes, and Life Styles
                                                                                                   PR-7
        To fully utilize the natural advantages of Pismo Beach's location and climate, park and
        recreational opportunities for residents and visitors shall be provided for all ages, incomes and life
        styles. This means that:
        a.        The beach shall be free to the public.
        b.        Some parking and/or public transportation access to the beach shall be free to the public.
        c.        Recreational needs of children, teens, adults, persons with disabilities, elderly, visitors
                  and others shall be accommodated to the extent resources and feasibility permit.
        d.        City residents need mini-parks, neighborhood parks, community parks, activity centers,
                  special use and all-purpose parks.
PR-2    Ocean and Beach are the Principal Resources
        The ocean beach and its environment is, and should continue to be, the principal recreation and
        visitor- serving feature in Pismo Beach. Oceanfront land shall be used for recreational and
        recreation-related uses whenever feasible.
PR-3    Parks and Recreation Policy Plan
        The city Park and Open Space Policy Plan shall be as shown in Figure PR-l, as summarized in
        Table PR-l, and as set forth in the policies of this Element. The plan shows the conceptual system
        of parks and open spaces but is not intended to preclude additional areas of open space or parks
        as found appropriate through environmental reviews, the development process, and annexations.
PR-4 Master Parks and Recreation Plan
The City’s Parks and Recreation vision includes:
        a.        Specific park standards - The standards shown in Table PR-2 should be used as a basis
                  for city park development, including annexation areas. Where feasible, park standards
        should enable efficient and sustainable use for and maintenance of City parks and
                  recreation facilities.
        b.        The use of concept plans for each park or open space reflecting active, passive and
        natural open space uses.
        c.        The development of an operation and maintenance plan for each facility.
        d.        A Parks and Recreation Commission oversight of:
        1)        A citizen participation program to determine facility needs and
                  2)         A periodic survey of residents and visitors to determine resident and visitor
                             services and community program needs and desires.
        e.        A periodic review and update of criteria for new development contribution of land and/or
        fees for park development.
PR-5    Multi-Use Path System (Trails)
        A system of public paths as delineated on Figure PR-2 shall be developed to connect the various
        parks, scenic aspects and open space of the city. Ideally the paths should be located within
        designated greenbelt areas. However, in areas of the community that have already been
        developed, the system can include sidewalks and right-of-way shoulders of less traveled streets.
        The system should be delineated with signs, uniform landscaping, and pavement. Every attempt
        shall be made to interconnect city trails with those being developed by adjacent cities and the
        county. Key trail connections are shown for future annexation areas. Motorized vehicles shall not
        be permitted on trails, except as used by handicapped persons.
        Rest areas, picnic areas, view platforms and similar facilities shall be located along the path
        systems. The ridge path should provide for equestrian use. See also:

      schools wherever possible. The City shall negotiate joint agreements with the school district to
      cooperatively maximize park and recreation opportunities.
PR-9  Private Sector Open Space, Parks and Recreation
      The City shall recognize the contribution of the private sector to parks and recreation and
      encourage cooperative continuation and expansion of such contributions. All new planned
      developments shall be required to provide either public and/or private parks and recreation
      facilities. When possible said areas shall connect with adjoining park and recreation areas, which
      are existing or planned. All such development shall either be dedicated in fee to the public or
      have a dedicated open space easement placed upon the property to preclude future

 PR-21 John Michael Price Historical Site and Park
The city-owned John Michael Price Historical Site contains the original "anniversary house" constructed in
1893 and about four acres of surrounding land. A master plan for the restoration of the anniversary house
and improvements to the 4-acre site shall be prepared. The City shall encourage non-profit groups to
assist in financing and preparing such a master plan. The plan may include a 6-acre expansion of the
present site to include adjoining lands that contain the adobe and schoolhouse of the Price Rancho.
These additional lands shall be required to be dedicated to the City at the time of annexation of this
property to allow restoration and public access. The major purpose of this plan shall be to promote an
appreciation of the cultural history and early settlement of the region. Features may include:
a.       a museum, visitors center, and gardens
b.       passive and limited active-use areas

Access Component
Background
          The City of Pismo Beach has a tradition of shoreline access. The purpose of this shoreline
access component is to implement the state Coastal Act shoreline access polities, thus continuing to
ensure the public's right to gain access to the shoreline. The city's seven-mile pacific coastline is
accessible from numerous locations, and the entire beach is open to the public. Very few private routes
are located along the shoreline. Those that do exist provide access to beaches that also have public
access.
          There are areas along the city's coastline where access may be improved. Different methods of
providing access - public acquisition, deed restrictions, development conditions and in-lieu fees may be
utilized. These are described in the Technical Appendix to the General Plan. Particularly important to the
city is the private sector provision of access, in-lieu fees, or permit conditioning and dedication.
Policies
PR-22 Lateral Beach/Shoreline Access Required
          Coastal Beach Access Dedication - For all developments on parcels located along the shoreline,
          a lateral public access easement in perpetuity extending from the ocean-side parcel boundary to
          the top of the bluff shall be required for the purpose of allowing public use and enjoyment of dry
          sandy and rocky beaches, intertidal and subtidal areas. Such easements shall be granted to the
          California Department of Parks and Recreation, the City of Pismo Beach, or other appropriate
          public agency.
PR-23 Lateral Bluff-Top Open Space and Access Required
          Bluff-Top Access Dedication - To ensure public safety, provide for protection of fragile ocean
          bluff-tops, and permit enjoyment by the public of oceanfront amenities and recreation, all
          development on the bluff edge should be required to dedicate in fee or by an easement in
          perpetuity a bluff-top conservation and public access zone. The width of the area to be dedicated
          shall be a distance equal to the estimated 100-year bluff retreat plus a minimum of 25 feet
          additional inland from that line. In certain areas the width of the bluff-top dedication should be
          greater as provided in the land use element. Existing single-family lots on the bluff less than
          10,000 feet in area are exempted from requirements of dedication of the bluff-top area, if another
          lateral public access route (beach, sidewalk or separate path) is or will be available nearby so as
          to provide for continuity of the Coastal Trail. The extent of the bluff retreat shall be determined
          through a site-specific geological study conducted by a qualified registered geologist. The
          dedication should be made to the City of Pismo Beach or other appropriate public agency as
          determined by the city.
          Encroachments into the bluff-top conservation and lateral access zone shall be limited to roadway
          extensions which incorporate public parking opportunities. Such encroachments shall not extend
          more than a depth of 35 feet into the conservation and public access zone. Development of
          structures shall be prohibited within the zone, except for public amenities such as walkways,
          benches, and vertical beach access stairs. Landscaping and irrigation of these areas shall be
          designed to avoid or minimize bluff-top erosion problems. (See also Land Use Policies B-3, C-2,
          D-5, E-6, F-3, G-7, H-10 and J-3.)
                                                                                                          PR-16
PR-1
PR-1
PR-24 Perpendicular Access to Shoreline Required
      Public access perpendicularly from the nearest public roadway to the shoreline should be
      provided in new development projects except where protection of fragile coastal resources
      prevents access or adequate public access already exists nearby (generally within 500 feet or as
      shown on Figure PR-3). Existing bluff-top single-family lots less than 10,000 sq. ft. in area are
      exempted from this requirement.
PR-25 Access Maintenance and Liability
      Dedicated access-ways shall not be required to be opened to public use until a public agency,
      homeowners association or private property owner agrees to accept responsibility for
      maintenance and liability of the access-way.
PR-26 Access Parking Area Required
      Parking, consistent with site constraints, shall be provided in conjunction with vertical and lateral
      access-ways wherever necessary to ensure the use of the access-way. Dedication shall be
      required for such parking when appropriate.
PR-27 Environmental Carrying Capacity
      The City, and other appropriate public agencies with jurisdiction, shall determine the
      environmental carrying capacity for all existing and proposed recreational areas sited on or
      adjacent to the beach, dunes, cliffs, wetlands, streams, tide-pools, or any other habitat areas. A
      management program shall be developed to control the kinds, intensities, and locations of
      recreational activities so that habitat resources are preserved. The level of facility development
      (i.e., parking spaces, camper sites, etc.) shall be correlated with the environmental carrying
      capacity. Designs respectful of natural forms shall be emphasized.
                                                                                                     PR-19
PR-28 Access Signs Required
      Signs should be located at all access points and street leading to access points to assist the
      public in recognizing and using major coastal access points. Such signs should be designed and
      located for easy recognition.
PR-29 Specific Access Points
      Specific area access programs for implementation of the general goals and policies are given in
      Table PR-4. These programs are given by access point and by neighborhood planning area
      within the City. Figure PR-4 identifies the location of these access points; the access points are
      shown on the figure by the number that corresponds to the access point as described in Table
      PR-4. This information shall be used in conjunction with specific plans. See also:

PR-30 Spindrift Viewpoint
      A 50-foot linear easement at the top of the bluff and southeast of the existing viewpoint should be
      granted to the city concurrent with any development approvals. This easement should include as
      many of the existing pine trees as possible. A minimum 10-foot easement from the south end of
      the Spindrift path should be dedicated to the city with development of the oceanfront property and
      concurrent with expansion of the bluff-top area for public use. The nearby heron rookery shall
      remain undisturbed.
PR-31 Boardwalk
      A pedestrian beachfront boardwalk shall be constructed between Pismo Creek and Main Street.
      A beach pathway shall continue to Harloe Street.
PR-32 Motor Driven Vehicles on Beach Prohibited
      Motor driven vehicles shall be prohibited access to the beaches within the city except for these
      purposes:
      1.       When performing necessary maintenance or emergency activities.
      2.       When conducting promotional activities, providing that such activities are (1) on a short-
               term basis; (2) limited to the hard sandy beaches; (3) do not adversely impact marine or
               other coastal resources, including the habitat of the intertidal area; (4) do not interfere
               with pedestrian beach access and use; and (5) the area disrupted as a result of such use
               shall be returned to its pre-existing condition.
PR-33 Permitted Development In Bluff-top Access Areas
      Development permitted in the areas reserved for public bluff-top access or recreation shall be
      limited to structures and facilities designed to accommodate recreational use of the area,
      including but not limited to stairways, benches, tables, refuse containers, bicycle racks, public
      parking facilities, seawalls, groins, etc. In no case shall any development except public access
      paths and access facilities and public stairways be permitted within the bluff retreat setbacks
      identified in site specific geological studies.
                                                                                                       PR-20
S-
Safety Element
Background
    California General Plan law requires the Safety Element to address means of protecting the
community from unreasonable risks associated with seismic hazards, slopes and cliff instability,
subsidence, flooding, and urban and wild-land fires. This element also implements provisions of the
California Coastal Act pertaining to minimizing hazard potential in the Coastal Zone.
          The intent of the Safety Element is to establish polices that will minimize the potential of human
injury and property damage by reducing the exposure of persons and property to natural hazards. The
policies and actions included are based upon determinations as to the acceptable levels of exposure to
risk for each type of hazard. The evaluations and policies necessarily involve judgments based upon such
factors as the severity of the hazard; the likely frequency of damage-inducing events; the potential
number of persons exposed to the risk; and the amounts of potential losses due to injuries, deaths, and
damage to property.
          Exposure to the hazards addressed in this element may or may not be voluntarily undertaken by
individuals. Voluntarily taken risks, however, are not necessarily acceptable from a public point view. This
is because property owners and residents frequently have expectations that public actions, such as
building and zoning regulations or floodplain management, will provide a significant risk-reduction. For the
various hazards, thresholds of unacceptable exposure to risks have been determined. These
determinations are expressed in policies, which limit the intensity of development in high-risk areas,
impose development standards, which will provide a measure of protection, or prohibit construction in
areas with unacceptable risks.
          In imposing any restrictions, it is the intent of the general plan to protect the public health, safety
and welfare within the following framework: 1) individuals should not be permitted to develop land in a
manner which would impose risks on their neighbors or the community at large; 2) future residents of
subdivisions or other developments should not be placed in jeopardy through a failure of the City to
require adequate risk- assessment when considering permits; and 3) a financial burden should not be
imposed on the general taxpayer by allowing developments in hazard-prone areas which are likely to
have unusually high costs for public services and for disaster relief.
          The City of Pismo Beach has prepared, and is responsible for the maintenance of an Emergency
Plan required by the California Emergency Services Act. Among the peacetime emergencies considered
in the Plan are earthquakes, fires and floods.
          This Element is based on; a) A Technical Report which contains the risk analysis of potential
hazards (see Technical Appendix to General Plan); b) The larger County of San Luis Obispo Seismic
Safety Element Study (see Technical Appendix to General Plan); c) The issue identification document of
the City's 1981 Local Coastal Program (see Technical Appendix to General Plan).
          Background material on cliff erosion, flooding and seismic issues are included in separate
sections to follow. Fire and radiation hazards are briefly discussed below.
          Fires in undeveloped areas that result from the ignition of accumulated brush and woody material
are termed "wild-land fires" and represent a significant threat to safety in San Luis Obispo County and to
some extent within the Pismo Beach.
          Principal urban fire hazards in Pismo Beach result from (1) the influx of population during the
tourist season, (2) existing and potential multi-story developments, and (3) the presence of U.S. Highway
101 and the Southern Pacific Railroad. The large tourist population of the city during the summer could
impede efficient response by the city's fire department because of traffic congestion in the beach area.
The problems could be compounded if large-scale evacuation were necessary. Multi-story structures
represent potential hazards be- cause of their dependence on internal support systems including
ventilation, water, and elevator systems. Additional background on fire hazards is included in the
technical report (see Appendix to General Plan).
                                                                                                     S-2
          An analysis of radiation hazards is not specifically required by the Government Code, but is
included in the Safety Element for San Luis Obispo County (see Technical Appendix to General Plan),
because of the presence of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company's nuclear power plant at Diablo
Canyon. The evaluation of radiation hazards does not include an estimate of risk. The potential for
hazardous situation arises from the presence and transport of highly radioactive nuclear fuel within the
city limits. This hazard is recognized by utilities, government agencies and private citizens. Numerous
steps have been taken to minimize the risk of release of high levels of radiation. Some level of risk,
however small, does exist, though, and it is appropriate to plan for an accident. The emphasis of this
element, with respect to radiation hazards, is on emergency response capabilities rather than on
discussion of risk.
Principles
P-23      Protection of Life & Safety
          Pismo Beach shall develop policies to minimize injury and loss of life, to minimize damage to
          public and private property (particularly damage to critical facilities and structures where large
          numbers of people are apt to congregate at one time), and to minimize social and economic
          dislocations resulting from injuries, loss of life, and property damage.
P-24      Maintain Unique Physiographic Characters
          The unique physiographic character of Pismo Beach, including the City's sandy and rocky
          beaches, hills and valleys, creek corridors and riparian areas within the City and within its
          spheres of influence shall be maintained through the proper management of vegetal cover,
          natural surface water runoff patterns, and patterns of groundwater recharge. Management of
          these natural features will conserve soil resources and prevent excessive erosion due to wind
          and water.
Policies
S-1       Risk Identification
          The City shall continually provide for the identification and evaluation of existing structural
          hazards, and abate those hazards to acceptable levels of risk. Specifically:
          a.       Structures within the City's jurisdiction that are old, or suspect of hazards from fire,
                   flooding and geologic events, including bluff retreat, should be inspected by qualified
                   personnel to determine the degree of the hazards.
                   Critical facilities should be inspected prior to non-critical facilities, and public-owned
                   facilities prior to private owned facilities. Structural inspections are a major seismic
                   concern. Susceptibility to damage from flooding should be determined based on the 100-
                   year flood. Fire hazards are best evaluated on a building-by-building basis, by qualified
                   inspection personnel.
          b.       CALTRANS should review its facilities and roadways within the area to determine the
                   potential impact of expected earthquakes and floods and should forward comments to the
                   City.
          c.       The Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the Southern California Gas Company should
                   continue the review of their facilities and distribution/transmission networks and centers,
                   especially with regard to fire and earthquake hazards to ensure adequate and safe
                   service pursuant to the standard of construction, operation and maintenance mandated
                   by the California Public Utilities Commission. Where local standards differ significantly
                   with those of the Commission, the City should inform the commission accordingly in order
                   that such differences be taken into consideration.
                                                                                                         S-3
        d.       Structures, which have been inspected and found to have a high degree of hazard from
                 earthquake, landslide, fire or flooding should be brought up to an acceptable level of risk
                 or mitigated to reduce the level of risk. Programs used to bring structures up to standards
                 should include, but not be limited to, structural rehabilitation, flood proofing, occupancy
                 reduction, and demolition and reconstruction.
        e.       The City shall initiate abatement proceedings against structures found to be unsafe.
S-2     New Development
        New development within the City's jurisdiction shall be designed to withstand natural and man-
        made hazards to acceptable levels of risk by:
        a.       Adoption of the most recent safety requirements in the Building and Fire Code.
        b.       Using the planning and technical criteria presented in the Safety Element, as basic
                 guidelines for all new public facilities.
        c.       Evaluating new development, particularly industrial, commercial or utility development, to
                 ensure that construction or operation of the project will not cause hazardous conditions at
                 an unacceptable level of risk.
        d.       Requiring new development to avoid portions of sites with high hazard levels.
Bluff Erosion/Instability
Background
        Approximately five miles of the northwest portion of the city's shoreline consists of cliffs and bluffs
ranging in height from ten to one hundred feet. The rapidly receding nature of this long cliff line has
claimed, and continues to threaten, a broad range of public and private investments located near the
edge. This bluff erosion has been caused by both natural events and human activities, including
development and intrusion up and down the unprotected banks. Eight areas of the city suffered damage
from severe storms in 1978.
        The Coastal Act (Section 30253) addresses bluff erosion as follows:
        "New development shall:
                 (1)      Minimize risks to life and property in areas of high geologic, flood, and fire
                          hazard.
                 (2)      Assure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute
                          significantly to erosion, geologic instability or destruction of the site or
                          surrounding area or in any way require the construction of protective devices that
                          would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs."
        Information regarding bluff erosion rates along the city's bluff areas is contained in the General
Plan Technical Appendix.
        The city completed a bluff erosion study addressing public oceanfront property in 1991. However,
precise information regarding cliff retreat is not available for the majority of the privately owned coastline.
More information on a site- to-site basis is needed regarding the erosion process, rates of erosion, and
exact locales of most severe cliff or bluff-top erosion other than those identified by the City. Over the
years, many types of protective structures have been built. No comprehensive information is available
describing the devices, their maintenance requirements or long-term effects on the shoreline.
Policies
S-3     Bluff Set-Backs
        All structures shall be set back a safe distance from the top of the bluff in order to retain the
        structures for a minimum of 100 years, and to neither create nor con- tribute significantly to
        erosion, geologic instability or destruction of the site or require construction of protective devices
        that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs.
        The City shall determine the required setback based on the following criteria:
                                                                                                      S-4
    a.       For development on single-family residential lots subdivided prior to January 23,1981, the
             minimum bluff setback shall be 25 feet from the top of the bluff (bluff-top is defined as
             the point at which the slope begins to change from near horizontal to more vertical). A
             geologic investigation may be required at the discretion of the City Engineer, and a
             greater setback may be applied as the geologic study would warrant.
    b.       For all other development, a geologic study shall be required for any development
             proposed.
S-4 Bluff-top Guidelines/Geologic Studies
    Site-specific geologic reports shall incorporate the information requirements contained in the
    State Coastal Commission's guidelines for Geologic Stability of Bluff-top Development, as
    adopted May 3, 1977 and updated on December 16, 1981. This guideline is included in the
    Appendix. The report shall consider, describe and analyze the following:
     1.      A site-specific erosion control plan to assure that the development would not contribute to
             the erosion or failure of any bluff face shall be prepared by a licensed engineer qualified
             in hydrology and soil mechanics for all bluff-top development.
     2.      Cliff geometry and site topography, extending the surveying work beyond the site as
             needed to depict unusual geomorphic conditions that might affect the site. (See
             guidelines in the Appendix.)
     3.      Historic, current and foreseeable cliff erosion, including investigation of recorded land
             surveys and tax assessment records in addition to the use of historic maps and
             photographs where available and possible changes in shore configuration and sand
             transport.
     4.      Geologic conditions, including soil, sediment and rock types and characteristics in
             addition to structural features, such as bedding, joints, and faults.
     5.      Evidence of past or potential landslide conditions, the implications of such conditions for
             the proposed development and the potential effects of the development on landslide
             activity.
     6.      Impact of construction activity on the stability of the site and adjacent area.
     7.      Ground and surface conditions and variations, including hydrologic changes caused by
             the development (i.e., introduction of irrigation water to the ground water system);
             alterations in surface drainage.
     8.      Potential erodibility of the site and mitigating measures to be used to ensure minimized
             erosion problems during and after construction (i.e., landscaping and drainage design).
     9.      Effects of marine erosion on seacliffs;
    10.      Potential effects of seismic forces resulting from a maximum credible earthquake; and
    11.      Any other factors that might affect slope stability.
S-5 Development on Bluff Face
    No additional development shall be permitted on any bluff face, except engineered staircases or
    access-ways to provide public beach access, and pipelines for scientific research or coastal
    dependent industry. Drain- pipes shall be allowed only where no other less environmentally
    damaging drain system is feasible and the drainpipes are designed and placed to minimize
    impacts to the bluff face, toe and beach. Drainage devices extending over the bluff face shall not
    be permitted if the property can be drained away from the bluff face, toe and beach.
S-6 Shoreline Protective Devices
    Shoreline protective devices, such as seawalls, revetments, groins, breakwaters, and riprap shall
    be permitted only when necessary to protect existing principal structures, coastal dependent
    uses, and public beaches in danger of erosion. If no feasible alternative is available, shoreline
    protection structures shall be designed and constructed in conformance with Section 30235 of the
    Coastal Act and all other policies and standards of the City's Local Coastal Program. Devices
    must be designed to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply, and to
    maintain public access to and along the shoreline. Design and construction of protective devices
    shall minimize alteration of natural landforms, and shall be constructed to minimize visual
    impacts. The city shall develop detailed standards for the construction of new and repair of
                                                                                               S-5
         existing shoreline protective structures and devices. As funding is available, the city will inventory
         all existing shoreline protective structures within its boundaries.
S-7      Hazards Overlay Zone
         Areas where bluff-top hazards exist shall be included within and subject to the requirements of
         the Hazards Overlay Zone
Flood Hazards
Background
         The City has two areas with potential flood hazards: the Pismo Creek/Price Canyon and Meadow
Creek/Pismo Marsh drainage-ways. The last flood of major proportions occurred in 1971, which damaged
private and city property along the two creeks. Since the floods, the city with the aid of the Army Corps of
Engineers has made alterations to Pismo Creek channel to reduce flood hazard. Existing flood plain
maps prepared prior to the recent creek improvements show that substantial developed areas in the city's
commercial core and Pismo Creek Planning Areas could be subject to flooding from a 100-year storm.
         The majority of the Meadow Creek flood plain within the city limits is contained within the State
Department of Fish and Game controlled Pismo Lake Ecological Preserve (Pismo Marsh). The preserve
is bounded on all sides by slopes, which rise over the 100-year level of flood, thus containing flooding
within the preserve boundary. Meadow Creek leaves the preserve at State Highway 1, which crosses the
creek via a low-lying bridge. The creek flows into the North beach Campground where it divides into two
channels, one flowing into the ocean, and the other flowing southward into the Grover City area. The
creek channel floods state Highway 1, the commercial property to the north of the creek at State High-
way 1, and the North Beach Campground during periods of heavy storm flows. The level of flooding is
affected by tidal conditions.
         One hundred year flood plain maps have been prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers. Any
proposed project within the existing mapped area should supply flood plain information prior to project
construction in order to determine whether or not the property is subject to flooding.
Policies
S-8      Flood Plain Zoning
         Areas subject to flooding shall be mapped within and subject to the requirements of the Flood
         Plain Overlay Zone.
S-9      Restrictions on Development Within the 100-Year Flood Plain
         1.        No habitable structure shall be approved for construction within the area of the 100-year
                   flood plain unless the applicant demonstrates that the finished floor elevations are at least
                   one foot above the projected elevation of the 100-year flood, except as allowed by FEMA
                   regulations.
         2.        No new fill, structure, or other obstruction shall be permitted to be placed or constructed
                   within a flood-way unless a detailed hydrologic study has been prepared and approved
                   by the City Engineer ensuring that the proposed project will not obstruct, in any way,
                   passing floodwaters.
         3.        No new development shall be allowed in the 100-year flood plain which will contribute to
                   or increase flood hazards on the same or other properties or which would require
                   construction of flood control devices.
         4.        Any application for development on a parcel any portion of which is within the boundary
                   of the 100-year floodplain shall be required to submit a hydrological engineer's report
                   which assesses the nature of the flood risks, identifies the boundary of the 100-year flood
                   plain and specifies the protective measures that should be undertaken to attain
                   compliance with the city's flood plain zoning and with FEMA regulations.
                                                                                                    S-6
Geological/Seismic Hazards
Background
          The California State Legislature has placed specific responsibilities on local government for
identification and evaluation of seismic hazards and the formation of programs and regulations to reduce
risk.
          Cities and counties must take seismic hazards into account in their planning programs. The basic
objective is to reduce loss of life, injuries, damage to property, and economic and social dislocations
resulting from future earthquakes.
          The City of Pismo Beach is located in a seismically active area. However, no active faults are
known to be present within or in the near vicinity of Pismo Beach and surface rupture resulting from fault
movement is not considered a significant problem within the City. Additionally, the potential for landslides
is considered to be negligible in rocks that underlie most of the city and its surrounding hills.
          Ground shaking could occur in Pismo Beach, primarily from the San Andreas Fault. The
Nacimiento fault is considered a secondary source of strong ground shaking but would have a negligible
effect on Pismo Beach. This section of the Safety Element is a refinement of the larger County of San
Luis Obispo Safety Element Study. The "Technical Report" from the County is to be considered an
internal part of the General Plan and is included in the Technical Appendix. From analysis derived in the
County's Technical Report it is recommended that the criteria on Table S-1 be utilized as a basis for
determining acceptable risk in Pismo Beach.
          Hazards that can be effectively evaluated as a part of individual site investigations are treated in a
general manner with the intent that the results be used to facilitate the administration of public safety. The
relationship and attendant responsibilities between this concept and the evaluation of specific
seismic/geologic hazards is given on Table S-2.
          The primary responsibility for evaluation of each aspect of a hazard is shown by an "XX". Those
aspects for which either sector may commonly have a secondary responsibility are indicated by an "X".
The intent is to show the distribution of responsibility for evaluation of a hazard.
          The derivation of the twenty seismic zones for the entire County has been documented in the
County Technical Report. They are expressive of the level of ground motion that can reasonably be
anticipated from earthquakes on the principal fault systems affecting San Luis Obispo County. The
characteristics of each seismic zone are represented by response spectra, which translate ground motion
into displacement (inches); velocity (inches per second); and acceleration (inches per second expressed
as a percent of the acceleration of gravity). These three factors, which are derived from mathematical
analysis, are essentially the descriptors of each seismic zone.
          The potential for liquefaction and landslides is present within and surrounding the city.
Liquefaction areas are limited, however, to soils having relatively low compaction underlain by shallow
groundwater (refer to Technical Appendix). Landslides are also limited, primarily to the hills flanking the
City on the north.
          Allocation of resources towards realizing the following policies will be a continuing consideration
of decision-makers over a long period of time.
          An earthquake of Richter Magnitude 8.0 to 8.5 can be expected in the future. Secondary seismic
hazards could result from the interaction of ground shaking with existing soil and bedrock conditions, and
include liquefaction, settlement, landslides, tsunamis or "tidal waves", and seiches (oscillating waves in
lakes or reservoirs).
          The State Legislature in 1986 passed SB.547 (Government Code Section 8875) requiring every
local jurisdiction in Seismic Zone 4, which includes Pismo Beach, to identify and mitigate all "potentially
hazardous buildings." These are defined as buildings constructed of brick or other masonry materials,
and that are not reinforced. Pismo Beach has identified 21 hazardous buildings including City Hall.
                                                                                                   S-7
Policies
S-10   Hazardous Overlay Zone
       Land areas subject to hazards associated with steep slope, slope instability and drainage
       problems shall be included within the Hazardous Overlay and Protection Zone. Generally, all
       lands in excess of 10% slope shall be included.
S-11   Development Review in Hazardous Overlay Zone
       Geologic reports may be required and shall be re- viewed by the appropriate decision-making
       body, prior to approval of any development permits for projects located within the Hazardous
       Overlay Zone.
S-12   Education Programs
       The City should develop an information program to familiarize citizens with seismic safety issues.
       School districts and agencies related to aged, handicapped and seismically susceptible industries
       should be encouraged to develop education programs relative to seismic awareness.
                                                                                             S-8
S-13     Development Regulations
         a.       The Technical Appendix should be made available to developers for review and use
                  when proposing land development projects.
         b.       Development shall be prohibited in:
                  1.        landslide risk areas without site-specific slope stability investigations.
                  2.        areas of high potential liquefaction without site-specific analysis of liquefaction
                            potential.
S-14     Critical Facilities
         a.       All critical facilities constructed prior to 1948 should be reviewed by a structural engineer
                  for potential hazards. Since many of these structures have regional impact, the source of
                  funding for the inspection program ought to be at the regional level.
         b.       All new critical facilities shall be designed to continue functioning after a major
                  earthquake.
         c.       Emergency communication centers, fire stations, and other emergency service facilities
                  should be examined as to their earthquake resistant capacities. If found below acceptable
                  standards, a program to mitigate potential hazards should be immediately established.
S-15     Brick and Masonry Non-Reinforced Buildings
         The City shall adopt ordinance or other mitigation programs to reduce the hazards from brick or
         masonry non-reinforced buildings. Such regulations shall require building strengthening or
         demolition.
S-16     Community Programs
         Community programs that train volunteers to assist police, fire, and civil defense personnel how
         to perform effectively after an earthquake, shall be supported.
S-17     New Construction Across Faults Prohibited
         New construction directly astride or across known faults, or fault zones, shall be prohibited. Non-
         structural land uses, however, should not be prohibited.
Wildland Fire Protection
Fires in undeveloped areas that result from the ignition of accumulated brush and woody material are
termed "wildland fires". These fires represent a significant threat to safety in San Luis Obispo County and
to some extent within the City of Pismo Beach.
S-18     Wildland Fire Analysis
         The City shall require a wildland fire analysis and plan as part of all future annexations.
         Additionally, the city shall prepare a wildland fire analysis and plan prior to implementation of the
         required open space/park, Conservation Element Policy CO-8. At a minimum these plans shall
         specify:
         a.       Appropriate fuel clearance areas
         b.       Building set-backs from undeveloped areas
         c.       Access to high hazard areas
         d.       Standards for evaluation of areas
         e.       Identified turnouts and helispots in road system
         f.       Water supplies
         g.       Manpower and equipment requirements.
                                                                                                       S-9
Emergency Preparedness Plan
Emergency Preparedness - San Luis Obispo County and incorporated cities peacetime emergency
organizations rely heavily on the concept of mutual aid for responding to major disasters. While the basic
planning framework and emergency inventories should be adequate for most disasters, they may prove
insufficient when confronted with a major earthquake, widespread flooding, or a large fire.
Emergency communications between different agencies cooperating under mutual aid agreements may
be impaired in a major disaster by the lack of a common emergency communication channel.
Risk - Given that certain natural hazards exist in San Luis Obispo County, it is necessary to decide
whether the risks these hazards present are acceptable or whether action is necessary to reduce the
level of risk. The Council on Intergovernmental Relations (CIR) defines "risk" from natural and man-made
hazards in three categories:
1.       Acceptable Risk: The level of risk below which no specific action by government is deemed to be
         necessary.
2.       Unacceptable Risk: The level of risk above which specific action by government is deemed to be
         necessary to protect life and property.
3.       Avoidable Risk: A risk which is not to be taken because the individual or public goals can be
         achieved at the same, or less, total "cost" by other means without taking the risk.
To determine levels of acceptable risk is to provide an answer to the question, "How safe is safe
enough?" No environment is perfectly hazard-free. Natural and man-made hazards of some kind are
always present, especially in urban environments. However, some hazards cause only minimal loss or
occur so rarely that they need not be planned for at the community level. On the other hand, some events
occur often enough, are large enough, and have the potential for major disruption of the community such
that a community- wide response to the risk is called for. Deciding the level of response to natural
hazards such as fire and flooding is a public process, which involves making a judgement, either explicit
or implicit, about acceptable risk. Scientific expertise can determine the magnitude of the hazard and
estate the probable effects, but it cannot decide for the public how much risk to assume (or not assume
by planning for loss- reduction). The determination for acceptable risk from hazardous events also
involves differentiating among man-made structures according to their potential effect on the loss if life
and their importance in terms of emergency response and continued community functioning.
A recommended list of critical facilities based on potential effects on loss of life and importance to
continued community functions is contained in Table S-3.
The management and coordination of emergency preparedness and response efforts, related to the
hazards discussed in the preceding sections, is shared by all levels of government. San Luis Obispo
County and its cities rely heavily on the concept of mutual aid for responding to major disasters. The
County's Office of Emergency Services is the agency designated to coordinate the responses to
emergency situations which affect more than one agency.

S-19       Emergency Disaster Programs
           The city shall develop and maintain a multi-hazard emergency response plan, which conforms to
           state and federal requirements. Objectives of the plan should be:
           a.        To save lives and protect property;
           b.        To provide a basis for direction and control of emergency operations;
           c.       To provide for the continuity of government;
           d.       To repair and restore essential systems and services;
           e.       To provide for the protection, use and distribution of remaining resources;
           f.       To coordinate operations with the civil defense emergency operations or other
                    jurisdictions;
           g.       To enable the City to be self-sufficient in the weeks following a severe earthquake, such
                    as a magnitude 8.5 event on the San Andreas Fault;
           h.       To provide for emergency medical facilities, temporary shelter, emergency
                    communications equipment and emergency water and food supplies.
            i.      To establish a priority system for roads, services and other vital needs in the event of an
                    earthquake disaster.
           j.       To train volunteers to assist police, fire, and civil defense personnel after an earthquake.
           The City should annually review its Emergency Plan to anticipate emergency services, which may
           be required under mutual aid agreements and in the event of major accidents, including a
           radiological accident at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Generating Station. The city's
           Emergency Plan should also be reviewed and revised to anticipate an accident during the
           transportation of hazardous materials. Primary emphasis should be given to responding to an
           accident on the Southern Pacific rail line or U.S. Highway 101.
S-20       Mutual Aid
           The City shall make arrangements with the County, other cities, the state, and other agencies for
           mutual aid in emergency situations. Emergency service plans and agreements shall be based on
           a realistic assessment of the limited resources available to the various agencies.
                                                                                                    S-11
S-21 Essential Public Services
     A program designed to coordinate, repair and restore essential public services and utility systems
     following disaster-caused interruptions shall be prepared and maintained.
S-22 Hazardous Materials
     A use permit shall be required for any commercial or industrial use involving potentially
     hazardous materials. Hazardous waste management plans shall be required as a condition of
     approval for such permits.
S-23 Evacuation Routes
     Highways generally most suitable as evacuation routes are Highway 101, Highway 1, and Price
     Canyon Road. The particular route and direction of evacuation shall be determined at the time of
     an emergency situation based upon an evaluation of conditions at.that time by the county and city
     emergency operations centers.
S-24 Analysis and Education Programs
     The City shall with the aid of the county and state, continue to provide for more detailed scientific
     analysis of natural and man-caused hazards impacting in the City. Specifically:
     a.      In reviewing development proposals for future water impoundments, the City should
             require (1) an evaluation of the potential inundation areas and (2) design of the dam to
             withstand the earthquakes which can be expected in the area.
     b.      Information on potential disasters, appropriate preparations and planned responses shall
             be disseminated as widely as possible to the media and general public. Special attention
             should be afforded to those groups particularly susceptible to seismic, fire and flooding
             hazards including, but not limited to, school districts, agencies involved with the aged,
             and agencies involved with handicapped persons. These agencies should be encouraged
             to develop educational programs of their own relative to hazard awareness.
     c.      The city's Emergency Services Director should be responsible for establishing community
             programs that train volunteers to assist police, fire and civil defense personnel during and
             after a major earthquake, fire or flood.
     d.      The City should continue to encourage programs in the lower grades using displays and
             demonstrations that would expose younger children to the nature and strength of fire.
             Such programs should tend to replace their natural curiosity with a sense of respect.
     e.      The City should continue to support or sponsor exhibits and presentations in secondary
             schools which demonstrate the more involved aspects of fire dynamics, i.e., major
             contributing factors to fire hazard and the relationship of fire to the natural ecology, and
             encourage parental cooperation and assistance in overall fire education programs.
                                                                                              S-12
