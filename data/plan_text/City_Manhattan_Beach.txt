Cultural Arts
Through visual arts, music, dance, drama, literary, and other
performing arts, we as humans express our emotions and
convictions and reach out to share these feelings with others.
The arts bring us together as a community. Manhattan Beach
has long recognized the importance and value that cultural arts
bring to the community. Visual and performing arts provide
programs that meet the creative, social, and cultural needs of
residents by providing entertainment, spiritual expression, and
life-long education. In recognition of the humanizing effects the
arts produce and the benefits they provide, the City sponsors
visual, literary, musical, and performing arts programs,
exhibitions, festivals, and Concerts in the Park. The Cultural Arts
Program also facilitates the arts-in-education program, which is
designed to fully and cohesively integrate arts into the school
curriculum.
Manhattan Beach’s cultural arts facilities include the Creative Arts
Center and the Ceramic Studio. The Creative Arts Center is
located at 1560 Manhattan Beach Boulevard. The Center
includes free exhibits, art education classes, workshops, camps,
after-school arts programs, and other classes offered by the City’s
Parks and Recreation Department. The Ceramic Studio, located           Throughout the year, the

that distinguish Manhattan Beach from other cities.
The Parks and Recreation Department anticipates a growing
demand for cultural arts programs in Manhattan Beach and has
outlined a response in the Cultural Arts Education Master Plan.
The Plan includes initiatives to cultivate and sustain a sense of
civic identity and pride by fostering awareness of visual and
performing arts through education programs. The Plan sets the
foundation for exhibits, concerts, festivals, performances, and art
education programs.

                       Public Art
                       Recognizing that art in public places is important to the vitality of
                       Manhattan Beach and its mission to preserve, enhance, and
                       strengthen quality of life, the City has defined and approved a
                       Public Art Master Plan. The goals of the Plan are to preserve the
                       heritage of Manhattan Beach, and to educate and cultivate a sense
                       of civic identity and pride by expressing the ideas, traditions, and
                       value of the community in which public art is placed.
                       The Public Art Master Plan establishes goals and criteria for the
                       acquisition of art works, sets guidelines for inclusion in capital
                       improvement projects, defines appropriate site locations,
                       establishes a process for documentation, maintenance and
                       acceptance of art donations, provides a variety of funding
                       mechanisms, establishes a public art trust fund, and outlines an
                       implementation plan.
                       In support of the Public Art Master Plan, the City adopted a one
                       percent for art fee in November, 2002. The fee applies to large
                       residential, commercial, and industrial projects for the development
                       of public art.

Educational Institutions
Education is the foundation of a
community. Education is at the heart of
economic prosperity and security; it
channels creativity and success and
enriches lives. A community that values
and promotes education and learning
benefits its residents and the business
sector.      Public and private schools,
extension centers, and continuing
educational opportunities are most
successful when they have the support of
students, families, City officials, and the
business community. These partnerships
are essential to providing quality
education that all deserve.                                              Mira Costa High School has been

Landscape Resources
Trees and other landscaping provide extraordinary biological
and aesthetic benefits to the community. They filter airborne
pollutants, conserve energy by shading buildings and paved
surfaces, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide, serve as wind
breaks, reduce stormwater runoff, support wildlife, and provide a
welcome “greenscape”in the urban environment.
Trees
In Manhattan Beach, where buildings substantially cover lot
areas, streets are narrow and open space is limited. The City
and residents have worked hard to provide landscape relief in
the form of trees on public and private property.                In
neighborhoods where trees have grown to maturity, the trees
create a distinct character and feel, particularly within the Tree
Section (so designated, however, to reflect the street names:
Elm, Pine, etc.) and neighborhoods along the Valley/Ardmore
greenbelt of Veterans Parkway. Increasingly, City residents
have recognized the value trees create for their homes and the
quality appearance trees contribute to Manhattan Beach’s
business districts. City staff and policy makers have realized
that a more comprehensive, coordinated approach to street
tree planning, maintenance, and protection of mature trees on
private property can amplify the benefits trees provide.
Trees have always been a part of Manhattan Beach history.
The Eucalyptus tree, an Australian native, was introduced into
Manhattan Beach in the early 1900s. The tree was first
established in California in 1856 and from 1870 on, the various
subspecies were widely planted for windbreaks, firewood,
shade, and beauty. The trees were later spread throughout
California to create wooded landscapes for housing
developments. Rosecrans Avenue, El Camino Real (today
Sepulveda Boulevard), and Center Street (today Manhattan
Beach Boulevard) were all lined with Eucalyptus trees to work
as windbreaks and also help reduce soil erosion. In the 1930s,
during the widening of Center Street, 284 Eucalyptus trees
were declared traffic and pedestrian hazards and later
removed. Today, unfortunately, this tree has been dwindling in
numbers in Manhattan Beach and throughout California due to
the infestation of the Red Gum lerp psyllids (Glycaspis
brimblecombei), a non-native insect pest that is slowly killing
the trees.      A collaborative effort by State and local
                                                                           P A G E      C R - 17

                                      Trees need space to grow. The restricted rights-of-way along City
                                      streets challenge landscape planners and City engineers who
                                      must balance infrastructure needs — such as new sidewalks,
                                      parking pads, and utility undergrounding — with root space and
                                      canopy requirements for street trees. The Municipal Code
                                      requires property owners to maintain the public property
                                      adjacent to their real property, including sidewalks, so it is
                                      imperative that residents and the City implement tree planting
                                      and maintenance standards to minimize damage to the urban
                                      infrastructure while maintaining the health of the urban forest.
                                      The City is committed to preserving existing trees and expanding
                                      the urban forest by replacing trees that are damaged or dying,
                                      and planting new trees. As part of this commitment, and as

                                      refine adopted tree planting guidelines by adopting and
                                      maintaining a comprehensive street tree plan that establishes a
                                      consistent and coordinated approach to urban forestry.
Trees and landscaping on private
     and public property provides
  tremendous value to everyone,
     not just the property owner.
Eucalyptus trees, as shown here,
       are quite large and provide
   extensive greenery and shade.

Landscaping
Landscaping can enliven and give purpose to outdoor space; a
rich, coordinated palette of landscape materials can provide
scale, texture, and color. W ell-maintained landscaping can
beautify property, adding character and uniqueness to private
and public areas.
Private Property
Landscaping of private residential and business properties should
be designed, installed, and maintained for long-term sustainability
by a knowledge of and respect for the natural environment.
Appropriate landscaping that is well maintained can add
aesthetic richness within any context.            W ell-landscaped
properties add value, reduce and control stormwater runoff, and
create unique and recognizable qualities to neighborhoods and
districts.
The City’s Tree Ordinance protects front yard trees in the Tree
Section, and the ordinance has been expanded to all residential
areas except the Beach area.
Walkstreets and Right-of-Way
W alkstreets provide convenient pedestrian access to the beach,
and they create stunning corridors with ocean vistas from those
properties along the walkstreets and vistas for the public using
walkstreets. Landscaping in the encroachment area (the section
of public right-of-way located between the property line and the
edge of the walkway) that is excessive in height can obstruct
vistas and limit these “view corridors”. The Manhattan Beach
Municipal Code provides standards for landscaping, as well as
other encroachments (fences, walls, and decks), in the public
right-of-way to preserve these vistas.
City standards for landscaping the walkstreets and public rights-
of-way balance protection of scenic vistas, safety visibility for
pedestrians and vehicles, provision of parking areas, and creation
of beneficial landscaped areas.

Conservation of Energy
and Water Resources
Conserving and managing natural resources in Manhattan Beach
ensures that these resources remain available for future residents
to enjoy.
Energy Conservation
When we drive our children to school, boil a pot of water, or
cool down the house on a warm sunny day, energy is consumed.
The use of energy keeps our appliances and vehicles running but
requires the burning of fossil fuels. Recognizing the sources of
                                                                          Most households and businesses

and understanding the consequences associated with energy
                                                                          old, inefficient appliances,

one quarter of the electricity generated. Not only is supply
limited, but extracting and using these fuels dirties the air and can
cause health problems such as chronic respiratory ailments.
The City’s goals and policies recognize the importance of
efficient energy use and conservation by Manhattan Beach
residential, commercial, office, and industrial consumers. Efficient
energy use can be encouraged by changing customer behavior,
rewarding use of energy-saving appliances, and employing
building design and construction approaches that reduce electric
power and natural gas usage. Alternative energy sources such as
solar – both active and passive – provide opportunities to reduce
reliance on more traditional sources. While the General Plan
accommodates very little net new development in the City, with
new development resulting largely from land use recycling,
Manhattan Beach residents, the business community, and
institutions can use less energy through simple conservation
techniques and can thereby contribute to environmental
enhancements locally and throughout the region.

                                      Manhattan Beach, like the rest of the basin, receives less than 13
                                      inches of rainfall annually.1 Water is considered a limited natural

                                      gallons annually. That is equivalent to every Californian drinking
                                      three cups of water per day. Water conservation represents the

Manhattan Beach has long promoted efficient water use through
education and public information, municipal water management
programs, and regulations involving landscaping and
requirements for water conservation during shortages. Economic
and financial incentives can be used to encourage conservation
and prudent use of water, although sometimes legislative
mandates are required. In 1991, the City imposed conservation
measures when the City experienced a substantial water
shortage.      However, the City’s preferred approach is to
continually promote and encourage wise water use.
Goals and Policies: Conservation of Energy
and Water Resources
The following goals and policies aim to conserve energy and

                 conservation, and storm water run-off pollution
                 reduction.
Policy CR-5.10 Encourage and support the use of alternative fuel
                 vehicles, including support of charging or “fueling”
                 facilities.
The City’s vehicle fleet consists of vehicles that require
compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and electricity.
Alternative fuel vehicles burn cleaner and consume fewer natural
resources. Fueling stations should be widely available to the
public, such as commercial areas, as this technology grows.
Policy CR-5.11: Support sustainable building practices.
Sustainable building practices include designing, constructing
and operating buildings and landscapes to incorporate energy
efficiency, water conservation, waste minimization, pollution
prevention,      resource-efficient      materials,      and       indoor
environmental quality in all phases of a building's life.
Information and resources related to sustainable building are
provided to the public on the City’s website. The City is
developing standards for recycling of construction and
demolition debris.
Policy CR-5.12: Support other agencies              in    their     Livable
                 Communities programs.
Livable Community programs include the following key elements:

                                    Air Quality
                                    Every day, each of us breathes about 3,400 gallons of air, yet our
                                    air is contaminated on a daily basis by our activities: driving cars,
                                    burning fossil fuels, and manufacturing chemicals. Although air
                                    quality has improved since the 1960s despite substantial
                                    economic expansion and population growth, further
                                    improvements are needed. The Los Angeles basin still has some
                                    of the most polluted air in the nation.
   In the 1950s, smog levels in
       Southern California were
  worse than they are today in

                                    (PM10). The South Coast Air Q uality Management District
                                    (AQ MD) regulates air quality improvement programs within the
                                    Basin and works to improve regional air quality to achieve
                                    Federal and State standards.
                                    The AQ MD monitors the air quality in the basin through a
                                    regional network of air pollution monitoring stations to
                                    determine if the national and State standards for air pollutants
                                    and emission limits of toxic air contaminants are being achieved.
                                    One of these monitoring stations is located in the city of
                                    Hawthorne, less than two miles from Manhattan Beach’s
                                    boundary. The AQ MD is also responsible for controlling
                                    emissions from stationary sources of air pollution. These can
                                    include anything from large power plants and refineries to the
                                    corner gas station. Manhattan Beach has continued to work with
                                    the AQMD and in accordance with the Air Quality Management

exhaust in the air. Most pollution control strategies have aimed at
reducing vehicle usage and using cleaner-burning fuels.

Parks Classifications and Standards
The City park system consists of neighborhood parks, community
parks, and school grounds for which the City and Manhattan
Beach Unified School District maintain joint-use agreements. The
City owns, operates, and maintains eleven parks primarily
designed and used for active recreation. Joint-use agreements
for use of school grounds and play areas provide residents with
additional recreational facilities, particularly athletic fields. Table
CR-1 lists recreation facilities in Manhattan Beach, with locations
shown on Figure CR-1. Figure CR-1 also identifies areas of the
City lacking local recreation resources.
The types of parks and recreation facilities in the City can be
classified as follows:
Pocket Park. A pocket park is a small neighborhood-oriented
facility used to address limited or isolated recreational needs.
Such parks usually range in size from 2,500 square feet to under
one acre. Pocket parks can be built on small, challenged
properties and fill a localized park niche.
Neighborhood Park. Neighborhood parks, by definition, are
specifically oriented toward residents living within a one-half mile
radius of the park. These parks encompass one to ten acres, with
some sports fields and facilities usually geared toward the
recreation needs of children.
Specialized Recreation Area. Specialized recreation areas are
facilities that provide limited recreational use. This includes the
1.7-mile Veterans Parkway with its multi-use trail.
Community Park. Community parks, as traditionally defined,
vary from ten to sixty acres in size and serve residents within a
three-mile radius.       These parks usually serve a broader
demographic and include a variety of recreational amenities.
School Park. School parks, or joint-use parks, combine the
resources of a school facility and park. School parks are unique
because they provide recreational needs in an efficient and cost-
effective manner. Due to their size, school parks can offer
broader amenities than a traditional neighborhood park, often
more comparable to a community park, with baseball fields,
basketball courts, tennis courts, and playgrounds.
                                                                               P A G E     C R - 3

                                     tremendous recreational opportunities to residents of Manhattan
                                     Beach and people living throughout the southland. These
                                     resources define Manhattan Beach and contribute significantly to
                                     its attractive living environment. Amenities include volleyball
                                     courts, biking and walking paths, play areas, and public parking.
                                     The County of Los Angeles, Department of Beaches and Harbor
                                     manages these improvements. The pier is owned by the State of
                                     California and leased to the City of Manhattan Beach.
                                     Park Needs and Service Areas
                                     Manhattan Beach has established a service standard of providing
                                     5.0 acres of park and recreation facilities per 1,000 residents.
                                     The 2000 Census reported 33,852 people living in Manhattan
                                     Beach. With approximately 179 acres of park, beach, and school
                                     grounds within the City (as indicated in Table CR-1), residents
                                     enjoy a ratio of 5.3 acres of parkland for every 1,000 people.
                                     General Plan land use policy allows for up to 35,786 residents
                                     within the City. If the current park acreage remained constant,
                                     the ratio would reduce to 5.0 acres per 1,000 people, still
                                     achieving the City’s target.

While providing park acreage at or above the established
community standard is important, the City must also ensure that
all neighborhoods are well served by park locations and that park
facilities match residents’ needs.       Ideally, all residents of
Manhattan Beach should have access to a park within a
reasonable walking distance of their homes. This walking
distance is referred to as the park service area. The service area
standards recommended by the National Recreation and Parks
Association indicate that a park typically should cover a 1/2- to
1/4-mile service area radius, depending on the size of the park.
One-quarter mile is an approximate five-minute walking distance.
Smaller parks such as pocket parks typically have a smaller
service area, matching park needs to the immediate
neighborhoods.
Based on this standard, Manhattan Beach neighborhoods are
well served by local parks (Figure CR-1).               For those
neighborhoods in the southeast portion of the community,
school athletic fields provide a local park function. However,
both residents of these neighborhoods and City staff have
identified very localized needs for pocket parks and small passive
open space areas.
                                                                      Manhattan Beach provides

                                                                      Southern Californians,
                                                                      expansive open space of
                                                                      sandy beaches and ocean
                                                                      waves.
In the North End and El Porto, while no local parks exist, the
neighborhood has immediate access to the beach. To address
needs in these two areas, the City will examine opportunities for
public park space when such opportunities are available.
Manhattan Beach is a relatively young city, with families attracted
to the community by the high quality of living and excellent
public schools. Children and youth benefit from organized
recreation programs, which require sports fields that can occupy
significant acreage. The City also has a growing senior resident
population whose recreation needs are quite different. Even with
these diverse needs, the City is committed to providing park and
                                                                            P A G E          C R - 9

                                        Although Manhattan Beach is well served by parks, overuse of
                                        these recreational facilities has been an increasing issue for
                                        residents who live adjacent to the parks. Noise, parking, traffic
                                        problems, and safety concerns are just some of the issues
                                        identified at Sand Dune Park and Polliwog Park. Sand Dune Park
                                        has received numerous complaints from surrounding residents
                                        specifically because of park usage and attraction of people to the
                                        park beyond the immediate neighborhood due to the unique
                                        sand dune features of the park. The City has taken measures to
                                        address these concerns. The City will continue to take proactive
                                        measures and incorporate unique solutions to reduce the
                                        impacts of park use on surrounding residential properties.

U.S. Census data indicate that between 1990 and 2000, the City
experienced a significant percentage increase in the number of
children under the age of 18, as well as people over 55. This trend
is anticipated to continue as more families move to Manhattan
Beach and older residents elect to remain. Both demographic
trends and the voice of residents highlight the need to develop
additional programs for children, youth, and Manhattan Beach’s
older residents.
Goals and Policies: Parks and Recreation
Goal CR-1:        Maintain a park, recreation, and open space
                  system that provides a variety of recreational
                  opportunities accessible to all residents and
                  m eets the needs ofall residents.
Policy CR-1.1:    Promote the acquisition ofproperties for the purpose
                  ofconversion to parks and open space areas to meet
                  the needs ofCity residents.
Policy CR-1.2:    Encourage the development of quality commercial
                  recreation facilities on both privately held and City-
                  owned land under long-term lease or concession
                  agreements.
Policy CR-1.3:    Acquire properties that are subject to flooding during
                  heavy storms for the purpose ofconverting them to
                  open space and parkfacilities,when feasible to do so.
Policy CR-1.4:    Convert a portion ofthe water tower property into a
                  passive open space area.
A grassy portion of the water tower property, along Meadows
Avenue and 8th Street, contains a fenced area that is in the process
of being partially converted into a passive area for neighborhood
residents to enj oy. Large trees also cover the site, making it very
comfortable and inviting.
Policy CR-1.5:    Accept and actively seek out the donation ofprivate
                  residential properties for the development of
                  strategically located pocket parks and similar open
                  space.
                                                                              P A G E      C R - 11

                                       create ruptures and weaknesses termed “faults”. Movement
                                       along a fault releases stored energy and tension, thereby
                                       producing earthquakes. In 1933, the Long Beach Earthquake

                                       (see Figure CS-1 on the following page).
                                       The level of damage in the City resulting from an earthquake will
                                       depend upon the magnitude of the event, the epicenter distance
                                       from the City, the response of geologic materials, and the

                                       Earthquakes are often measured by the magnitude or the
                                       intensity of an earthquake. Magnitude measures the energy
                                       released at the source of the earthquake. It is a measure of the

size of the earthquake source and is the same number no matter
where you are or what the shaking feels like. Magnitude is
determined from measurements on seismographs. Intensity, on
the other hand, measures the strength of shaking produced by
the earthquake at a certain location. Intensity is determined from
effects on people, human structures, and the natural
environment. Magnitude identifies the shaking and damage
caused by the earthquake, and this value changes from location
to location.
The intensity scale differs from the magnitude scale in that the
effects of any one earthquake vary greatly from place to place, so
there may be many intensity values (e.g. IV, VII, X using the
Modified Mercalli Scale) measured from one earthquake. For
example, an earthquake having an epicenter in northern Los
Angeles County with a magnitude of 7.5 may also have an
intensity of X at that same location (see Table CS-1 for magnitude
and intensity comparisons). However, in Manhattan Beach, the

                                       intensity may be significantly lower because the earthquake
                                       occurred at a location nearly 40 miles away, but the magnitude
                                       of the earthquake is still registered as a 7.5. The following table

Maximum Credible Earthquake
Preparing for earthquakes requires preparing for the worst-case-
scenario earthquake. Engineers construct dams and bridges to
withstand the maximum credible earthquake (MCE) to prevent
structural failure. The MCE is defined as the largest possible
earthquake that could reasonably occur along the recognized
faults or within a particular seismic source, and by definition has
a very low probability of occurrence. City officials can prepare
against the worst-case-scenario earthquake by understanding the
potential effects of a MCE.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the stiffness of a soil is
reduced when ground shaking causes water-saturated soil to
become fluid and lose its strength.                            Earthquake-induced
liquefaction and related phenomena can cause significant
damage, creating problems with buildings, buried pipes, and
tanks. Liquefaction hazard areas in Manhattan Beach have been
identified along the coast, particularly the sandy areas of the
beach (Figure CS-2). Only lifeguard towers and a partial portion
of the Pier are located in liquefaction areas.

Landslides
The strong ground motions that occur during earthquakes are
capable of inducing landslides, generally where unstable soil
conditions already exist. Prior to the 1920s, when beach sand
was hauled away to facilitate development, Manhattan Beach
was known to have significantly large sand dunes, ranging from
50 to 70 feet in height. Past indication of these sand dunes are
evidenced in the north end of the City, particularly at Sand Dune
Park. The north end is the only area of the City where landslides
hazards and unstable soil have been recognized (Figure CS-2).
Tsunami Inundation
A tsunami, the Japanese word for harbor wave, describes a series
of traveling ocean waves of extremely long length and period
generated by a major undersea earthquake or landslide occurring
below or near the ocean floor. Large tsunamis can travel at
speeds exceeding 600 miles per hour, and the length, from crest
to crest, may be 60 miles or more. Yet the height of a tsunami,
from trough to crest, may only be a few inches or feet and
cannot be felt aboard ships in deep water.
The threat for tsunamis in California can be considered relatively
low given the low recurrence frequencies from these
phenomena. However, the threat of a seismically induced
undersea landslide off the Southern California coast exists.
Because locally generated tsunamis provide little time for
warning, Manhattan Beach residents must be informed of the
exact areas that could be inundated and the precise routes for
self-evacuation. Topography in Manhattan Beach greatly reduces
the risks for residents living further inland and away from the
beaches.
Local Flooding
No portions of Manhattan Beach lie within any Federally
designated flood zone. Localized flooding represents the only
flood concern. Historically, localized flooding has resulted in
damaged properties. Flooding can occur in low topographic
areas or where storm drains are unable to accommodate peak
flows during a storm event. Generally, localized flooding
dissipates quickly after heavy rain ceases. The topographical
features in the City, local drainage infrastructure, and proximity to
the ocean reduce any serious threat of storm flooding within the
City. City engineering records indicate that localized flooding of
consequence occurs roughly every 20 years. This has been an
                                                                              P A G E     C S - 7

                                      a number of years, particularly in the Tree Section. There are
                                      areas of Manhattan Beach that regularly flood during heavy
                                      storm events.

                                      The City’s narrow streets and alleys, steep topography, densely

                                      access of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, particularly
                                      longer vehicles. Several roadways in Downtown and North
                                      End/El Porto cannot accommodate longer wheelbase fire
                                      engines. The Fire Department has identified all impassible
                                      roadways and uses designated alternative routes to quickly gain
                                      access to all properties within the City. The Department also
                                      regularly practices maneuvering on narrow streets with large
                                      vehicles to analyze access limitations and develop routing
                                      alternatives in the event of responding to an emergency within
                                      an identified issue area.
                                      Raleigh Studio with fourteen operating film sound stages, has a
                                      constant impact on the Prevention Division of the Fire
                                      Department due to multi-tenant short-term usage and the unique
                                      character of the film business. There are also several high-rise
                                      buildings, 55 feet or greater in height, in the Rosecrans corridor.
                                      The City had adopted more stringent local codes to regulate
                                      these high-rises.        State and local codes require special
                                      construction design and annual inspections to ensure safety.
                                      To quickly extinguish urban fires, the Fire Department must have
                                      sufficient water pressure and storage throughout the City.
                                      Insufficient water pressure can jeopardize fire-fighting capabilities
                                      and allow fire to spread uncontrollably, causing excessive
                                      damage to structures. The Public Works Department regularly
                                      monitors the water system to ensure sufficient water pressure
                                      and storage to meet daily fire-fighting needs. Given that the City
                                      is largely built out and General Plan policies call for continued
                                      low-scale development, no substantive changes to the water
                                      system are anticipated for fire protection services over the long
                                      term.

                         Hazardous Materials
                         Release
                         Industrial processes and advancements create a myriad of
                         products and materials that make life easier. However, these
                         processes and materials can also use or generate substances
                         known to be hazardous to human health. The current regulatory
                         framework provides a high level of protection from the
                         hazardous materials manufactured by, transported to, and stored
                         in businesses in Manhattan Beach. Recognizing the hazards
                         presented by such materials and ensuring that an educated
                         public works with the City can minimize risks associated with
                         these materials and helps create safe conditions citywide.
                         A hazardous material is any material that because of its quantity,
                         concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics poses a
                         significant present or potential hazard to human health or safety
                         or the environment. Such materials may not be released through
                         any spilling, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging,
                         injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the
                         environment. Many businesses in Manhattan Beach, such as
                         drycleaners or automotive businesses, are allowed to handle and
                         transport hazardous materials.       The Federal Environmental
                         Protection Agency (EPA) and other Federal, State, and County
                         regulatory agencies closely monitor these businesses and sites.
                         Industrial uses in the adjacent city of El Segundo may have an
                         impact on Manhattan Beach residents.           The Chevron Oil
                         Refinery, El Segundo Generation Station (ESGS), and other
                         industrial uses occupy properties just north of Manhattan Beach
                         and are adjacent to many homes. Northrop Grumman (formerly
                         TRW, Inc. - Space and Electronics), with locations in Redondo
                         Beach and Manhattan Beach, handles hazardous materials. Fire
                         and/or spills of chemicals and petroleum can release hazardous
                         materials into the air that may warrant an evacuation of
                         surrounding areas. In January of 1996, a fire at the Chevron Oil
                         Refinery required notification of 2,900 Manhattan Beach
                         residents of the incident, although an evacuation was not
                         necessary.

A report by the California Energy Commission identified three
major types of hazards associated with the El Segundo Power
(Generation Station) Redevelopment Project. These include the
accidental release of ammonia, hydrazine vapor mishandling;fire;
and explosion from natural gas. Mitigation measures have been
introduced to reduce the threat of public exposures to these
hazards, as well as alternative use of chemicals that are less
hazardous1.

The Manhattan Beach Fire Department Fire Prevention Division
participates in a local hazardous materials program through a
joint agreement with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
Division responsibilities include cleanup of spills, leaks, and illegal
dumping, and monitoring hazardous materials within businesses
in Manhattan Beach.
Hazardous Waste Transport
All motor carriers and drivers involved in the transportation of
hazardous materials must comply with the requirements of
Federal and State regulations, and must apply for and obtain a
hazardous materials transportation license from the California
Highway Patrol.         When transporting explosives, inhalation
hazards, and highway route-controlled quantities of radioactive
materials, safe routing and safe stopping places are required. The
driver is also required to display warning placards or markings
while hauling hazardous waste. Given that Sepulveda Boulevard
(State Route 1) serves as the primary north-south travel route
through Los Angeles County coastal communities, the City must
ensure quick response to any accident along the roadway
involving hazardous waste transport vehicles.

                       Hazardous Waste Generators and
                       Contaminated Sites
                       Some businesses in Manhattan Beach and adjacent cities
                       produce, store, handle, and transport hazardous waste. Several
                       sites are contaminated due to prior poor handling practices,
                       insufficient storage of waste, and dumping activities. Regulatory
                       agencies such as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency
                       (EPA) closely monitor these businesses and sites to protect the
                       community from hazardous material releases. Issues of primary
                       concern include:
                               Hazardous waste generators (small and large generators,
                                transporters, and waste storage)

                                underground release of toxic materials)
                               Superfund archive sites
                               Leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs)
                       Hazardous Waste Generators
                       Over 40 commercial businesses in the City are small-quantity
                       generators that produce between 220 and 2,200 pounds (100
                       and 1,000 kilograms) per month of hazardous waste. These
                       businesses include automotive repair, gas stations, photograph
                       processing, dry cleaners, printing companies, and movie studios.
                       Northrop Grumman represents the sole large-quantity generator,
                       which is defined as any business that produces over 2,200
                       pounds (1,000 kilograms) per month of hazardous waste.
                       Pursuant to Federal law, all such businesses must register with
                       the EPA for record-keeping and recording. The Chevron Oil
                       Refinery and several industrial businesses in the cities of El
                       Segundo and Redondo Beach, along the border of Manhattan
                       Beach, are registered as large-quantity hazardous waste
                       generators as well.
                       Toxic Release Inventory
                       The EPA has established the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), a
                       publicly available database that contains information on toxic
                       chemical releases and other waste management activities
                       reported annually by certain covered industry groups, as well as
                       Federal facilities.      The Northrop Grumman Space and
                       Technology facility in Manhattan Beach has been identified by

the EPA on the TRI database. This facility released 9,000 pounds
of five different toxic chemicals into the air during 2000. The
facility also transfers over 28,000 pounds of six different
chemicals to a waste broker, which eventually sends the material
off to a waste treatment facility, incinerator, or recycling facility.
The EPA closely monitors the emissions from this facility, as well
as nearby facilities, to ensure that the annual limits allowed under
Federal regulations are not exceeded. The Chevron Oil Refinery
also releases toxics into the air, water, and land. In 2000, the
emissions totaled over two million pounds. The Northrop
Grumman facility in Redondo Beach emitted 2,800 pounds of
toxics into the air and transferred less than 9,000 pounds of
toxics.
Superfund Sites
Although the use of hazardous materials is carefully regulated
today, past activities have led to the contamination of several
sites in the City. Contamination has resulted from disposal of
hazardous materials, leaking underground storage tanks, and
various industrial practices. The Superfund Act is a Federal law
designed to protect the environment from risks created from
previous chemical disposal practices. Two “archive” sites in
Manhattan Beach have been identified as Superfund sites under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA). Archive status indicates that to the
best of the EPA’s knowledge, no immediate or long-term risk to
human health or the environment are associated with these sites,
and no further steps will be taken to list the sites on the National
Priority List (NPL). No further remedial action is planned for
these sites under the Superfund Program.
Leaking Underground Storage Tanks
Leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) are one of the
greatest environmental concerns of the past several decades.
The California Regional Water Quality Board, in cooperation with
the Office of Emergency Services, maintains an inventory of
LUST sites throughout the State. Some of these fuel leaks
resulted in substantial soil and groundwater contamination. As of
2001, over ten sites in Manhattan Beach had been identified as
sources of industrial solvent or metals contamination and were
targeted for clean–up. Half of the sites identified with fuel leaks
are from gasoline storage tanks for service stations. Most cases
are currently closed, meaning they pose no environmental risk
and clean-up actions have occurred. Some of the sites have
been cleaned and redeveloped. Since the problems of past
practices have largely been addressed, focus instead has been
turned toward avoiding future contamination.
                                                                              P A G E      C S - 15

                         Household Hazardous Waste
                         Hazardous waste is generated in homes and businesses alike. In
                         the home includes products such as used lead-acid (automotive)
                         batteries, pesticides, solvents, and paint thinners. Although most
                         hazardous waste is generated by larger industrial businesses,
                         wastes created by households and small businesses are of
                         particular concern since these wastes are more likely to be
                         handled inappropriately and discarded in a landfill or local sewer.
                         The City provides an annual hazardous waste collection program,
                         and residents are allowed to dispose of household hazardous
                         waste free of charge at the Community Hazardous Waste
                         Collection Facility in Redondo Beach.

Goals and Policies: Hazardous Materials
Release
Goal CS-2:     Protect residents from hazardous materials and
               the hazards associated with the transport of
               such materials.
Policy CS-2.1: Continue to encourage and support the enforcement
               of State and Federal environmental and pollution
               control laws.
Policy CS-2.2: Continue to support and encourage State and Federal
               efforts to identify existing or previously existing
               hazardous waste generators or disposal sites, and
               monitor disposal of all wastes and contamination of
               their sites.
Policy CS-2.3: Continue to monitor underground emissions and
               associated hazards in Manhattan Village and in other
               areas adjacent to industrial uses.
The Manhattan Village residential area was previously an oil field
that had large oil storage tanks. The area has a vapor recovery
system which captures and recovers dilute volatile organic
compounds and other hazardous air pollutants. Annual reports
are provided to Chevron and the Public Works Department.
Policy CS-2.4: Promote the routing of vehicles carrying potentially
               hazardous materials along transportation corridors
               that reduce public exposure to risk. Cooperate with
               regional agencies in developing such routing systems.

Emergency Preparedness
and Response Services
The provision of emergency preparedness and response services
is a major responsibility of the City. By establishing outstanding
police and fire departments that are active within the community,
the City provides residents and businesses a sense of comfort
and safety knowing that committed and qualified public safety
personnel will perform the tasks and duties to keep Manhattan
Beach safe.
Manhattan Beach is well prepared to respond to all types of
emergencies. The City’s emergency preparedness program
addresses appropriate responses to major earthquakes, flooding,
and hazardous materials accidents. The program describes how
emergency response will be coordinated and how evacuation of
residents will proceed.       Program objectives include injury
reduction and avoiding loss of life and property damage through
effective management of emergency personnel.
Fire Department
In 1923, the Lion Tamers Club organized the first volunteer fire
department for the City of Manhattan Beach, leasing a chemical
truck containing equipment for six men. Their first original home
was at Manhattan Hardware Store located at the intersection of
Manhattan Avenue and Center Street (Manhattan Beach
Boulevard). They were later given space in City Hall. In 1954,
the fire station at 1400 Manhattan Beach Boulevard was
constructed and labeled as Fire Station No. 2. In 1960, Fire
Station No. 1 at 400 15th Street was built, allowing staff and
equipment to move out of City Hall and into the new facility.
Fire Station No. 1, now over 40 years old, no longer meets the
current needs of the Fire Department and the City of Manhattan
Beach. A new facility, to begin construction in 2003 and
schedule for completion in 2005, will accommodate both the
Fire and Police Departments.
Manhattan Beach’s Fire Department daily suppression staffing
typically consists of eight Firefighters/Paramedics, plus one
Battalion Chief who operates out of two stations. Emergency
                                                                          P A G E      C S - 19

   Fire Station No. 2, located at
          1400 Manhattan Beach
   Boulevard, was built in 1954.
    Station No. 2 personnel can
  easily respond to emergencies
  on the eastern half of the City.
                                      response is handled by two engines (both are Paramedic
                                      engines), a Paramedic rescue ambulance, and the Battalion Chief.
                                      Fire Station 1 (headquarters) is located adjacent to City Hall at
                                      400 15th Street, and Fire Station 2 is located at 1400 Manhattan
                                      Beach Boulevard, east of Sepulveda Boulevard. The Department
                                      responds to emergency incidents within an average time of four
                                      minutes and thirty seconds. Emergency preparedness training is
                                      given to all City employees to prepare them to respond properly
                                      to the needs of the community in the event of a major
                                      emergency, including natural disasters, terrorism, and other
                                      catastrophic events. Fire Department personnel have provided
                                      City employees with the Standardized Emergency Management
                                      System (SEMS) training, a State-mandated program, which
                                      includes familiarization with the City’s Emergency Operations
                                      Center (EOC) and a comprehensive disaster simulation drill to
                                      instruct personnel in their responsibilities to the organization and
                                      community during a disaster. City staff is committed to servicing
                                      the needs of the community through emergency preparedness
                                      and will continue to enhance this service over time.
                                      The Fire Department has a new Community Emergency
                                      Response Team program (CERT) to provide education and
                                      training to the community to prepare them for major
                                      emergencies. The program focuses on how community residents
                                      can protect themselves, their family, and neighbors in an
                                      emergency or natural disaster.

Emergency shelters offer refuge for those seeking temporary
protection from a disaster or emergency. These shelters are
equipped to provide disaster relief.
The City has identified ten roadways to be used by the general
public as emergency evacuation routes:
         Sepulveda Boulevard
         Rosecrans Avenue
         Highland Avenue
         Valley Drive
         Ardmore Avenue
         Aviation Boulevard
         Artesia Boulevard
         2nd Street
         Manhattan Beach Boulevard
         Marine Avenue
Each identified roadway has the capacity to evacuate residents
out of the City or to designated emergency shelters. The City’s
grid-style roadway network creates additional alternate routes to
the roadways listed above.          However, Manhattan Beach
experiences traffic congestion during weekday peak travel hours
and summer weekends that may impede or delay evacuation.
                                                                              P A G E      C S - 21

                                   The mission of the M anhattan Beach Police Department is "to
                                   protect life,property and liberty while providing excellent service
                                   and developing problem-       solving partnerships within the
                                   community.   " Assuch,the M anhattan Beach Police Department
                                   is a highly valued positive force in the community,providing
                                   effective safety and emergency response services, but also
                                   engaging in community programs and educational activities.
                                   Volunteerism and community involvement continue to be the
                                   cornerstone of the M anhattan Beach Police Department. The
                                   Department isgenerally able to respond to high priority callsin
                                   under two and half minutes. The response time is within the
                                   Department’sresponse time goals.
          “Area” patrol officers
       enforce traffic laws and
           create a presence in
   neighborhoods where traffic
    problems occur frequently.

                                     Intrusion
                                     The clean, expansive beaches in Manhattan Beach attract visitors
                                     from far away to enjoy the splendid amenities of the Pacific
                                     Ocean, particularly during the summer. This attraction generates
                                     significant outside traffic and parking demands along the beach.
                                     While beneficial to the local economy, the beachgoers can
                                     impact residential neighborhoods by using local streets to avoid
                                     congested thoroughfares and parking in quiet residential areas.
                                     Manhattan Beach lies between major employment centers to the
                                     north and South Bay residential communities and Palos Verdes
                                     Peninsula to the south. As described above, through north-south
                                     traffic significantly impacts Sepulveda and Aviation Boulevards,
                                     which carry volumes over their design capacity during morning
                                     and evening commute hours. This effect is intensified whenever
                                     I-405 experiences substantial delays.
                                     When arterial and collector roadways become over-congested
                                     and vehicular movement is limited, motorists look for alternative
                                     routes to bypass the heavily congested streets.           Regular
                                     commuters use the alternative routes regularly. Manhattan
                                     Beach’s grid street pattern established in the early 1900s is
                                     conducive to cut-through traffic, which creates noise impacts and
                                     compromises pedestrian and vehicular safety in these
                                     neighborhoods. Local streets that intersect with congested
                                     arterials and collector streets experience the most cut-through
                                     problems.
  2nd Street is a popular street
   for motorist to cut through.
    The uses on 2nd Street are
        all residential. A slight
    grade change is conducive
   to higher vehicle speeds as
     motorists travel downhill.

Motorists also look to avoid major intersections where excessive
queuing occurs. Intersections along Sepulveda Boulevard in particular
are heavily congested during peak hours, and connecting streets
facilitate motorists cutting through to other north-south routes.
Neighborhood Traffic Issue Areas
Marine Avenue (residential section west of Sepulveda Boulevard) and
2nd Street have experienced significant traffic impacts, including
speeding, excessive volumes, truck traffic, and cut-through traffic during
the peak hours of the day. Traffic studies have been conducted to
determine the needed street measures that will help reduce traffic
impacts on both streets. Marine Avenue measures included stop signs,
increased enforcement, signage directing commuters to arterials, and
modification to the centerline. 2nd Street has also gone through
extensive street experimenting with street chokers and diverters aimed
at reducing cut-through traffic.
Residents are concerned about excessive speed and volume resulting
from Meadows Avenue being used as an alternative to Sepulveda
Boulevard. Complaints from residents originated from persons with
homes between Marine Avenue and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. The
intersection is posted to only allow right or left turns onto Marine
Avenue from Meadows Avenue, both directions; no through traffic is
allowed. Residents surrounding Sand Dune Park have voiced their
concern to the City about traffic volumes and lack of parking for park
users.
Local streets directly adjacent to schools experience traffic impacts as
well, such as cut-through traffic (vehicles and buses) and speeding, and
pick-up and drop-off trips during morning and mid-afternoon hours.
Parents shuttling children to school significantly increase traffic on local
streets that surround the schools. Student parking for Mira Costa High
School can encroach into surrounding residential areas, creating
significant impacts.
Other areas have been identified as having traffic issues and some of
these areas have been studied (see Figure 1-6). In many of these areas
where traffic issues have identified, the City continues to experiment
with options and has taken proactive measures to reduce impacts on
the surrounding residential neighborhood.
                                                                              P A G E   I - 27

                          Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
                          In response to continued residents’ concerns regarding traffic
                          impacts in neighborhoods, in 2002 the City instituted a
                          Neighborhood Traffic Management Program designed to identify
                          specific issues at a local neighborhood level, and to allow
                          residents to help define mitigation strategies appropriate to the
                          identified and documented problem. The overall objective of the
                          Neighborhood Traffic Management Program is to improve the
                          livability of neighborhoods by mitigating the impacts of vehicular

traffic in residential areas. Specific impacts addressed by the Program
include high non-local cut-through traffic volumes, excessive speeds,
truck traffic intrusion, demonstrated accident history, and related
problems.
The process will ensure that neighborhoods with demonstrated
problems and community support for traffic improvements have equal
access to neighborhood traffic management measures. The Program
depends upon resident involvement and may vary from year-to-year
based upon funding available for installation of neighborhood traffic
improvements. The process includes the following steps:
          Step 1 - Identify Candidate Streets/Neighborhoods
          Step 2 - Preliminary Screening and Evaluation
          Step 3 - Engineering Analysis/Preliminary
                   Recommendations
          Step 4 - Neighborhood Meetings and
                   Survey/Petitions
          Step 5 - Develop, Install, and Evaluate Test Projects
          Step 6 - Determination of Permanent Project
          Step 7 - Monitoring
Various traffic management measures can be placed within a
neighborhood street to help alleviate traffic; however, each control
measure can have an impact on or divert traffic to adjacent streets.
The Neighborhood Traffic Management Program requires extensive
evaluation, analysis, and monitoring to prevent additional traffic
problems elsewhere within a neighborhood.
Figure I-7 and Table I-1 present some of the different traffic
management measures that can be used to ease traffic issues on local
neighborhood streets. Efforts to apply Level 1 toolbox measures will be
made first where feasible, then proceeding to Level 2 and Level 3 only
when applicable Level 1 tools have been demonstrated as inadequate
to solve the problems.

                            Some traffic management measures can limit or affect access of
                            emergency vehicles. Specific measures can negatively impact response
                            time, such as diagonal diverter or half closure. Many of Manhattan
                            Beach’s roadways are very narrow; adding traffic measures can further
                            limit emergency vehicle access. Public Works, Fire, Traffic Engineering,
                            Community Development staff, and the Police Traffic Division review
                            traffic improvement related requests and make recommendations to
                            the to the Parking and Public Improvements Commission. The

                            recommendations and the City Council then takes action on the

                       Police Department Traffic Team
                       In addition to the physical improvement strategies offered by the
                       Neighborhood Traffic Management Program, the City will
                       continue to use the Police Department’s Traffic Team to patrol
                       the streets of Manhattan Beach, investigating and resolving
                       traffic-related concerns or complaints and enforcing traffic laws.
                       Traffic officers are assigned to neighborhood patrol areas and
                       solicit the support of the patrol officers, and to work as a team to
                       address issues within their assigned area. The intent of the
                       strategy is to have traffic officers become aware of and be more
                       responsive to community concerns.                 This program also
                       encourages officers to establish relationships with community
                       residents and businesses, creating a heightened awareness of the
                       people and activities in their assigned area. Contact with the
                       community provides familiarity and allows the officers to develop
                       a sense of ownership, thereby positively impacting traffic issues.
                       It also provides residents a means to express traffic issues within
                       their neighborhoods.
                       Goals and Policies: Preventing
                       Neighborhood Traffic Intrusion
                       Goal I-2:        Move commuter traffic through the City
                                        primarily on arterial streets, and on collector
                                        streets as appropriate, to protect other streets
                                        from the intrusion of commuter traffic.
                       Policy I-2.1:    Encourage the use of the Neighborhood Traffic
                                        Management Program and utilize neighborhood traffic
                                        management tools to mitigate neighborhood intrusion
                                        by commuter traffic.
                       Policy I-2.2:    Establish priorities and determine funding available for
                                        implementing the Neighborhood Traffic Management
                                        Program.
                       Levels 2 and 3 traffic measures can be considerable in costs.
                       With limited funding resources, planning and prioritizing the
                       implementation of traffic measures is important, and will be
                       established by the City Council.
                       Policy I-2.3:    Upgrade all major intersections and arterial streets to
                                        keep traffic moving efficiently.

Policy I-2.4:      Require additional traffic lanes and/or other traffic
                   improvements for ingress and egress for new
                   development along arterials where necessary for
                   traffic and safety reasons.
Policy I- 2.5:     Work with neighboring cities and regional and sub-
                   regional agencies to widen and upgrade all major
                   intersections and associated street segments within
                   the City and adjacent jurisdictions to optimize traffic
                   flow.
Manhattan Beach is working with the cities of El Segundo,
Hawthorne, and Redondo Beach to synchronize traffic signals
using real time information and develop traffic management plans
to combat congestion. Manhattan Beach consistently works with
the MTA, South Bay Cities Council of Governments, Caltrans,
employees associations, and neighboring jurisdictions on projects
such as the Sepulveda Boulevard widening, Aviation Boulevard
widening, Rosecrans Corridor Study and, the Douglas Street
extension. Public Works has a number of CIP projects in the City
that address subregional and regional traffic issues.
Policy I-2.6:   Encourage the use of Intelligent Transportation
                Systems (ITS), such as advanced signalization,
                motorist information, advanced transit, advanced
                emergency vehicle access, and intelligent parking
                systems,       as     well    as   other    appropriate
                communication technologies, to direct through
                traffic.
Intelligent Transportation Systems include the application of
advanced information processing (computers), communications,
technologies, and management strategies in an integrated manner
to improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of a transportation
system. As mentioned in Policy I-2.5, Manhattan Beach is working
with neighboring cities to coordinate traffic signals to move traffic
through cities faster.
Policy I- 2.7:  Monitor and minimize traffic issues associated with
                construction activities.
Construction activity can cause significant traffic congestion due to
the need to close lanes or streets, limiting vehicle capacity or
creating detours. More than one construction site on a street
simultaneously can pose serious traffic impacts on surrounding
streets.

                                    Parking
                                      Parking typically is considered a separate issue from vehicle
                                      circulation. However, the presence of on-street parking has a
                                      direct effect on roadway capacity, particularly in Manhattan
                                      Beach, where many streets are narrow. In addition, inadequate
                                      off-street parking can cause vehicles to re-circulate the streets in
                                      search of parking, increasing traffic volumes and congestion.
                                      For many years, lack of parking has been a key community
                                      concern, particularly near the beach and in the Downtown and
                                      North End commercial districts. Neighborhoods with older high-
                                      density housing also experience parking shortages, as the units
                                      were built before more stringent parking standards were in place.
                                      When beach parking facilities are full, beachgoers take up on-
                                      street parking spaces in residential areas adjacent to the beach,
                                      spaces that local residents use as well. Public parking often
                                      appears as the best solution to meeting broad-based community
                                      parking needs for residents and visitors. While the City owns
                                      many parking facilities and operates surface parking and
                                      structures along the Strand and near Parque Culiacan (Figure I-8),
                                      constructing new facilities involves significant cost, and few sites
                                      are available where parking is most needed. Figure I-8 identifies
                                      areas where parking is most deficient and where public and/or
                                      private shared facilities may be sited. Off-site shuttles are
                                      provided for large annual events Downtown and beach events
                                      such as the Old Hometown Fair and the AVP Volleyball
                                      tournament.
     This public parking lot, just
      south of Parque Culiacan,
    provides convenient parking
                 for beachgoers.

                       The City’s zoning ordinance includes parking requirements to
                       ensure that adequate parking spaces are provided as well as
                       minimum stall dimensions. These regulations will continue to
                       apply to all new development as well as existing uses with major
                       remodeling or expansion.
                       Parking Management
                       The City will also encourage parking management to promote
                       efficient use of private parking facilities. Parking management
                       can help address a wide range of transportation issues, including
                       spillover problems, parking demand, and parking facility
                       improvements. Example of parking management strategies
                       include:
                           Shared parking
                           Allow reduced parking requirements in exchange for TDM
                            Programs
                           Accurate assessment of parking demand
                           Valet parking program
                           Address parking spillover problems
                           Develop overflow parking plans
                           Regulate parking facilities for efficiency
                           Improve parking facility design
                       Parking for Residents
                       Residents should have reasonable access to parking near their
                       homes. Parking problems can inconvenience residents and
                       erode their perception of neighborhood livability. Part of the
                       problem stems from residents who cannot park near their homes
                       because of all-day parking by businesses, schools, and/or
                       beachgoers.
                       Residential neighborhoods, particularly along the beach and
                       North End/El Porto, experience severe on-street parking
                       deficiencies. Narrow streets and alleys, and driveways and
                       access to off-street parking limit the number of parking spaces
                       that can be placed on the street.

The residential neighborhoods adjacent to Mira Costa High
School also experience parking issues. Many students park their
automobiles in the surrounding residential neighborhoods during
school hours. Residential areas adjacent to Mira Costa High’s
athletic fields experience problems during weekends and
evenings when youth sporting activities occur.
Goals and Policies: Meeting Community
Parking Needs
Parking is a significant issue; the City is committed to finding
solutions to improve access to public parking.
Goal I-3:       Ensure that adequate parking and loading
                facilities are available to support both
                residential and commercial needs.
Policy I-3.1:   Review the existing Downtown Parking Management
                Program recommendations, re-evaluate parking and
                loading demands, and develop and implement a
                comprehensive program, including revised regulations
                as appropriate, to address parking issues.
Policy I-3.2:   Explore opportunities for creating peripheral parking
                lots to serve the Downtown and North End.
                                                                               P A G E   I - 37

                       The Metlox development, schedule for completion in 2003, will
                       provide 460 new public parking spaces within two levels of a
                       subterranean parking structure in the Downtown. The Public
                       Safety Facility, scheduled for completion in 2005, will also
                       increase public parking in the Downtown.
                       Policy I-3.3:    Periodically evaluate the adequacy of parking
                                        standards in light of vehicle ownership patterns and
                                        vehicle sizes in the City.
                       Policy I-3.4:    Review development proposals to ensure potential
                                        adverse parking impacts are minimized or avoided.
                       Policy I-3.5:    Encourage joint-use and off-site parking where
                                        appropriate.
                       Policy I-3.6:    Evaluate parking and loading demands in the North
                                        End, and develop and implement a comprehensive
                                        program to address these needs.
                       The North End Business Improvement District (BID) is conducting
                       a study to address parking and loading demands within this area.
                       Policy I-3.7:    Require private development to provide public on-
                                        street parking in the public right-of-way according to
                                        Public Works standards in certain areas of the City.
                       Ordinances 2039 and 2042 regulate construction within the
                       public street right-of-way. Ordinance 2039 contains updated
                       Encroachment Permit regulations pertaining to private use
                       construction within the public right of way. Ordinance 2042
                       contains standards for public use construction within the off-
                       roadway portion of the right of way in certain residential areas.
                       Policy I-3.8:    Monitor and minimize parking issues associated with
                                        construction activities.
                       The Manhattan Beach Police and Community Development
                       Departments track and adjust the number of contractor parking
                       permits issued to minimize parking impacts.                Parking of
                       construction dumpsters in the street right-of-way is generally not
                       allowed, as it also impacts street parking.

Policy I-3.9:   Work to retain on-street parking in the Beach Area,
                particularly on Highland Avenue.
Policy I-3.10   Continue to work with businesses and public agencies
                to coordinate parking strategies.
Goal I-4:     Protect residential neighborhoods from the
              adverse impacts of traffic and parking of adjacent
              non-residential uses.
Policy I-4.1:  Review on-street parking in neighborhoods adjacent to
               commercial areas where neighbors have requested
               such review, and develop parking and traffic control
               plans for those neighborhoods which are or which
               could potentially be adversely impacted by spillover
               parking and traffic.
Policy I-4.2:   Carefully review commercial development proposals
                with regard to planned ingress/egress, and enforce
                restrictions as approved.
Policy I-4.3:   Encourage provision of on-site parking for employees.
Policy I-4.4:   Ensure that required parking and loading spaces are
                available and maintained for parking.
Goal I-5:       Reduce the adverse parking and traffic impacts
                that schools create on surrounding residential
                neighborhoods.
Policy I-5.1:   Encourage the school district and private schools to
                provide busing or other alternative transportation
                modes to the schools as a means of reducing peak-
                hour traffic.
Policy I-5.2:   Work with the school district and private schools to
                improve pedestrian and bicycle safety around schools.
Policy I-5.3:   Coordinate after-school, weekend, and community
                activities on school grounds with consideration of
                potential traffic and parking impacts on
                neighborhoods.

Pedestrian and Bicycle
Networks
Manhattan Beach’s high residential density, walkstreets, small
lots, narrow streets, and lively street frontages in Downtown and
the North End all make it a very “walkable” City. Walking from
the residential neighborhoods down to the beach can be
accomplished easily and quickly. Lack of parking and traffic
congestion also make walking and biking desirable alternatives
for accessing the beach and activity centers.
Walking in Manhattan Beach
Walkability, access, and connections are necessary components
of a circulation system that easily and specifically accommodates
pedestrians. Walkability includes wide sidewalks, safe street
crossings, features that encourage cautious driving, and a
pleasant and safe walking environment. Walkways, mid-block
crossings, pathways, and pedestrian short-cuts allow people to
get from one destination to another with ease. Dedicated
pedestrian paths can provide safe access between residential,
beach, and retail areas. Pedestrian connections should be
provided primarily to and from intense commercial activity
centers such as Downtown, the North End, and transit stops, as
well as schools. Handicapped access strategies, which also
accommodate strollers and other “wheeled” transportation,
should be incorporated into all street and pathway plans.
                                                                    Walkstreets provide
                                                                    convenient and safe access
                                                                    to the beach for
                                                                    pedestrians.

                                   Walkstreets are unique pedestrian features in Manhattan Beach
                                   that provide safe, attractive paths to the beach and surrounding
                                   areas. Walkstreets are pedestrian-only streets perpendicular to
                                   the beach between the Strand and Alma Avenue in the North
                                   and Valley Drive in the south. Walkstreets generally front
                                   residential units with alleys providing vehicular access.
                                   Walkstreets also create visual corridors framing the ocean.
                                   Figure I-6 identifies the major pedestrian and bicycle networks in
                                   Manhattan Beach, including and complementary to the
                                   walkstreets.
                                   The Strand provides two miles of continual pedestrian access
                                   along the beach. Veterans Parkway, a pedestrian jogging and
                                   walking trail between Valley Drive and Ardmore Avenue,
                                   connects the City from Manhattan Village through Downtown
                                   and through Hermosa Beach. The trail was once the right-of-way
                                   for the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe railway.
                                   Accommodating Bicyclists
                                   With rain falling less than 30 days a year and moderate
                                   temperatures most of the year, the Southern California climate is
                                   perfect for bicycling. Cycling to work or school is a popular
                                   means of transportation for short distances. Allowing bicycles on
                                   buses or providing secure bicycle parking facilities can
                                   encourage bicycling for longer trips, provided safe routes are
                                   established.
                                   Cycling is a major recreational activity in Manhattan Beach.
                                   However, the only bicycle facility is a dedicated bicycle path
                                   along the Strand. This bicycle path is a two-mile segment of a
                                   larger system that links Marina Del Rey to Palos Verdes, covering
                                   a distance of approximately twelve miles (Figure I-9).
      The bike path along the
    Strand, separate from the
      pedestrian path, allows
      bicyclists to enjoy rides
              along the beach.
     Magnificent views of the
    Pacific Ocean can be seen
       all along the bike path.

                       The narrow and congested streets in Manhattan Beach make
                       adding bicycle lanes and routes difficult. Bike lanes are only
                       recommended on streets where the right-of-way is wide enough
                       to accommodate bike lanes and where on-street parking is
                       limited. Veterans Parkway and/or the adjacent streets of
                       Valley/Ardmore are possible locations for a bikeway, with
                       enough space to serve both bikes and pedestrians. Feasibility of
                       accommodating a bicycle path should be considered.
                       Providing a bicycle-to-transit link is a critical strategy to
                       encourage daily bicycle and transit use, potentially reducing air
                       pollution, energy consumption, and traffic congestion. Bicycle-
                       transit integration has four components:
                                Allowing bicycles on transit
                                Offering bicycle parking at transit locations

                                Encouraging usage of bicycle and transit programs
                       The Green Line Station on Douglas Street in El Segundo
                       accommodates bicyclists by providing bicycle parking and
                       lockers. Most MTA buses have bicycle racks on the front of
                       buses.

                                         networks that facilitate these modes of
                                         circulation.
                       Policy I-6.1:    Implement those components of the Downtown

                                    Parking
                                      Parking typically is considered a separate issue from vehicle
                                      circulation. However, the presence of on-street parking has a
                                      direct effect on roadway capacity, particularly in Manhattan
                                      Beach, where many streets are narrow. In addition, inadequate
                                      off-street parking can cause vehicles to re-circulate the streets in
                                      search of parking, increasing traffic volumes and congestion.
                                      For many years, lack of parking has been a key community
                                      concern, particularly near the beach and in the Downtown and
                                      North End commercial districts. Neighborhoods with older high-
                                      density housing also experience parking shortages, as the units
                                      were built before more stringent parking standards were in place.
                                      When beach parking facilities are full, beachgoers take up on-
                                      street parking spaces in residential areas adjacent to the beach,
                                      spaces that local residents use as well. Public parking often
                                      appears as the best solution to meeting broad-based community
                                      parking needs for residents and visitors. While the City owns
                                      many parking facilities and operates surface parking and
                                      structures along the Strand and near Parque Culiacan (Figure I-8),
                                      constructing new facilities involves significant cost, and few sites
                                      are available where parking is most needed. Figure I-8 identifies
                                      areas where parking is most deficient and where public and/or
                                      private shared facilities may be sited. Off-site shuttles are
                                      provided for large annual events Downtown and beach events
                                      such as the Old Hometown Fair and the AVP Volleyball
                                      tournament.
     This public parking lot, just
      south of Parque Culiacan,
    provides convenient parking
                 for beachgoers.

                       The City’s zoning ordinance includes parking requirements to
                       ensure that adequate parking spaces are provided as well as
                       minimum stall dimensions. These regulations will continue to
                       apply to all new development as well as existing uses with major
                       remodeling or expansion.
                       Parking Management
                       The City will also encourage parking management to promote
                       efficient use of private parking facilities. Parking management
                       can help address a wide range of transportation issues, including
                       spillover problems, parking demand, and parking facility
                       improvements. Example of parking management strategies
                       include:
                           Shared parking
                           Allow reduced parking requirements in exchange for TDM
                            Programs
                           Accurate assessment of parking demand
                           Valet parking program
                           Address parking spillover problems
                           Develop overflow parking plans
                           Regulate parking facilities for efficiency
                           Improve parking facility design
                       Parking for Residents
                       Residents should have reasonable access to parking near their
                       homes. Parking problems can inconvenience residents and
                       erode their perception of neighborhood livability. Part of the
                       problem stems from residents who cannot park near their homes
                       because of all-day parking by businesses, schools, and/or
                       beachgoers.
                       Residential neighborhoods, particularly along the beach and
                       North End/El Porto, experience severe on-street parking
                       deficiencies. Narrow streets and alleys, and driveways and
                       access to off-street parking limit the number of parking spaces
                       that can be placed on the street.

The residential neighborhoods adjacent to Mira Costa High
School also experience parking issues. Many students park their
automobiles in the surrounding residential neighborhoods during
school hours. Residential areas adjacent to Mira Costa High’s
athletic fields experience problems during weekends and
evenings when youth sporting activities occur.
Goals and Policies: Meeting Community
Parking Needs
Parking is a significant issue; the City is committed to finding
solutions to improve access to public parking.
Goal I-3:       Ensure that adequate parking and loading
                facilities are available to support both
                residential and commercial needs.
Policy I-3.1:   Review the existing Downtown Parking Management
                Program recommendations, re-evaluate parking and
                loading demands, and develop and implement a
                comprehensive program, including revised regulations
                as appropriate, to address parking issues.
Policy I-3.2:   Explore opportunities for creating peripheral parking
                lots to serve the Downtown and North End.
                                                                               P A G E   I - 37

Pedestrian and Bicycle
Networks
Manhattan Beach’s high residential density, walkstreets, small
lots, narrow streets, and lively street frontages in Downtown and
the North End all make it a very “walkable” City. Walking from
the residential neighborhoods down to the beach can be
accomplished easily and quickly. Lack of parking and traffic
congestion also make walking and biking desirable alternatives
for accessing the beach and activity centers.
Walking in Manhattan Beach
Walkability, access, and connections are necessary components
of a circulation system that easily and specifically accommodates
pedestrians. Walkability includes wide sidewalks, safe street
crossings, features that encourage cautious driving, and a
pleasant and safe walking environment. Walkways, mid-block
crossings, pathways, and pedestrian short-cuts allow people to
get from one destination to another with ease. Dedicated
pedestrian paths can provide safe access between residential,
beach, and retail areas. Pedestrian connections should be
provided primarily to and from intense commercial activity
centers such as Downtown, the North End, and transit stops, as
well as schools. Handicapped access strategies, which also
accommodate strollers and other “wheeled” transportation,
should be incorporated into all street and pathway plans.
                                                                    Walkstreets provide
                                                                    convenient and safe access
                                                                    to the beach for
                                                                    pedestrians.

                                   Walkstreets are unique pedestrian features in Manhattan Beach
                                   that provide safe, attractive paths to the beach and surrounding
                                   areas. Walkstreets are pedestrian-only streets perpendicular to
                                   the beach between the Strand and Alma Avenue in the North
                                   and Valley Drive in the south. Walkstreets generally front
                                   residential units with alleys providing vehicular access.
                                   Walkstreets also create visual corridors framing the ocean.
                                   Figure I-6 identifies the major pedestrian and bicycle networks in
                                   Manhattan Beach, including and complementary to the
                                   walkstreets.
                                   The Strand provides two miles of continual pedestrian access
                                   along the beach. Veterans Parkway, a pedestrian jogging and
                                   walking trail between Valley Drive and Ardmore Avenue,
                                   connects the City from Manhattan Village through Downtown
                                   and through Hermosa Beach. The trail was once the right-of-way
                                   for the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe railway.
                                   Accommodating Bicyclists
                                   With rain falling less than 30 days a year and moderate
                                   temperatures most of the year, the Southern California climate is
                                   perfect for bicycling. Cycling to work or school is a popular
                                   means of transportation for short distances. Allowing bicycles on
                                   buses or providing secure bicycle parking facilities can
                                   encourage bicycling for longer trips, provided safe routes are
                                   established.
                                   Cycling is a major recreational activity in Manhattan Beach.
                                   However, the only bicycle facility is a dedicated bicycle path
                                   along the Strand. This bicycle path is a two-mile segment of a
                                   larger system that links Marina Del Rey to Palos Verdes, covering
                                   a distance of approximately twelve miles (Figure I-9).
      The bike path along the
    Strand, separate from the
      pedestrian path, allows
      bicyclists to enjoy rides
              along the beach.
     Magnificent views of the
    Pacific Ocean can be seen
       all along the bike path.

                       The narrow and congested streets in Manhattan Beach make
                       adding bicycle lanes and routes difficult. Bike lanes are only
                       recommended on streets where the right-of-way is wide enough
                       to accommodate bike lanes and where on-street parking is
                       limited. Veterans Parkway and/or the adjacent streets of
                       Valley/Ardmore are possible locations for a bikeway, with
                       enough space to serve both bikes and pedestrians. Feasibility of
                       accommodating a bicycle path should be considered.
                       Providing a bicycle-to-transit link is a critical strategy to
                       encourage daily bicycle and transit use, potentially reducing air
                       pollution, energy consumption, and traffic congestion. Bicycle-
                       transit integration has four components:

                                Encouraging usage of bicycle and transit programs
                       The Green Line Station on Douglas Street in El Segundo
                       accommodates bicyclists by providing bicycle parking and
                       lockers. Most MTA buses have bicycle racks on the front of
                       buses.

                                      The City’s water, sewer, and storm drain systems support
                                      development in Manhattan Beach. These systems must be
                                      maintained in good condition to ensure that residents and
                                      businesses can reliably turn on a tap, run the washing machine,
                                      or serve customers food and beverages. As infrastructure ages,
                                      isolated failures represent a real potential. To preserve high
                                      service levels, water and sewer lines will need to be maintained,
                                      replaced, and/or expanded to maximize efficiency and increase
                                      capacity. For new development, the infrastructure must be able
                                      to support additional needs and demands without burdening
                                      current users.
                                      The City maintains the local water distribution, sewage collection,

                                      In the early 1900s, prior to provision of a coordinated water
                                      system, water wells and tanks served the needs of the growing
                                      population. Water tanks were perched at the highest points on
                                      sand dunes and used gravity to deliver water to the relatively low
                                      number of households at the time. The first water well was
                                      located near 10th Street and Highland Avenue. Another well and

                                      service forced many residents to retrieve water by carrying it
                                      back in buckets for household use. Water was eventually
                                      provided by the Hermosa Beach Land and Water Company,
                                      costing $10 per year per resident. After the City’s incorporation
                                      in 1912, bonds were issued to establish the first municipal water
                                      plant and system consisting of 23 miles of pipeline. This system
                                      was not extensive enough to benefit everyone within Manhattan

Providing the Community with Water
Manhattan Beach obtains water from three sources: (1)
                                                                     See Com m unityResource
Metropolitan Water District (MWD) treated surface water from         Element for a detailed
Northern California and the Colorado River, which is provided to     description on water
the City by the West Basin Municipal Water District and              conservation.
represents over eighty percent of the local water supply; (2)
groundwater extracted by City-owned and operated wells; and
(3) reclaimed water supplied for landscape irrigation from the
West Basin Municipal Water District. Manhattan Beach owns
the right to pump 3.8 million gallons per year of groundwater
from the West Coast Basin. Imported water flows to Manhattan
Beach via 45-inch MWD line in Manhattan Beach Boulevard.
                             Water Facilities
                             The City’s water system consists of      The elevated water tank
                             pump stations, storage reservoirs, an    located at Rowell Avenue
                             elevated storage tank, water supply      and 6th Street wasbuilt in
                             wells,    a   settling    basin,   and   the late 1940s.
                             approximately       112     miles   of
                             distribution pipelines (Figure I-9).
                             Given that Land Use Policy (Figure
                             LU-3) accommodates a very modest
                             level of growth in the City, these
                             facilities will not require any
                             substantial expansion to meet long-
                             term needs. The City’s efforts will
focus on maintenance and replacement as needed. Pursuant to
the Water System Master Plan, the City replaced the deteriorating
roof of the Peck Reservoir in 2000,which should extend the
reservoir’slife by about 25 years.

                      In addition to these facilities, the City provides access to
                      reclaimed water supplies via a maj          or pipeline in Marine Avenue.
                      Reclaimed water can be used for landscape irrigation and some
                      industrial uses, and can reduce demand on potable water
                      supplies.

                      Policy I-7.1:      Periodically evaluate the entire water supply and
                                         distribution system to ensure its continued adequacy,

                      Policy I-7.2:      Ensure that all new development or expansion of

                                         water service to meet the increased demand which it
                                         generates.
                      Policy I-7.3       Support the exploration of the feasibility of

                      Desalination has long been prohibitively expensive as a source of

supply, and new technology that makes it cheaper to take the salt out
of seawater are changing the economics of desalination. The W est
Basin Municipal W ater District, along with a conglomerate of other
water agencies, continues to pursue funding from Metropolitan W ater
District for a possible desalination plant in the South Bay.
Sewage Collection and Treatment
Early in Manhattan Beach’s history, sewage was disposed of into
cesspools located at the end of each street before connecting to a
trunk line to the Hyperion Sewage Plant in El Segundo. The City’s
wastewater system was constructed between 1925 and 1994, with
almost 85 percent of the system built prior to 1954. A major post-war
project in the late 1940s was a new sewer system and sewer pumping
station under the Strand and 27th Street, which allowed sewage
collection in the western portion of the City to join with the County
Sanitation District #5 system in the east portion of the City.
Today the City owns, operates, and maintains the local wastewater
collection and pumping system (Figure I-7). Collected effluent is
treated at the Joint W ater Pollution Control Plant in Carson, operated
by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County. The sewer main to
Carson tunnels under Sand Dune Park and connects the east and west
portion of the City. The collection system appears to serve the City
adequately. The City has undertaken a complete inspection of the
entire system via videotaping, and priorities for line replacement have
been established to ensure long-term reliability.
New development in Manhattan Beach will consist of the recycling of
established uses, as older homes and businesses are torn down and
replaced with new. In the case of single-family residences, the trend
toward larger homes is expected to continue. Larger homes with more
plumbing fixtures have the potential to increase sewage generation,
although on balance, newer plumbing can be more efficient. Given
the capacity and age of sewer lines, the City will develop a
comprehensive strategy to address:(1)minimizing new demands on
the sewer system, and (2)replacing and upgrading facilities in critical
need of such.

                                   Policy I-8.2:   Ensure that all new development or expansion of
                                                   existing facilities bears the cost of expanding the
                                                   sewage disposal system to handle the increased load,

                                   Storm Drains
                                   Stormwater is rainwater plus anything the rain carries along with
                                   it. In urban areas, rain that falls onto roofs or collects on paved
                                   areas is carried away through a system of gutters, pipes, and
                                   culverts. Stormwater runoff flows directly into the City'    s storm
                                   drain system via street gutters and other inlets, and this flow in
                                   turn discharges into the County flood control network, which
                                   ultimately drains into the Pacific Ocean. The Los Angeles County
                                   Department of Public Works (LACDPW) maintains the regional
                                   storm drain system, including two major pump plants (Polliwog
                                   Pond and Johnson Street) in the City.
                                   From a planning standpoint, the two important considerations to
                                   focus on regarding storm drains are: 1) ensuring adequate

                                   as part of regional efforts to improve water quality in surface
                                   waters. Flooding problems in the Sand Dune Park area have
                                   been addressed by the installation of an underground storage
                                   system to accommodate a 50-year storm.
                                   With regard to capacity, the established system is adequate to
                                   handle most runoff. However, during unusually heavy storm
                                   events, the system can become overwhelmed, with flooding
                                   occurring in the areas shown in Figure CS-3 in the Safety
                                   Element. The City has assessed the cost to correct isolated

deficiencies, with the determination that significant investment
will be required to address the issue. The main deficiency occurs
in the County-owned trunk line that collects flow from more than
50 percent of the City and empties at the beach at 28th Street.
Rough estimates indicate that at least $20 million would be
needed to add necessary capacity to eliminate flooding in certain
areas.
Stormwater Pollutants
When it rains, trash, litter, silt, automotive chemicals (oils and
grease, antifreeze, and fine dust from tire wear), animal wastes,
and many other contaminants are washed into the storm drain
system. In addition, storm drains carry dry weather water flows
resulting from excess irrigation and other discharges. Historically,
storm drains have been designed with no filters or cleaning
systems. Consequently, the storm drains deliver polluted urban
runoff directly into local flood control channels and the ocean.
Many of the pollutants found in this runoff are toxic to fish,
marine mammals, and other aquatic life.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge
of any pollutant to navigable waters from a point source unless
the discharge is authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit. In 1987, the passage of the
Water Q uality Act established NPDES permit requirements for
discharges of storm water. The NPDES permit program controls
water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States. Since the 1990s,
operators of stormwater systems such as Los Angeles County
have been required to develop a stormwater management
program to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed away
by stormwater runoff and discharged into local water bodies.
Manhattan Beach participates in the NPDES permit program via
a partnership consisting of the County, all cities within the
County, and the County Flood Control District.
                                                                            P A G E   I - 53

                       Polliwog Park contains storm drainage facilities to help reduce
                       pollutants entering the storm drain system. After it rains, water
                       from the surrounding area flows into the park where it is held
                       before being pumped into the storm drain system. One of the
                       benefits of holding the water in the park is that some of the water
                       is absorbed into the ground, recharging the groundwater basin.
                       The Municipal Golf Course also acts as a stormwater retention
                       basin for 200 acres east of Sepulveda Boulevard and north of
                       Marine Avenue. Pursuant to Los Angeles County NPDES permit
                       requirements, new construction projects are implementing
                       similar measures to remove pollutants from runoff.
                       The City has also installed several storm water filtration devices
                       called continuous deflective separation (CDS) units at strategic
                       locations throughout the City, such as the CDS unit and low-flow
                       diverter installed under the parking lot at the Pier in 2002. The
                       CDS units are designed to capture and retain sediments,
                       floatable and settleable trash, and debris before the runoff enters
                       the ocean. The units use a combination of a uniquely balanced
                       hydraulic design, the deflective characteristics of fine perforated
                       screens, and the natural energy in the flowing water to effect
                       separation of solid particles. Stormwater passes through the CDS
                       system and returns to the storm drain system, while debris and
                       coarse sediments are retained and settled into a sump where
                       they can be collected and hauled away.
                       Goals and Policies: Storm Drains
                       Goal I-9:        Maintain a storm drainage system that
                                        adequately protects the health and safety and
                                        property of Manhattan Beach residents.
                       Policy I-9.1:    Evaluate the size and condition of the storm drainage
                                        system periodically to ensure its ability to handle
                                        expected storm runoff.
                       Policy I-9.2:    Evaluate the impact of all new development and
                                        expansion of existing facilities on storm runoff, and
                                        ensure that the cost of upgrading existing drainage
                                        facilities to handle the additional runoff is paid for by
                                        the development which generates it.
                       Policy I-9.3:    Support the use of storm water runoff control
                                        measures that are effective and economically
                                        feasible.

                       Energy and
                       Communications
                       Just like traditional infrastructure such as roads, energy and
                       communications infrastructure provide a vital framework for the
                       community.       Electric power and gas utilities have shaped
                       Manhattan Beach’s current urban form.            Communications
                       infrastructure links the community with the nation and the world.
                       Expanding access and capabilities of technology assists
                       Manhattan Beach in meeting its goals of livability, economic
                       growth, and provision of high-quality services to residents and
                       businesses.
                       The first street lighting at Center Street (Manhattan Beach
                       Boulevard) and the Strand used acetylene lamps and were later
                       replaced with electric lights with current supplied by the Pacific
                       Electric Railway. Later, Southern California Edison (SCE) formed
                       and took over lighting for Manhattan Beach and surrounding
                       communities. In 1918, the Strand ornamental lights were placed
                       between 1st Street and 37th Street.
                       The Gas Lamp area, a unique residential area, uses old-fashioned
                       gas lamps for street lights. Residents pay an assessment and the
                       Gas Company maintains the lamps.
                       Utility Undergrounding
                       The presence of overhead utility poles and wires can be a visual
                       blight on the surrounding neighborhood, as well as a safety
                       concern to some residents. Undergrounding of electric power
                       and communications lines can remove unsightly poles and wires
                       from what is otherwise a very aesthetically pleasing street or
                       neighborhood. Many residents agree that transferring overhead
                       utilities to underground locations would increase the value of
                       individual properties while improving overall community
                       appearance. Other residents have expressed concerns about the
                       safety of overhead power lines.

The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) outlines funding to
remove the high voltage power poles on Rosecrans Avenue to
improve the corridor visually.          The City is pursuing
implementation, with SCE, on a number of undergrounding
projects in residential areas. The projects will be financed
through assessment districts.
Communications
The last decade of the twentieth century brought significant
changes to the communications industry, and technologies
continue to evolve rapidly. Manhattan Beach can work to
harness new technology and telecommunications systems by
anticipating and accommodating high-speed, high-capacity digital
and other emerging communication systems that benefit
residents and the business community.
Section 10.60.130 of the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code
identifies procedures and regulations for processing wireless
service facility applications in all non-residential areas and to
create consistency between federal legislation and local
ordinances regarding amateur radio and satellite dish antennas.

                                   Throwing away a pizza box at home or a shipping box at the
                                   office adds to a waste stream with one final destination: the
                                   landfill. Although one or two boxes may seem insignificant,
                                   imagine a region with over ten million people and thousands of
                                   businesses constantly throwing away recyclable materials. Many
                                   landfills in the Southern California region are quickly reaching
                                   capacity, with new locations sought in the desert and beyond.
                                   Manhattan Beach residents and business owners alone disposed
                                   of 38,405 tons of waste into local landfills in 1999 (Table I-3).
                                   Land is a valuable resource in Southern California. Recycling of
                                   solid waste and diverting recyclable materials from landfills helps
        The City provides both     reduce the environmental costs associated with expanding and
           waste and recycling     siting new landfills. Manhattan Beach residents and businesses
    receptacles throughout the     can contribute significantly by simply recycling as much as
                          City.

                                   How much more waste can be deposited into landfills in the
                                   future? Limitation of landfill space can significantly increase
                                   disposal costs.
                                   Solid Waste History in Manhattan Beach
                                   In the early 1900s, trash was simply thrown into a hole dug by
                                   residents near their property. For longer stays, a larger hole was
                                   dug. By 1921, the City purchased a truck to pick up trash each
                                   morning for a few hours, while the truck was used for other City
                                   duties during the remainder of the day. Trash was typically
                                   dumped in a ravine that is now Live Oak Park (formerly Poison
                                   OakPark). In the 1940s, the City’s first dump was built as part of
                                   a W ork Progress Administration project. Today, Manhattan
                                   Beach contracts for refuse and recycling services with a private
                                   waste hauler. Contracted haulers provide exclusive service to
                                   residential and commercial customers for solid waste, recycling,
                                   and co-mingled green waste.
                                   Recycling Today
                                   In 2000, the City and its residents achieved a diversion rate of 36
                                   percent, meaning that 36 percent of the paper, glass, metal, and
                                   plastic to be thrown away was instead diverted to a recycling
                                   facility. Curbside recycling in the residential areas has been
                                   facilitated with color-coded bins.             Additional diversion

has been achieved through the community’s source reduction,
composting, and green waste programs, and business recycling
practices. The City provides low-cost bins and instruction
courses for composting. Additional efforts are planned for
encouraging the recycling of special waste streams such as
construction and demolition debris and asphalt to meet State-
mandated recycling and diversion goals.
Construction and demolition debris disposal exceeds the disposal
of residential trash. A high percentage of construction and
demolition materials are recyclable, including concrete, asphalt,
wood, and metal. The City places a high priority on developing
regulations and guidelines to apply to construction projects that
will maximize the recycling and reuse of construction and
demolition materials.
                                                                                   Trash and recyclables are

                                        industrial, institutional, and the construction industry.
                       Policy I-12.2:   Continue to provide and improve recycling programs
                                        to commercial establishments in the City.
                       Policy I-12.3:   Encourage the maximum diversion of construction and
                                        demolition materials.
                       Policy I-12.4:   Require trash haulers to track the amount of recycling
                                        in accordance with City standards.
                       Tracking the amount of recyclable material diverted from a
                       landfill is important for meeting State-mandated goals. Ensuring
                       that trash haulers accurately calculate the amount of recyclable
                       material diverted from the waste stream can avoid miscounting.

                       Circulation
                       Circulation refers to all travel modes and routes people use to
                       move within and beyond Manhattan Beach: the local street
                       system, via biking or walking, or using of public transit. Moving
                       people and goods within the City efficiently and effectively
                       allows the community to function well economically and socially.
                       People should be able to circulate from home to school, work, or
                       shopping with ease and safety. Alternatives to the private car –
                       transit, biking, and walking – can offer choice and convenience.
                       Goods must also be easily transported locally and regionally to
                       foster a viable economy. Truck routes are essential to direct
                       trucks off local streets to regional roadways to lessen the impacts
                       of noise and vibrations in residential neighborhoods.
                       When considering circulation, we think of both the physical
                       infrastructure systems – the roadways, rails, and trails – as well as
                       the method of getting around, by car, bus, or bike, or on foot. In
                       Manhattan Beach, the physical system includes the local street
                       network, the wonderfully unique walkstreets, Veterans Parkway,
                       and several streets of regional significance:Sepulveda Boulevard,
                       Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, Aviation
                       Boulevard, and Artesia Boulevard. While these roadways afford
                       residents with ready access to surrounding destinations,
                       providing distant connections and linkages, these roads also
                       bring significant regional traffic volumes to and through the City.
                       Much of the traffic traveling along Sepulveda Boulevard during
                       peak periods simply passes through Manhattan Beach to other
                       Los Angeles County areas.
                       The most pressing mobility concern in Manhattan Beach is traffic
                       congestion. In a year 2002 community survey, when asked to
                       define the most significant issue in Manhattan Beach other than
                       traffic and parking, residents overwhelming responded “traffic
                       and parking.” Congestion can cost businesses money, and
                       people lose time and gain frustration due to traffic. Manhattan
                       Beach’s arterial and collector streets carry significant traffic loads
                       that overflow onto adj      oining neighborhood streets, causing
                       noise, traffic, and safety impacts during peak periods of the day.
                       Demand for parking adj       acent to the beach and commercial
                       districts can also create undesirable traffic and parking impacts
                       within adj oining residential neighborhoods.
                       This Circulation section guides the continued development and
                       enhancement of the circulation system to meet local mobility

and neighborhood protection objectives, and to respond to
anticipated regional traffic growth. The South Bay area will
continue to grow even if Manhattan Beach experiences little or
no population increase. Regional growth will increase use of
local and regional roadways, and the plan and policies here
identify strategies the City will pursue to maintain good operating
conditions to the maximum extent possible.            Because local
circulation is linked with the regional system, policies in this
Element highlight Manhattan Beach’s continued need to
participate in regional programs to alleviate traffic congestion
through capacity enhancements and trip reduction. Reduced
dependency on the automobile also works toward these goals
and improves environmental quality.
Transportation History in Manhattan Beach
The first railroad tracks were laid down in 1888 through the
undeveloped, sandy landscape of Manhattan Beach with the
introduction of the Santa Fe Railroad connecting Los Angeles to
Redondo Beach Wharf. This line included both freight and
passenger services. Santa Fe eventually terminated passenger
service in 1918 because it could not compete with the Pacific
Electric Red Car passenger rates. The tracks were removed 98
years later in 1986 and replaced by Veterans Parkway.
The Electric Trolley, built by Los Angeles Pacific in 1903, had five
stops in Manhattan Beach and connected Hill Street Station in
Downtown Los Angeles to Redondo Beach. The tracks were laid
just west of The Strand where the bicycle path is today. Los
Angeles Pacific later merged with Pacific Electric Red Car in
1910. A Red Car depot was built in 1914 on Marine Avenue.             Rosecrans Avenue, looking west
                                                                      from Pacific Avenue, circa 1940.
The main selling point of this line was the view of the ocean from
                                                                      The Eucalyptus trees were
the passenger train cars. The Red Cars would run on this line
                                                                      removed in 1969 when Standard
until May 12, 1940.                                                   Oil Company(Chevron)agreed to
                                                                      widen the roadway.
Starting in the 1920s, the Santa Fe railroad tracks were used to
carry clay and other supplies to the Metlox Manufacturing Plant
at Center Street (Manhattan Beach Boulevard) and Railroad
Drive (Valley Drive).
With a transportation system in place, development and new
roadway system soon followed. Most of the early buildings were
beach cottages built along the beach west of the Santa Fe
Railroad tracks. Manhattan Beach was advertised as a summer
vacation resort.
Manhattan Beach’s current street system was then taking shape
as land was subdivided into smaller lots that eventually were
sold. The streets of Manhattan Beach evolved from paths to
                                                                                    P A G E       I - 3

                       wooden planks, to dirt roads, to oil or macadam coating, to
                       asphalt, and to concrete paving. Street paving directly followed
                       land development. Eucalyptus-lined roadways were developed in
                       the City, including Center Street (Manhattan Beach Boulevard),
                       Rosecrans Avenue, and other minor roadways.
                       The period from 1914 to 1916 saw much activity with
                       transportation projects. The Strand project (from 1st Street to 37th
                       Street), including lighting and other citywide sidewalk projects,
                       was completed in 1914. Marine Avenue and Highview Avenue
                       were paved, Manhattan Avenue widened, and Highland Avenue
                       paved from the southern boundary of the City to its terminus just
                       north of Marine Avenue. Ocean Boulevard was a coastal
                       “country road” connecting Manhattan Beach to Venice and
                       other coastal cities to the north.
                       Since Railroad Drive (Valley Drive/Ardmore Avenue) lacked
                       connections between Marine Avenue and Palm Avenue, and 15th
                       Street and 10th Street, until 1967 the east-west connections from
                       Manhattan Beach to the region were Manhattan Beach
                       Boulevard and Marine Avenue.
                       A map of the City from 1923 shows that west of Sepulveda
                       Boulevard, the development and street patterns were well
                       established and similar to what we see today. About half of the
                       land east of Sepulveda Boulevard had been subdivided for
                       residential development, with the major streets laid out.
                       The paving of Sepulveda Boulevard (formerly Camino Real) was
                       completed in April of 1931, marking a milestone in Manhattan
                       Beach’s roadway system.            In 1934, Sepulveda Boulevard
                       connected into the City of El Segundo, replacing a previous
                       detour used during construction.
                       In the 1950s post-war era, as new home construction boomed,
                       major road construction projects (widening, grading, curbs, and
                       resurfacing) occurred throughout the City. In 1957, Interstate
                       405 (San Diego Freeway) was completed, providing regional
                       freeway access for the South Bay. The I-105 was completed in
                       1993, with access via Highland Avenue. MTA’s Metro Green
                       Line opened in 1995, with a station located at Douglas Street
                       (Douglas/Rosecrans Station) in El Segundo, making available rail
                       transit to Manhattan Beach residents once again 55 years later.

Master Plan of Roadways
Manhattan Beach’s roadway system is based on a conventional
hierarchy of streets. The top of the hierarchy consists of arterial
streets that carry large volumes of traffic, with the bottom
consisting of low-volume local streets that provide access to
abutting properties. Definitions of the roadway classifications are
presented below, and Figure I-1 identifies roadways utilizing
these classifications. Although a street may be classified in a
certain way, it does not necessary mean that it must be improved
accordingly. The classification is more about how a street
functions rather than the physical dimensions.
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has
authority over the State highway system and must be involved in
and approve the planning and design of improvements for State
highway facilities. The only State highway facility in Manhattan
Beach is Sepulveda Boulevard (State Route 1).               Artesia
Boulevard, previously State Route 91, was relinquished to the
City in 2002.
Regional Arterial – Sepulveda Boulevard (State Route 1) is the
only Regional Arterial in Manhattan Beach. Regional Arterials are
State-designated facilities that are relatively high-speed, high-
capacity routes serving intercity and interregional circulation
needs.
Regional Arterials also connect major City streets with other
regional routes. Local access is intended to be limited to major
streets via signal-controlled intersections, although given that
Sepulveda Boulevard functions as a major business district,
access has been granted to retail business and shopping centers
along Sepulveda Boulevard. Left turns should be prohibited or
restricted to signalized intersections where feasible. Curbside
parking is either prohibited all day or during the peak hours to
facilitate the movement of traffic.
M ajor Arterial - Major Arterials provide for through movement
between areas of Manhattan Beach and across the City, and to
provide access to Minor Arterials and limited access to Collector
streets. Access to abutting land uses should be limited where
possible, or consolidated to minimize curb cuts to avoid
interference with the through-traffic function of these routes.
Major Arterials generally provide four to six lanes for through
travel within a 60- to 100-foot right-of-way, depending on local
land use conditions. Major Arterials have single or double left-
turn lanes at intersections, left-turn signal phases where
necessary, and other enhancements to help the efficient
movement of larger volumes of traffic. Curbside parking may be
                                                                            P A G E   I - 5

                       prohibited all day or during the peak hours to facilitate the most
                       efficient movement of through traffic. Major Arterials include
                       Artesia Boulevard, Aviation Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, and
                       Manhattan Beach Boulevard, east of Sepulveda Boulevard.
                       Minor Arterial – Minor Arterials are similar to Major Arterials in
                       function, providing some through movements and movements
                       across the City. In contrast to Major Arterials, Minor Arterials
                       allow additional access to abutting land uses. While they
                       function similarly to Major Arterials and have similar right-of-way
                       width (generally 70 to 90 feet), they generally have lower
                       capacities and may have lower speeds. Curbside parking is
                       generally allowed, although it may be prohibited in selected
                       locations to facilitate traffic movement. Minor Arterials typically
                       provide four lanes for through traffic. Intersections generally
                       have left-turn lanes (or dual left-turn lanes in selected locations).
                       Minor Arterials include Marine Avenue east of Sepulveda
                       Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard west of Sepulveda
                       Boulevard to Ardmore Avenue.
                       Collector Street – Collector Streets serve an area or
                       neighborhood, and they function as collectors or distributors of
                       traffic from the local and major local streets to the Minor or
                       Major Arterial or Regional Arterial streets. Collector Streets are
                       lower speed streets with lower capacity than Arterials, but carry
                       more traffic than either Local or Major Local streets. Collector
                       streets have a mixture of single-family residential, multi-family
                       residential, and some commercial land uses. Some of the
                       adjacent land uses may have direct driveway access, while some
                       may have side yards on the collector street. Collector streets
                       often have curbside parking and one or two through lanes in
                       each direction.
                       Residential Collector – Residential Collector Streets are similar
                       to Collector streets in function; however, they primarily have
                       residential land uses adjacent to them, with very limited
                       commercial traffic (usually near selected intersections).
                       Residential Collectors are intended to serve an area or
                       neighborhood by collecting or distributing traffic from the Local
                       and Major Local streets to the Collector, Minor Arterial, Major
                       Arterial, or Regional Arterial system.         Although similar in
                       character to Collector Streets, Residential Collectors should carry
                       a lower volume of traffic than Collectors, reflecting their
                       residential character. Curbside parking is generally allowed, and
                       adjacent land uses often have direct driveway access. Residential
                       Collectors generally have one lane in each direction.
                       Major Local – Major Local streets provide for circulation within
                       and between residential neighborhoods. Major Local streets are
                       designed to discourage longer distance through trips and higher

speeds (posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour or slower).
Major Local streets generally have a maximum of one lane in
each direction, and curbside parking is generally allowed where
the street width is sufficient to support both moving traffic and
parking lanes.
Local – Local streets are the lowest functional classification and
are intended solely for access to adjacent residential land uses.
They provide for circulation within a residential neighborhood,
including bicycle and pedestrian access. Any through traffic,
including through traffic from one residential neighborhood to
another, is discouraged. Local streets have one lane in each
direction and have posted speed limits of 25 miles per hour or
slower. Curbside parking is generally allowed where the street
width is sufficient to support both moving traffic and parking
lanes.
W alkstreets – Walkstreets are intended and designed to provide
local access solely for pedestrians and cyclists. Motorized
vehicles of all kinds are prohibited. Walkstreet right-of-way width
ranges from 25 to 60 feet. The Land Use Element establishes
policies for the use of Walkstreets beyond their basic mobility
function.
Addressing Traffic Congestion
As residents have expressed, traffic congestion continues to be
the leading issue affecting the quality of life in Manhattan Beach.
Not only is local congestion a concern, but regional traffic that
passes through the City compounds the issue, especially for
businesses located along Sepulveda Boulevard, Manhattan Beach
Boulevard, and Highland Avenue. The beach draws many
visitors, bringing in additional traffic and parking demands.
Figure I-2 shows volumes in year 2002. Although Manhattan
                                                                       Motorists heading
                                                                       northbound on Sepulveda
                                                                       Boulevard can experience
                                                                       lengthy delays and traffic
                                                                       during the morning peak
                                                                       traffic hours of the day.
                                                                                       P A G E    I - 9

Beach will experience only very limited growth, regional
influences and the popularity of the beach will continue to
contribute to traffic congestion.
Over time, the City will pursue two primary courses of action to
improve congestion: (1) focused physical improvements for
enhanced function of intersections, which function as the control
points in the circulation network; and (2) creative, technological
solutions to improve mobility. Examples of the proposed
physical improvements include:
        Widening the bridge on Sepulveda Boulevard between
         Rosecrans Avenue and Marine Avenue
        Widening of Rosecrans Avenue between Douglas Street
         and Aviation Boulevard
        Widening of Aviation Boulevard between Rosecrans
         Avenue and Marine Avenue
        Intersection improvements at Manhattan Beach
         Boulevard/Sepulveda Boulevard and Marine
         Avenue/Sepulveda Boulevard
        Intersection improvements at Manhattan Beach
         Boulevard/Redondo Avenue
The location of these improvements is shown on Figure I-3. The
City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) will continue to be the
tool for identifying needed circulation improvements and for
prioritizing funding. As properties are redeveloped and the
opportunity arises for other traffic or roadway improvements not
identified in this Plan, the City should pursue them. The
widening of the north side of 33rd Street west of Sepulveda
Boulevard is one example of the type of improvement that
should be considered.
Creative solutions can be used primarily to address regional
concerns. While no freeway passes through Manhattan Beach,
nearby I-405, I-105, and SR-91 routes provide regional access for
residents and businesses. Sepulveda Boulevard and Aviation
Boulevard serve as commuter routes north and south, paralleling
the function of I-405. Both arterials experience heavy congestion
during the morning and evening peak hours. As part of a large
metropolitan area and of necessity, Manhattan Beach has
integrated its street system – and these routes in particular – with
existing and planned regional systems.
Transportation planning and management require cooperation
and coordination among local cities with the South Bay Cities
Council of Governments (SBCCOG) and the Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Working together,
these agencies are determined to address the Intelligent
                                                                             P A G E   I - 13

Transportation Systems approaches, for example, to move traffic
flow. The SBCCOG Rosecrans Corridor and Coastal Corridor
studies are examples of projects that the South Bay is working on
together to address regional traffic issues. Regional, cooperative
efforts are also critical to ensuring that convenient alternative
transportation modes allow for an integrated approach to
addressing traffic problems.
Traffic Volumes and Intersection Level of Service
Traffic flow is measured and analyzed both on a daily basis and
during peak hours (commute peak hours). On a daily basis,
traffic flow is measured on roadways at mid-block locations to
determine the overall level of travel demand and level of service.
Traffic volume values have been developed that represent the
typical daily traffic flow, within a 24-hour period, on key
roadways in the City, as shown on Figure I-2. This figure shows
streets carrying significant traffic volumes, particularly Sepulveda
Boulevard, with traffic volumes ranging from 54,000 to 62,000
vehicles trips. Signalized intersections were analyzed using the
Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) method.                  This
methodology produces an intersection volume-to-capacity (V/C)
ratio that is then related to a “Level of Service” (LOS) estimate.
LOS describes the ability of an intersection or road segment to
meet its intended design capacity. Each LOS rating describes
how people perceive the amount of congestion or difficulty in
getting where they want to go. LOS is ranked from A,
representing no limitation on movement (best), to F, representing
very high levels of congestion (worst).
The traffic analysis for the General Plan evaluated baseline and
projected conditions on intersections within the City. Figure I-3
summarizes baseline and projected conditions for the identified
intersections.
Congestion Management Plan
The MTA oversees preparation of the County’s Congestion
Management Program (CMP).                 The CMP includes a
"credit/deficit"program, with debits incurred as a result of new
development activity and credits issued for specific traffic
mitigation strategies. The mitigation strategies are divided into
the following categories: (1) Land Use Strategies, (2) Capital
Improvement Strategies, and (3) Transportation Demand
Management and Transit Services. Manhattan Beach incurs
debits with new development construction and offsets these
debits through implementation of mitigation strategies.
Compliance with the program is defined as maintaining a credit
balance. The City works with MTA to address debits incurred by
new construction and develops action plans to receive credits.
                                                                              P A G E   I - 17

M A N H A T T A N  B E A C H        G E N E R A L      P L A N
                       Manhattan Beach is required to meet the major program
                       requirements identified in the CMP to continue receiving State
                       gas tax funding.
                       The City continues to have difficulty incurring credits, as the
                       opportunities for transportation improvements that meet MTA’s
                       CMP criteria are limited. The City has a contract with another
                       jurisdiction that has excess “credits” and has allowed developers
                       to purchase these credits as required project mitigation. Similarly,
                       creative strategies will be approved as necessary to ensure the
                       City continues to receive transportation tax funds.
                       Expanding Mobility Options
                       To achieve a balanced transportation system, City policies focus
                       not only on strategies to improve traffic flow but also on ways to
                       encourage use of alternative mobility options such as transit,
                       walking, and bicycling. A balanced transportation system also
                       includes transportation strategies and programs aimed at
                       reducing congestion, in turn allowing for the safe and efficient
                       movement of people, goods, and services throughout the City.
                       Enhancing Transit Services
                       MTA provides transit service in Manhattan Beach and throughout
                       Los Angeles County. Bus routes are established on several
                       streets in Manhattan Beach, including Rosecrans Avenue,
                       Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Highland Avenue, Aviation
                       Boulevard, and Sepulveda Boulevard, as shown on Figure I-4.
                       MTA also operates the Metro Green Line, a twenty-mile light rail
                       system with fourteen stations throughout the South Bay region.
P A G E I - 18


                                                I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  E L E M E N T
The Metro Green Line extends from Los Angeles International
Airport east along the I-105 to the City of Norwalk and links to
the Blue Line, providing connections to Downtown Los Angeles
and Long Beach. MTA has no plans to extend the Green Line or
other rail service within the South Bay. The closest Green Line
stations are the Douglas/Rosecrans Station and the
Marine/Redondo Station located in the cities of El Segundo and
Hawthorne, respectively, as shown on Figure I-4.              Thus,
Manhattan Beach’s challenge lies in enhancing local connectivity
to Green Line stations via bus or similar service. To address
localized transit needs, Manhattan Beach operates a Dial-A-Ride,
a shared ride, curb-to-curb bus service for Manhattan Beach
residents, with ridership restrictions based on age, disability, or
similar factors.
One demographic group continually challenged to find public
transit is school children. When the State budget is unable to
assist with school bus funding, the Manhattan Beach Unified
School District cannot bear the cost of providing bus service to
its schools. Traffic congestion around schools, particularly in the
morning, creates not only delays but safety risks to Manhattan
Beach’s younger residents. Working cooperatively with the
District, the City may be able to find new ways to provide safe
routes to school.
Incorporating Transportation Demand
Management
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) is a general term
for strategies that promote the efficient use of transportation
systems without adding carrying capacity (e.g., additional lanes or
widening) on the roadway or freeway system. TDM strategies
can help address a variety of traffic problems and provide
secondary economic, social, and environmental benefits. When
all are considered, TDM strategies are often the most cost-
effective way to improve transportation. Examples of TDM
include:
        Bike/Transit Integration
        Carpooling
        Improvements to Pedestrian Ways
        Transit Improvements
        Walking and Cycling Encouragement
        Parking Pricing
        Bicycle Parking
        Parking Management
        Alternative Work Schedules
                                                                            P A G E   I - 21

                                    Maintaining Truck Routes
                                    Truck routes have been designated for use by heavy trucks to
                                    access most commercial areas in the City, including Downtown
                                    and El Porto. These roadways are primarily Arterial Roadways,
                                    except for Highland Avenue in El Porto/North End, which is
                                    designated as a Collector street and Manhattan Beach Boulevard
                                    from Highland Avenue to Manhattan Avenue (Figure I-5). No

                                    impacts of heavy truck traffic, noise, and vibration.

Goals and Policies: Ensuring a Balanced
Transportation System
Goal I-1:        Provide a balanced transportation system that
                 allow s the safe and efficient m ovem ent of
                 people,goods and services throughoutthe City.
Policy I-1.1:    Review the functioning of the street system on a
                 regular basis to identify problems and develop
                 solutions.
Policy I-1.2:    Improve street signage citywide, and ensure that
                 street signs are not obscured or obstructed by
                 vegetation or structures.
Unique street signage, such as walkstreet obelisks, can help
improve pedestrian orientation.
Policy I-1.3:    Encourage the development of Transportation
                 Demand Management (TDM) plans for all major
                 developments or facility expansions to encourage
                 ride-sharing and other improvements, thereby
                 reducing vehicle trips.
The Manhattan Beach City Council adopted a Transportation
Demand Management Ordinance (No. 1873) that includes TDM
measures and trip reduction standards depending on the size of
proposed projects. Such measures may include informative
bulletin boards, preferential parking for vanpools/carpools,
bicycle parking, bus stop improvements, and a pedestrian
circulation system.
Policy I-1.4:    W ork with neighboring communities and other South

                       Manhattan Beach –
                       AChronology
                       Manhattan Beach today is a desirable community for many. Its
                       history began back in 1872 when Colonel Blanton Duncan built
                       the first house at First Street and Sepulveda Boulevard and
                       became the first resident of the area.1
                       Despite Manhattan Beach’s urbanized character today, the City
                       has an agrarian history. Manhattan Beach was part of Rancho
                       Sausal Redondo (“Round Clump of Willows”), a land grant from
                       Mexico consisting of 22,500 acres given to Antonio Ygnacio
                       Avila in 1837. The Rancho was later sold to Sir Robert Burnett
                       from Scotland for sheep and cattle raising. In 1873, Burnett
                       leased the land to Daniel Freeman, who increased the stock and
                       planted citrus trees. However, the 1875 drought weakened the
                       livestock industry, and Freeman turned to dry farming. While
                       Freeman purchased the land from Burnett in the 1880s, financial
                       difficulties forced Freeman to sell off the land, and real estate
                       development followed.
                       Manhattan Beach got its name by the flip of a coin. In the early
                       1900s, the larger developers in the area -- George Peck and John
                       Merrill -- agreed that only one name should be given to the area.
                       George Peck, who owned the northern section of the area, was
                       calling his area Shore Acres, after a Santa Fe j       unction sign. John
                       Merrill, who was laying out the southern section, was calling his
                       area Manhattan after his hometown in New York. A half-dollar
                       coin was flipped and "Manhattan"became the name of the area.
                       The railroad changed the j      unction name to Manhattan in 1902
                       presumably to coincide with the area name change.
                       1
                         This history of Manhattan Beach has been compiled from excerpts from the
                       Manhattan Beach Historical Society;A Walk Beside the Sea by Jan Dennis,
                       1987;I’ll Take M anhattan,A Pictorial History by Bonnie Beckerson, 2000;and
                       M anhattan Beach 90266,A Pictorial History by the Manhattan Beach Historical
                       Society, 1995. The City appreciates the works local residents have pursued to
                       document and memorialize the foundations of our community.

With the introduction of “modern” transportation, development
followed and the character of the area changed. In 1888, the
Santa Fe Railroad laid tracks from Los Angeles to the Redondo          See the Circulation Plan of
Beach wharf, passing through the area now known as Manhattan           the Infrastructure Element
Beach. Santa Fe terminated its passenger service in 1918, failing      for the Transportation

to compete with Red Car (Pacific Electric) passenger rates. In
1903, the Pacific Railway Company (later merged with the Pacific
Electric in 1910) installed a track along the oceanfront extending
from Los Angeles to Santa Monica and then south to Redondo
Beach, passing through Manhattan Beach. The electric trolley
had five stops in Manhattan Beach, including one at Marine
Avenue.
In 1908, the Peck’s Pier and Pavilion were built as a real estate
promotional attraction at 33rd Street for dances, parties, picnics,
and roller-skating. The wooden pier was destroyed in 1913 by a
storm, and the pavilion was demolished in the 1920s due to
timber rot.
Initially, housing construction was minimal. As each year passed,
construction activities increased. Almost all of the early buildings
were small wooden beach cottages. Families would come from
Pasadena and other parts of Los Angeles on the trolley or the
Santa Fe train. Manhattan Beach was promoted as a place to
vacation; few stayed year-round. As the community grew, the
first church in Manhattan Beach, the Community Church, was
established in 1905. At the time of the City’s incorporation on
December 7, 1912, the permanent residential population was
estimated at 500 to 600 people.                                        Although the City
                                                                       incorporated as M anhattan

were a major problem. Some were 50 feet to 70 feet high and
difficult to level.     In the late 1920s, the Kuhn Brothers
Construction Company supplied Waikiki Beach with Manhattan
Beach sand. This practice continued for almost ten years.
Today, sand dunes are still obvious in the north end of
Manhattan Beach where Sand Dune Park is located.
Choosing the Downtown for Manhattan Beach was not without
controversy. The street to have the pier was regarded as the
street at the center of business. While Center Street had been
                                                                                  P A G E      L U - 3

    Manhattan Beach were built
    on sand. Today, evidence of

                                      wanted the City Pier and Downtown to be located at Marine
                                      Avenue. The new City Pier was dedicated at Center Street in
                                      1920, and Center Street became the center of Downtown. The
                                      Marine Avenue Pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1941.
                                      The 1940s and 1950s were Manhattan Beach’s growth period.
                                      Population in the City increased dramatically from 6,393 in 1940
                                      to 33,934 in 1960. The 400-home Liberty Village bounded by
                                      Redondo Avenue, Aviation Boulevard, Marine Avenue, and
                                      Manhattan Beach Boulevard broke City building permit records
                                      and became the biggest housing tract in town.
                                      As the City continued to grow, annexation became inevitable.
                                      The 30-acre El Porto area was annexed from Los Angeles County
                                      to the City in November of 1980, and El Porto transferred from
                                      the El Segundo School District to the Manhattan Beach School
                                      District.
                                      The Metlox Potteries Company was established in 1927 at 1200
                                      North Morningside Drive. The Metlox Company began its
                                      operation with the manufacturing of ceramic and neon tube
                                      signs, including the marquee for the Pantages Theatre built in

                                      Disney figurines. The 1950s and 1960s represented the peak of
                                      Metlox business activities. Business declined in the 1970s due to
                                      foreign imports and closed in 1989. Today, Metlox represents
                                      one of the few remaining property with significant development
                                      potential in the City. A commercial development and public

                                      site into a key Downtown location. Adjacent to the site, a new
                                      Fire and Police facility within the Civic Center complex will link
                                      the Metlox site and the Downtown.

Manhattan Beach - 2002
Located nineteen miles southwest of Los Angeles near the south
end of Santa Monica Bay, Manhattan Beach is a densely
populated community of less than four square miles. As we
entered the new millennium, almost 34,000 people lived in the
City, reflecting a stable population that grew by six percent in the
last decade of the twentieth century. This limited growth reflects
the built-out character of the community.
The City’s prestigious coastal location creates a housing market
where detached homes maintain high values and results in the
highly efficient use of the limited land. Almost 70 percent of the
land area is developed with residential uses (Table LU-1). With
approximately 15,000 housing units in 2002, the City ranked as
the 15th most densely populated city in Los Angeles County,
among similar cities such as Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach,
and Santa Monica.
More than 1,600 businesses of various sizes contribute to the
local economy, the majority of which are small local businesses
that employ fewer than 10 employees.2 Overall, commercial and
industrial businesses occupy fifteen percent of the land area. The
balance of the City is dedicated to parks, open space, and public
facilities such as exceptional public schools, the National Guard
Armory, and public utility sites.

                                  Manhattan Beach is a city of distinct neighborhoods that people
                                  recognize:the Sand Section, Downtown, North End/El Porto, the
                                  Tree Section, the Hill Section, Manhattan Village and mall, and
                                  the Eastside (Figure LU-1). These neighborhoods often have
                                  general boundaries that overlap with each other. Within some of
                                  these neighborhoods are smaller, more defined areas with their
                                  own unique characteristics, and each of these areas often do not

                                  Manhattan Beach treasures its two miles of beach frontage and
                                  forty acres of recreational beach area. The Sand Section, or
                                  Beach Area, as it is also known, generally extends inland from the
                                  beachfront to Grandview Avenue and Valley-Ardmore,

                                  North End, the 400-acre area is developed primarily with
                                  apartments and condominiums. Lots in the Sand Section are
                                  small, usually less than 3,000 square feet in size. With more than
                                  5,600 housing units, the Sand Section is the most densely
                                  populated neighborhood in the City. Parking in the Sand Section
                                  is in short supply, as many of the housing developments were

Downtown
Downtown Manhattan Beach is generally defined by 15th Street
on the north; Valley-Ardmore on the east; 8th, 9th and 10th Street
on the south; and on the west by the Strand and Ocean Drive.
An area of over forty blocks that radiates from the intersection of
Highland Avenue and Manhattan Beach Boulevard, the
Downtown is characterized by a variety of restaurants and small
specialty shops and services that cater to both residents and
visitors to the beach.
The Civic Center and the new Safety Facility represent the
municipal heart of Downtown, where City Hall and the adjacent
mixed-use commercial center enhance the Downtown'          s village
character, encourage pedestrian activity, and create a gateway to
Downtown businesses.
Downtown Manhattan Beach enjoys commercial success but
also faces many challenges. Traffic congestion (especially along
Highland Avenue, Manhattan Avenue, and Manhattan Beach
Boulevard), pedestrian/automobile conflicts, parking shortages,
and new buildings and businesses that can be out of scale and
character with the existing environment are key concerns
residents and the business community have noted as important
to address.
In 1996, the City adopted the Downtown Strategic Action Plan
(DSAP) to articulate a community vision for the Downtown,
identify issues, and establish a framework for future decisions. As
a result of the DSAP, in 1998 the City adopted the Downtown
Manhattan Beach Design Guidelines as a planning tool to shape
the function and appearance of Downtown. The Guidelines
establish three overarching themes for Downtown:
    Preserve the small-town village character of downtown
     Manhattan Beach
    Preserve and enhance the pedestrian orientation of
     downtown Manhattan Beach
    Protect and encourage streetscape amenities

                                    The North End neighborhood includes the small community
                                    known as El Porto, which was annexed from the County of Los
                                    Angeles to the City in November of 1980. The North End
                                    neighborhood generally extends from 33rd Avenue north to the
                                    City limit in El Segundo at 45th Street, and from the ocean to
                                    Grandview Avenue, Rosecrans Avenue, and Crest Avenue. The
                                    neighborhood encompasses a mix of residential and commercial
                                    uses, and the El Porto Area also has the highest residential
                                    density in the City. Despite the density, most buildings are low-
                                    profile structures of two or three stories. To ensure that the low-
                                    profile image is preserved, the City established the North End
                                    Commercial Design Overlay District.
          North End is the most
      densely developed area in
    the City. Parking shortage
        is an ongoing challenge
     faced by residents and City
                       planners.
                                    Commercial uses consist primarily of local- and neighborhood-
                                    serving businesses, with a few restaurants and shops oriented
                                    toward beachgoers and night-time visitors. The limited parking
                                    serves to constrain the expansion of established shops and
                                    restaurants and the diversification of businesses. As a popular
                                    beach area, particularly for surfing, beachgoers create additional
                                    parking demands. Many streets are also hilly and difficult to walk
                                    up and down. The local business community recognizes the
                                    advantages of working together to enhance business
                                    opportunities and create a more cohesive appearance for the
                                    area. The North End Business Improvement District continues to
                                    explore ways to beautify the streetscape and address parking
                                    issues.

Tree Section
The Tree Section is generally bounded by Rosecrans Avenue,
Sepulveda Boulevard, Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Valley
Drive/Ardmore Avenue, and Grandview Avenue. The streets
east of Pacific Avenue are named after trees – Palm, Walnut,
Pine, Elm, and Oak – and the entire area has many mature trees,
giving the Tree Section its descriptive name. Several distinctive
features define the character of this neighborhood, which
consists almost exclusively of single-family residences, with
commercial uses and high-density housing along Manhattan
Beach Boulevard and senior housing at Valley Drive and
Sepulveda Boulevard. The strip of residential development along
Manhattan Beach Boulevard, between Ardmore Avenue and
Pacific Avenue bordering the Hill Section and the Downtown, is
permitted for more intensive residential development. The           Cars park under the generous

located in the Tree Section.
The Grandview area lies within the Tree Section and borders the
Sand Section. This area contains the historical remnant of the
large sand dunes that once extended down to the beach but
were slowly leveled when the Kuhn Brothers Construction
Company began supplying Waikiki Beach with Manhattan Beach
sand in the 1920s. The Gaslamp District, Sand Dune Park,
Ladera Elementary School, Grand View Elementary School, the
Public Works Yard, and National Guard Armory are all located in
this area.
The neighborhood has maintained an almost rural feel, with most
areas having an absence of sidewalks, curbs, and gutters and
varying street widths. Some property owners have established
private landscaping improvements and parking areas within the
undeveloped portion of the public right-of-way. While this
practice presents certain public safety and code enforcement
challenges, it contributes substantially to the charm of the Tree
Section.
Residents have invested significantly in tree planting over the
years, resulting in many mature trees thriving in front yards.
Some concern has been expressed over a noticeable loss of long-
established trees with home remodeling and expansion and the
changed streetscape associated with such activity. In 1993, the
City adopted the Tree Protection Ordinance to protect front yard
trees in the Tree, Section and in 2003 the ordinance was
expanded Citywide, except for the Sand Section.

                       Sepulveda Boulevard
                       Sepulveda Boulevard is the only State Highway in Manhattan
                       Beach. As a major transportation corridor for the South Bay
                       region, Sepulveda Boulevard also functions as a commercial
                       corridor. With the heavy traffic volumes and associated noise
                       impacts, adequate buffering of the residential uses behind
                       Sepulveda Boulevard from such impacts is important. The scale
                       and character of commercial development along Sepulveda
                       Boulevard is also an important community concern. In response
                       to these issues, the City adopted the Sepulveda Boulevard
                       Design Guidelines to provide a framework for future
                       development along this corridor.
                       Hill Section
                       The Hill Section is generally bounded by Manhattan Beach
                       Boulevard, Sepulveda Boulevard, Boundary Place, and Valley
                       Drive/Ardmore Avenue. This section, at the south end of the
                       City, includes some of the largest residential lots in Manhattan
                       Beach, with many homesites afforded ocean and Downtown Los
                       Angeles vistas and beyond. The Hill Section contains mostly
                       single-family residences, with commercial uses along Manhattan
                       Beach Boulevard, and apartments and townhomes along the
                       west end of Manhattan Beach Boulevard.
                       Due to the large lots and spectacular vistas, the Hill Section
                       commands some of the highest real estate prices and contains
                       some of the largest homes in the City. The large lots, as well as
                       the practice of combining lots, provide opportunities to build
                       homes of 5,000 square feet or larger.
                       Manhattan Village
                       Manhattan Village occupies an area that was once devoted to
                       extensive industrial uses, including a Chevron oil field. The
                       historic pattern of ownership facilitated large-scale master
                       planning of the area when market conditions caused the oil field
                       to close. Manhattan Village, which is bordered by Rosecrans
                       Avenue to the north, Aviation Boulevard to the east, Marine
                       Avenue to the south, and Sepulveda Boulevard to the west,
                       contains a diverse mix of complementary uses, including the
                       City’s only gated residential community. Residential uses include
                       low-density single-family homes, medium-density townhouses,
                       and high-density senior apartments.       The subareas within

The Eastside, bounded by Marine Avenue, Aviation Boulevard,
Artesia Boulevard, and Sepulveda Boulevard, contains distinct
neighborhoods of single-family homes. Many of the homes were
constructed as part of the 1940s and 1950s post-war tract homes
(e.g., Liberty Village). Higher-density housing and commercial
uses front Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and
Aviation Boulevard.
Many young families reside in the Eastside, and Polliwog Park is
used extensively for family outings. Five schools are located in
the Eastside, including the City’s only public high school, Mira    Families enjoying outings at
Costa High School, and only middle school, Manhattan Beach          Polliwog Park. See the
Middle School. Other distinct areas within the Eastside include     Recreation and Parks section
the Poets Section, Manhattan Heights, and Liberty Village.          of the Community Resources

                       The Land Use Plan
                       In response to the desire of the community to maintain
                       Manhattan Beach as a city with a small-town feel, the City has
                       developed this Land Use Plan to guide the development,
                       maintenance, and improvement of land and properties for the
                       next twenty years.
                       Density and Intensity
                       When we describe a community, we often differentiate one area
                       from another by the principal use, whether it is homes
                       (residential), shops and restaurants (commercial), manufacturing
                       businesses (industrial), a park, or a school. To describe the
                       intensity of use – how much development exists on a property
                       (and presumably, what the associated activity level is) – land use
                       planners have developed quantitative measures called density
                       and intensity.
                       The term density typically applies to residential uses and refers to
                       the population and development capacity of residential land.
                       Density is described in terms of dwelling units per acre of land
                       (du/ac).
                       For commercial, industrial, and other nonresidential uses,
                       intensity describes the degree to which a property is developed.
                       The measure of intensity Manhattan Beach has adopted is the
                       floor-area factor. The floor-area factor, or FAF, describes the
                       relationship between the total square footage of development on
                       a lot and the area of that lot. The FAF is determined by dividing
                       the gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the land area of
                       that lot.
                       FAF and factors such as building square footage, building height,
                       and the percent of lot coverage are all inter-related. For example,
                       a 20,000-square-foot building on a 40,000-square-foot lot yields
                       an FAF of 0.50:1. This 0.50:1 FAF can accommodate a single-
                       story building thatcovers halfthe lot, or a tw o-story building w ith
                       reduced lot coverage. Figure LU-2 illustrates different FAF
                       calculations.

Figure LU-2: Examples of Floor-Area Factors (FAF)
  In a zone district with a maximum FAF of 0.50:1, the maximum
  allowable floor area of a building on a 40,000 sq. ft. lot would be
  20,000 sq. ft. (20,000 sq. ft. divided by 40,000 sq. ft. equals 0.50).
  Note: Variations may occur if upper floors are stepped back from
  ground-level lot coverage.

                       Land Use Designations
                       The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-3) graphically represents the
                       planned distribution and intensity of land use citywide. The
                       colors shown on the map correspond to twelve land use
                       designations that describe the types of uses existing and planned
                       in Manhattan Beach. Given the built-out character of the
                       community, only minor land use changes from baseline year
                       2002 conditions will occur over the long term. Table LU-2

                       Residential Land Use Categories
                       Three residential land use categories describe the general
                       character of housing development in Manhattan Beach: Low
                       Density Residential, Medium Density Residential, and High
                       Density Residential.
                       Low Density Residential
                       The Low Density Residential category provides for the
                       development of single-family residences within a density range of
                       1.0 to 16.1 units per acre. Development is characterized
                       generally by detached homes on individual lots. Other permitted
                       uses include parks and recreation facilities, public and private
                       schools, public safety facilities, and facilities for religious
                       assembly, consistent with zoning code requirements, which may
                       require discretionary review.

Medium Density Residential
The Medium Density Residential category allows single-family
homes, duplexes, and triplexes, including condominiums. Multi-
family housing with four or more units may be permitted subject
to discretionary review and provided compatibility with
surrounding development can be assured. Development
densities may range from 11.6 to 32.3 units per acre. Other
permitted uses include parks and recreation facilities, public and
private schools, public safety facilities, and facilities for religious
assembly, consistent with zoning code requirements, which may
require discretionary review.
High Density Residential
The High Density Residential category accommodates all types
of housing, and specifically housing development of a more
intensive form, including apartments, condominiums, and senior
housing. Residential projects may be constructed at a density of
up to 51.3 units per acre. Other permitted uses include parks
and recreation facilities, public and private schools, public safety
facilities, and facilities for religious assembly, consistent with
zoning code requirements, which may require discretionary
review.
The maximum density permitted within each residential land use
category varies citywide, based on historic development patterns
and street configurations. To preserve neighborhood character
and recognize past investments made, the City has established
four districts, wherein the maximum permitted density for each of
the three residential land use designations varies (Figure LU-3).
    District 1 encompasses the Hill Section and the Eastside
     south of Manhattan Beach Boulevard.
    District 2 includes the Tree Section, Manhattan Village, and
     the Eastside north of Manhattan Beach Boulevard.
    District 3 covers the Beach Area, including Downtown
     Manhattan Beach, the Grandview area, a small area in the
     Tree and Hill Sections, and parts of the North End.
    District 4 encompasses the El Porto Section of the North
     End.

                                land use category within each district. The table also identifies
                                the maximum population density, in terms of persons per acre,
                                associated with each category/district.        These population
                                densities numbers are required to be included per State Law.
                                These maximum densities provide guidelines for planners,
                                property owners, and decision-makers in the drafting and review
                                of development plans.        The maximums do not infer an
                                entitlement, as many considerations weigh in the planning
                                process, including, but not limited to, the ability of local
                                infrastructure to support proposed development, the relationship
                                between proposed and established uses, and provisions for
                                parking, open space, and other development standards.

                                established to acknowledge and preserve the unique
                                characteristics of Manhattan Beach’s varied commercial activity
                                centers.
                                General Commercial
                                The General Commercial category provides opportunities for a
                                broad range of retail and service commercial and professional
                                office uses intended to meet the needs of local residents and
                                businesses and to provide goods and services for the regional
                                market. Limited industrial uses are also permitted consistent with
                                zoning regulations.        The General Commercial category
                                accommodates uses that typically generate heavy traffic.
                                Therefore, this designation applies primarily along Sepulveda
                                Boulevard and targeted areas along Manhattan Beach Boulevard,
                                Artesia Boulevard, and Aviation Boulevard. The maximum FAF is

Downtown Commercial
The Downtown Commercial category applies only to the
Downtown, an area of 40+ blocks that radiates from the
intersection of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Highland
Avenue. Downtown provides locations for a mix of commercial
businesses, residential uses with discretionary review, and public
uses, with a focus on pedestrian-oriented commercial businesses
that serve Manhattan Beach residents. Visitor-oriented uses are
limited to low-intensity businesses providing goods and services
primarily to beachgoers. The maximum FAF for commercial or
mixed-used development is 1.5:1, and the maximum residential
density is 51.3 units per acre.
Local Commercial
The Local Commercial category provides areas for
neighborhood-oriented, small-scale professional offices, retail
businesses, and service activities that serve the local community.
Permitted uses are generally characterized by those which
generate low traffic volumes, have limited parking needs, and
generally do not operate late hours. The maximum FAF is 1.5:1.
Residential uses are permitted with discretionary review at
densities consistent with the High Density Residential category.
Mixed-Use Commercial
The Mixed-Use Commercial category accommodates the parking
needs of commercial businesses on small lots that front
Sepulveda Boulevard and abut residential neighborhoods. In
recognition of the need to ensure adequate parking for
businesses and to protect residential uses from activities that

Goals and Policies
Small-Town Character
Manhattan Beach values its small-town atmosphere and unique
neighborhoods. Low-profile, human-scale development not only
promotes a sense of neighborhood and community among
residents and businesses, this development profile also
encourages interaction and maximizes visual and physical access
to one of the most important assets of our community – the
beachfront. To preserve this character, the City recognizes that
reasonable controls on development must be pursued,
particularly to avoid overbuilding on small lots. New residential
construction and home additions should reflect the scale and
character of surrounding homes. Excessively large structures that
are tall and bulky, with tight setbacks, and/or that exhibit limited
architectural articulation along the façades or rooflines, can
produce streetscapes that are aesthetically overbearing.
In the commercial districts of Downtown and the North End, and
where commercial businesses interface directly with residential
neighborhoods, low-scale development enhances compatibility,
encourages walking, and creates a human scale. The following
goal and corollary policies encourage well-proportioned
structures and functional, attractive streetscapes that promote
and maintain the low-profile development and small-town
character of Manhattan Beach.
Goal LU-1:       Maintain the low-profile developm ent and sm all-
                 town atm osphere ofManhattan Beach.
Policy LU-1.1:   Limit the height of new development to three stories
                 where the height limit is thirty feet, or to two stories
                 where the height limit is twenty-six feet, to protect
                 the privacy of adjacent properties, reduce shading,
                 protect vistas of the ocean, and preserve the low-
                 profile image of the community.
                                                                               P A G E   L U - 23

                       Policy LU-1.2:    Require the design of all new construction to utilize
                                         notches,balconies,rooflines,open space,setbacks,
                                         landscaping, or other architectural details to reduce
                                         the bulk of buildings and to add visual interest to the
                                         streetscape.

Specifically, the City has established development guidelines for
the Downtown and Sepulveda Boulevard – two of the most
important commercial areas in the City (see discussion under
Goal LU-3 below).
Policy LU-2.2:   Preserve and encourage private open space on
                 residential lots citywide.
As part of the City’s Bulk and Volume Ordinance, large homes
with minimum private open space are discouraged (see
discussion under Goal LU-1 above).
Policy LU-2.3:   Protect existing mature trees throughout the City, and
                 encourage their replacement with specimen trees
                 whenever they are lost or removed.
In May of 2003, the City expanded the Tree Ordinance, which
protects front yard trees in the Tree Sections, to include tree
protection in front yards in all of District 1 and District 2.
Policy LU-2.4:   Support appropriate stormwater pollution mitigation
                 measures.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge
of any pollutant to navigable waters from a point source unless
the discharge is authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit.                Manhattan Beach
participates in the NPDES permit program via a partnership
consisting of the County, all cities within the County, and the
County Flood Control District.
Community Aesthetics
Manhattan Beach takes pride in the aesthetic quality of our
community.       The ocean vistas, tree-lined streets, well-kept
neighborhoods, and Downtown village all contribute to the
scenic quality of our community. Architectural features, design
elements, street amenities, and landscaping should all work
together to provide uniform themes.
Goal LU-3:       Achieve a strong, positive com m unity aesthetic.
Policy LU-3.1:   Continue to encourage quality design in all new
                 construction.
                                                                             P A G E   L U - 25

                       Policy LU-3.2: Promote the use of adopted design guidelines for new
                                      construction in Downtown, along Sepulveda Boulevard,
                                      and other areas to which guidelines apply.
                       To ensure quality design for development in Downtown and
                       along Sepulveda, the City has adopted design guidelines for
                       Downtown and Sepulveda Boulevard.
                       A considerable part of the charm of the Downtown is the
                       diversity of buildings and uses. New development should display
                       uniqueness in design yet recognize the common elements that
                       existing structures employ to create a uniform village theme for
                       the Downtown. The Downtown Design Guidelines address such
                       issues as site design, compatibility with neighboring
                       development, architectural elements/features, pedestrian activity,
                       landscaping, and signs.
                       Sepulveda Boulevard is the major commercial corridor in
                       Manhattan Beach, with primarily regional-serving and large-scale
                       businesses. Ensuring quality design is especially important along
                       this corridor to avoid monotonous and overbearing buildings,
                       safeguard pedestrian safety and access, and promote
                       compatibility with residential neighborhoods. The Sepulveda
                       Boulevard Design Guidelines address such issues as vehicular
                       access, pedestrian access, sidewalk dedication, building
                       orientation, visual aesthetics, residential nuisances, landscaping,
                       signs, and utility undergrounding.
                       To address neighborhood aesthetic issues, the North End also has
                       a Design Overlay District and Business Improvement District.
                       Policy LU-3.3:    Encourage use of “stealth” design for
                                         telecommunications antenna and related facilities.
                       Policy LU-3.4:    Establish and implement consistent standards and
                                         aesthetics for public signage, including City street
                                         signs.

Policy LU-3.5:  Ensure that the sign ordinance provides for
                commercial signage that is attractive, non-intrusive,
                safe, and consistent with overall City aesthetic goals.
The Sign Ordinance regulates the location, height, size, and
illumination of signs to: 1) maintain the attractiveness and
orderliness of the City'  s appearance; 2) protect business sites
from loss of prominence resulting from excessive signs,
particularly pole signs, on nearby sites; and 3) protect the public
safety and welfare.
Policy LU-3.6:  Encourage the beautification of the walkstreets,
                particularly through the use of landscaping.
The City has established Encroachment Permit Standards to
regulate private encroachments in the public right-of-way, with
specific standards for the pedestrian walkstreets. Walkstreet
encroachment standards regulate fences, retaining walls,
landscaping, decks, and patios.
Neighborhood Character
Manhattan Beach is made up of various unique neighborhoods,
each with distinct features and character that reflect the history
and culture of our community.             Future development and
improvements must respect the unique qualities of individual
neighborhoods and recognize the historic and cultural values of
certain homes and buildings. For example, generally the absence
of standard public improvements in the right-of-way and the
individual landscaping in the right-of-way in the Tree Section add
to the rural character of the neighborhood. While public
improvements could enhance pedestrian mobility, they may not
be in keeping with neighborhood charm.
Walkstreets offer an innovative solution to the often competing
interests of needs for private open space for beach homes and
public access to the beach. Private use of the public right-of-way
along the walkstreets and the Strand gardens responds to needs
for open space. The characteristics of the walkstreets and the
Strand should be maintained and enhanced while facilitating
physical and visual accesses to the beach.
Goal LU-4:      Preserve the features of each community
                neighborhood, and develop solutions tailored to
                each neighborhood’s unique characteristics.

                       Policy LU-4.2:  Develop and implement standards for the use of

                       The City has developed encroachment standards for walkstreets,
                       providing regulations for the installation of fences, retaining walls,
                       landings, landscaping, decks, and patios in the encroachment

                                       M anhattan Beach to preserve the culture and history
                                       of the City.

                                       protect buildings, landscaping, and other features
                                       important to the City’s history.
                       Policy LU-4.6:  W hen public improvements are made, they should
                                       preserve and maintain distinctive neighborhood
                                       characteristics.
                       Protecting Residential Neighborhoods
                       Manhattan Beach is primarily a residential community. Intrusion
                       of incompatible uses and activities can threaten the quality and
                       integrity of our neighborhoods. Commercial uses typically
                       generate traffic and noise. Businesses such as service stations
                       and restaurants also generate odors. Some businesses have
                       extended hours of operation or require deliveries during late
                       night and/or early morning hours. Schools and public gathering
                       places, including parks, can create traffic and noise impacts
                       during specific periods or special events. Such secondary effects
                       can erode the quality of a residential neighborhood and thus
                       must be avoided if possible, or mitigated to the maximum extent
                       feasible.

Goal LU-5:       Protect residential neighborhoods from the
                 intrusion of inappropriate and incompatible
                 uses.
Policy LU-5.1:   Require the separation or buffering of residential areas
                 from businesses which produce noise, odors, high
                 traffic volumes, light or glare, and parking through the
                 use of landscaping, setbacks, or other techniques.
In 1991, the City adopted Ordinance 1382, authorizing the
Neighborhood Conservation (NC) Overlay District.                     The
Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District allows property
owners to initiate and implement programs for the revitalization
or conservation of older areas or districts possessing distinctive
features, identity, or character worthy of retention and
enhancement. The NC district is implemented through adoption
of a plan and a set of regulations that facilitate maintenance and
upgrading of the neighborhood, while reducing or eliminating
incompatible mixes of uses.
The Oak Avenue Overlay District encompasses the area
designated Mixed-Use Commercial on the Land Use Policy Map
and applies to commercial lots with access to a predominately
single-family residential street but has some history of commercial
use or intent. Property located within the Oak Avenue Overlay
District may be commercially developed, redeveloped, or
intensified in conjunction with abutting Sepulveda-frontage
property, subject to strict rules intended to protect the adjacent
residential neighborhood.
Similarly, the Design Overlay District provides a mechanism to
ensure that the low-profile image of the community is preserved
and neighborhoods are protected from adverse effects of noise
and traffic. Six subdistricts are established:
    D1: Rosecrans Avenue, where higher fences in the front yard
     setback area are needed to reduce traffic noise
    D2: 11th Street, where limitations on building height and
     density are needed to minimize building bulk and buffer
     adjoining residences
    D3: Gaslamp Neighborhood, where special design standards
     and review procedures are needed to preserve existing
     neighborhood character
    D4: Traffic Noise Impact Areas, where higher fences are
     needed to reduce traffic noise
                                                                                P A G E   L U - 29

                            Sepulveda Boulevard
                       Policy LU-5.2:  Work with all commercial property owners bordering
                                       residential areas to mitigate impacts and use
                                       appropriate landscaping and buffering of residential
                                       neighborhoods.
                       Policy LU-5.3:  Consider using discretionary review for any public
                                       gathering place or institutional use proposed within or
                                       adjacent to a residential neighborhood.
                       Policy LU-5.4:  Discourage the outdoor commercial and industrial use
                                       of property adjacent to residential use.
                       Policy LU-5.5:  Discourage the commercial use of walkstreet
                                       encroachment areas.
                       In 2003, the City adopted an ordinance to prohibit any new
                       commercial use of walkstreets.
                       Policy LU-5.6:  Regulate the use of and special activities conducted
                                       within public parks to minimize any adverse impact on
                                       adjacent residential neighborhoods.
                       Policy LU-5.7:  Recognize the unique qualities of mixed-use areas,
                                       and balance the needs of both the residential and
                                       commercial uses.
                       Mixed-use areas promote lively neighborhoods and serve as a
                       buffer between commercial uses and residential neighborhoods.
                       Mixed-use developments can be accommodated, subject to
                       discretionary reviews, in Downtown, North End/El Porto, and the
                       Mixed-Use Commercial area along Oak Avenue; and Local
                       Commercial areas along Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Artesia

Vibrant and Diverse Commercial Areas
A local economy that is diversified tends to be more resilient to
economic recession, allowing the community to respond quickly
to fiscal and structural changes in the regional economy.
Manhattan Beach has several core commercial areas:
Downtown, North End/El Porto, Manhattan Village, Rosecrans
Avenue, and Sepulveda Boulevard. Each area serves specific
functions within the community and contributes to the diversity
of services our residents and visitors enjoy.               Economic
development efforts must focus on maintaining and enhancing
the diversity and vitality of our commercial areas.
Goal LU-6:       Maintain the viability of the commercial areas
                 of Manhattan Beach.
Policy LU-6.1:   Support and encourage small businesses throughout
                 the City.
Among the 1,600+ businesses in Manhattan Beach, close to
1,400 are small businesses employing fewer than 10 employees.
Policy LU-6.2:   Encourage a diverse mix of businesses that support
                 the local tax base, are beneficial to residents, and
                 support the economic needs of the community.
While the City has a mix of businesses, the major sales tax
generators in Manhattan Beach are a few large stores. The City
must work to introduce additional sale tax generators to improve
the diversity of our local economy.
Policy LU-6.3:   Recognize the need for a variety of commercial
                 development types and designate areas appropriate
                 for each. Encourage development proposals that meet
                 the intent of these designations.
Policy LU-6.4:   Recognize the unique qualities of mixed-use areas and
                 balance the needs of both the commercial and
                 residential uses.
Mixed-use areas promote lively neighborhoods.                  Several
commercial areas in Manhattan Beach accommodate residential
uses: Downtown, North End/El Porto, the Mixed-Use
Commercial area along Oak Avenue, and Local Commercial
areas along Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and
Aviation Boulevard. For example, the Aviation Triangle (a portion
                                                                             P A G E   L U - 31

                       Avenue) has been designated Local Commercial as part of this
                       General Plan, with mixed residential/commercial development
                       being a permitted use via the discretionary review process.
                       A Vibrant Downtown
                       Downtown Manhattan Beach is the focal point of our
                       community, offering services and activities for our residents and
                       visitors. Continued development and enhancement of this
                       walkable village requires coordinated planning efforts to address
                       issues relating to economic diversity, parking, traffic congestion
                       and safety, and development character.
                       Goal LU-7:      Continue to support and encourage the viability
                                       of the Dow ntow n area of Manhattan Beach.
                       Policy LU-7.1:  Encourage the upgrading and growth of businesses in
                                       the Downtown area to serve as a center for the
                                       community and to meet the needs of local residents
                                       and visitors.
                       The Civic Center/Metlox development will offer additional
                       amenities to the Downtown, including a gateway to the
                       Downtown, a new Public Safety Facility, public open space,
                       public parking, and an appropriate mix of local-serving uses
                       designed and integrated to reflect the existing unique small-scale
                       development patterns, strengthening the vitality of the
                       Downtown environment. As part of this General Plan, a portion
                       of the Civic Center/Metlox site is designated Public Facilities, and
                       a portion is designated Downtown Commercial to reflect the
                       intended uses of these properties and to reflect the 13th Street
                       extension.
                       Policy LU-7.2:  Encourage the use of the Downtown Design
                                       Guidelines to improve the Downtown’s visual
                                       identification as a unique commercial area.
                       Policy LU-7.3:  Support pedestrian-oriented improvements           to
                                       increase accessibility in and around Downtown.
                       Policy LU-7.4:  Encourage first-floor street front businesses with
                                       retail, restaurants, service/commercial, and similar
                                       uses to promote lively pedestrian activity on

                 Downtown streets, and consider providing zoning
                 regulations that support these uses.
A vibrant downtown must promote and encourage interactions
among its users. Ground-floor street-front commercial spaces in
the Downtown should be occupied by uses that create
interesting storefronts, promote foot traffic, and generate
customers. Office uses that do not offer storefront activities
should be discouraged.
Policy LU-7.5:   Support the efforts of business improvement districts
                 (BIDs)to enhance and improve Downtown.
Policy LU-7.6:   Recognize the unique qualities of mixed-use
                 development, and balance the needs of both
                 commercial and residential uses.
A theme raised during the development of the Downtown
Strategic Action Plan and the General Plan is the importance of a
"balanced" mix of uses in Downtown Manhattan Beach. The
desired mix includes residential and commercial.
As part of this General Plan, a cluster of properties in the vicinity
of 11th Street has been designated High Density Residential to
reflect development trends and the community desire to provide
for residential uses in the Downtown.
Furthermore, the Downtown Commercial designation allows
residential development consistent with the High Density
Residential category. One method of establishing a residential
and commercial balance in Downtown is to encourage mixed-
use development. This type of development allows retail
commercial uses on the ground floor and residential usage above
the commercial tenants. The City’s Zoning Code recognizes and
provides standards for the construction of such development.
These standards may need to be revisited to ensure they address
the community needs.
Policy LU-7.7:   Encourage a future public use other than parking in
                 the lower Pier Parking Lot.
Consistent with the Downtown Strategic Plan, the City envisions
a future public use other than parking in the lower parking lot,
provided that no negative impact on parking in the Downtown is
expected. If parking is eliminated from the lower lot, additional
parking may be accommodate d as new levels in reconstructed
beach parking lots.
                                                                           P A G E   L U - 33

                       Regional-Serving Commercial Districts
                       Regional-serving commercial uses are concentrated along two
                       major transportation corridors:            Sepulveda Boulevard and
                       Rosecrans Avenue east of Sepulveda Boulevard. Zoning and
                       development standards must recognize the importance of these
                       regional-serving commercial districts and support their vitality.
                       Goal LU-8:       Maintain Sepulveda Boulevard, Rosecrans
                                        Avenue, and the commercial areas of
                                        Manhattan          Village     as    regional-serving
                                        commercial districts.
                       Policy LU-8.1:   Ensure that applicable zoning regulations allow for
                                        commercial uses that serve a broad market area,
                                        including visitor-serving uses.
                       Policy LU-8.2:   Support the remodeling and upgrading needs of
                                        businesses as appropriate within these regional-
                                        serving commercial districts.
                       Policy LU-8.3:   Recognize that shallow-depth commercial lots along
                                        Sepulveda Boulevard may be difficult to develop and
                                        that in limited circumstances, allowing parking
                                        facilities to be established on adjacent residential
                                        properties may be appropriate, provided such use
                                        does not result in significant adverse impact on
                                        abutting residential neighborhoods and further
                                        provided that access to residential streets located at
                                        the rear of the commercial uses is discouraged.
                       North End/ElPorto
                       The North End/El Porto area contains eclectic neighborhood-
                       oriented retail, service, and residential uses. The El Porto area
                       was developed under County development standards prior to its
                       annexation into the City. Efforts to improve the overall aesthetic
                       quality, streetscape, parking conditions, and economic vitality
                       need to be addressed.

Goal LU-9:      Preserve the low-intensity, pedestrian-oriented
                character of commercial areas in the North End
                and El Porto.
Policy LU-9.1:  Provide zoning regulations that encourage
                neighborhood-oriented businesses within these areas.
Policy LU-9.2:  Encourage and support ground floor retail and service
                uses on properties designated for commercial use.
Some commercially designated properties are developed with
residences. Future recycling of these properties to commercial
uses or mixed-use developments with ground-floor retail and
services should be encouraged.
Policy LU-9.3:  Continue to improve the aesthetic quality of
                businesses within the North End and El Porto.
The North End Business Improvement District (BID) was
established to improve the appearance of the North End.
Policy LU-9.4:  Provide traffic enhancements that accommodate safe
                pedestrian movement.
Policy LU-9.5:  Work to improve parking conditions within the North
                End and El Porto.
Policy LU-9.6:  Support the development of a comprehensive
                streetscape improvement plan.
Policy LU-9.7:  Recognize the unique qualities of mixed-use
                development, and balance the needs of both
                commercial and residential uses.
The neighborhood-oriented character of the North End/El Porto
area is ideal for fostering mixed-use development, particularly
along Highland Avenue.
Policy LU-9.8:  Support the efforts of business improvement districts
                (BIDs) to enhance and improve the North End and El
                Porto.
                                                                           P A G E   L U - 35

                       Use Policy
                       Table LU-4 identifies the planned distribution of land uses. Over
                       time, as properties are redeveloped, land uses and intensities will
                       gradually shift to align with the intent of this Land Use Element.
                       Table LU-4 summarizes the land use distribution, average
                       development, and the resultant residential and commercial
                       developments that can be expected over the next 20 years.
                       Given the built-out character of Manhattan Beach and the good
                       conditions of most buildings, significant redevelopment activities
                       are not anticipated over the life of this General Plan. Average
                       development densities and potential presented in Table LU-4
                       reflect primarily the established densities with limited
                       opportunities for recycling to more intensified development.

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     I. Introduction
I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
The Housing Element describes the City’s needs, goals, policies, objectives, and programs
regarding the preservation, improvement, and development of housing within
Manhattan Beach. The Element analyzes community housing needs in terms of
affordability, availability, adequacy, and accessibility, and describes the City’s strategy
and programs to address those needs.
The Housing Element is the City’s response to a growing awareness of the need to
provide housing for all economic segments of the community, as well as a legal
requirement for all California jurisdictions. It provides Manhattan Beach with the
opportunity to plan for the existing and future housing needs in the community.
This Housing Element has been prepared in compliance with the 2013-2021 planning
cycle for cities within the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region.
It identifies strategies and programs that focus on: 1) providing diverse housing sites and
opportunities; 2) conserving and improving the existing affordable housing stock;
3) removing governmental and other constraints to housing development; 4) promoting
equal housing opportunities; and 5) promoting energy conservation.
B.      Scope and Content of the Housing Element
The California Legislature recognizes the role of local general plans and particularly the
Housing Element in implementing statewide housing goals to provide decent and
adequate housing for all persons. Furthermore, the Legislature stresses continuing efforts
toward providing affordable housing for all income groups. The California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) also sets forth specific requirements
regarding the scope and content of housing elements, including the following major
components:
      •      An analysis of the city’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
             (Chapter II);
      •      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
             address the City’s housing needs (Chapter III);
      •      A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
             to meeting the City’s housing needs (Chapter IV);
      •      A Housing Action Plan for addressing the City’s identified housing needs,
             including goals, policies, programs and quantified objectives (Chapter V);
      •      An evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of previous policies
             and programs in achieving the City’s objectives, and the progress in
             implementing Housing Element programs (Appendix A);
      •      A parcel-specific inventory of vacant and underutilized land (Appendix B);

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    I. Introduction
      •     A description of the opportunities provided to interested members of the
            community and other stakeholders to participate in the preparation of the
            Housing Element (Appendix C).
C.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
According to state law, all elements of the General Plan must be consistent with one
other. The Housing Element has been prepared within the context of the other General
Plan Elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth therein. The
Housing Element is closely related to development policies contained in the Land Use
Element, which establishes the location, type, and intensity of land uses throughout the
City. The Land Use Element determines the number and type of housing units that can be
constructed in the various land use districts. Areas designated for commercial and
industrial uses create employment opportunities, which in turn, create demand for
housing. The Circulation Element or Mobility Element establishes the location and scale of
streets, highways and other transportation routes and multi-modal transportation options
that provide access to residential neighborhoods. Because of the requirement for
consistency among the various General Plan elements, any proposed amendment to
one element will be evaluated against the other elements to ensure that no conflicts
occur. If necessary to maintain internal consistency, amendments to other elements of
the General Plan will be processed concurrently with future Housing Element
amendments.
Government Code §65302 requires that the Land Use Element be reviewed annually for
consistency with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state
Department of Water Resources (DWR) flood hazard maps, and that amendments to the
Safety and Conservation Elements that are required to address flood hazard issues be
adopted upon the first amendment to the Housing Element after January 1, 2009. The
City will comply with these requirements prior to or concurrent with Housing Element
adoption.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                            II. Housing Needs Assessment
II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size,
household income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g.,
number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally,
the City’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2014-2021 Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent available data from the U.S.
Census, the California Department of Finance (DOF), the California Employment
Development Department (EDD), the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) and other relevant sources. Supplemental data were obtained through field
surveys and from the California Department of Finance.
A.      Overview
The City of Manhattan Beach is located within the southwestern coastal portion of Los
Angeles County in what is commonly referred to locally as the "South Bay" area (Figure
1). To the north is the City of El Segundo, to the east is Redondo Beach and the City of
Hawthorne, to the south is Hermosa Beach, and on the west the Pacific Ocean. The City
has a total land area of 2,017 acres (3.15 square miles).
The City is made up of several distinct neighborhoods which are grouped into "planning
areas" that reflect the City's unique and varied environment (Figure 2). These planning
areas are as follows:
      •     Beach Area - This area contains most of the City's multi-family rental housing.
            Lots in this area are small with generally less than 3,000 square feet, and
            parking for residents and visitors is in short supply (Figure II-3). The General Plan
            calls for the maintenance and enhancement of the "Village” atmosphere
            within the downtown commercial district. The City’s goal is to promote the
            preservation of the small specialty retail and service activities that serve both
            visitors to the beach and local residents while also encouraging mixed-used
            residential/commercial development.
      •     Hill Section - This area consists primarily of single-family residential
            development, with commercial and higher-density residential development
            limited to Sepulveda Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard (Figure II-4).
            The City's General Plan promotes the maintenance of single-family
            neighborhoods. Higher-density, multiple-family residential development is
            directed to those parcels located on either side of Manhattan Beach
            Boulevard, which is already developed with a mix of commercial and multi-
            family residential uses.
      •     East-Side/Manhattan Village - This includes all of the City's land area located
            east of Sepulveda Boulevard, and a large proportion of the City's commercial
            and residential uses are within this area. The City's land use policy calls for the
            preservation of the existing character of the residential neighborhoods
            located in the areas. Medium-and high-density residential development is
                                                II-1                                  February 2014

         located along Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and in areas
         adjacent to Manhattan Intermediate and Meadows schools, which are
         designated exclusively for multiple-family residential development (Figure II-5).
         Manhattan Village includes a substantial amount of regional commercial and
         office development as well as a significant number of condominium units.
    •    Tree Section – This is the portion of the City located to the east of Grand
         Avenue and northwest of Valley Drive. The area will remain almost exclusively
         single-family residential under the policies contained in the General Plan
         (Figure II-6). A small portion of the area adjacent to Sepulveda Boulevard is
         designated for commercial uses.
    •    El Porto – This area was formerly the unincorporated community of El Porto and
         is located north of 38th Street between the ocean and the City of El Segundo.
         The area is developed with a mix of residential and commercial uses. El Porto
         has the highest residential development intensities found in the City (Figure II-
         7). The General Plan protects the mix of multi-family and commercial
         development presently existing in this area.

       2.     Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and
housing preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the city and county population
by age group in 2010. This table shows that the age distribution of the city’s population is
older than Los Angeles County as a whole, with Manhattan Beach’s population having a
median age about six years older than Los Angeles County. An aging population has
implications regarding the type and size of future housing needs, as well as accessibility.

       3.     Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the city differs from the county in that a lower
proportion of city residents are Hispanic/Latino or other racial minorities. Approximately
79% of city residents are non-Hispanic white, contrasted with 28% for the county as a
whole. The percentage of Hispanics residing in the city, at 7%, is significantly lower than
that of the county with 48% Hispanic/Latino. Asians, at 8.5%, represent the largest non-
Hispanic minority (Table II-3).

C.     Household Characteristics
       1.      Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Manhattan Beach had 14,038 households as reported in the 2010 Census. Table II-4
provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Los Angeles County as a
whole. Family households in 2010 comprised approximately 63% of all households in the
city, 5% less than the county. The city’s average household size is also lower than Los
Angeles County as a whole (2.50 persons per household City vs. 2.98 persons per
household for the county). These statistics suggest that there is less need for large units in
Manhattan Beach than in other areas of the county.

        2.         Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities strive to have an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for
sale in order to accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes
and composition, and lifestyles. Table II-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in 2010 as compared to the county as a
whole. This table reveals a higher level of home ownership in the city, approximately 18
percentage points higher than the county.

        3.       Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 residents per room. Overcrowded households are usually a
reflection of the lack of affordable housing (see Section E.4 starting on page II-22 below
for a detailed definition of “affordable” housing). Table II-6 summarizes recent
overcrowding data for the City of Manhattan Beach as reported by the Census Bureau.

Based on U.S. Census standards, Manhattan Beach residents live in relatively less
crowded housing conditions than the rest of Los Angeles County. Recent Census data
indicate that there were only 0.4% overcrowded owner-occupied units and 0.9%

overcrowded renter-occupied units in Manhattan Beach. In the county, however, 1.4%
of the owner-occupied units and about 18% of renter-occupied units are considered
overcrowded.
        4.      Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community – the
ability of residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to
recent Census data, the median household income in Manhattan Beach was $132,752,
more than double that of Los Angeles County (Table II-7).

        5.      Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-8 displays recent estimates for overpayment by tenure.
According to SCAG, approximately 86% of lower-income renter households and 64% of
lower-income owner households were overpaying for housing. The highest rates of
overpayment were among very-low- and extremely-low-income households.
Although homeowners enjoy interest and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For

D.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.        Employment
Employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing needs
during this planning period. Table II-9 shows that the city had a workforce of 18,173
persons, or approximately 68% of the working-age population, as reported by recent
Census data. This table also shows that the city’s population has a higher participation in
the workforce than the county (68% city vs. 65% county).

  Notes:
      (A) Self-Employed persons work for profit or fees in their own business, profession, trade, or farm. Only the unincorporated self-employed are
             included in this category. The estimated and projected employment numbers include all workers who are primarily self-employed and wage and
             salary workers who hold a secondary job as a self-employed worker.
      (B) Unpaid family workers are those persons who work without pay for 15 or more hours per week on a farm or in a business operated by a member
             of the household to whom they are related by birth or marriage.
      (C) Private household workers are employed as domestic workers whose primary activities are to maintain the household. Industry employment is
             based on QCEW.
      (D) Temporary U.S. Census workers are included in the base and projected year employment numbers.
According recent Census data, about 93% of employed Manhattan Beach residents
worked in Los Angeles County, but only 24% of all workers were employed within the city
limits (Table II-12).

E.     Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined by the Census Bureau as a house,
apartment, mobile home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if
vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
       1.      Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2012, 77% of the city’s housing stock was comprised of single-family units, while
multi-family units comprised 23% of the total. Mobile homes comprised the remaining
0.1%. Table II-13 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type along with growth
trends for the city compared to the county as a whole for the period 2000-2012.

Between 2000 and 2012, the city had a net decrease of 116 units due to the demolition
and replacement of older units. The decrease in units included single family units (10),
multi-family units (87) and mobile homes (19).

        2.     Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors
opening and closing.
Table II-14 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Manhattan Beach
compared to Los Angeles County as a whole as reported in recent Census data.

This table shows that 59% of the housing units in Manhattan Beach were constructed prior
to 1970. These findings suggest that there may be a need for maintenance and
rehabilitation, including remediation of lead-based paint, for a large percentage of the
city’s housing stock. However, due to the city’s high household incomes, market forces
would be expected to encourage more private maintenance, rehabilitation, and lead
paint remediation, as compared to lower-income communities.
Housing in the City of Manhattan Beach is generally in quite good condition. Due to the
desirability of beach area real estate, units that become dilapidated are usually
purchased and rebuilt. Further, the City of Manhattan Beach maintains an active code
enforcement program, thus reducing the potential for perpetuation of substandard
conditions. The City’s most recent survey (2003) indicated 55 units in need of repair.
However, these units were all capable of rehabilitation. Based on the field observations
of Building and Code Enforcement staff, this estimate is believed to still be representative
of housing conditions in the City.
                                                              II-20                            February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                            II. Housing Needs Assessment
The following categories were considered in the survey:
        Category 1: Substandard; rehabilitation would not be economical, and
        replacement is recommended. A total of 11 units were identified in this category.
        Category 2: Major repair needed, but economically feasible to rehabilitate. A
        total of 16 units were identified in this category.
        Category3: Moderate repair needed (painting, landscaping, minor repairs). A
        total of 28 units were identified in this category.
        Category 4: Structurally sound with little or no repairs needed. The balance of the
        housing units in the City were included in this category.
Due to high property values in Manhattan Beach, property maintenance is generally
good and the percentage of units in need of substantial rehabilitation or replacement is
very low compared to most areas of Los Angeles County.
        3.       Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates as reported in the 2010 Census are shown in Table II-15. The table
shows that vacancy rates in the city were relatively low, with a rental vacancy rate of
5.3% and an owner vacancy rate of only 0.8%. The rental vacancy rate for the county as
a whole was higher, at 5.8%% for rental units and 1.7% for owner units. A rental vacancy
rate in the 5% range is considered a healthy market condition allowing for tenant
mobility. Rental vacancy rates in the 2% range indicate nearly full occupancy, and
contribute to upward pressures on rents.

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                 II. Housing Needs Assessment
        4.          Housing Cost
a.      Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”):
      •        Extremely-Low (30% or less of AMI),
      •        Very-Low (31-50% of AMI),
      •        Low (51-80% of AMI),
      •        Moderate (81-120% of AMI), and
      •        Above Moderate (over 120% of AMI).
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and
housing expenses. According to HUD and the California Department of Housing and
Community Development, housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is
no more than 30% of a household’s gross income. In some areas, these income limits may
be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table II-16 shows 2013 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices
for housing in Los Angeles County by income category. Based on state-adopted
standards, the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is
$640, while the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,068. The
maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1,708, while the maximum for
moderate-income households is $1,944.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table II-16 have been
estimated based on typical conditions.

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                             II. Housing Needs Assessment
b.       For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics reported by DataQuick Information Systems for the calendar
year 20121 showed median sales prices of $1.42 million for single-family homes and $1.18
million for condos in Manhattan Beach. Based on the estimated affordable purchase
prices shown in Table II-16, it is unlikely that any market rate homes or condos would be
affordable to lower- or moderate-income residents. These data illustrate the fact that in
beach communities, very large public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales
prices to a level that is affordable to low- and moderate-income buyers.
c.       Rental Housing
Based on a recent rental survey, the lowest advertised rents for 1- and 2-bedroom units in
Manhattan Beach were $1,100 and $1,950, respectively, while larger homes rented for up
to $12,000 per month. As would be expected in a desirable beach community in
Southern California, when market rents are compared to the amounts households can
afford to pay (Table II-16), it is clear that very-low- and extremely-low-income households
have a very difficult time finding housing without overpaying. At a rent of $1,950 per
month, the gap between market rent and affordable rent at the very-low-income level is
approximately $900 per month, while the gap at the extremely-low-income level is about
$1,300 per month.
F.       Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some residents
may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing
problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
         1.     Persons with Disabilities
The most recent available Census data found that approximately 1,758 people in
Manhattan Beach between the 16 and 64 years of age, or 7.5% of the working age
population, reported a work-related disability (Table II-17). Of those aged 65 and over,
17.7% reported some type of physical disability and 14.4% reported a disability that
affected their ability to go outside the home. Housing opportunities for persons with
disabilities can be improved through housing assistance programs and universal design
features such as widened doorways, wheelchair ramps, lowered countertops, single-level
units and ground floor units.

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
      •     Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
            and physical impairments;
      •     Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
      •     Is likely to continue indefinitely;
      •     Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
            areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language;
            c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or
            g) economic self-sufficiency;
      •     Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
            interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
            assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
            planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities as a separate category of
disability. According to the U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an
accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can
live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely
                                                           II-24                                                February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                 II. Housing Needs Assessment
disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The
most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where
medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to
an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four
developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Westside Regional
Center (WRC) located in Culver City (http://www.westsiderc.org/) provides services for
people with developmental disabilities in Manhattan Beach. The WRC is a private, non-
profit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of
services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
There is no charge for diagnosis and assessment for eligibility. Once eligibility is
determined, most services are free regardless of age or income. There is a requirement
for parents to share the cost of 24-hour out-of-home placements for children under age
18. This share depends on the parents' ability to pay. There may also be a co-payment
requirement for other selected services.
Regional centers are required by law to provide services in the most cost-effective way
possible. They must use all other resources, including generic resources, before using any
regional center funds. A generic resource is a service provided by an agency that has a
legal responsibility to provide services to the general public and receives public funds for
providing those services. Some generic agencies may include the local school district,
county social services department, Medi-Cal, Social Security Administration, Department
of Rehabilitation and others. Other resources may include natural supports. This is help
that disabled persons may get from family, friends or others at little or no cost. According
to the latest WRC Performance Report2, the Center served approximately 7,100
individuals during 2010.
In addition to the services provided by the WRC, City housing programs that respond to
the needs of this population include 5a (Incentives for Affordable Housing), 6a (Section 8
Rental Assistance) and 7d (Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing).
          2.     Elderly
According to recent Census data, there were 2,712 households (25% of owners but only
7% of renters) in Manhattan Beach where the householder was 65 or older (Table II-18).
Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.
The housing needs of this group can be addressed through smaller units, second units on
lots with existing homes, shared living arrangements, congregate housing and housing
assistance programs.

       3.      Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. According to recent Census data, approximately 53%
of owner households and 77% of renter households in Manhattan Beach had only one or
two members. Approximately 3% of renter households had five or more members, while
about 8% of owners were large households (Table II-19). This distribution suggests that the
need for large units with four or more bedrooms is expected to be much less than for
smaller units.

       4.      Female-Headed Households
Recent Census data reported that approximately 4% of owner households and 5% of
renter households in Manhattan Beach were headed by a female (Table II-20). A similar
number of owner households were headed by single men, while only 3% of renter
households were headed by single men in the city. While female-headed households
represent a small portion of households, they may have significant difficulties finding
affordable housing, particularly in expensive coastal areas.

         5.        Farm Workers
Farm worker households are considered a special needs group due to their transient
nature and the lower incomes typically earned by these households. Migrant workers,
and their places of residence, are generally located in close proximity to agricultural
areas providing employment. Although agriculture produces a total annual value of
approximately $278 million per year in Los Angeles County, no major agricultural activities
are found in Manhattan Beach or in the surrounding communities.3 As a result, there is
not a special need for farmworker housing in Manhattan Beach.
         6.        Homeless Persons
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines the term
“homeless” as the state of a person who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time
residence, or a person who has a primary night time residency that is:
       •      A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
              temporary living accommodations;
       •      An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
              be institutionalized; or
       •      A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
              sleeping accommodation for human beings.4
Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common are:
       •      Substance abuse and alcohol
       •      Domestic violence
       •      Mental illness

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                              II. Housing Needs Assessment
According to the 2013 Homeless Count Report5 by the Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority (LAHSA), it is estimated that 53,798 persons were homeless at the time of the
survey. Of this population, 24% were in shelter facilities, 42% were unsheltered and 34%
were estimated to be “hidden homeless.” Manhattan Beach is located within LAHSA’s
Service Planning Area (SPA) 8 – South Bay (see Figure II-2). The homeless count for SPA 8
found 5,245 single adults, 551 family members, and 15 unaccompanied youth. The
estimated total number of homeless persons in SPA 8 was approximately 14% lower than
the previous survey in 2011. There is no current information regarding the homeless
population in Manhattan Beach. The most recent homeless estimate for the city was in
2007 when the homeless population was estimated to be 87 persons. Since 2007, the
homeless estimate for SPA 8 has increased from 4,457 to 5,245 persons. Assuming that the
trend in homelessness in Manhattan Beach is similar to the entire SPA, the current
estimate of homeless in the City would be 102 persons.
Shelter and service needs of the homeless population are significantly different
depending on the population subgroup. Los Angeles County’s Continuum of Care
approach to homelessness is a coordinated and systematic local approach to meet the
needs of homeless individuals and families within these subgroups, including:
        •    Chronic Homeless Persons;
        •    Episodic Homeless Persons; and
        •    Persons at Risk of Becoming Homeless
The County’s focus is to provide funding for access to mainstream resources such as
income supports, health care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment
programs, child care, and job training placement.6 These resources serve the existing
homeless population, and also work toward the prevention of homelessness.
Senate Bill 2 of 2007 strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelter and
transitional/supportive housing. Unless existing shelter facilities are available to meet local
needs, jurisdictions must designate at least one zone where new shelters may be
established “by-right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other discretionary
approval). In 2013 the City amended the Municipal Code to address these new
requirements.
G.        Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
As part of the Housing Element update, state law requires jurisdictions to identify assisted
units that are at risk of conversion to market rate housing during the 10-year period 2013-
2023. According to the Southern California Association of Governments and the
California Housing Partnership Corporation, there are no units at risk in Manhattan Beach.
There is one assisted project in the city, Manhattan Village Senior Apartments, which has
a loan maturity date of 2037 and is not at risk of conversion.

H.      Low- and Moderate-Income Housing in the Coastal Zone
Government Code Section 65590 contains requirements for the replacement of low- and
moderate-income housing within the coastal zone when such housing is demolished or
converted to other uses, subject to certain limitations. In accordance with Government
Code §65590(b)(1), replacement housing is not normally required for the conversion or
demolition of a residential structure which contains less than three dwelling units, or, in
the event that a proposed conversion or demolition involves more than one residential
structure, the conversion or demolition of 10 or fewer dwelling units. The majority of
housing in the City’s Coastal Zone consists of multi-family housing. Government Code
§65590(b)(3) states that replacement housing must be provided only where feasible if
the local jurisdiction has less than 50 acres, in aggregate, of privately-owned vacant
land that is available for residential use. The City is built out and has only a nominal
amount of vacant land, well below the 50-acre threshold. Thus, the City has not had
occasion to administer the provisions of Section 65590, nor had occasion to maintain
records regarding the income level of past housing occupants. No low- or moderate-
income housing has been provided or required pursuant to Section 65590 in the City of
Manhattan Beach whether as replacement units or inclusionary units. This is primarily due
to existing land use patterns consisting of small lots that provide for only a few units on a
site. Since the City does not have the ability to construct or otherwise subsidize the
construction of new housing through redevelopment, it must rely on its existing incentives
to promote the development of affordable housing in the Coastal Zone.
I.      Future Housing Needs
        1.     Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA for the 5th Housing Element cycle quantifies the
anticipated need for housing within each jurisdiction for the period January 2014 to
October 2021. Communities then determine how they will address this need through the
process of updating the Housing Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) in October 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the
forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a
child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors – household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.

III.     RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A.       Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and
potential redevelopment opportunities has been prepared and is described in
Appendix B. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table III-1 below. The table
shows that the city’s land inventory exceeds the RHNA allocation of 38 units for this
planning period.
As discussed in Appendix B, the requirement to demonstrate availability of lower-income
sites is met through zoning that allows development or redevelopment of underutilized
sites at densities of at least 30 units/acre pursuant to Government Code Section
65583.2(c)(3)(B). The land inventory analysis in Appendix B contains an estimate of the
realistic capacity of potential sites for residential development at densities of 30
units/acre or greater. The analysis notes that high land values have resulted in extensive
“recycling” of small residential parcels to higher-density projects.

B.      Financial and Administrative Resources
        1.      State and Federal Resources
The Los Angeles Community Development Commission administers housing assistance
funds, including HOME Funds and Rental Assistance funds for the City of Manhattan
Beach which is a participating city in Housing Authority and Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) programs as a part of the Los Angeles Urban County program. The
City of Manhattan Beach did not have a redevelopment agency and therefore does
not have a successor agency or redevelopment funds for housing.
CDBG Funds
Beginning in the 1997-1998 Fiscal Year, the City of Manhattan Beach has traditionally sold
its allocation of CDBG funds to other participating cities in exchange for general funds.
For the 2012-2013 Fiscal Year, the City is exchanging $102,865 in CDBG funds with the City
of Hawaiian Gardens at sixty cents on the dollar for general fund monies in the amount
of $75,091.45. The City is providing funding for the following local social service providers:
        •   Care Management for Manhattan Beach Seniors (BCHD)- promotes optimal
            functioning of seniors to avoid the need to institutionalize fragile or at risk
            seniors, targeting the population 85 years of age or older.
        •   1736 Family Crisis Center- provides shelter for victims of domestic violence,
            including five women’s shelters for women and their children and an
            emergency youth shelter. The Center provides a 24-hour hot line and also
            offers legal services.
        •   South Bay Family Health Care Center- provides dental care to low and
            moderate income residents and the indigent.
        •   South Bay Center for Counseling-provides counseling to low and moderate
            income families, groups, and individuals.
        •   South Bay Children’s Health Center- provides counseling to at-risk youth
        •   Salvation Army-Senior Meals-Operation Sunshine- provides groceries to low
            income seniors.
        •   Project Touch- provides tutoring, counseling, and social services to at-risk youth.
        •   Cancer Support Community-provides psychological and social support
            services to cancer patients and their families.
        •   South Bay Adult Care Center- provides adult day care for seniors suffering from
            Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, frailty, etc.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
Landlords and tenants in Manhattan Beach may participate in the Section 8 Rental
Assistance Program, which assists eligible families to afford safe, decent, high-quality
rental housing. The Housing Authority of Los Angeles County (HACoLA) provides rental
assistance to over 20,000 households through this federal program.
                                                III-2                               February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                        III. Resources and Opportunities
The Section 8 Program is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), and tenants and rental units must meet limits on income and rental
rates, respectively.
Participants rent housing from private landlords and pay no more than 30% of income
toward rent. Very-low- and extremely-low-income tenants pay a smaller portion of
income toward rent. The Housing Authority utilizes federal funds to subsidize the
difference in monthly payments between households’ ability to pay and Fair Market
Rent. Owners, participants and the Housing Authority share in a three-way-partnership.
The Housing Authority’s responsibilities in administering the program include:
        •     Maintaining the waiting list;
        •     Determining eligibility , and level of assistance;
        •     Calculating rent portion;
        •     Conducting annual re-determinations; Briefing tenants on finding a rental unit;
        •     Contracting with owners; Ensuring that contracted unit rents are reasonable ;
              Conducting unit housing quality standard inspections;
        •     Ensuring tenant and owner compliance with program rules (and terminating
              contracts and assistance if necessary);
        •     Making housing assistance payments to owners; and
        •     Processing assisted families moving into and out of the jurisdiction through
              portability.
          2.      Local Resources
As a small city, Manhattan Beach has very limited local resources for housing. Chapter V
describes the City’s programs to facilitate the development and rehabilitation of
housing.
C.        Energy Conservation Opportunities
As residential energy costs rise, the subsequent increasing utility costs reduce the
affordability of housing. Although the City is fully developed, new infill development and
rehabilitation activities could occur, allowing the City to directly affect energy use within
its jurisdiction.
State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings were established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce
California's energy consumption. The standards are codified in Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations and are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible
incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods. California's building
efficiency standards (along with those for energy efficient appliances) have saved more

than $56 billion in electricity and natural gas costs since 1978. It is estimated the
standards will save an additional $23 billion by 20137.
Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption of an “energy
budget” for all new residential buildings and additions to residential buildings. Separate
requirements are adopted for “low-rise” residential construction (i.e., no more than 3
stories) and non-residential buildings, which includes hotels, motels, and multi-family
residential buildings with four or more habitable stories. The standards specify energy
saving design for lighting, walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and
cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the
use of non-depleting energy sources, such as solar energy or wind power. The home
building industry must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan check and building
inspection processes.
In addition to state-mandated Title 24 requirements, Manhattan Beach is participating in
a coalition to collaboratively tackle the issue of energy conservation.8 The South Bay
Environmental Services Center (SBESC9) is educating residents, business owners and
public agencies and hosting or making available information about the energy
conservation programs, retrofits and incentives available in the community and how to
incorporate more energy-saving practices into everyday life. Established through funding
from the California Public Utilities Commission, the SBESC includes the 15 cities that
comprise the South Bay Cities Council of Governments (SBCCOG), and is associated with
Southern California Edison and Southern California Gas Company. Member cities include
Carson, El Segundo, Gardena, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach, Inglewood, Lawndale,
Lomita, Hermosa Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach,
Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Torrance, and the Harbor City and San Pedro
communities of Los Angeles.
The City of Manhattan Beach has adopted solar energy and wind energy ordinances to
facilitate their use, and has reduced building permit fees for solar energy systems. These
waivers are reviewed annually.
The City has adopted a water conservation ordinance and a water efficient landscape
ordinance that is consistent with state law. Drought-tolerant landscaping is required for
all new landscaping in connection with all projects regardless of size or tenancy.
The City adopted increased energy efficiency requirements (Tier 1) as part of the 2010
CalGreen Code. The City is participating in the Los Angeles County Energy Upgrade
Program so that residents and businesses can take full advantage of energy retrofit
programs per AB 811.
The City, in conjunction with the South Bay Environmental Service Center (SBESC) and
others, will continue to participate and host workshops on green building.
On May 31, 2012 the California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted new energy
efficiency standards for both residential and commercial buildings. The new standards

take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. The CEC’s 2013 Building Energy Efficiency Standards are 25
percent more efficient than previous standards for residential construction and 30
percent better for nonresidential construction.
Some of the changes to residential standards include:
     •    Solar-ready roofs to allow homeowners to add solar photovoltaic panels at a
          future date;
     •    More efficient windows to allow increased sunlight, while decreasing heat
          gain;
     •    Insulated hot water pipes to save water and energy and reduce the time it
          takes to deliver hot water;
     •    Whole house fans to cool homes and attics with evening air, reducing the
          need for air conditioning load; and
     •    Air conditioner installation verification to insure efficient operation.

Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the City’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Manhattan Beach General Plan Land Use Element includes three residential land use

In addition to the residential land use designations, residential or mixed-use development
is permitted in several commercial land use designations, as described below.
    •    The Downtown Commercial (CD) land use category applies only to the
         Downtown, an area of 40+ blocks that radiates from the intersection of
         Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Highland Avenue. Downtown provides
         locations for a mix of commercial businesses, residential uses with discretionary
         review, and public uses, with a focus on pedestrian-oriented commercial
         businesses that serve Manhattan Beach residents. Visitor-oriented uses are limited
         to low-intensity businesses providing goods and services primarily to beachgoers.
         Multi-family residential development is conditionally permitted according to the
         development standards for the High Density Residential district. The height limit in
         this district ranges from 26 feet to 30 feet depending on location.
    •    The Local Commercial (CL) land use category provides areas for neighborhood-
         oriented, small-scale professional offices, retail businesses, and service activities
         that serve the local community. Permitted uses are generally characterized by
         those which generate low traffic volumes, have limited parking needs, and
                                                                 IV-1                          February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                      IV. Constraints
        generally do not operate late hours. Residential uses are conditionally permitted
        at densities consistent with the High Density Residential category. The height limit is
        30 feet.
    •   The Mixed-Use Commercial land use category accommodates the parking needs
        of commercial businesses on small lots that front Sepulveda Boulevard and abut
        residential neighborhoods. In recognition of the need to ensure adequate parking
        for businesses and to protect residential uses from activities that intrude on their
        privacy and safety, this category limits commercial activity on commercial lots
        adjacent to residences and establishes a lower floor area factor (FAF) limit of 1.0:1
        for commercial uses. Uses permitted are similar to those allowed in the General
        Commercial category. Residential uses are conditionally permitted consistent with
        the Low Density Residential category and the D-6 Oak Avenue Zoning Overlay.
    •   Properties designated North End Commercial (CNE) lie at the north end of the
        City, along Highland Avenue and Rosecrans Avenue between 33rd and 42nd
        Streets. Commercial uses are limited to small-scale, low-intensity neighborhood-
        serving service businesses, retail stores, and offices. Restaurant and entertainment
        establishments are permitted only where zoning regulations can adequately
        ensure compatibility with residential uses. The maximum permitted FAF is 1.5:1.
        Residential uses are conditionally allowed at densities consistent with the High
        Density Residential category with a height limit of 30 feet.
The realistic capacity for new multi-family residential development in these commercial
districts is discussed in Appendix B.
The General Plan is not considered a constraint to the goals and policies of the Housing
Element as the City’s zoning is consistent with the General Plan and adequate sites with
appropriate densities have been identified to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation.
b.      Zoning Designations
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan
and are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents. The Zoning Code also helps to preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods, and provides for residential standards for four areas:
        Area District I – South of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and east of Valley/Ardmore.
        Area District II – North of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and east of Valley/Ardmore
        and Bell.
        Area District III – Coastal area south of Rosecrans.
        Area District IV – Coastal areas north of Rosecrans (El Porto).
General development standards for each area are summarized in Table IV-2.

Minimum lot standards and setbacks are typical of many areas of southern California,
and the three-foot minimum side yard setback is the minimum required to maintain
public safety and emergency access. A five-foot rear yard setback is relatively
conservative, compared to the 20-foot minimum often required in inland areas and in
other suburban areas.
The minimum required area per dwelling unit allows for a range of densities, up to 51
dwelling units per acre, as shown in Table IV-3.
                                                                       Table IV-3

The City's height limits allow a maximum height of 26 feet in single-family and medium-
density areas of Districts I and II and 30 feet in multi-family areas and in all parts of Districts
III and IV, which can accommodate three-story structures. In accordance with Municipal
Code Section 10.12.030, any increase in the height limit must be submitted to voters for
approval. Thus densities higher than the maximum 51 units per acre permitted would be
extremely difficult to achieve, due to the need for parking and the desire of the residents
for adequate living space. This limit is consistent with the repeatedly stated desires of the
citizenry to maintain a small-scale community and the capacity of area roadways to
serve development.
The City does not generally prescribe a minimum floor area per dwelling unit. Units as
small as 500 square feet currently exist in the City, primarily in El Porto and the northwest
area of the City. In accordance with Zoning Code Section 10.12.050 a minimum floor
                                                                             IV-3                                                             February 2014

area of 525 square feet per dwelling is required for units developed as part of a senior
housing complex.
Design Overlay Districts
In addition to zoning requirements for the base districts, the City has established seven
Design Overlay Districts which establish development standards specific to the unique
needs of each Overlay District. These Overlay Districts are as follows:
         D1 - Rosecrans Avenue, where higher fences in the front-yard setback area are
         needed to reduce traffic noise; in this Overlay District, front yard fences up to six
         feet in height may be constructed as close as three feet from the front or street
         side property line.
         D2 - Nine small lots totaling approximately 1.34 acres at 11th Street and Harkness,
         where limitations on building height and density are needed to minimize building
         bulk and buffer adjoining residences; high density residential uses in this area are
         limited to a maximum height of 26 feet and maximum density of one dwelling per
         1,800 square feet of lot area.
         D3 - Gaslamp neighborhood, a single-family neighborhood where special design
         standards and review procedures are needed to preserve existing neighborhood
         character;
         D4 - Traffic noise impact areas, where higher fences are needed to reduce traffic
         noise; fences up to eight feet in height are permitted.
         D5 - North End Commercial, where special design standards are needed for the
         north end commercial area to accommodate additional residential
         development;
         D6 - Oak Avenue, where special design standards, landscaping and buffering
         requirements for commercial uses are needed to allow commercial use of
         property in a residential area adjacent to Sepulveda Boulevard;
         D7 - Longfellow Drive area, including residential lots in Tract 14274 located on
         Longfellow Drive, Ronda Drive, Terraza Place, Duncan Drive and Kuhn Drive,
         where a special minimum lot area requirement of 17,000 square feet and
         restriction on subdivision is needed to preserve the character of the
         neighborhood, including views and privacy, and prevent unwanted impacts from
         increased traffic, bulk and crowding that would result from increased density.
Several of the Design Overlays, such as D1 and D4 are more permissive than the base
district, allowing higher walls closer to the property lines in order to provide protection
from excessive noise. Others such as Design Overlay D3 and D5 affect minor design issues
that would not be anticipated to constrain the delivery of additional housing. In fact,
Design Overlay D3 would act to preserve existing structures in areas subject to
“mansionization” pressures.
However, Design Overlay D2 would reduce the number of dwellings permitted on each
of the affected lots (AP # 4164-001-013 to 15; 4164-001-017&018; 4164-001-21; 4164-001-
032 to 036; 4164-001-039 to 044). Lots in this area are each approximately 6,500 square
                                               IV-4                               February 2014

feet. Base District requirements of 1,000 square feet per unit would permit six dwellings on
each lot for a total of 54 dwelling units. Under Design Overlay D2, only three dwellings
would be permitted on an individual lot for a total of 27 units, a 27-unit reduction in
maximum buildout. These regulations are consistent with the Covenants, Conditions and
Restrictions recorded at the time this tract was originally subdivided.
Design Overlay 7 increases minimum lot area from 7,500 square feet under the base
district to 17,000 square feet. Although this is a significant difference, at more than
double the lot size, the terrain in this area is such that higher density would be unlikely,
unless very costly landform modification were to be undertaken. Also these regulations
are consistent with the original private CC&Rs that were recorded at the time the tract
was originally subdivided.
Zoning for Affordable Multi-Family Housing
Lower-income housing can be accommodated in all zones permitting residential use in
Manhattan Beach. These may include second residential units in single-family zones and
multi-family apartments and condos in the RH zone, and commercial/residential mixed-
use developments in the CD, CL and CNE Zones. Under state law, the “default density”
presumed to be adequate to facilitate lower-income housing is 30 units/acre in
Manhattan Beach.
Exclusive residential development is allowed subject to the RH development standards in
the CD, CL and CNE commercial zones. The RH standards allow more building floor area
on a given parcel than the commercial development standards, therefore a strong
incentive is created for high density residential development in these commercial zones.
As noted in Table IV-3 above, the RH zone allows multi-family development at densities of
43.5 to 51 units/acre and therefore is considered suitable for lower-income housing under
state law10. The CD, CL and CNE commercial zones also allow densities greater than 40
units/acre. In order to encourage and facilitate the production of higher-density
affordable housing, the City also offers a graduated density incentive to encourage
consolidation of small lots.
Special Needs Housing
Under state law, persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities,
persons with disabilities, persons needing emergency shelter, transitional or supportive
housing, and low-cost single-room-occupancy units. The City’s regulations regarding
these housing types are discussed below.
       •     Housing for Persons with Disabilities
            State requirements. Health and Safety Code §§1267.8, 1566.3, 1568.08 require
            local governments to treat licensed group homes and residential care facilities
            with six or fewer residents no differently than other single-family residential uses.
            “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the operator’s family, or
            persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow these licensed care
            facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may not require licensed

         residential care facilities for six or fewer persons to obtain conditional use
         permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings.
         Residential Care, Limited is defined in Section 10.08.030.E of the Municipal
         Code as: “Twenty-four (24) hour non-medical care for six (6) or fewer persons in
         need of personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance essential for
         sustaining the activities of daily living. This classification includes only those
         services and facilities licensed by the State of California.” These facilities are a
         permitted use in all residential districts in conformance with state law.
         Residential Care, General is defined in Section 10.08.040.N of the Municipal
         Code as: “Twenty-four (24) hour non-medical care for seven (7) or more
         persons, including wards of the juvenile court, in need of personal services,
         supervision, protection, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of
         daily living. This classification includes only those services and facilities licensed
         by the State of California.” These facilities are conditionally permitted uses in
         the RH (High Density Residential), RPD (Residential Planned Development), RSC
         (Residential Senior Citizen), CG (General Commercial) and PS (Public and
         Semi-Public) districts subject to approval of a Use Permit by the Planning
         Commission. These regulations do not pose an unreasonable constraint on
         persons with disabilities.
         Reasonable Accommodation for Persons with Disabilities. The Municipal Code
         contains procedures for reviewing and approving requests for reasonable
         accommodation from persons with disabilities in conformance with state law.
         Definition of “Family”. Section 10.04.030 of the Municipal Code defines "Family"
         as “A single individual or two (2) or more persons living together as a single
         housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, provided that this shall not exclude the
         renting of rooms in a dwelling unit as permitted by district regulations.” This
         definition is consistent with state law and does not pose a constraint.
         Group Residential is defined in Section 10.08.030.C of the Municipal Code as:
         “Shared living quarters with not more than five (5) guest rooms and without
         separate kitchen or bathroom facilities for each guest room, and where either
         of the following apply:
             1. Lodging and meals for compensation are provided by pre-arrangement
             for definite periods for not more than nine persons, or
             2. Rooms, beds or spaces within the living quarters are rented to 10 or more
             individuals by pre-arrangement for definite periods.
         Shared living quarters with six or more guest rooms or where lodging and meals
         for compensation are provided for 10 or more persons shall be considered a
         Visitor Accommodation.”
         These regulations apply to group residential facilities that are not intended for
         persons with disabilities and are a conditional use in the RH (High Density
         Residential) and RSC (Residential Senior Citizen) districts. Use permits are

         Zoning Code.
         Parking requirements. Code requirements for off-street parking are as follows:
             Group residential:             1 per 2 beds; plus 1 per 100 sq. ft. used for
                                            assembly purposes
             Residential Care, Limited:     1 per 3 beds
             Residential Care, General:     1 per 3 beds; plus additional spaces, as
                                            specified by use permit
             Senior housing:                0.5 per unit, plus: 1 accessible and designated
                                            guest space/5 units, one space per non-
                                            resident employee and 1 (11′ w × 30′ l × 10′ h)
                                            loading area
             Residential hotels:            1.1 per room
         These requirements do not pose an unreasonable constraint to facilities for
         persons with disabilities.
    •     Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
         Senate Bill 2 of 2007 requires that emergency shelters be allowed by-right (i.e.,
         without discretionary review such as a conditional use permit) in at least one
         zoning district, subject to certain development standards. The Municipal Code
         allows emergency shelters by-right in the PS (Public and Semi-Public) and IP
         (Industrial Park) zones. These districts include vacant and underutilized parcels
         that could support emergency shelters, and also have good access to transit
         and other services.
         Transitional housing is longer-term housing, typically up to two years.
         Transitional housing generally requires that residents participate in a structured
         program to work toward established goals so that they can move on to
         permanent housing. Residents are often provided with an array of supportive
         services to assist them in meeting goals. Under SB 2 transitional and supportive
         housing is deemed to be a residential use subject only to the same
         requirements and standards that apply to other residential uses of the same
                                             IV-7                                February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                            IV. Constraints
                type in the same zone. The Municipal Code allows transitional and supportive
                housing consistent with state law.
        •        Single Room Occupancy
                 Section 10.08.050.CC.2 of the Municipal Code defines Residential Hotels as
                 “Buildings with six (6) or more guest rooms without kitchen facilities in individual
                 rooms, or kitchen facilities for the exclusive use of guests, and which are
                 intended for occupancy on a weekly or monthly basis.” Residential hotels are
                 similar to SRO facilities and are conditionally permitted in CG (General
                 Commercial) district.
c.         Off-Street Parking Requirements
The provision of parking is needed to satisfy the requirements of the Zoning Code and
resident needs. In addition, the California Coastal Commission has repeatedly expressed
the need to preserve public parking for visitor serving uses, which can sometimes be
affected by new development. A reduction in parking below two parking spaces per
dwelling unit could potentially result in impacts on existing public parking. City parking
requirements are shown in Table IV-4. As can be seen from this table, parking
requirements are most stringent for larger units and least stringent for smaller, more
affordable units.
                                                             Table IV-4
                                                Residential Parking Requirements

                                                               per condominium unit and 0.25 guest parking spaces per apartment
                                                               unit in complexes of four or more units.

d.         Accessory and Second Units
Section 65852.2 of the California Government Code requires local governments to permit
second units subject to certain limitations in single-family and multi-family residential
zones. The City does not currently have a second unit ordinance; therefore the provisions
of state law apply. Program 5e (Chapter 5) includes a commitment to process an
amendment to the Municipal Code to establish regulations and procedures for second
units in conformance with state law.
e.         Density Bonus
Under state law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a density increase up
to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the Municipal
                                                                  IV-8                                                  February 2014

Code and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of equivalent financial
value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to
low- or moderate-income households. The Zoning Code was updated in 2013 to include
density bonus regulations in conformance with current state law.
f.      Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on
site, thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the
installation of mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also
declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and
zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile
home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
Mobile or manufactured homes are considered to be single-family or multi-family units
depending on the structure configuration and are permitted in all residential zones,
subject to applicable development standards.
g.      Condominium Conversions
The LCP includes provisions related to condominium conversion, senior citizen housing,
and loss of affordable housing in the coastal zone. Regarding condominium conversion,
the LCP provides that:
            “The City shall continue to maintain, at a minimum, the present restrictive
            conditions for condominium conversion, within the coastal zone. This will allow
            only buildings which meet current standards to be converted to
            condominiums, thus preserving many units for privately-owned, affordable
            rental units.”
Section 10.88.070 of the Municipal Code and Section A.88.070 of the LCP also contain
requirements regarding tenant notification, right to purchase, tenant purchase discounts,
relocation expenses, and tenant discounts when condominiums are converted. Provision
is made for lifetime leases for non-purchasing elderly or medically disabled tenants. In
addition, low- and moderate-income tenants and those with children are provided with
an extended relocation period. In evaluating requests for condominium conversion, the
Planning Commission must consider the impact of tenant displacement, with emphasis
on existing low- and moderate-income tenants under Section 10.88.080 of the MBMC
and Section A.88.080 of the LCP.
h.      Building Codes
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such charges to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed. The City has adopted the 2010 California Building Code, with
appropriate amendments to address local geological and topographic considerations.
                                             IV-9                               February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                        IV. Constraints
i.      Coastal Zone
Section 65590 of the California State Government Code requires the inclusion of low- or
moderate- income housing in new residential development in the Coastal Zone where
feasible. Due to land costs, it would not be feasible to provide low- or moderate-income
housing on single-family or small multi-family lots within the city’s Coastal Zone without
very large subsidies. There are no large vacant lots available for housing complexes
which would accommodate large numbers of dwelling units within the Coastal Zone.
However, significant development opportunities exist within the Coastal Zone on
underutilized commercial properties in the CD, CNE and CL zones.
The City of Manhattan Beach has a certified Local Coastal Program (LCP). The LCP was
certified by the California Coastal Commission in 1994 and therefore the City is able to
issue its own coastal permits. The LCP addresses three primary issue areas: public access,
locating and planning for new development, and the preservation of marine-related
resources. The LCP includes a number of policies that will affect the ability to develop
new housing within the coastal areas of the City. These include policies related to the
preservation of beach access, the provision of adequate parking (including requiring
adequate off-street parking to be provided in new residential development) and
controlling the types and densities of residential development within the Coastal Zone
Those coastal policies related to residential development within the Coastal Zone include
the following:
        1. Policy II.B.1: Maintain building scale in Coastal Zone residential neighborhoods
        consistent with Chapter 2 of the Implementation Plan.
        2. Policy II.B.2: Maintain residential building bulk control established by
        development standards in Chapter 2 of the Implementation Plan.
        3. Policy II.B.3: Maintain Coastal Zone residential height limit not to exceed 30 feet
        as required by Sections A.04.030 and A.60.050 of Chapter 2 of the Implementation
        Plan.
        4. Policy II.B.4: The beach shall be preserved for public beach recreation. No
        permanent structures, with the exception of bikeways, walkways, and restrooms,
        shall be permitted on the beach.
At the same time, the City seeks to process permits in the Coastal Zone as efficiently as
possible. As noted above, certification of the City’s Local Coastal program allows the
City to process coastal permits locally, saving the time and expense of a separate
Coastal Commission approval.
        2.      Development Processing Procedures
a.      Residential Permit Processing
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits
while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
                                              IV-10                                February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
The permit review and approval process for single- and multi-family residential
developments is described below.
        Single-Family Development
Single-family development on a previously subdivided lot is a straightforward process. A
building permit application is submitted and plans are reviewed by the City to assure
compliance with City laws and standards, including planning and zoning standards such
as building height and setbacks. Building permits are issued administratively and do not
require a public hearing. The City does not have any separate design review process. If a
project is located in the Coastal Zone, a Coastal Development Permit (CDP) is also
required. Administrative CDP approval by the Director is required for any new single-
family residence and multi-family residence (excluding remodels and additions), in the
non-appealable area of the Coastal Zone. In the appealable area of the Coastal Zone,
administrative CDP approval by the Director is required for any new single-family and
multi-family residence as well as an increase of 10 percent or more of the internal floor
area of the existing structure or the construction of an additional story or increase in
building height of more than 10 percent. Any project located within the Coastal Zone
compares similarly to a regular plan check located outside the Coastal Zone, with no
extra requirements and findings. The City’s Local Coastal Program has been certified by
the California Coastal Commission. Therefore, the City processes its own Coastal Permits,
saving time and money for applicants since they do not need to seek separate approval
from the California Coastal Commission. Processing time for a CDP is typically 6-8 weeks.
Single-family subdivisions and condominiums require approval of a subdivision map.
Condominium projects with 3 or more units require approval of a Use Permit. The typical
time required is 3-4 months for review and approval for projects requiring a Use Permit.
        Multi-Family Development
Multi-family projects with 5 units or less are approved with an Administrative Site
Development Permit (approved by the Director with no public hearing). Multi-family
developments with 6 or more units require Site Development Permit approval by the
Planning Commission. The typical time required for review and approval of an
Administrative Site Development Permit is 6-8 weeks, while the processing time for a Site
Development Permit is typically 2-3 months.
Both the Administrative SDP and the Planning Commission SDP review processes are
limited to confirming that the project complies with applicable development standards
and does not examine the appropriateness of the use itself.
b.      Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all discretionary development projects under the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Most projects in Manhattan Beach are
either Categorically Exempt or require only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration.
Developments that have the potential of creating significant impacts that cannot be
mitigated require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report. Most residential
projects require a Negative Declaration and take an additional three to four weeks to
complete. Categorically Exempt developments such as second residential units require a
                                           IV-11                               February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  IV. Constraints
minimal amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental review does not
pose a significant constraint to housing development.
        3.     Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
Fees are charged by the City to cover processing costs and staff time and also to defray
the cost of providing public services and facilities to new developments. By State law,
fees cannot exceed costs to the City generated by the activity for which the fee is
assessed. Permit processing and impact fees are described below.
    Permit Processing Fees
For non-discretionary projects that do not require a hearing, a permit fee of $560 is
assessed. In cases involving land subdivision, such as a condominium project, a tract
map must be approved. Map fees range from $915 if no public hearing is needed up to
$3,325 for a map with four or fewer parcels. For a larger map the fee would be $1,075 if
there is also another discretionary application such as a Use Permit or Variance and
$4,080 if there is only the map. Condominium projects requiring a use permit (2-unit
condos are exempt) are assessed a $5,200 fee.
    Impact Fees
In addition to permit processing fees, developments are subject to impact fees to help
fund the cost of providing public services and facilities. Water and sewer fees are
necessary to ensure that these services will be available to serve new developments. For
single-family or condo developments, $1,817 per dwelling unit is assessed for park
purposes in accordance with the Quimby Act. Multi-family rental projects are exempt
from park fees. In accordance with Chapter 10.90 of the Municipal Code, the City
charges a fee for art in public places. The fee is equal to one percent of the building
valuation and is not assessed on residential projects of fewer than four units. The City
does not charge a traffic impact fee. While these fees are not insubstantial, they
constitute only about 2% of the value of a typical owner-occupied residence and about
1.5% of the total value of a multi-family apartment. In accordance with Municipal Code
Section 10.52, Affordable Housing Incentive Program, fees may be waived if the
applicant agrees to meet certain affordability standards.
The following table summarizes processing fees and impact fees for typical single-family
and multi-family developments.

The City requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to
serve their projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility
extensions, street construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably
related to the project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a
project for rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent
with the Subdivision Map Act.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements, including street improvements and other public works projects, to
facilitate the City’s continued development according to the City’s General Plan. The
CIP helps to ensure that construction of public improvements is coordinated with private
development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.          Non-Governmental Constraints
            1.          Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, or sensitive biological habitat. In many cases, development of these areas is
constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA floodplain regulations, the Clean

designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to protect public safety
Environmentally sensitive areas are generally zoned and protected as parklands.
However, a significant portion of the City is within the Coastal Zone wherein impacts to
coastal resources are always of concern. In addition, portions of the city are located on
moderately steep hillsides and some areas are subject to liquefaction. While policies
constrain residential development to some extent, they are necessary to support other
public policies.
       2.     Infrastructure Constraints
Roadways in Manhattan Beach are subject to high levels of traffic which would be
exacerbated by increased development. Much of this traffic is cut through traffic over
which the City has no control, a particular problem on such north/south arterials as
Sepulveda Boulevard. This traffic affects both the ability of the City to intensify
development and the desirability of residential use of parcels along major streets.
Other infrastructure issues relate primarily to the age of the infrastructure, rather than
capacity. In the coastal area of the City, terra cotta sewer lines are deteriorating.
Domestic water discoloration occurs from time to time in the beach area due to the use
of iron pipes. At the southerly end of the City, along Sepulveda Boulevard, elevation
differences between the area and the reservoir result in water pressure problems on
occasion. Therefore intensification of water consuming development at the southerly
end of the City could be a problem. However, this area has no vacant sites and
additional housing in this area would consist primarily of scattered second units which
would not be anticipated to result in any significant increase in demand for water or
sewer services. Water and sewer capacity are adequate to provide service for the larger
numbers of units anticipated in the downtown area and Manhattan Village.
       3.     Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and the downturn in the housing market
following the 2008 mortgage crisis had a negative effect on property values. Real estate
professionals have reported that sales and property values are now recovering, however.
In Manhattan Beach there is no vacant developable land, therefore all new residential
development occurs on underutilized sites where existing structures must be removed.
This added site preparation cost significantly increases the effective land cost and overall
cost of development. In addition, land cost varies widely depending on proximity to the
beach and whether ocean views are available. Per-unit land cost is directly affected by
density – higher density allows the cost to be spread across more units, reducing the total
price. Most new residential development in the City consists of one to two units per lot,
and recent trends indicate redevelopment projects have been maximizing density.
       4.     Construction Costs
Residential construction costs are estimated by the Community Development
Department at $200 per square foot and higher, usually due to the type of construction
and amenities desired by the developer in this market. Construction cost is affected by
                                             IV-14                              February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                           IV. Constraints
the price of materials, labor, development standards, and general market conditions.
The City has no influence over materials and labor costs, and the building codes and
development standards in Manhattan Beach are not substantially different from other
cities in the South Bay area. Since most development consists of private redevelopment
where impact fees and major infrastructure or offsite improvements are typically not
required, it is likely that costs are lower than in many cities.
        5.       Cost and Availability of Financing
Manhattan Beach is similar to most other communities with regard to private sector
home financing programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the
availability of real estate loans, although the long-term effects are unpredictable. For
buyers with good credit histories, mortgages can be obtained at very favorable interest
rates, which currently are in the range of 4.5% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the city.
C.      Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. Fair housing issues
are addressed in Manhattan Beach through coordination with fair housing organizations
to process complaints regarding housing discrimination and to provide counseling in
landlord/tenant disputes. Anti-discrimination resource materials (handouts, booklets,
pamphlets, etc.) are made available to the public at City Hall, the library, and on the
City’s website through links to the Housing Rights Center (see Program 7a in Chapter V -
Housing Plan).

V.      HOUSING PLAN
A.      Goals, Policies and Programs
The previous chapters of this Housing Element describe existing conditions in the City
relative to housing, and identified needs, resources, opportunities and constraints that
affect the City’s ability to meet its housing needs. This chapter articulates City goals,
policies and programs intended to address identified needs.
GOAL I.     Preserve existing neighborhoods.
The City is made up of several distinct neighborhoods, some of which were originally
established in the early 1900s. The neighborhoods each contribute to the small-town feel
of the community and reflect the City's unique and varied environment. They include the
following, which are described in more detail in the Community Profile chapter:
    1) The Beach Area, containing most of the City's multi-family rental housing, which is
        developed on small lots and offers a village atmosphere;
    2) The Hill Section consisting primarily of single-family residential development on slightly
        larger lots, with commercial and higher-density residential development limited to
        Sepulveda Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard;
    3) East-Side including single-family residential uses and a large proportion of the City's
        commercial and residential uses within this area;
    4) Manhattan Village which includes a substantial amount of regional commercial and
        office development as well as a significant number of single-family homes and senior
        housing.
    5) The Tree Section which is the single-family area east of Bell Avenue and northwest of
        Valley Drive as well as senior housing; and
    6) El Porto, a formerly unincorporated community providing a mix of high-density
        residential and commercial uses.
The City has long been committed to the maintenance and preservation of its residential
neighborhoods.
Policy 1. Preserve the scale of development in existing residential neighborhoods.
Program 1a. Continue to enforce provisions of the Zoning Code which specify District
                Development Regulations for height, lot coverage, setbacks, open space,
                and parking.
Section 10.12.030 of the MBMC establishes standards to avoid “mansionization,” including
increased setback and open space requirements for new single-family residences. The
additional open space must be provided in areas adjacent to streets or in areas that
create useable open space. Open space may be provided above the second story,
encouraging structures to be built to less than maximum height thereby reducing the
mass of homes. The mansionization ordinance also establishes maximum lot sizes in
residential districts as follows:
                                                V-1                                 February 2014

          District                                                            Maximum Lot
          I - Hill Section; Ardmore east, Manhattan Beach Blvd. south         15,000 sq. ft.
          II -Tree Section; Ardmore/Blanche east, Manhattan Beach Blvd. south 10,800 sq. ft.
          III - Beach area                                                    7,000 sq. ft.
          IV - El Porto                                                       7,000 sq. ft.
Generally, properties in the Medium and High Density Residential zones that are
developed with three or more units are exempt from the stricter requirements in order to
encourage multi-family development.
Section 10.64.030 of the MBMC requires additional enclosed parking for larger
residences. Three enclosed parking spaces are required for residences that exceed
3,600 square feet in floor area, whereas residences smaller than 3,600 square feet only
need to provide two spaces. Only one space is required for multi-family units with less
than 550 square feet.
These provisions act to discourage construction of overly large dwellings that are out of
scale with the surrounding neighborhood. In addition to issues of scale, the large
dwellings are also more costly, and lead to increased pressure to demolish modest
dwellings in favor of lavish structures affordable only to the most affluent.

Program 1b. Continue to apply the Design Overlay as provided under Section 10.44 of
                   the Municipal Code, as appropriate.
This section of the Code provides a mechanism for establishing specific development
standards and review procedures for certain areas of the City with unique needs,
consistent with General Plan policies, taking into consideration the unique nature of a
given neighborhood. Seven sub-districts have been established:
    D1) Rosecrans Avenue, where higher fences in the front-yard setback area are
         needed to reduce traffic noise;
    D2) 11th Street, where limitations on building height and density are needed to
         minimize building bulk and buffer adjoining residences;
    D3) Gaslamp neighborhood, where special design standards and review procedures
         are needed to preserve existing neighborhood character;
    D4) Traffic noise impact areas, where higher fences are needed to reduce traffic
         noise;
    D5) North end commercial, where special design standards are needed to
         accommodate additional residential development;
    D6) Oak Avenue, where special design standards, landscaping and buffering
         requirements are needed to allow commercial use of property in a residential
         area adjacent to Sepulveda Boulevard;
                                                              V-2                               February 2014

    D7) Longfellow Drive area, including residential lots in Tract 14274 located on
          Longfellow Drive, Ronda Drive, Terraza Place, Duncan Drive and Kuhn Drive,
          where a special minimum lot area requirement and restriction on subdivision is
          needed to preserve the character of the neighborhood, including views and
          privacy.

    Objective:         Preserve neighborhood character citywide.
Program 1c. Refrain from approval of lot mergers that would result in a reduction in the
                number of residences allowed.
Many homes have been constructed on double lots. The City has permitted the
underlying subdivision to remain, in order that separate homes may potentially be built
on each of the underlying lots. In accordance with Zoning Code Section 10.52.050,
accessory structures ancillary to a primary residence may be constructed on an
adjacent lot in common ownership without processing a lot merger. Similarly, the City will
not require that lots be merged when schools, churches or other similar public assembly
uses are constructed on multiple lots. In addition, the maximum lot standards noted
above would prevent consolidation of very large lots. This will preserve opportunities for
future housing units that would otherwise be lost if lots were consolidated.

    Funding:           City General Fund
    Schedule:          On-going
    Objective:         Preserve neighborhood character citywide
Policy 2. Preserve existing dwellings.
Program 2a. Allow non-conforming dwellings to remain and improve.
Under Zoning Code Section 10.68, the development process for improvements to smaller
non-conforming residential structures has been streamlined.            Exceptions may be
approved administratively to allow additions to non-conforming structures that will not
result in total structures in excess of 66 percent of the maximum floor area in Districts III
and IV or 75 percent of the maximum floor area in Districts I and II, or 3,000 square feet,
whichever is less.
Non-conforming dwellings may also be improved while maintaining non-conforming,
existing parking. For dwellings with less than 2,000 square feet of floor area, only one
enclosed parking space is required.
The non-conforming dwellings to be preserved tend to be smaller and less costly than
newer housing in the community. The preservation and improvement of these units will
maintain the pool of smaller units which might otherwise be demolished to make way for
larger, more costly housing.

    Schedule:          On-going
    Objective:         Preserve smaller, more affordable housing units
Program 2b. Utilize Community Development Block Grant funds or exchange funds for
               home improvement loans for low-income residents, consistent with income
               limits provided for such funding, and pursue additional sources of funding
               for City programs.
CDBG funds are exchanged for unencumbered General Funds, which are granted to
local public service agencies who provide services for low- and moderate-income
residents as well as elderly, disabled, and abused residents. Services include counseling,
shelter referral, dental care, case management and groceries for seniors. This allows the
City to exceed the 15 percent limit on a locality's CDBG funds that may be passed on to
such social service providers.
A large proportion of very-low- and low-income homeowners pay over half their income
on housing, leaving little for home maintenance or improvement. Many homeowners in
the City could not afford to purchase their homes at currently prices, and are "house rich
and cash poor," which is not unusual for the region. Long-time residents would be
expected to have decades-old mortgages with relatively low payments. Some may
have completed their mortgage payments. Thus, as they approach their retirement
years on a fixed income, they could continue to afford to live in their current residences.
However, major home repairs and rehabilitation could exceed limited budgets.
Under this program, a portion of CDBG funds could be utilized to provide small loans or
grants for rehabilitation of existing housing or utility under-grounding. Years ago, residents
showed little interest in such a program. However, the population has aged, leading to a
greater number of residents on fixed incomes. Before initiating any such program, the
City will attempt to establish whether interest exists through public solicitation of interest.
It would be important to assure residents of full confidentiality, in order not to deter
participation.

    Schedule:          Throughout the planning period.
    Objective:         Preserve/improve 16 low and moderate income units
GOAL II. Provide a variety of housing opportunities for all segments of the community
commensurate with the City’s needs, including various economic segments and special
needs groups.
There is considerable diversity in the types and densities of housing that comprise the
City's neighborhoods, with high-density multiple-family development found within the
coastal zone, and less dense single-family neighborhoods located further inland. A
substantial portion of the City’s population is over the age of 55, and housing policy must
consider the special needs of the aging population.

Policy 3. Provide adequate sites for new housing consistent with the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment and the capacity of roadways, sewer lines, and other infrastructure to
handle increased growth.
Program 3a. Continue to facilitate infill development in residential areas.
There are very few vacant residential parcels remaining in the City. Development of
scattered vacant and underutilized residential infill sites can help to address the need for
additional housing units to accommodate the City’s share of regional growth needs.

    Funding:           City General Fund
    Schedule:          On-going
    Objective:         Increase the supply of housing through infill development
Program 3b. Facilitate multi-family residential development in the CL, CD, and CNE
                commercial districts.
Provision of housing in commercial and mixed-use areas is a long-time (since 1993) City
housing policy. Under Section 10.16.020 of the Municipal Code, exclusive multi-family
residential uses are permitted upon the approval of a use permit in the Local
Commercial (CL), Downtown Commercial (CD), and North End Commercial (CNE)
Districts. Single-family residential development is permitted by-right in the North End
Commercial District if located on a site which (1) fronts on Crest Drive; or (2) on the rear
half of a site which fronts on Highland Avenue; or (3) on a site which fronts on the east
side of Highland Avenue between 38th Place to the south and Moonstone Street to the
north; or (4) on a site which does not abut Rosecrans Avenue or Highland Avenue;
otherwise a use permit is required.
Development of residential and mixed uses in commercial districts can facilitate the
delivery of housing. Not only does mixed-use development make additional areas
available for residential use, in a mixed-use project the provision of an accompanying
commercial use can help absorb some of the fixed costs of development, thereby
facilitating the production of lower-cost units. In addition, traffic congestion along with
energy consumption and air emissions can be reduced as residents are able to walk to
nearby commercial services. This can also enhance the viability of less thriving
commercial areas.
To enhance opportunities for residential development commensurate with the City’s
share of lower-income regional need of 16 units, the following incentives have been
established for affordable multi-family development within the Downtown Commercial,
Local Commercial, and North End Commercial districts:
1.      Owner-occupied and rental multi-family housing developments that qualify for a
        density bonus under Government Code Sec. 65915 are permitted within these
        districts subject only to a non-discretionary Precise Development Plan controlling
        project design. Projects with 5 units or less are reviewed by the Director and
        projects with 6 units or more are reviewed by the Planning Commission. Other non-
        affordable residential developments with 6 or more units within these zones will
        continue to require approval of a Site Development Permit (see also Program 5b).

                  consolidation using the City’s GIS system and property database;
             •    Provide a graduated density bonus for lower-income housing
                  developments that consolidate small parcels into a larger building site
                  according to the following formula:

                  concurrently with other planning entitlements for affordable housing
                  developments;
             •    Publicize the program on the City’s website, at the Planning counter, and
                  by notice to affordable housing providers.

The Manhattan Village area contains a mix of hotel, office, research and development,
retail, recreation and residential uses, including senior housing. The existing parking lot at
Parkview Avenue and Village Drive could accommodate up to 25 additional residential
units similar to the existing senior project. This site was identified as a potential housing
site in the 2003 Housing Element, consistent with the more general 1993 Housing Element
program calling for a mixture of uses in the Manhattan Village area.

otherwise maximum physical dimensions of the allowable building envelope are not
exceeded in mixed-use commercial/residential developments. Greater numbers of

smaller units could result, with likely occupants being young people and seniors wanting
easy access to commercial uses, particularly seniors who no longer feel comfortable
driving.
The review of development standards will also examine parking requirements for
residential and mixed-use developments in commercial districts. Under existing codes,
parking spaces located within the Downtown Commercial (CD) district may serve as
required parking for a nonresidential use located within the same district at a maximum
distance of 1,000 feet. No parking for commercial uses is required at all if the floor area
ratio does not exceed 1:1. The same is not permitted for residential uses. In order to
facilitate development of residential uses, residential and commercial uses could be
treated equally for parking purposes, if the residential units are a small size and the City
concludes that it does not burden the District.

To ensure adequate sites are available throughout the planning period to meet the
City’s RHNA, the City will continue to annually update an inventory that details the

accommodate the City’s RHNA.
To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained to accommodate the RHNA need,
the City will continue to implement project-by-project evaluation pursuant to
Government Code Section 65863. Should a development proposal result in a reduction
of yield below the residential capacity identified in the sites inventory, the City will identify
and zone sufficient sites to ensure no net loss in residential capacity.

Policy 4. Preserve the existing affordable housing stock
Program 4.      Regulate the conversion of rental housing to condominiums.
Section 10.88.080 of the Municipal Code requires that potential displacement of existing
tenants be taken into consideration when evaluating requests for conversion of existing
rental units to condominium status. In addition, under Section 10.88.070, tenants must be
given first right of refusal to purchase at discounted prices. Those tenants who do not

tenants must be provided life leases, with no rent increases for at least two years, and
low- and moderate-income tenants and families must be given at least one year to

Policy 5. Encourage the development of additional low- and moderate-income housing.
Program 5a. Provide incentives for housing affordable to low-income households and
                senior housing.
Section 10.52.090 of the Municipal Code provides for density bonus or other incentives
when low-income housing is provided, in accordance with Section 65915 of the
California Government Code. The housing must remain affordable for at least 30 years.
The City will continue to implement the Density Bonus ordinance in conformance with
state law.
     Responsibility: Community Development Department
     Funding:        City General Fund
     Schedule:       Ongoing implementation of the Density Bonus ordinance.
     Objective:      Additional affordable housing units commensurate with the City’s RHNA
                     allocation
Program 5b. Streamline the development process to the extent feasible.
The City currently allows and encourages concurrent processing of all discretionary
applications for a project, thereby streamlining the development process. Many routine
applications may be processed as minor exceptions instead of the longer and more
difficult variance process. As discussed in Chapter 4 regarding governmental constraints,
processing time for building permits in the City compares favorably with other nearby
jurisdictions. To minimize constraints to multi-family development, projects with up to 5
units are approved by the Director through an Administrative Site Development Permit
with no public hearing, and a Site Development Permit approved by the Planning
Commission is required for projects with more than 5 units. Both the Administrative SDP
and the Planning Commission SDP review processes are limited to confirming that the
project complies with applicable development standards and does not examine the
appropriateness of the use itself.
     Responsibility: Community Development Department
     Funding:        City General Fund
     Schedule:       Throughout the planning period.

Program 5c. Allow the establishment of manufactured housing on single-family
                residential lots.
Manufactured housing can be constructed for much less than the cost of traditional
building. Building various standardized modules in one location results in savings due to
economies of scale and greatly reduced waste of building materials. Factory-built
housing designed for placement on fixed foundations can be highly attractive and
virtually indistinguishable from standard construction. In addition, current factory-built
housing is typically built to higher standards for energy conservation.
In accordance with Section 10.52.100 of the Municipal Code, manufactured housing is
permitted on single-family lots not occupied by another dwelling. The housing must be
secured, must meet certain design criteria, and must be on a relatively flat slope. These
criteria are not unduly burdensome and would not prevent the establishment of
manufactured housing on residential lots.
    Responsibility:   Community Development Department
    Funding:          City General Fund
    Schedule:         Ongoing.
    Objective:        Continue to facilitate development of manufactured housing as a
                      means of reducing housing cost.
Program 5d. Work with the private sector to facilitate the provision of low-and moderate-
                priced housing.
This is a continuation and expansion of the Developer Consultation Program included in
the 2003 Housing Element. In the past, the City worked with the private sector to produce
two residential projects available to low- and moderate-income households. The
Manhattan Terrace development received a certificate of occupancy in July 1991. The
City approved a use permit to allow this senior citizen project at 3400 Valley Road. This
48-unit project contains 540-square-foot units with rents at affordable levels.
A 104-unit senior project was completed at Manhattan Village on Parkview Avenue in
1997. This project provides housing affordable to very-low- and moderate-income
households along with market-rate housing. The City approved a zoning amendment to
allow higher density and reoriented a City recreation facility in order to facilitate
development of the project.
To increase the likelihood of additional affordable housing development during the
planning period, the City will take the following actions:
       •    Assist developers in identifying suitable sites for affordable housing
       •    Provide fast-track processing
       •    Provide density       bonus,   modified    development      standards   and    other
            concessions
       •    Prioritize funding for projects that include extremely-low-income units
       •    Reduce development fees if feasible
       •    Provide administrative assistance with grant funding applications

                    the City’s RHNA allocation
Program 5e. Allow second units in residential areas.
Section 65852.2 of the California Government Code provides for the establishment of
second units subject to certain limitations as a means of increasing housing stock.
Absent a local ordinance specifying development standards, the provisions of State law
apply. The City does not currently have a local ordinance regarding second units,
therefore a Code amendment will be processed in conformance with state law.
    Responsibility: Community Development Department

Policy 6. Encourage means of increasing ability to afford existing housing stock.
Program 6a. Continue to participate in Los Angeles County Housing Authority programs,
               and publicize availability of Section 8 rental assistance for households in
               the City.
Section 8 rental assistance is provided by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) and is administered locally by the Los Angeles Community
Development Commission (CDC) operating as the Housing Authority of the County of Los
Angeles. Under this program, low-income households are provided the differential
between the rental rate of a unit and what they can afford. The rental rate cannot
exceed fair market rent for the area as established by HUD.

Program 7b. Provide for the housing needs of seniors.
The Manhattan Village Senior Villas, located at 1300 Park View Avenue, was first
occupied in 1997. This project consists of 104 senior housing apartments. As a condition of
the project's approval, 20% of the units must be reserved for very-low income households,
20% must be reserved for low-income households, and 40% of the units must be reserved
for moderate-income households. The remainder (20%) of the units may be rented at a
market-rate. The occupants of the senior housing project must consist of a householder
62 years of age or older, or 55 years of age or older if handicapped, according to criteria
established by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 or the Federal
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This program is concerned with ensuring that the current
affordability of the project is being maintained.
Implementation:       No additional funding and/or staffing will be required or are
anticipated with this program's continued implementation. The City will continue to
inform the public of this program.

Program 7c. Provide for the special needs of seniors so that they may remain in the
               community.
The Senior Care Management program provides services to predominantly low-income
seniors. This program is operated by a part-time Senior Services Care Manager who is
contracted through the Beach Cities Health District and the City of Manhattan Beach
Fire Department. At any given time, the Senior Services Program may assist up to 110
senior citizens, of whom 70% are low-income. As liaison and service coordinator, the
Senior Services Care Manager performs the following functions:
      1.   Locates suitable (often more affordable) housing. This may include referrals to
           "board and care" residential facilities in Manhattan Beach, or multi-family
           apartments;
      2.   Identifies financial assistance resources, including HUD Section 8 rental
           vouchers through Los Angeles County, and other federal assistance programs,

           discounts, weatherization services, and payment assistance.
As discussed above, it is suggested that a shared housing program also be established,
expanding responsibilities under No. 1 above. The City also provides funds for social
service groups serving seniors, including the Salvation Army brown bag food program,
Care Management for Manhattan Beach Seniors, and South Bay Adult Care Center.

Program 7e. Emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing.
The Zoning Code allows emergency shelters “by-right” subject to appropriate
development standards consistent with SB 2 in the Public & Semi-Public (PS) and Industrial
Park (IP) zones. These zones include vacant and underutilized parcels that could support
emergency shelters. Sites in this zone also have good access to transit and other services.
Transitional housing is defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2 as rental
housing for stays of at least six months but where the units are re-circulated to another
program recipient after a set period. Transitional housing may be designated for a
homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional housing that

                     monitored as part of the annual General Plan report.
GOAL III. Provide a safe and healthy living environment for City residents.
The City’s housing stock is generally in good condition, and the City has few heavy
industrial type uses. In the past, industrial uses to the north, in El Segundo adversely
affected local residents, but the two cities have worked together to address this
problem. It is the goal of the City to continue to provide a healthy environment for all
residents, consistent with the stated goal of the California Legislature to provide decent
sage and sanitary housing.
Policy 8. Eliminate potentially unsafe or unhealthy conditions in existing residential
development.
Program 8a. Continue the active code enforcement program for illegal and substandard
               units.
The City has an active Code enforcement program that responds to complaints of
substandard structures. In addition, a Report of Residential Building Records is required
each time a property is sold, which serves to alert all parties to unpermitted and
potentially substandard construction that may exist.

understanding of the impacts of energy consumption and climate change, specifically
greenhouse gases. California has become the first state to address greenhouse gases. It
is important that new housing be developed in light of a changing energy environment.
Policy 10. Encourage the use of alternate energy.
Program 10. Waive fees for installation of solar panels.
Solar panels may be used on roofs of residential and commercial structures to generate
electricity that is either transmitted to the grid or stored in batteries on-site. The existing
height limits in Manhattan Beach ensure rooftop units would not eventually be subject to
shade and shadow, which would render them ineffective. Since 2008, in order to
encourage use of alternate energy the City has waived any building fees for
photovoltaic panels.

     Objective:      Process permits for new solar panels at no cost.
Policy 11. Reduce energy loss due to inferior construction/development techniques.
Program 11a. Enforce green building techniques.
The City has adopted the California Energy Code.             In addition the City requires the
following:
       •    Insulating hot water pipes to minimize energy loss
       •    Using caulk and insulation that are formaldehyde-free or contain low VOC
            (volatile organic compounds)
       •    Pre-plumb water piping and sensor wiring to the roof for future solar water
            heating
       •    Use duct mastic on all duct joints and seams to minimize energy loss
       •    Install "Energy Star" bath fans vented to the outside
       •    Energy efficient water fixtures
The City continues to review its codes to encourage greener building techniques. The
United States Green Building Council continues to review more intensive measures to be
included in buildings for LEED certification. The City reviews standards through the
Environmental Task Force and will continue to review and update its codes as updates
become available.

Where individuals have an opportunity to live in close proximity to their work, vehicle
miles traveled to and from work can be reduced, thus reducing energy consumption.
The City has permitted the development of mixed uses in Manhattan Village and permits
the development of residential uses in commercial districts downtown and along
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. In addition, the commercial areas of the City are in close
proximity to residential districts, thus providing the potential that residents may walk to
work or to shopping, dining out or other activities, or only drive a short distance.

                 Evaluation of the 2008-2014 Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the
2008-2014 Housing Element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period. This analysis also includes an
assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The findings from this
evaluation have been instrumental in determining the City’s 2013-2021 Housing
Implementation Program.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies
any changes that are called for in response to the City’s experience during the past
planning period. Based on this evaluation, all of the current Goals and Policies continue
to be appropriate and have been retained.
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                          Appendix B – Land Inventory

                                   Residential Land Inventory
1.       Methodology and Assumptions
State law requires each city to include in the Housing Element an inventory of vacant
parcels having the potential for residential development, or “underutilized” parcels with
potential for additional development or redevelopment. The purpose of this inventory is
to identify sufficient development capacity, based on the General Plan, zoning,
development standards, and infrastructure, to accommodate the City’s fair share of
regional growth needs as identified in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
This analysis represents an estimate of the City’s realistic development potential. Actual
development will depend on the intentions of each property owner, market conditions
and other factors. The detailed methodology and assumptions for the residential land
inventory are provided below.
The City has been allocated a growth need of 38 units for the 2013-2021 planning period.
Since there are no significant vacant parcels remaining in the city that could
accommodate new housing developments of any appreciable size, future housing
growth needs will be met primarily through the consolidation and redevelopment of
small commercial parcels with multi-family residential or mixed-use projects.
Affordability Assumptions
In general, there are three alternative ways for determining the affordability level of new
housing units.
       1.    Affordability Covenants. The most definitive method is through required
             affordability covenants (i.e., requirements imposed upon or agreed to by the
             project sponsor) that establish income limits for purchasers or tenants. Such
             covenants are legally enforceable and binding upon the property owner for a
             specified time period.
       2.    Market Prices or Rents. When covenants are not in place, affordability levels for
             newly-built units are based on actual prices or rents. As discussed in Chapter II,
             virtually all new housing in Manhattan Beach is priced in the above-moderate
             income category.
       3.    Density. For potential new units in a city’s land inventory, state law establishes
             affordability assumptions based on density. The “default” density for
             metropolitan jurisdictions, including Manhattan Beach, is 30 units per acre11.
             This means that if the General Plan and zoning allow development at 30 units
             per acre or greater, these sites are deemed appropriate to accommodate
             housing for lower-income households.
         The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance allow residential densities greater than 30
         units/acre in portions of the Medium Density Residential category (Beach District –
11 Assembly Bill 2348 of 2004 (Government Code §65583.2(c)(3)(B))
                                                   B-1                             February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                          Appendix B – Land Inventory
        32.3 units/acre) and in all portions of the High Density Residential category (43.6 to
        51.3 units/acre). In addition, the Downtown Commercial, Local Commercial, and
        North End Commercial districts allow residential or mixed-use development at
        densities permitted in the High Density Residential category, which is significantly
        higher than the default density of 30 units/acre.
2.      Vacant and Underutilized Land Inventory
Manhattan Beach is a mature developed city and only a few small vacant parcels
remain. As a result, nearly all future development must be accommodated through
“recycling” of previously developed properties. Redevelopment is partially constrained
by existing subdivision and ownership patterns. Parcels are primarily less than 5,000
square feet, with only about 35 parcels over 6,000 square feet. Of these, only a dozen
parcels are over 10,000 square feet, including the Lutheran Church and the Vons grocery
site, both of which are needed to serve the community and would not be expected to
redevelop during the current planning period. With the exception of one 15,756-square-
foot parcel at 1030 Manhattan Beach Boulevard, all of the larger parcels are developed
with newer structures unlikely to redevelop for other uses in the near future. However,
significant redevelopment opportunities exist on commercial parcels where both
exclusive high-density residential and mixed uses are allowed. Approximately half of all
potential commercial/mixed used parcels are occupied by structures at least 50 years
old, and would be considered candidates for redevelopment. Many commercial sites
currently contain smaller, one-story leased buildings at densities significantly below what
is allowed, and parcels experiencing regular business turnover could be more conducive
to redevelopment.
Due to the small size of available parcels, there is little opportunity to achieve economies
of scale without consolidation of two or more parcels into larger development sites. As
described in Program 3b of the Housing Plan (Chapter V), the City will facilitate lot
consolidation through a variety of regulatory and administrative incentives that will
enhance the feasibility of affordable multi-family development. Property owners and
developers have expressed interest in lot consolidation to assemble larger sites for
residential development. It should be noted that the inventory summarized in Table B-1
below includes far more sites than are needed to address the regional housing need of
38 units for the planning period.
The commercial districts where the majority of the City’s lower-income housing need can
be accommodated are described below. Development standards in these districts
encourage and facilitate high-density multi-family residential development by allowing 3-
story structures up to 30 feet in height, plus other applicable incentives that may be
granted under Density Bonus law. Multi-family projects are also encouraged by allowing
more residential floor area on a given parcel than is permitted for commercial
developments. Figure B-4 -Zoning Districts shows the general location of these three
districts.

           The Downtown Commercial land use category applies only to the Downtown,

          residential development is permitted according to the development standards
          for the High Density Residential (RH) district, which supersede the commercial
          development standards and allows one unit per 850 square feet of land area
          (51 units/acre). As shown in Table B-3, sites in this district with good potential for
          lot consolidation and redevelopment can accommodate at least 443 multi-
          family units, excluding density bonus.
   •   Local Commercial (CL) District
          The Local Commercial land use category provides areas for neighborhood-
          oriented, small-scale professional offices, retail businesses, and service activities
          that serve the local community. Permitted uses are generally characterized by
          those that generate low traffic volumes, have limited parking needs, and
          generally do not operate late hours. Residential uses are also permitted at
          densities consistent with the High Density Residential (RH) district, which
          supersede the commercial development standards and allows one unit per
          1,000 square feet of land area (43.5 units/acre). As shown in Table B-4, sites in
          this district with good potential for lot consolidation and redevelopment can
          accommodate at least 316 multi-family units, excluding density bonus (see
          Figures B-2 and B-6).
   •   North End Commercial (CNE) District
          Properties designated North End Commercial lie at the north end of the City,
          along Highland Avenue and Rosecrans Avenue between 33rd and 42nd
          Streets (see Figures B-3 and B-7). Commercial uses are limited to small-scale,
          low-intensity neighborhood-serving service businesses, retail stores, and offices.
          Restaurant and entertainment establishments are permitted only where zoning
          regulations can adequately ensure compatibility with residential uses.
          Residential uses are also allowed at densities consistent with the High Density
          Residential category, which supersede the commercial development
          standards and allows one unit per 850 square feet of land area (51 units/acre).
          As shown in Table B-5, sites in this district with good potential for lot
          consolidation and redevelopment can accommodate at least 235 multi-family
          units, excluding density bonus.
3.     Capacity to Accommodate Regional Housing Needs
Table B-1 summarizes the City’s land inventory compared to the RHNA for each income
category in the current planning period. The City is mostly built-out and only a few
vacant parcels are available for residential development. Most of the residential
capacity is provided on underutilized sites in commercial districts. Small sites with less than
one-quarter acre have been excluded from the totals for all zones. Table B-1 shows that
the development capacity of underutilized sites exceeds the City’s RHNA allocation for
the planning period.
                                              B-3                                  February 2014

Manhattan Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                    Appendix B – Land Inventory
The potential capacity in commercial zones is based on the allowable number of units
that could be built, excluding density bonus. As seen in Tables B-3, B-4 and B-5, sites that
are not considered to have realistic potential for redevelopment during the 2013-2021
planning period have not been counted toward the total capacity. The capacity of
each site is based on maximum allowable density, which is reasonable considering high
land values and the potential for density bonus that allows up to 35% higher yield when
affordable units are provided. While market trends and financial considerations of
property owners will ultimately determine the level of development, the City’s total RHNA
allocation represents only about 4% of the potential residential capacity.
In order to enhance the potential for affordable housing development, Program 3b
describes actions the City has taken to reduce constraints and facilitate multi-family
housing in the Downtown Commercial, Local Commercial, and North End Commercial
districts, including incentive density increases for lot consolidation, elimination of the CUP
requirement for residential projects, and expedited processing.

This update to the Manhattan Beach Housing Element has provided residents and other
interested parties with numerous opportunities to review draft documents and proposed
policies, and to provide recommendations for consideration by decision-makers. Public

newspaper in advance of each meeting, as well as by direct mail to interested parties
and posting the notices on the City’s website. The draft Housing Element was also made
available for review at City Hall and posted on the City’s website.
As part of the public review process, two public meetings were held, as follows:
         October 9, 2013                       Planning Commission hearing
         February 4, 2013                      City Council hearing
Summarized below are comments received during the Housing Element review process
and how those comments have been addressed. Table C-1 provides a list of persons and
organizations that were sent direct mail notice of all public meetings on the Housing
Element.

                                  The dB(A) descriptor only reports noise from a single source or
                                  combination of sources at a point in time. To allow a more
                                  comprehensive description of a noise environment, Federal and
                                  State agencies have established noise and land use compatibility
                                  guidelines that use averaging approaches to noise measurement.
                                  Two measurement scales commonly used in California are the
                                  Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the day-night
                                  level (Ldn). To account for increased human sensitivity at night,
                                  the CNELlevel includes a five-decibel penalty on noise during the
                                  7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. time period and a ten-decibel penalty on
                                  noise during the 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. time period. The Ldn
                                  level includes only the ten decibel weighting for late-night noise.
                                  These values are nearly identical for all but unusual noise sources.
                                  Sources of Noise
                                  Noise typically is categorized as transportation-related or non-
                                  transportation noise. Transportation noise refers to noise from
                                  automobiles, trucking, airport operations, and rail activity. Non-
                                  transportation noise refers to noise from stationary sources such
                                  as machinery, air conditioning systems, compressors, landscape
                                  maintenance equipment, and a range of activities (e.g., live
                                  music/concerts, outdoor cafes, amplified music from stereos, and
                                  loud voices of crowds).
                                  In Manhattan Beach, vehicular traffic represents the primary
                                  noise source.          Stationary sources such as industrial and
                                  commercial activities also present some concerns, particularly
                                  where such operations abut residential neighborhoods. Aviation
                                  activities and heavy industrial operations in adjacent
                                  communities also impact the City. Due to the compactness of
                                  development in Manhattan Beach, noise impacts generated by
                                  construction activities, as well as special events at schools, parks,
                                  commercial businesses and public assembly places, are also of
                                  concern.

Figure N-1 displays a composite picture of average noise levels in
Manhattan Beach in 2002 using noise contours. Noise contours
define areas of equal noise exposure. Noise is at the highest
level near the source and decreases with distance.
Transportation-Related Noise
Traffic is one of the most important quality of life issues faced by
Manhattan Beach residents and businesses. Traffic-related issues
like noise also impact our community. Large volumes of vehicles
travel to, from, and through Manhattan Beach daily. Noise is
generated as vehicles travel at high speeds, drivers use their
horns, and vehicle engines gear up after stalling behind a red
light, stop sign, or traffic jam. The most heavily traveled
roadways in the City include Sepulveda Boulevard, Rosecrans
Avenue, Aviation Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard, and Manhattan
Beach Boulevard, and portions of Highland Avenue and Marine
Avenue. As shown in Figure N-1, noise levels are highest along
these travel routes.
Many trucks carrying heavy loads of goods travel to and from
                                                                         See the Infrastructure
commercial and industrial operations in Manhattan Beach, as              Element for discussion and
well as through the City to other communities. These heavy               m ap of truckroutes.
trucks present traffic-related issues such as wide turn radius, noise,
air quality, and vibrations. Truck routes have been designated for
use by heavy trucks to access most commercial areas in the City,
including Downtown and North End, to protect residences from
such impacts.
Residential uses along portions of Rosecrans Avenue, Aviation
Boulevard, and Marine Avenue are particularly impacted by the
heavy traffic. To mitigate traffic noise impacts on residences, the
City has designated residential lots along a portion of Rosecrans
Avenue as Design Overlay District 1. Residents are allowed to
erect higher fences in the setback areas to screen out traffic           See the Land Use Elem ent

Management Program to address cut-through traffic and related            discussions on
impacts on residential neighborhoods.                                    Neighborhood Traffic

                       Non-Transportation Noise
                       Stationary noise sources that affect noise-sensitive land uses in
                       Manhattan Beach include the El Segundo Power Generation
                       Facility, the Chevron Refinery, and the Los Angeles International
                       Airport, as well as other industrial and commercial uses in El
                       Segundo and Hawthorne, all of which are located north and east
                       of the City boundary. Residents in the North End and El Porto
                       neighborhoods, and those in the north end of the Tree Section,
                       are mainly affected by these industrial uses. Additionally,
                       commercial uses within the City near residential uses can cause
                       noise impacts, such as in the Downtown, the North End and El
                       Porto, and along Sepulveda Boulevard.
                       El Segundo Generating Station
                       The El Segundo Generating Station (ESGS), located immediately
                       north of Manhattan Beach, provides electric power to Southern
                       California residents and businesses.              While located in an
                       industrial area of El Segundo, the facility abuts residential uses in
                       Manhattan Beach, and for many years the noisy operations have
                       impacted North End residents. The operator has initiated a
                       phased program to remove and replace two electric generation
                       units (Units 1 and 2) located on the north end of the facility, with
                       three new Units (Units 5, 6, and 7) in the same location. Only
                       minor modifications are planned for Units 3 and 4 located in the
                       middle of the ESGS. The expansion program also includes the
                       removal of two large fuel oil tanks that visually and acoustically
                       shield Manhattan Beach residents from the ESGS. Residents are
                       concerned that removal of the tanks could significantly increase
                       noise levels from the ESGS. Construction noise impacts are also
                       a concern. The City will need to work with the California Energy
                       Commission to proactively monitor the construction and
                       operation of the ESGS to ensure that North End residents are not
                       exposed to significant noise impacts.
                       Chevron Oil Refinery
                       The Chevron Oil Refinery in El Segundo lies directly north of
                       Manhattan Beach (north of Rosecrans Avenue and east of
                       Highland Avenue). This oil refinery is configured to produce
                       large volumes of high-value, cleaner-burning gasoline and diesel
                       fuels designed to meet the air quality standards of the California
                       market. This facility has a capacity of 260,000 BCD (Barrels per
                       Calendar Day).1 Operating around the clock daily, this facility
                       contributes to the ambient noise environment that impacts
                       Manhattan Beach residents, particularly those whose homes face
                       Rosecrans Avenue.

Aircraft Noise
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is located four miles
north of Manhattan Beach, and Hawthorne Municipal Airport lies
approximately seven miles northeast of the City.
Typically, aircraft noise has more impact on neighborhoods
during take-offs than during landings. Out-bound flights from
LAX generally follow an east-west route, then turn north or south
to all directions.2 In-bound flights from the south or west may fly
over Manhattan Beach to allow the aircraft to turn around for
landing on the runways. Due to the altitude of incoming flights,
noise impacts on Manhattan Beach fall below 60 dB(A). The City
of Manhattan Beach is not located within any Airport Influence
Area, as defined by the State of California.
In 2002, LAX accommodated 2,300 operations daily, serving
approximately 70 million passengers annually. To accommodate
growth in air travel and cargo demands, airport planners have
developed a master plan that accommodates expansion. The
LAX Master Plan provides for expansion in aircraft operations by
adding a new runway either to the north or south of the airport.
If expanded, daily operations will increase to 2,700 flights. 3
Increased operations at LAX may potentially increase the aircraft
noise impact on nearby communities, including Manhattan
Beach. Noise studies conducted for the LAX Master Plan
indicate that aircraft operations will not create noise conditions in
the City inconsistent with the noise/land use compatibility criteria
                                  set forth in this Element (Figure N-2).
                                  Hawthorne Municipal Airport is a
                                  small general aviation reliever airport,
                                  owned and operated by the city of
                                  Hawthorne. Hawthorne Airport is
                                  home to fewer than 200 aircraft and
handles approximately 85,000 takeoffs and landings annually.4
Noise from low-flying aircraft using Hawthorne Municipal Airport
occasionally impact residential neighborhoods.
A number of agencies and others operate low-flying propeller
planes and helicopters that generate occasional noise. These
include news helicopters that monitor traffic and report on other
events, lifeguards and other agencies that patrol the beach area,
“flying”advertisements, and police/sheriff personnel that monitor
emergency situations.

                                  Construction
                                  Manhattan Beach is a highly desirable residential community.
                                  Due to the high real estate values, new homes are constantly
                                  being built, replacing older, smaller homes with larger homes
                                  with more amenities. Commercial redevelopment is also active
                                  in the Downtown area and along Sepulveda Boulevard and
                                  Manhattan Beach Boulevard. Because of the dense development
                                  pattern and narrow streets in some neighborhoods, construction
                                  activities present not only traffic congestion issues but also noise
                                  impacts, particularly when multiple construction projects occur
                                  on the same block. Monitoring of construction activities is
                                  necessary to ensure that noise impacts are mitigated to the
                                  extent feasible.
                                  The City limits construction activities to between the hours of
                                  7:30 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. on Monday through Friday and between

                                  prohibited on Sundays and on six specified public holidays. The
                                  City also enforces the “reasonable person” standard, meaning
                                  that noise is considered a nuisance if it causes discomfort or
                                  annoyance to any reasonable person of normal sensitivity, or if it
                                  exceeds the noise standards set forth in the Manhattan Beach
                                  Municipal Code.

                                  home security devices), and landscape and garden maintenance
                                  equipments all generate noise. The City adopted the Noise
                                  Ordinance to regulate excessive neighborhood noise that may
                                  erode the quality of our neighborhoods. Specifically, the use of
                                  mechanical blowers is prohibited in Manhattan Beach.
                                  Noise and Land Use Planning
                                  Noise is most problematic when noise-sensitive uses are affected.
                                  Noise-sensitive uses -- defined as activities that are interrupted by
                                  noise -- include residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas,
                                  and public assembly places.
                                  Because of Manhattan Beach’s built-out character and well-
                                  established land use patterns, the City has limited latitude to plan
                                  using noise/land use compatibility criteria at a broad scale. Land
                                  use decisions instead are made at a project-specific level, such as
                                  reviewing proposals for new commercial businesses adjacent to
                                  residences. Specifically, in Downtown, in the North End and El
                                  Porto, along Oak Street, and in other neighborhoods directly

behind Sepulveda Boulevard frontages, the City routinely
considers the type and arrangement of commercial use proposed
and how such might affect surrounding residences. For example,
bar and restaurant operations that extend into the late night may
significantly impact adjacent residences, and mitigation measures
are required to protect residences from excessive noise.
The noise/land use compatibility guidelines in Figure N-2, based
on cumulative noise criteria for outdoor noise, are used to review
development proposals and to identify and mitigation measures
necessary to avoid or minimize impacts -- including traffic noise
impacts -- that a new use may have on established uses.
Land use policy set forth in the Land Use Element provides for
established land use patterns to continue. Thus, any change in
noise levels over time will be attributable to increased traffic
volumes due to regional growth, expanded operations at Los
Angeles International Airport, and activity on industrial and
commercial properties in surrounding communities. The
projected future noise environment graphic shown in Figure N-3
accounts for future traffic volumes.        The noise/land use
compatibility matrix recognizes the densely character of the City
and the presence of mixed-use districts.

Goals and Policies
To control unnecessary, excessive, and annoying noise in
Manhattan Beach, the City’s policy is to maintain and preserve
the quiet atmosphere of the City, to implement programs aimed
at retaining ambient noise levels throughout the City, and to
mitigate noise conflicts.
Goal N-1:        Provide for measures to reduce noise impacts
                 from transportation noise sources.
In Manhattan Beach, major transportation-related noise sources
include Sepulveda Boulevard, and arterials and collectors such as
Rosecrans Avenue, Aviation Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard,
Marine Avenue, Manhattan Beach Boulevard, Manhattan Avenue,
Highland Avenue, and Valley/Ardmore. Vehicular traffic along
collector streets that traverse residential neighborhoods, such as
Valley Drive/Ardmore Avenue, Highland Avenue, and Manhattan
Avenue, also impacts residents living along these routes.
Policy N-1.1:    Use proven methods of reducing the transmission of
                 traffic noise onto adjacent noise-sensitive land uses
                 (e.g.,residences,schools,medical facilities).
Policy N-1.2:    Ensure the inclusion of noise mitigation measures in
                 the design of new roadway projects in Manhattan
                 Beach.
Policy N-1.3:    Reduce transportation noise through proper design
                 and coordination of vehicle routing.
The Infrastructure Element establishes truck routes in the City
where truck traffic is only permitted along regional and major
arterial streets. Neighborhood traffic management tools are also
                                                                           The Infrastructure Element
to help reduce cut-through traffic in residential neighborhoods,
                                                                           identifies the Roadway
thereby reducing undesirable traffic noise.
                                                                           Classifications,including
                                                                           designated truck routes.
Policy N-1.4:    Ensure the effective enforcement of City,State,and
                 Federal noise levels by all appropriate City divisions.
                                                                                    P A G E         N - 13

                                    Policy N-1.5:    Work with appropriate agencies to mitigate impacts
                                                     from existing and proposed aviation operations.
                                    Policy N-1.6:    Work with surrounding jurisdictions and other
                                                     agencies to mitigate noise impacts.
                                    Intensification of development or land use changes that occur in
                                    neighboring jurisdictions may potentially degrade the ambient
                                    environment if transportation-related noise is increased.
                                    Goal N-2:        Incorporate noise considerations into land use
                                                     planning decisions.
                                    As a built-out community, land use patterns in Manhattan Beach
                                    are well-established; little opportunity exists to relocate noise-
                                    sensitive uses to areas of lower ambient noise levels. However,
                                    land use planning and development decisions in the future must
                                    take into consideration noise impacts. Other tools, such as
                                    neighborhood traffic management tools, may also be applied to
                                    redirect traffic and associated noise impacts from sensitive land
                                    uses.
                                    Policy N-2.1:    Establish acceptable limits of noise for various land
                                                     uses throughout the community.
                                    Policy N-2.2:    Ensure acceptable noise levels near residences,
                                                     schools, medical facilities, and other noise-sensitive
                                                     areas.
                                    The City adopted a Neighborhood Traffic Management Program

Policy N-2.5:   Require that the potential for noise be considered
                when approving new development to reduce the
                possibility of adverse effects related to noise
                generated by new development, as well as impacts
                from surrounding noise generators on the new
                development.
Policy N-2.6:   Work with businesses in surrounding jurisdictions to
                manage noise impacts on City residents and
                businesses.
Goal N-3:       Minimize the impact of non-transportation noise
                sources.
The City adopted the Noise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 1957)
that establishes exterior noise standards by land use and the
maximum duration of time that the noise standards may be
exceeded without being considered a nuisance punishable by
law. The Noise Ordinance regulates a variety of noise generators,
focusing primarily on non-transportation sources.
Policy N-3.1:   Monitor and update the Noise Ordinance to mitigate
                noise conflicts.
Policy N-3.2:   Enforce the Noise Ordinance.
Policy N-3.3:   Minimize impacts associated with single-event noise
                activities.
Policy N-3.4:   Recognize in the Noise Ordinance that nighttime noise
                levels create a greater sensitivity than do daytime
                noise levels.
Policy N-3.5:   Encourage jurisdictions, including cities, and other
                agencies to require compliance with the City of
                Manhattan Beach Noise Ordinance where activities
                affect Manhattan Beach residents and businesses.
Commercial establishments and heavy industrial operations such
as the power plant in El Segundo generate noise that impacts our
residents and businesses.

                                       construction activities on residential neighborhoods.
                       As a highly desirable community in which to live, Manhattan
                       Beach experiences constant demolition and construction
                       activities in residential neighborhoods.         With the compact
