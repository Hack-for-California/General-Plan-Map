Introduction
Castro Valley is an unincorporated area of Alameda County that has
developed a strong community identity over its 150 year history. Castro
Valley’s name suggests its character – a populated valley surrounded
by picturesque hills. It began as an area of cattle and poultry ranches
and has evolved into a residential community of more than 60,000
people. Its main thoroughfare, Castro Valley Boulevard, began as a
small road connecting eastern and western Alameda County, which
later became a state highway lined with auto-oriented uses, and is
now the commercial center of the community.
This Castro Valley General Plan sets forth the vision for the next
20 years of Castro Valley’s evolution. While the community
appears to be fully developed, or “built out,” an analysis of existing
zoning shows that there are many sites available for residential and
commercial development. Given Castro Valley’s central location and
transportation access, the area will experience additional growth,
especially given the great housing demand in the region combined
with voter-approved preservation of surrounding open space. This
plan is intended to guide that development, so that it contributes to
the quality of the community, allowing Castro Valley to retain its
                                                                        1-1

Castro Valley General Plan
                                                picturesque natural setting and small town character as it continues
                                                to grow and evolve.
                                                Alameda County does not have a countywide Land Use or Circulation
                                                Element but has adopted area plans that meet the Government
                                                Code’s requirements for these elements for Castro Valley and other
                                                unincorporated areas. As such, the General Plan for Castro Valley is
                                                part of the Alameda County General Plan serving as the Land Use
                                                and Circulation elements for the urbanized area of Castro Valley,

                                                and establishing policies for other topics specific to Castro Valley.
                                                The Alameda County General Plan’s countywide Housing, Resource
                                                Conservation, Open Space, Noise, Seismic Safety, and Safety
                                                Elements are also applicable to Castro Valley. This plan has been
                                                written to be consistent with all of their policies and provisions.
                                                1.1	 PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
                                                The Castro Valley General Plan establishes a new vision and
                                                comprehensive plan for the next 20 years of the community. It has
                                                two primary purposes:
Castro Valley will continue to grow with infill
residential development.
                                                •	   update the General Plan to take changing conditions into
                                                     account, and
                                                •	   guide the future development of Castro Valley.
                                                The previous General Plan for Castro Valley was adopted in 1985
                                                and, while many General Plan policies are still relevant, the planning
                                                context and setting have changed. The new General Plan reflects the
                                                passage of Measure D, the initiative approved by County voters in
                                                2000 that amended the County’s General Plan to establish an Urban
                                                Growth Boundary (UGB). That measure limits urban development
                                                in most of the rural areas of the county, including the canyonlands
                                                surrounding Castro Valley. The new Plan also implements
                                                amendments to the County’s Housing Element that the Board of
                                                Supervisors adopted in 2003 and updated in 2010.
                                                Together with these adopted policies, the new General Plan is intended
                                                to serve as the basis for regulating land use and development until the
                                                year 2025, which is the horizon year of the plan. The key objectives
                                                of the General Plan regarding future development are discussed in
                                                Chapter 2 and include:

1.2	 PLANNING PROCESS
The Castro Valley General Plan was prepared over an eight year
period from 2004 to 2012, with extensive input from the community.
The planning effort began with a General Plan meeting attended
by over 400 people, a demonstration of Castro Valley residents’
commitment to their community. Through a series of six interactive
public workshops and four meetings of the Municipal Advisory
Council, the plan maps and policies were developed.
                                                                       Leslie Gould of Dyett & Bhatia solicits
In 2007, in response to residents’ requests, the Board of Supervisors
                                                                       comments from the community; County
voted to expand the planning area to include the El Portal Ridge and   Supervisor Nate Miley listens closely
Fairmont Terrace neighborhoods, which had been covered by the 1985
Castro Valley General Plan, as well as Hillcrest Knolls, previously in
the Eden Plan area. Two additional public workshops were held to
determine the residents’ needs and concerns for the new area. The
Draft General Plan originally completed in 2007 was revised and
then reviewed by the Castro Valley Municipal Advisory Council.
The County Board of Supervisors adopted the revised General Plan
in 2012 following review and hearings by the Planning Commission
and the Board. In its final form, the General Plan serves as the
community’s statement of its goals for the next 20 years, and the
County’s regulatory “constitution” of the community for the future
development of Castro Valley.

                                                The General Plan addresses nine major topic areas that are related to
                                                the physical environment of Castro Valley but are intended to achieve
                                                a broad range of economic, environmental, and social objectives:
                                                Land Use and Development; Community Character and Design;
                                                Circulation; Biological Resources; Community Facilities, Parks and
                                                Schools; Public Services and Utilities; Natural Hazards and Public
                                                Safety; Noise, and Air Quality and Climate Change. Each of the nine
       Work with HARD, the school districts,
                                                topics has four components: a background section describing existing
    Alameda County Library, and the Medical
  Center to add at least one new community      conditions and analysis; an overarching goal; a series of guiding
center building in Castro Valley, like t he one policies; and action steps to implement those policies. Maps are used
             in Castro Valley Community Park
                                  shown here.
                                                extensively to illustrate information and policy direction.
                                                The plan is designed to be a strategic plan, focused on the primary
                                                goals that Castro Valley wants to achieve in the next 20 years, and
                                                on the specific actions that will be taken to achieve those goals. The
                                                types of actions the Plan recommends are within the County and
                                                community’s control or influence, including:

                                                         BOUNDARIES
                                                Castro Valley, an unincorporated sub-area of Alameda County, is
                                                centrally located in the western part of the County. Castro Valley
                                                is bounded by the City of San Leandro and the unincorporated
                                                communities of Ashland and Cherryland to the west, the City of
                                                Hayward and unincorporated Fairview to the south, the East Bay
                                                Regional Park District to the north, and Contra Costa County and the
                                                City of Dublin to the east. See Figure 1-1: Castro Valley Regional

Castro Valley is divided by Interstate 580 and the Dublin-Pleasanton
BART line, the principal means of access between San Francisco and
Oakland, to the west and Dublin, Pleasanton, and Livermore to the
east. Castro Valley Boulevard is the major commercial thoroughfare
and one of the area’s few east-west connectors, running generally
parallel to I-580. Radiating from the Central Business District (CBD)
north and south of Castro Valley Boulevard are a series of primarily
single-family residential neighborhoods, most of which were
developed from the early 1950s to the late 1990s.
The new Castro Valley General Plan area includes approximately 11
square miles of urbanized land within the boundaries described above.
Alameda County defines Castro Valley as the urbanized area as well
as the Canyonlands outside the Urban Growth Boundary that voters
established in 2000 with the passage of Measure D. (See Appendix
A.) This Plan uses the term “planning area” to refer to the urbanized
area within the County’s Urban Growth Boundary, including the
Castro Valley Census Designated Place (CDP) as well as the Five
Canyons neighborhood, as shown in Figure 1-2. These boundaries
largely follow the area that was proposed for incorporation in 2002,
plus the Five Canyons neighborhood, which was previously included
in the County’s Cherryland-Fairview sub-regional area.
1.5	 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS
State law requires that all municipalities have a General Plan that
includes seven elements: Circulation, Conservation, Housing, Land
Use, Noise, Open Space, and Safety. Other optional elements can
also be included in the General Plan. None of these elements take
precedence over the other ones; they must be consistent with one
another.
As an unincorporated area, Castro Valley is subject to the County’s
General Plan. State law allows a county General Plan to be adopted as
a series of area plans, such as those Alameda County has produced for
Castro Valley, the Eden area, and the East County. These plans must
conform to all countywide general plan elements and be consistent
with one another. Consequently, the Castro Valley General Plan must
be consistent with the land use plans for adjacent unincorporated
areas of Eden and the East County, as they are also components of
the County’s Land Use Element, and must also be consistent with the
other countywide General Plan elements.
                                                                                           1-5

                                           Table 1.5-1 indicates which elements of the proposed Castro Valley
                                           Plan and which countywide elements are applicable to Castro Valley.
                                           Land use decisions within the Castro Valley planning area are also
                                           governed by a variety of area, sub-area, and countywide plans and
                                           regulations. All of these plans and regulations, including the County
                                           subdivision and zoning ordinances (General Ordinance Code Titles
                                           16 and17), must be consistent with the Castro Valley General Plan.
                                           They may need to be amended after the new General Plan is adopted.
                                           Other plans that could be affected include the Central Business
                                           District Specific Plan, the Upper Madison Avenue/Common Road
                                           Area Specific Plan, and the Eden Redevelopment Plan.

Vision for Castro Valley
2025
2.1	 Castro Valley 1985-2005
Castro Valley’s previous General Plan was completed in 1985. At
that time, flatter areas of the Castro Valley “bowl” were generally
built out, and there were hillside subdivisions, such as Greenridge
and Columbia, as well as other scattered “rural residential” homes
throughout the hills. Since the 1985 plan, two large planned unit
developments have been constructed: Palomares Hills in the late
1980s and Five Canyons from 1999-2004. In addition, extensive
small residential infill development has occurred. Larger hillside
lots have been subdivided into multiple lots and larger properties
in flat areas have been redeveloped with townhomes and small
lot single family developments. The total population of Castro
Valley has increased from about 46,000 in 1985 to more than
61,000 people in 2005.
                                                                    2-1

Castro Valley General Plan
                           Job growth in Castro Valley has increased at a slightly faster rate than
                           the population, increasing by 50 percent between 1980 and 2005. In
                           comparison, the population grew by 35 percent over the same period.
                           Most of the jobs in Castro Valley are in the health, education, and
                           recreation fields, largely associated with Eden Medical Center Castro
                           Valley (the Medical Center), the County’s Fairmont health facilities,
                           and the Castro Valley Unified School District. Retail jobs make up
                           relatively little of the local employment market, actually declining
                           between 1980 and 2000.
                           In the year 2000, Alameda County voters passed a ballot measure
                           that defines future growth areas in Castro Valley. Measure D (see
                           Appendix A) established an urban growth boundary, restricting the
                           areas outside the boundary to agricultural, natural resource, and rural
                           uses, and preventing the construction of infrastructure to support
                           any urban development. As a result of Measure D, the canyonlands
                           surrounding Castro Valley are now off -limits to development, and
                           there are no large land areas left for new subdivisions. New growth
                           will involve infill in existing developed areas, and redevelopment of
                           older sites and structures. This land use prescription is part of a larger
                           regional effort toward “smart growth,” encouraging new development
                           in areas with existing infrastructure and transportation, and preserving
                           outer areas with agricultural and natural resource value.
                           2.2	 Developing a Vision for Castro Valley
                                    2005-2025
                           Residents in Castro Valley care deeply about their community,
                           and have chosen to live here because of many positive community
                           attributes. In the public workshops, there was general consensus
                           about the things people like about Castro Valley and want to preserve.
                           •	   Community character and quality of life, which was described
                                as a “hometown” or “small town” or “rural” character.
                           •	   Residential neighborhoods that are good for raising families,
                                specifically including large lots, cul-de-sacs, children playing in
                                the streets, and a sense of privacy.
                           •	   Small commercial establishments that people know and love,
                                mostly locally-owned small businesses (Chabot Theater, the Ice
                                Creamery, Lucca’s Deli), but also new businesses that provide
                                desired services like Trader Joe’s.
                           •	   Great open space and recreation, both the proximity of neigh-

                                                                       Chapter 2 | Vision for Castro Valley 2025
    borhood and regional parks like Cull Canyon and Lake Chabot,
    and the views to the hills and canyon lands.
•	  Good schools and public facilities, including the Castro Valley
    Unified School District schools, the Castro Valley Adult School,
    the Medical Center, Kenneth Aitken Senior Center, and the
    Adobe Art Center.
•	  Location and transportation access, specifically the location
    in between the major employment centers of the east county
    and west county, and the proximity of two regional freeways
    plus access to BART. As one person put it, “You can get
    anywhere from here.”
•	  Great climate.
Residents are, however, concerned about many issues in Castro
Valley, and want things to change for the better in several ways. They
are worried that new growth could exacerbate certain conditions that
are already a problem. The main issues they identified were:
•	  Traffic that detracts from the quality of life in the community,
    described as outsider traffic trying to avoid freeway congestion,
    and cut-through traffic that goes through residential streets.
•	  Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety. Residents expressed a strong
    need for sidewalks, street trees, medians, and other measures
    that create safe environments for pedestrians and bicyclists, and
    improve the appearance of the community.
•	  Loss of Community Character due to new development.
    Residents are very worried that new homes are oversized and do
    not fit in with the existing character of Castro Valley. They also
    are concerned that the natural environment which contributes so
    much to the character of Castro Valley – hillsides, canyons, and
    creeks – is being degraded or lost.
•	  Castro Valley Boulevard is unattractive. Residents want major
    improvement in the appearance of Castro Valley Boulevard,
    including both the public right of way and the buildings’ appear-
    ance.
•	  Lack of civic center and community facilities. Residents want
    more community facilities, a teen center, a better post office, a
    community meeting facility, and entertainment venues.
•	  South of I-580 not a part of the schools or the community. A
    number of people were concerned that the area south of I-580 is
    physically divided from the rest of Castro Valley and has a dif-
    ferent school district. Most neighborhoods in the western part
                                                                                                              2-3

Castro Valley General Plan
                               of the planning area are also not in the Castro Valley Unified
                               School District.
                           •	  Lack of quality shops and restaurants. People want to be able
                               to do more of their shopping in Castro Valley, and to enjoy a
                               greater range of quality shops, restaurants, and service busi-
                               nesses.
                           Community Vision for Castro Valley
                           Out of all the community input and planning analysis, a clear vision
                           for Castro Valley emerged. The key objectives that the community
                           desires for the Castro Valley of 2025 include:
                           •	  Revitalize the Central Business District. Create a pedestrian
                               town center where people walk to shops, meet neighbors,
                               and gather for community events. Provide a variety of shops,
                               restaurants, and services, so residents do not need to leave
                               Castro Valley for their daily needs, and remake Castro Valley
                               Boulevard as a beautiful street where it is pleasant to walk.
                           •	  Preserve the area’s defining natural characteristics, embodied
                               in the hills, canyons, creeks, and rural corridors, and views to
                               those natural areas. Update policies to reflect the passage of
                               Measure D, which established an Urban Growth Boundary lim-
                               iting urban development in most of the rural areas of the county,
                               including the Canyonlands surrounding Castro Valley.
                           •	  Improve access for children to schools, parks and recreation
                               facilities, and provide safer streets for walking and bicycling, in
                               order to create a good environment for raising a family.
                           •	  Provide facilities for activities and entertainment venues for all
                               age groups, including places like the Chabot Theater, the Adobe
                               Art Center, the Aitken Senior Center, and the Community
                               Theater, and the new Performing Arts Center at the high school.
                           •	  Ensure safe residential streets where traffic speed and noise do
                               not dominate residential streets, and where residents, especially
                               children, can walk or bike to schools, neighbors, stores, and
                               other destinations.
                           •	  Preserve the small town “rural” character of Castro Valley, with
                               low scale buildings, views to the natural areas, many small local
                               businesses, and a town center where people gather and see their
                               neighbors.
                           •	  Reduce impacts of regional traffic and freeway traffic, so that
                               local streets contribute rather than detract from the quality of
                               life in the community.

•	   Only allow new infill housing on sites that have capacity in
     a way that fits in with the existing scale and character of the
     community. Provide a variety of types of housing that are avail-
     able for all types of households and incomes, including single
     family homes, townhomes, apartments, condominiums, cottag-
     es, and mobile homes. Encourage new housing on designated
     sites in the Central Business District that are close to BART and
     other transit facilities.
•	   Identify regulatory changes that need to be made to implement
     the plan, including changes to the Alameda County Zoning
     Ordinance, the CBD Specific Plan, and other applicable regula-
     tions to implement the community’s vision.
•	   Establish priorities for the capital improvement projects that the
     County and other agencies make in the Castro Valley planning
     area in order to implement the community’s vision.
Major Initiatives to Accomplish the Vision
The General Plan chapters that follow outline all the goals and
policies for Castro Valley and implementation actions. However it
is important to have a concise statement of the key initiatives that
should be undertaken by government and community groups over
the next 20 years to achieve the vision expressed above. The list of
15 initiatives below evolved from the community meetings during
the development of the General Plan. Because Castro Valley is not a
city, the community members need to provide the leadership to bring
these about, working with the County government. Castro Valley
has a tradition of this type of civic involvement and care for the
community. That tradition will need to continue, and each community
member should look for opportunities to be involved in some aspect
of one of these initiatives. All of the initiatives below require funding
in addition to community leadership, so securing long-term funding
sources must be part of the effort.
1. 	 Valleys, Creeks, Canyons, and Hillsides Preserved: Establish a
     framework of legal, managerial, and operational protections for
     the community’s natural resources, including the valleys, creeks,
     canyons, and hillsides, as well as views to those resources. Ensure
     that there is ongoing stewardship and maintenance.
2. 	 Greening Castro Valley: Plant street trees, install planted
     medians, create parks and open views to green spaces, so that
     Castro Valley has a green landscaped character that makes it
     attractive and harkens back to its rural beginnings.
                                                                                                                 2-5

Castro Valley General Plan
                           3. 	 Design Standards and Guidelines for New Housing: Establish
                                a comprehensive detailed framework of zoning and subdivision
                                regulations, development standards and guidelines used in the
                                review of all new housing projects to ensure that new residential
                                development fits with the desired character for Castro Valley.
                           4. 	 Preserve Resources that embody Castro Valley’s Historic
                                Rural Character: Castro Valley evolved from a rural agricultural
                                area to become a residential community. While there are few
                                “historic resources” eligible for listing on the State and federal
                                registers, there are some resources that can be preserved or
                                enhanced to retain a connection with the community’s historic
                                rural character. These include the natural hillside and canyon
                                resource areas, some remaining agricultural sites, and the row of
                                early 20th century commercial storefronts on the western end of
                                Castro Valley Boulevard.
                           5. 	 Traffic Calming: Allow traffic flow so that auto circulation is
                                convenient for residents, but control the volume and speed of
                                traffic on streets to maximize safety and ensure that the nature
                                of the traffic fits with the character of the area. Develop a traffic
                                calming program that includes education and enforcement as
                                well as control devices such as signals, new sidewalks, speed
                                limits, traffic humps, and roundabouts. Make sure that streets are
                                safe for pedestrians and bicyclists.
                           6. 	 Walkable Town Center: Create a central pedestrian-friendly
                                shopping and restaurant area on a few blocks along Castro Valley
                                Boulevard and key side streets, including Castro Village Shopping
                                Center. Over time add and relocate buildings, sidewalks, and
                                parking so that the area has a pedestrian environment. Add a
                                plaza and features that create a public gathering place that can be
                                identified as the heart of the community. If at all possible, create
                                a place for a new post office as part of this area.
                           7. 	 Beautify Castro Valley Boulevard: Complete a streetscape
                                improvement project on Castro Valley Boulevard that adds street
                                trees, lights, banners, medians, bulb-outs and other such features
                                and removes billboards to make it a beautiful boulevard. Add
                                bicycle lanes. Preserve two lanes of traffic in each direction so
                                excessive traffic congestion does not occur. Establish or continue
                                other programs that improve the appearance of the commercial
                                area, including: Façade Improvement Program; Billboard
                                Reduction Program; Revised Sign Regulations; and Design
                                Review Guidelines for commercial projects.

8. 	 New Shops, Restaurants, and Entertainment in Castro Valley:
     Establish a business attraction program to bring new shops,
     restaurants, entertainment, and services to Castro Valley, that
     helps existing businesses expand or upgrade, and new businesses
     to get established. Support small local businesses.
9. 	 Castro Valley Community Center: Complete construction of
     the community library on Norbridge Street. Over time, add other
     facilities on the library site, or elsewhere if that is not feasible,
     to create an additional community center that could include a
     meeting room and facilities for seniors and teenagers.
10.	 Castro Valley Parks/Recreation Centers: Over the next twenty
     years, add at least one new neighborhood park in the underserved
     western area of Castro Valley, and a large community gym/
     recreation center. Add quality after-school facilities to make
     fuller use of existing schools and parks.
11. Lake Chabot Road Medical District: Allow the rebuilding of
     the Medical Center so it can continue to provide high-quality
     medical and emergency services in structures that can withstand
     earthquakes. The hospital and the citizens of Castro Valley
     should form a working committee to ensure that the new campus
     and surrounding sites create an attractive and functional medical
     district with medical offices, retail, restaurants, and supportive
     housing. Establish standards and guidelines to ensure that the
     medical facility construction and operation does not negatively
     impact the surrounding residential neighborhoods.
12. Castro Valley Neighborhood Centers: Renovate or rebuild
     on the neighborhood commercial sites in Castro Valley so that
     there are convenience stores and services close to residences,
     and the properties look attractive and well maintained so they
     contribute to the community. Establish zoning that allows the
     construction of housing or other uses that make the renovation
     or rebuilding financially viable; and work with project applicants
     to facilitate the renovation through all means available, including
     Redevelopment Agency tools.
13.	 Housing In and Around the Town Center: Adding new housing
     in and around the town center is a way to meet housing needs for
     smaller and more affordable units, and offer housing choice where
     residents can walk to shops and transit. It will also help support
     downtown businesses by locating customers within walking
     distance. The neighborhood between Somerset and Castro Valley
     Boulevard, the BART station, and some of the existing mobile
                                                                                                                  2-7
Castro Valley General Plan
                               home parks all offer potential housing sites. New housing should
                               fit in with the desired character of the area, in attractive buildings
                               no more than 2-4 stories tall that preserve views to the hillsides.
                           14. An Improved Look for Castro Valley: Improve the general
                               appearance of Castro Valley by establishing and funding
                               several types of programs: Streetscape Improvements, Planting
                               Programs, Façade Renovation, New Sign Regulations, and
                               Gateway Entry Structures. Review the design of new structures
                               and façade renovations to achieve a greater consistency and unity
                               in the overall appearance of downtown Castro Valley.
                           15. Enforcement: Enforce the zoning regulations, conditions of
                               approval, traffic regulations, the Neighborhood Preservation
                               Ordinance, and all the other types of agreements that the
                               community has adopted through public participation and/or
                               legislation. Enforcement is a critical component that is often
                               neglected. Establish more thorough plan check and inspections
                               to make sure buildings are constructed as approved, public notice
                               is sent when project designs are substantially revised, etc.
                           2.3	priorities
                           As part of the General Plan process, the community discussed
                           the different types of projects and programs that are necessary to
                           implement the General Plan, and evaluated priorities. The focus of
                           the discussion was to identify the recommendations of the General
                           Plan that require additional funding, and establish the community’s
                           priorities for use of available funds. A range of suggestions was
                           provided that included:
                           •	 Capital projects such as new buildings or street improve-
                               ments,
                           •	 Land purchase for open space preservation,
                           •	 Redevelopment Agency assistance to property owners and/or
                               businesses,
                           •	 Educational and marketing programs,
                           •	 Regulations, and
                           •	 Enforcement programs and personnel.

Top Ten Priorities for Castro Valley
At workshops conducted during the planning process, community
residents agreed that the following ten actions should be the
top priorities over the lifetime of the General Plan. Successful
execution or attainment of these clear and realistic items, which
are listed in descending order of importance, will help bring Castro
Valley closer to achieving its desired future.
1.	 Highly Visible Hillside or Canyon Sites Preserved as
     Open Space.
2.	 Castro Valley Streetscape Improvements.
3.	 Enforcement of Zoning and Design Review Regulations,
     as well as property maintenance requirements.
4.	 Residential Design Standards and/or Guidelines.
5.	 Billboards Eliminated .
6.	 Neighborhood Commercial Center Sites at Heyer/Center
     and Lake Chabot Road/Seven Hills Renovated and/or
     Redeveloped.
7.	 Commercial Façade Improvement Program.
8.	 Revised Subdivision Standards – Lot Size, Private Streets,
     Landscaping, etc.
9.	 Commercial Design Review Standards and/or Guidelines.
10.	New neighborhood park in the western area of Castro Valley,
     and/or in other areas.
Other Recommended Implementation Projects and Programs
It is important that Alameda County and the Castro Valley
community also pursue investments and policy changes that will
help bring about the vision laid out in the General Plan. Many
of these projects and programs will take longer to execute than
the top ten priorities, and can be engaged concurrently with those
actions.
                                                                                                            2-9

Community
Development Strategy
The community development strategy establishes the areas where
growth and change are planned to occur in Castro Valley over
the twenty year planning period. There will continue to be infill
residential development, because there is strong regional housing
demand and there is development capacity on existing lots.
Encouraging commercial development and renovation is a key goal
of the General Plan, because existing commercial buildings are
older and in need of renovation; and there is a strong community
desire for more retail and services. To prepare the community
                                                                      Infill residential development will continue
development strategy, a detailed study of existing development        in Castro Valley over the next 20 years.
patterns was conducted, and the development capacity under
existing zoning was analyzed for every property. Regional growth
projections were also analyzed. This information was considered
in light of all the community goals for Castro Valley, and strategies
were prepared to define: areas for infill residential development;
areas for commercial renovation and development; areas where
special long range planning efforts are needed to ensure natural
resources are protected and community character is maintained and
improved; and areas where development potential is limited.
                                                                                                                 3-1
Castro Valley General Plan
                           3.1	 population and jobs: existing
                                    conditions and future trends
                           Demographic and economic data for Castro Valley must be estimated,
                           since the community is an unincorporated area and the planning area
                           boundaries have changed since the 2000 census. The US Census treats
                           Castro Valley, excluding Five Canyons and Hillcrest Knolls, as a
                           unique populated place, but the data collected for the 2000 Census have
                           become somewhat outdated. Consequently, information on current
                           households, household size, and population for Castro Valley is based
                           on the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency’s (CMA)
                           2005 data, which do include Five Canyons and, therefore, provide a
                           more accurate representation of Castro Valley’s current status. These
                           data are based on the Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG)
                           2002 projections for job and housing growth in the Bay Area.
                           Population Growth
                           According to the CMA, Castro Valley’s household population was
                           61,357 in 2005 including 2,523 in Five Canyons and an estimated
                           1,158 in Hillcrest Knolls. The 2000 Census reported that about 1,520
                           persons, who comprised 2.5 percent of the total population, lived in
                           group quarters. Including this non-household population, the total
                           2005 planning area population was estimated to be 62,877. (The
                           relatively high proportion of the population living in group quarters
                           is probably associated with the institutional uses on the Fairmont
                           Campus. In comparison, only 1.9 percent of the total Alameda
                           County population lived in group quarters.)
                           The estimated 2005 planning area population represents an increase of
                           about 4.0 percent over the 2000 Census estimate of 60,488 and is far
                           less than the 29 percent increase the area has realized since the 1990
                           Census, when the population was 48,619. Historically, the population
                           increased rapidly during and after World War II, from approximately
                           5,000 before the war to 18,000 by 1950. The population continued
                           to grow, doubling by 1960, and reaching 45,749 by 1970. The 1980s
                           brought a temporary decline in population but the extremely strong
                           housing market in the Bay Area during the 1990s and early 2000s has
                           made places like Castro Valley very attractive, and the population is
                           still growing.

Between 1990 and 2000, Castro Valley added more population
than any other unincorporated community in Alameda County but
its growth rate, which has averaged about 1.93 percent a year since
1990, is now slower than Cherryland-Fairview and Ashland. Since the
1980s, the community has grown more slowly than the countywide
population, a trend that ABAG projects will continue. Today, Castro
Valley, including Five Canyons, accounts for just over 4 percent of
Alameda County’s population. See Chart 3.1-1. CMA estimates the
current population of the Five Canyons area to be about 3,000 and
expects the population to increase to about 3,500 by 2025.
ABAG (2005) projected that between the years 2005 and 2025,
Alameda County’s population will increase by 18.4 percent, from
1,517,100 to 1,796,300 people. Castro Valley is projected to grow
by 7.9 percent, an average annual growth rate of less than .4 percent,
during the same period. This reflects the reality that the community is
becoming increasingly built out, since there are no large undeveloped
acreages within the urban growth boundary established by Measure D.

                                           communities. However, while Castro Valley will continue to be home
                                           to many older households, young families and smaller households
                                           are likely to move in to take advantage of the community’s central
                                           location within the job centers of the East Bay, quality of life, and
                                           good schools.
                                           Based on the 2000 Census, there were an estimated 23,066 households
                                           in the Castro Valley Planning Area (including Five Canyons and
                                           Hillcrest Knolls) with an average household size of 2.67 persons, an
                                           increase from 1980, when households averaged 2.53, but still smaller
                                           than nearby communities. In contrast, there were 2.70 persons in the
                                           average Alameda County household. Households were also larger in
                                           San Lorenzo (2.92), Cherryland (2.87), and Fairview (2.84). Based
                                           on CMA estimates, in 2005, Castro Valley had 23,226 households
                                           with an average household size of 2.64. Chart 3.1-2 shows how the
                                           community’s household size has changed over the years.
                                           Despite the fact that Castro Valley and the county as a whole have
                                           the same proportion of population between the ages of 5 and 19
                                           (20.3 percent), the median age of Castro Valley residents is higher
                                           (39.4 years compared with 34.5 countywide) because of the larger
                                           percentage of elderly residents. Almost 15 percent of Castro Valley’s

residents are 65 years of age and older compared with 10.2 percent
countywide. About 60 percent of the community’s residents are
between the ages of 20 and 64 compared with almost 63 percent
county wide. Chart 3.1-3 shows the age distribution in Castro Valley
versus Alameda County as a whole.
The median age of Castro Valley residents increased from 35.5 in
1980 to 39.4 in 2000 indicating that an increasing proportion of the
planning area’s population is made up of older adults, a trend that
is likely to continue in the future. One reason for this characteristic
may be that many of Castro Valley’s long-time residents choose to
remain in the community while the rate of population increase from
in-migration and natural increase have been somewhat lower than the
countywide average.

                                              proportion of non-white Castro Valley residents, the community
                                              continues to be relatively homogenous. In 1980, 92 percent of the
                                              residents were white, 7.5 percent Latino and about 2 percent African-

Housing Units
The 2000 Census reported a total of 23,051 dwelling units in Castro Valley (including Five Canyons), about
a 9 percent increase from 1990. The vacancy rate was 1.8 percent compared with 3.1 percent countywide
indicating the strength of the housing market. See Table 3.1-1.

Housing Types
Housing is the predominant land use in Castro Valley and the area’s residential neighborhoods are its most
prominent feature. As of the 2000 Census, most of the housing in the planning area (71.9 percent) was in
single family detached structures and another 8 percent of the dwellings are in two-unit buildings. About
18.5 percent of the area’s housing is in multi-family buildings that contain three or more housing units.
The multi-family units, townhouses, and mobile homes are generally located closer to the Central Business
District between Somerset and Castro Valley Boulevard, along Redwood Road, and south of I-580 along
Grove Way. About 2 percent of the housing units are mobile homes, most of which are in nine mobile home
parks; all but one of the parks are on Castro Valley Boulevard. This is one of the largest clusters of mobile
homes in Alameda County. Table 3.1-2 summarizes this breakdown.
                                                                                                              3-7

                           Almost 85 percent of all units were constructed before 1990, the
                           majority of which were built between 1940 and 1959. About 11
                           percent were built during the 1980s, and another 15.3 percent during
                           the 1990s. Close to half of the newest units are in the Five Canyons
                           development.
                           Jobs
                           Castro Valley is primarily a residential community, with more employed
                           residents than jobs. The CMA estimated 9,276 jobs in the planning area
                           in 2005—almost 3.4 employed residents for every job. Castro Valley
                           is also expected to have a lower rate of job growth than the county
                           as a whole, again due to limited availability of land. In 2005, ABAG
                           projected that the number of jobs in Alameda County would increase by
                           36 percent, from 750,160 in 2000 to 1,021,960 in 2025. During the same
                           period, the number of jobs in Castro Valley was expected to grow by a
                           about 11 percent.
                           According to the projections done by ABAG in 2005, just over half of the
                           jobs based in Castro Valley are in the services sector including personal
                           and business services as well as health, education, and recreation, which
                           is indicative of the importance of the Fairmont Campus facilities as
                           well as Sutter Medical Center. Many of the other jobs in this category
                           are school district employees. Another 18.6 percent of Castro Valley
                           jobs are in the financial and professional sector. Retail employment
                           represents a relatively small proportion of the community’s job base—
                           only 9.2 percent in 2005 compared with 11.1 percent countywide. In
                           fact, ABAG reports that the actual number of retail jobs dropped from
                           1,723 in 1980 to 1,270 in 2000. Although ABAG projected an 11.2
                           percent increase in the number of jobs in Castro Valley, the proportion
                           of retail jobs is expected to decline. Meanwhile, the proportion of jobs
                           in the services sector is projected to increase.

3.2	 Community Development Strategy
Infill residential and commercial development can continue to occur
in Castro Valley without changing the fundamental character of the
entire community. There is capacity throughout the community to add
small residential projects on residentially zoned properties. There are
sites in the downtown recently designated for higher density housing,
which is consistent with community and regional “smart growth”
goals of encouraging housing near transit and community services.
There are many small commercial properties that have not been
renovated in many years, and the community would benefit overall
from renovation and new development in downtown and along the
commercial corridors.
The following principles outline the overall community development
strategy:
•	   Continue to allow infill residential development to occur
     throughout the community. Accommodate a wide variety of
     housing types and households – small subdivisions of single
     family lots, “small-lot” subdivisions for detached homes;
     townhouses; rowhouses; condominiums and apartments.
•	   Maintain the character of the existing neighborhoods when
     allowing infill with home additions, and secondary units. There
     is no need for major increases or decreases in allowed density,
     except in cases where there are significant biological resources
     on the property.
•	   In areas where medium density housing or a mix of
     residential densities exist, clarify the desired character and
     density of whole neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods in
     the General Plan and Zoning, rather than considering density
     changes piecemeal through Planned Unit Developments and
     individual site re-zonings.
•	   Encourage the renovation of older commercial development,
     and the development of new commercial uses that provide
     retail, restaurants, services, and employment.

Castro Valley General Plan
                           Areas for Infill Residential Development
                           Over the past twenty years, there have been a few major large
                           subdivisions and a wide variety of smaller infill development projects.
                           Homes in the major subdivisions are much larger in scale than the
                           older single family homes built from the 1950’s through 1980’s.
                           Future residential development in Castro Valley will consist primarily
                           of the smaller projects, because most of the large acreages within the
                           urbanized area established by Measure D have been developed. In
                           addition, there have been a number of subdivisions on narrow deep
                           lots, creating detached single family homes or townhomes on small
                           lots along a private driveway. There have also been single family
                           homes built behind existing homes on deep lots, creating new “flag
                           lots.”
                           The primary areas where there is capacity for infill residential
                           development are shown in Figure 3-1, Community Development
                           Strategy, and further described below:
                           •	   Small Single Family Subdivisions on Existing Large Lots.
                                Existing large lots exist in areas currently designated for single
                                family development, where one lot can be divided into a few
                                smaller lots. Minimum lot sizes for new subdivisions should be
                                established in the zoning, based on slope conditions, access lim-
                                itations, biological resources, and prevailing lot size. In some
                                areas where very small lots already exist, minimum lot sizes can
                                be reduced below 5,000 square feet.
                           •	   Housing Element Sites. The 2003 Alameda County Housing
                                Element designated sites in the downtown and scattered in
                                neighborhoods for multifamily development at densities from
                                40 to 60 units per acre. These are opportunity sites for infill resi-
                                dential development that will benefit from access to downtown,
                                BART, bus, retail, and services.
                           •	   Mixed Housing Type Areas Near Business Districts. There
                                are several areas near commercial centers in Castro Valley that
                                currently include medium and higher density housing as well
                                as lower density housing. The primary area is north of Castro
                                Valley Boulevard to Somerset, between Lake Chabot Road and
                                Redwood Road. Others are located close to Redwood Road,
                                Grove Way, and Foothill Boulevard. These areas are well served
                                by roadways and transit and have easy pedestrian access to
                                shopping and services. It is appropriate to allow new medium
                                and high density development in these areas, provided that lot

   dimensions can accommodate higher density development and
   meet development standards and design criteria.
•	 Vacant Sites. There remain small vacant sites in Castro Valley
   where infill residential development can be accommodated.
Areas for Commercial Renovation and Development
•	 Central Business District Redevelopment Opportunity Sites.
   There are many sites in the Central Business District (CBD)            Small vacant site in Castro Valley.
   where renovation and redevelopment should be encouraged so
   that restaurants, retail, entertainment, and services are available
   to community residents. Opportunity sites have been identified
   in conjunction with preparation of the Redevelopment Strategic
   Plan (2006).
•	 Potential Renovation or Rebuilding Sites. There are other
   sites in the Central Business District and the Eden Area
   Redevelopment Project Area outside the CBD that are smaller
   and may not have as much potential for new development, but            Infill sites in the Central Business District
   still are appropriate for renovation and rebuilding.                   are being redeveloped for new retail and
                                                                          service uses.
•	 Hospital and Medical Office/Retail District. During the
   course of the 20 year planning period, the hospital must be
   rebuilt to comply with State seismic standards. This will involve
   a major rebuilding and renovation of facilities on the hospital
   campus. There are sites within the campus, and surrounding
   properties, where further infill commercial development is
   appropriate to support this major community facility and
   employer.
•	 Neighborhood Commercial. There are several very small sites            Underused sites around the Medical Center
                                                                          can be redeveloped for health-related uses.
   within residential neighborhoods that have long been occupied
   with small neighborhood-serving commercial uses. These sites
   would benefit from renovation, provided that it fits in with the
   scale of the neighborhoods.
                                                                          Neighborhood commercial sites should be
                                                                          retained for commercial or development.
                                                                                                                     3-11

Castro Valley General Plan
                                  Areas Where Special Planning Efforts Are Needed
                                  •	 Madison-Common Specific Plan Area. This area has very
                                     limited access for automobiles and emergency vehicles due to
                                     narrow streets, as well as steep slopes and significant biologi-
                                     cal resources. Thus future development in this area should be
                                     limited, as per the provisions of the Specific Plan.
                                  •	 Cull Creek Canyon. This area contains a major creek and has
                                     significant biological resources as well as steep slopes. Thus,
Madison-Common Specific Plan Area
                                     development in this area should be limited to protect these sen-
                                     sitive areas.
                                  •	 Fairmont Area. This 204-acre area is controlled by Alameda
                                     County for such uses as the Juvenile Justice Center, animal
                                     shelter, and Sheriff Department Facility. In addition, The
                                     Alameda County Medical Center (ACMC), and the Health
                                     Care and Behavioral Health Care facilities are located in the
                                     Fairmont Area. Approximately 30 percent of the area is not suit-
                                     able for structures as the Hayward fault runs through the area.
Cull Creek Canyon                 •	 EBMUD Site. The East Bay Municipal Utilities District owns
                                     a 24-acre parcel at Sydney Way, Stanton and Carlton Avenues,
                                     which is zoned for single family development. Steep slopes con-
                                     strain access to the flatter parts of the site that may be suitable
                                     for development.
                                  •	 John Drive Area. Despite its proximity to Interstate 580 and
                                     Castro Valley Boulevard, development of vacant lands in the
                                     southwestern part of Castro Valley, north of the Neighborhood
                                     Church, will be hampered by steep slopes and poor access.
                                  •	 Jensen Road Area. Formerly part of the Jensen Ranch, this
Fairmont Campus Area                 area is characterized by grassland vegetation that serves as an
                                     important natural habitat and migration route for animals. Steep
                                     slopes and adjacency to I-580 require that special planning be
                                     done to ensure resources are protected.

3.3	 2025 PROJECTIONS: GENERAL PLAN
         “BUILDOUT”
Based on the overall community development strategy, detailed land
use proposals that follow in Chapter 4, and the community character
and design analysis contained in Chapter 5, a detailed set of growth
projections were prepared for the twenty year planning horizon of
the General Plan. Full development under the proposed General Plan
is referred to as “buildout.” Although the General Plan applies a 20-
year planning horizon, it does not specify or anticipate when or where
buildout will actually occur; the designation of a site for a certain use
does not necessarily mean the site will be built or redeveloped with
that use in the next 20 years. Buildout does not reflect the maximum
capacity that the planning area could theoretically accommodate based
on the General Plan, but rather the most likely level of development
based on trends, permit history, demographic characteristics, and a
variety of other relevant factors that are discussed below.
This General Plan designates new land use classifications for some
areas of Castro Valley. In contrast to much of Castro Valley’s past
growth, new housing units will be added through infill development,
primarily from the redevelopment of under-built sites, additional units
on lots that are already developed, and some development on vacant
lots. As shown in Table 3.3-1, the proposed General Plan would add
around 2,394 households, increasing the total number of households
in Castro Valley to 25,620 by 2025. This would result in a population
of approximately 67,191 people at buildout, an increase of less than
10 percent over the estimated 2005 population.
Over a 20-year period, the addition of about 5,834 people represents
an average annual growth rate of 0.5 percent, a lower rate than that
experienced by Castro Valley over the last 15 years (1990-2005),
which was approximately 1.6 percent.
Average household size is expected to remain steady, decreasing
slightly from 2.64 people per household in 2005 to 2.62 in 2025.
However, the future population estimates shown in Table 3.3-1
assume an average household size of 2.62 over the course of the
planning period in order to be slightly more conservative when
estimating Castro Valley’s future population.
                                                                                                           3-15

1. E stimates of households, household size, and population are based on the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency’s
    2005 data, which are considered to be the most accurate representation of Castro Valley’s current status. This data is based
   on ABAG’s 2002 projections for job and housing growth in the Bay Area, which are similar in methodology to ABAG’s 2005
   projections. For household size, we have assumed an average household size of 2.62, in order to exercise caution in buildout
   estimates, although by the end of the planning period the average size is projected to be 2.60, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Assumes an average household size of 2.62, in order to exercise caution in buildout estimates.
3. A vacancy rate of 2 percent is assumed in calculating future households, based on a vacancy rate of 1.8 percent, as reported in
   the 2000 US Census.
4. T o project population at buildout, the number of new housing units was added to current housing units. Households were then
    calculated by multiplying total housing units by 0.98 to take the assumed 2 percent vacancy rate into account. The households
    were then multiplied by the assumed average household size.

                                                   Residential Development
                                                   The expected residential growth rates are based on a weighted
                                                   average of recent residential development rates in Castro Valley.
                                                   Between 1990 and 2000, there was an average of 167 units built per
                                                   year; between 2001 and 2003 the average was 99 units per year; and
                                                   between 2004 and 2005 the average was only 32 units per year. The
                                                   15 year average annual rate was 135 units built per year between 1990
                                                   and 2005. However, growth rates from 1990 to 2005 included several
                                                   very large subdivisions, and with the new Urban Growth Boundary
                                                   established by Measure D, there are no large sites remaining that can
                                                   be subdivided.
                                                   Based on the development anticipated under the parcel-level
                                                   development potential analysis, The projected buildout rate is
                                                   approximately 100 units per year. This projected rate takes into
                                                   account the pace of development over the past 16 years, the fact
                                                   that higher residential densities have recently been adopted for the
                                                   downtown, and also the many factors that limit housing development
                                                   on individual sites in Castro Valley. These include restrictions due
                                                   to slope and biological resources, limited access to some lots, the
                                                   number of people willing to subdivide their lots, a constraint on the
                                                   number of new units that can be absorbed in a year, and difficulty
                                                   in adding units to existing building configurations and meeting

parking and frontage requirements. All of these factors severely limit
residential development and, as a result, just 15 percent of maximum
possible residential construction is expected to occur.
Single Family Development Potential
New single-family units will primarily be created through the
subdivision of existing single-family lots, most of which already
include one unit. Outside of the Central Business District, about
1,000 new single-family units are expected to be added to Castro           Existing mobile home parks in the CBD
Valley by 2025.                                                            are potential sites for new multi-family
                                                                           residential or mixed-use development.
Multifamily Development Potential
Outside of the Central Business District, about 430 new multi-family
units are projected to be added to Castro Valley over the next 20 years.
Secondary Units Development Potential
Secondary units are expected to be added at a rate of around five per
year, which is slightly higher than the rate of 3.25 per year added
between 2002 and 2006, and assumes that secondary units will be
built on one percent of single-family lots that can accommodate them.
Around 100 new accessory units are expected to be added by 2025.
Downtown Development Potential
Within Castro Valley’s Central Business District, residential
development is expected to occur at a higher rate as sites have
recently been rezoned to allow for denser, mixed-use development.
The analysis studied the ratio of the value of improvements to the
value of land in order to identify opportunity sites for development.
Depending on the size and existing structures on the opportunity sites
within different sub-areas of downtown, development is expected
to occur on between 25 and 100 percent of the opportunity sites.
Around 900 new housing units are expected to be added in the
Central Business District, almost doubling the housing stock in
that area and accounting for 37 percent of Castro Valley’s expected
residential growth.

                                           Employment Growth
                                           Castro Valley is projected to accommodate approximately 1,608 new
                                           jobs within the community at buildout, an increase of 17 percent over
                                           the Alameda County CMA’s estimate of 9,276 jobs in the community
                                           as of 2005. This job growth will occur from a combination of more
                                           commercial floor area being developed, the renovation of Eden
                                           Medical Center Castro Valley, growth in local public sector jobs,
                                           and more residents working from home or starting home-based
                                           businesses. About half of the new jobs will be located in Castro
                                           Valley’s Central Business District (CBD). Most of the other new jobs

                                           home or from other jobs based in private residences but performed
                                           by non-residents. The breakdown of new employment is shown in

Opportunity Sites in Commercial Areas
About 42 percent of the projected new employment (812 jobs) will
be generated by an estimated net increase of 200,000 square feet
in Castro Valley’s commercial floor area, which represents about
a 20 percent increase above the community’s current commercial
floor area of 1.04 million square feet. This amount of development
corresponds with economic demand analyses undertaken for the
Existing Conditions report and the Redevelopment Strategic Plan
(Alameda County Community Development Agency, completed
December 2005) which estimate that over the next 20 years Castro
Valley would experience demand for approximately 150,000 square
feet of new retail space, 15,000 square feet of medical office space,
40,000 square feet of other office space, and 5,000 square feet of
neighborhood retail space.
There are three types of areas where commercial development will
likely occur in Castro Valley: around the BART station, in mixed use
projects elsewhere in the CBD, and on other sites that are developed
for a variety of exclusively commercial uses. Table 3.3-4 shows the
anticipated extent of development of each, taking into account the
loss of existing commercial floor space in the CBD due to demolition
for redevelopment for housing and other uses.

Castro Valley General Plan
                                           To calculate the buildout, assumptions were made about the
                                           intensity and mix of development in each location:
                                           •	   The BART site is designated to allow a mix of uses. It was
                                                assumed that development within this area build out to the
                                                maximum intensity permitted, with 20 percent of the structures
                                                being used for non-residential space and the remainder for
                                                housing.
                                           •	   For mixed-use sites in the CBD, it was assumed that retail
                                                would be placed on the ground floor of the structure, with a
                                                depth of 80 feet or less.
                                           •	   For the other commercial sites, an average FAR of 0.35 is the
                                                typical density of a single story commercial structure with
                                                surface parking.
A very small number of new jobs are
anticipated at the Medical Center, since
the hospital does not plan to increase the Eden Medical Center Castro Valley
number of beds.
                                           Eden Medical Center does not project any increase in total employment
                                           because the hospital does not plan to increase the number of beds.
                                           An increase of 100 jobs was assumed, since the hospital is planning
                                           to rebuild its facilities, and more modern facilities may attract more
                                           doctors and patients. The General Plan also creates a Hospital and
                                           Medical Office District and includes policies intended to optimize the
                                           role of the Medical Center as a catalyst for health-related development.
                                           Other Employment
                                           The 2000 Census reported that 3.7 percent of Castro Valley’s employed
                                           residents worked from home. The General Plan projects that the number
                                           of residents who work at home will increase to 5 percent in both existing
                                           and new units, based on increasing demand and technology available
                                           for working from home. This means that close to 2000 employed
                                           Castro Valley residents will be working from home in 2025. Assuming
                                           that about half of the existing employed residents will be shifting from
                                           other jobs in the planning area, about 570 or the new jobs will be home
                                           occupations, or as much as 35 percent of Castro Valley’s job growth.
                                           A similar category is home-based employment, which includes jobs
                                           like gardeners and cleaning services. Home-based employment is
                                           expected in one of every 8 new households, which will create 259
                                           new jobs, or 18 percent of the job growth. Because some of these
                                           positions are part-time jobs that are filled by persons who work in
                                           more than one household, the number of new home-based jobs is
3-20

                                                                   Chapter 3 | Community Development Strategy
estimated at about 90 or 6 percent of the increased planning area
employment.
School employment is expected to increase slightly (36 jobs), to
reflect minimal increases in the total number of students over the next
20 years based on projected demographic trends.
Employed Residents per Household
In addition to an increase in jobs located within Castro Valley, it is
expected that households in the community will contain a higher
number of employees per household on average. Alameda County’s
Congestion Management Program estimates that as of 2005, Castro
Valley had 31,233 employed residents in 23,226 households, for a
rate of 1.34 employed residents per household. This General Plan
anticipates that by 2025, Castro Valley will have 38,462 employed
residents in 25,620 households, for a rate of 1.50 employed residents
per household. This reflects demographic trends, which include: new
young families moving in taking the place of older residents that
retire; and an increased number of workers per household due to high
housing costs.
This change is not accompanied by a significant shift in average
household size, so the increase in employed residents per household is
primarily a function of an increase in the proportion of residents with
jobs. This increase in employed residents per household may affect
traffic volumes, although the impact will depend on the location and
hours of these jobs.
                                                                                                         3-21

Land Use and
Development
This chapter contains the detailed land use and development policies
that will guide future development in Castro Valley over the next
twenty years. Action items specify changes that need to be made
to the existing Zoning Code, Subdivision Code, and project review
processes to implement the policies. Because Castro Valley is an
urbanized area where new growth will happen through smaller infill
development projects, the policies are very detailed and specific to
certain neighborhoods, districts, and building types. The overarching
goal for land use and development is to continue to allow infill
housing and add new retail, restaurants, services, and employment,
while preserving and enhancing the small town character of Castro
Valley.
                                                                      4-1

                           4.1	 EXISTING LAND USE
                           Land use in Castro Valley is primarily residential. Commercial uses
                           are concentrated along Castro Valley Boulevard, along Redwood
                           Road and Grove Way, and in several neighborhood shopping centers.
                           Public and quasi-public uses, such as schools, libraries, and churches,
                           are spread throughout the area, adjacent to both commercial and
                           residential uses.
                           Interstate 580 divides Castro Valley into its northern and southern
                           halves; from west to east, Lake Chabot Road, and Redwood Road
                           provide the major north-south connections. Crow Canyon Road is
                           the other major arterial running east-west and connecting Central
                           Castro Valley with San Ramon and eastern Alameda County.
                           Figure 4-1 illustrates Castro Valley’s existing land use and vacant
                           land as of 2010.
                           Castro Valley’s Planning Area encompasses 6,880 acres, with 54
                           percent devoted to residential uses, as shown on Chart 4.1-1, Existing

family development and 20 acres for mobile homes. Commercial,
medical/dental services and industrial/auto-related land uses occupy
approximately 3 percent of Castro Valley’s land area. Public and
quasi-public land uses, including schools, churches, and public facilities,
comprise about 12 percent of the land area. Parks and open space occupy
11 percent. About 257 acres, or 4 percent of the planning area, are vacant.

4.2	 LAND USE PLAN
The amount of growth anticipated over the next twenty years in Castro
Valley can generally be accommodated without major changes to the
existing land use designations or substantial increases in permitted
densities. Opportunities for residential development exist on vacant lots,
and on lots in the upper and lower hillside areas that are large enough
to be subdivided into two to four lots. Infill residential development is
also possible in the downtown area and in multifamily neighborhoods
north and south of I-580. Within the downtown, substantial additional
commercial square footage can be developed because most of the
properties are currently built at far less intensity than permitted under
the Castro Valley CBD Specific Plan.

Castro Valley General Plan
                                          The focus of the General Plan effort has been to formulate more detailed
                                          land use and density regulations that reflect a deeper understanding
                                          of existing conditions, community character, environmentally
                                          sensitive areas, and new types of residential development. The
                                          General Plan Land Use Map (Figures 4-2 and 4-3) and Land Use
                                          Classification Tables (Tables 4.2-1A, -1B, and -1C) contained in this
                                          section represent a comprehensive revision to the land use regulatory
                                          framework, tailored specifically to Castro Valley. The Land Use Map
                                          is structured to function as a new zoning map for Castro Valley. The
Opportunities for residential development
exist on vacant lots in Castro Valley.    Land Use tables and policies of this chapter provide detailed guidance
                                          to revise the zoning ordinance provisions for land use, density, and
                                          development standards.
                                          Figure 4-4, Substantive Zoning Changes, shows locations where
                                          the new Land Use Map will require changes to the County Zoning
                                          districts.

LAND USE PLAN GOAL
 GOAL 4.2-1	   Promote a land use pattern that will meet the
               community’s development needs in a manner that
               protects desired community character and valued
               resources.
LAND USE PLAN POLICY
 Policy 4.2-1	 Comprehensive Land Use Regulatory System.
               Prepare a comprehensive regulatory system of
               land uses with standards that achieve the desired
               vision for the community while respecting the exist-
               ing conditions and environmentally sensitive areas.
LAND USE PLAN ACTIONS
 Action 4.2-1	 Revise the Alameda County Zoning Code. Revise
               the Alameda County Zoning Code to reflect the
               land use classifications described in Table 4.2-1.
 Action 4.2-2	 Revise the Alameda County Zoning Map. Revise
               the Alameda County Zoning Map to reflect the Land
               Use Classifications shown in Figure 4-2, Castro
               Valley General Plan Land Use.
                •	 Use Figure 4-4, Substantive Zoning Changes,
                    as the guide for rezoning.
                •	 Adopt the General Plan Land Use Map as
                    the interim Zoning Map for Castro Valley until
                    such time as the official Alameda County
                    Zoning Map is amended.
 Action 4.2-3	 Development Standards. In order to achieve the
               desired character and variety of development,
               amend the County subdivision and zoning ordi-
               nances to be consistent with the General Plan land
               use classifications and adopted design policies.
                                                                                                     4-23

                              4.3	 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
                              A wide variety of residential development types will be built in Castro
                              Valley over the next twenty years, including: single family homes,
                              small lot single-family dwellings, townhomes, row houses, and multi-
                              family residential apartments, and condominiums. Existing zoning
                              regulations do not have provisions tailored to different building types,
                              and there are not currently design standards or guidelines to use in
                              project design and review. There is no coordinated set of standards
Small lot single family homes
                              or guidelines for private streets and driveways. Existing standards
                              do not differentiate between flat sites and hillside areas, and do not
                              specifically address the long deep lots that are prevalent in certain
                              areas of Castro Valley. The review process also needs to be improved.
                              Residents want the review process to be straightforward and easily
                              understandable for homeowners, but they also want standards to
                              ensure that new buildings are compatible with existing development.
                              In order for new housing to enhance existing neighborhoods
                              (Figure 4-5) and be compatible with adjoining neighbors, more
Town homes and row homes      detailed development standards and design guidelines are needed.
                              As new development is tucked in among existing buildings,
                              careful attention needs to be paid to site planning and building
                              massing so that there is adequate sunlight, open space, and
                              privacy. Clearly defined development standards for building
                              facades, front yards, and parking will preserve and enhance
                              street appearance and character of residential neighborhoods.

                                         Schools, churches, day care, senior centers, and other community
                                         facilities provide essential services to residents, and locating them
                                         within residential neighborhoods allows easy access, especially for
                                         children, the elderly, and others who do not drive. The civic uses and
                                         community facilities in Castro Valley are generally located within
                                         residential neighborhoods and are primarily concentrated in the
                                         lower areas below Somerset Avenue and Heyer Avenue. There are
                                         also many after-school programs operated at public school sites.
                                         Sometimes these uses impact neighbors during peak periods of drop-
                                         off and pick-up, or when performances or events occur. It is important
                                         to support these uses, because they provide essential services, and
                                         to establish physical design and operational strategies to minimize
                                         impacts on neighbors. Chapter 8 provides more detailed strategies
                                         related to civic uses and community facilities within residential
                                         neighborhoods and throughout Castro Valley.

                                              community. In 2009, less than 5 percent of the planning area was
                                              developed with commercial uses. However, ABAG has projected
                                              that the number of jobs in the community will increase by more than
                                              10 percent between 2000 and 2025. Existing commercial areas and
                                              land uses should, therefore, be maintained and proposals to redevelop
                                              designated commercial areas for more intensive use should be
                                              supported.
                                              Castro Valley’s economy is largely based on the provision of goods
                                              and services for local residents. Although Castro Valley is situated
                                              at a very central location within the East Bay with easy access from
                                              the freeway, large employers (except for government and health-
                                              related facilities) and regional commercial uses have not located in
                                              the area, partly due to limited availability of large sites. More than
                                              half of the jobs in Castro Valley are in the fields of health, education,
                                              and recreation, related to Castro Valley Unified School District,
                                              Alameda County and Eden Medical Centers, and the County’s
                                              Fairmont campus. The other half are related primarily to commercial
                                              businesses in the Central Business District and along major corridors
                                              like Redwood Road, Grove Way, and East Castro Valley Boulevard.
                                              The vast majority of businesses are small retail, restaurant, auto
                                              repair, and personal services. Many are small local businesses.
                                              The overarching goal for the area’s economic development is to attract
                                              retail, restaurants, and other services that the community desires.
                                              Community residents feel very strongly that there is a shortage of
                                              retail and restaurant choices in their community. Data about where
                                              people shop and retail sales tax leakage support that statement.

Residents also indicate that they would like to retain and support
the small local businesses that contribute to the unique character of
Castro Valley.
Attracting and facilitating new employment opportunities to Castro
Valley would also benefit the environment by potentially reducing
the number of commute trips and traffic congestion. A strategy
to reduce traffic congestion and support family life is to facilitate
home occupations. With continuing technology improvements, it is
easier for people to work from home. Alameda County can support            Most businesses in the Central Business

4.6	 NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL USES
Neighborhood commercial establishments enhance the quality of life
for surrounding residential neighborhoods by providing goods and
services to meet daily needs. They also foster a sense of community
by creating a neighborhood focal point where people meet on a
regular basis. As shown in Figure 4-5, there are several areas of
                                                                            Develop proactive programs to promote
                                                                            small, local businesses.
neighborhood commercial uses, most of which are small commercial
sites embedded within residential neighborhoods near schools and
parks. Small convenience stores, small restaurants, and personal
services such as hair salons or fitness studios are typically located in
these areas.
These sites are highly valued by the community and should be
maintained for commercial uses. However many of the buildings
are older and have not been substantially renovated in recent years.
Some of the businesses find it difficult to generate enough revenue to
invest in major improvements, as they are small in scale and cannot
compete with large chain stores. Property owners, business owners,
and community members need to work together to renovate and
improve the properties and support these small local businesses.

Castro Valley General Plan
                                           4.7	 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
                                           The Central Business District (CBD) covers more than 350 acres
                                           and is Castro Valley’s downtown. Castro Valley Boulevard is the
                                           community’s “Main Street.” A comprehensive Specific Plan was
                                           approved in January 1993 that contains land use regulations and
                                           design standards, and recommends streetscape improvements for
                                           Castro Valley Boulevard. In 2006, the Redevelopment Strategic Plan
                                           (Figure 4-6) was prepared that contains:
Preserve existing neighborhood commercial
sites.                                     •	   streetscape improvements design;
                                           •	   catalyst project recommendations; and
                                           •	   other policy recommendations for the core business district.
                                           The General Plan policies have been prepared based on these
                                           documents. Figure 4-7 illustrates the key features of the CBD Land
                                           Use and Development Strategy.
                                           Commercial uses are concentrated in the community’s Central
                                           Business District (CBD) along Castro Valley Boulevard, on Lake
                                           Chabot Road north to Eden Medical Center, and along Redwood Road
Encourage     renovation     and/or    new south to the Hayward city limits. Commercial uses in the CBD include
development     on    larger  neighborhood a mixture of local and neighborhood retail, commercial, recreation,
commercial sites at Lake Chabot Road/Quail
and at Heyer Avenue/Center Street.         office, auto-related services, and self-storage. Castro Village, one of
                                           the oldest shopping centers in Alameda County, is a favorite retail
                                           center in the central part of the CBD on Castro Valley Boulevard.
                                           Except for the commercial uses along Castro Valley Boulevard and
                                           a few parcels on Grove Way near Hayward, most of the commercial
                                           uses occupy relatively small parcels.
                                           Due to the large area, a important strategy for improving the CBD
                                           is to focus and cluster development into sub-areas to: reinforce a
                                           strong community identity; allow people to easily walk from one
                                           business to the other; and, attract a greater customer base than any
                                           one business can attract on its own. The major sub-areas include:
                                           the Downtown Core (formerly Specific Plan Sub-area 7); the Transit
                                           Village (formerly Specific Plan Sub-areas 8 and 9; the Theater and
                                           Entertainment Districts (formerly portions of Specific Plan Sub-
                                           areas 2 and 5); the Library District (formerly a portion of Specific
                                           Plan Sub-area 10); and the Professional-Medical District (formerly
                                           Specific Plan Sub-area 4), which is discussed in detail in the following
                                           sections.

Downtown Core
Currently, the core of the CBD is not a highly attractive pedestrian-
oriented environment. There are high volumes of traffic on Castro
Valley Boulevard because it is the main east-west artery for the whole
community but much of the traffic is going through the community
rather than to downtown destinations. There is a minimal amount
of street landscaping, street furniture, and other visual design
enhancements that would make the street comfortable and attractive
for pedestrians. Many buildings are older and have not been renovated
over the past twenty years. Many buildings are set back, with parking
                                                                             Limit auto service facilities in neighborhood
                                                                             commercial areas to light repair only.
in front, so there is not a continuous pedestrian shopping frontage.
Sites are small, and parking is limited in certain areas. Auto repair
uses predominate in some sub-areas.
Improving the CBD is one of the highest priority goals for Castro
Valley over the next 20 years. In order to meet this goal, the General
Plan land use designation is intended to implement the Redevelopment
Strategic Plan. The concept includes the development of more retail
along Castro Valley Boulevard and a village green. Some residential
uses would be allowed above or behind the commercial uses, while
parking would be located at the center of blocks or behind buildings.
New commercial space may support structured parking.
                                                                             Encourage renovation of older buildings.
Library District
As detailed in the Redevelopment Strategic Plan, the goal for the
area surrounding the Castro Valley Library is to create a mixed-use,
pedestrian-oriented district with housing, retail, office space, and the
Castro Valley Creek Park. The pedestrian and bicycle access to and
from the library should be improved.
Transit Village
The Castro Valley BART station is located directly south of the
Downtown Core on Interstate 580 near Redwood Road. BART owns a
large surface parking lot, which has potential for joint development of
transit-oriented, high density, mixed-use development with structured
parking. The general layout could include high density residential
uses with complementary retail and services north of Norbridge
Avenue; office and retail uses on the Redwood Road frontage; and
the public transit facilities, access, circulation, and parking structures
south of Norbridge Avenue.
                                                                                                                      4-37
Castro Valley General Plan
                                             There is also an opportunity to link the Transit Village with the
                                             existing office district which currently fronts on Redwood Road
                                             between the BART station and the Downtown Core. Currently, there
                                             are a number of medical and dental offices, as well as neighborhood-
                                             serving tax services, accountants, and realtors, in this area. These sites
                                             are opportunities for additional office and mixed use development
                                             near public transit.
                                             Another strategy for this area is to establish an infill opportunity zone.
                                             This zone would encompass the parcels within one-half of a mile
                                             from the Castro Valley BART Station. This area would receive special
                                             consideration related to residential density and parking requirements
                                             in order to facilitate transit-oriented development.
                                             Theater and Entertainment Districts
                                             Castro Valley has two important entertainment venues on Castro

                                             include expanding the theater, and adding restaurants, cafes, and
                                             music clubs to develop the area as an entertainment destination
                                             district. The area would feature sidewalk dining and consolidated
                                             parking behind the buildings.
                                             The miniature golf center is included in an area referred to as the
                                             West Gateway District in the Redevelopment Strategic Plan. The
                                             goal for this area is to maintain and enhance the existing regional
                                             entertainment destination. New community facilities, family
                                             entertainment uses, and retail uses could be added.

                           Eden Medical Center is the largest employer in Castro Valley, with

                                                              Chapter 4 | Land Use and Community Development
over 1,000 employees. It is a sub-regional employment center that has
the potential for attracting medical offices, medical support facilities,
and nursing homes.
Health-related uses predominate in the area around the Medical
Center but some general commercial uses exist on both side of Lake
Chabot Road south of the hospital and along San Carlos Street. These
include auto repair and service businesses that have been in the area
since the time when Castro Valley Boulevard was part of the State
highway system and the main access route to the Tri-Valley area to
the east.
Per State Law mandate, Eden Medical is in the process of rebuilding
the main hospital to comply with seismic safety standards.
Construction began in 2009 and is expected to be complete in 2013.
Having the hospital and related medical offices is a great asset to
the community, because good medical care is so close for Castro
Valley residents. However, because the hospital is a large institution,
it can have significant impacts on surrounding properties related to
traffic and other issues. The County has worked closely with the
Medical Center’s team to ensure that the new site layout is designed
to minimize impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods. In approving
Eden Health’s application for rebuilding the Medical Center, the
County approved amendments to the 1985 Castro Valley Plan and
the CBD Specific Plan to implement the project. These amendments
are incorporated in the updated Castro Valley General Plan. Figures
4-2 and 4-4, the General Plan Land Use Map and Substantive Zoning
Changes, illustrate these changes.
The goal for this area is to achieve a modern attractive professional
medical district, with complementary restaurants, shops, and services
that serve hospital patrons, medical staff, and the surrounding
community. Hospital employees help support local stores and
restaurants. In addition, there is a significant opportunity in this
district to attract new retail, restaurants, and services along Lake
Chabot Road, which would not only provide services and employment
opportunities but could also improve the appearance of the corridor.
                                                                                                        4-49

                                         4.9	 COMMUNITY AND GENERAL COMMERCIAL
Modernization of the Medical Center can
serve as a catalyst for health-related
                                                  DISTRICTS
development in the surrounding district.
                                         In addition to the strategies for Neighborhood Commercial districts,
                                         this section defines the strategies to maintain and improve areas with
                                         community and general commercial uses. Beyond the commercial
                                         uses found in the small neighborhood commercial districts and the
                                         Central Business District, most of the commercial land in Castro
                                         Valley is located south of Interstate 580, along the eastern portion of
                                         Castro Valley Boulevard, and on Foothill Boulevard. In addition to
                                         small strip centers with neighborhood commercial uses, these areas
                                         are characterized by general commercial and auto-oriented uses. The
                                         General Plan strategies for these areas include: concentrating the
                                         neighborhood commercial uses (as described above), maintaining
                                         sufficient land designated for commercial uses to support economic
                                         development efforts, and re-zoning to ensure compatibility between
                                         existing uses and residential neighborhoods. Figures 3-1 and 4-8
                                         identify the approaches the Plan proposes for Castro Valley’s different
                                         commercial areas.
                                         Existing general commercial and auto-reliant uses located in
                                         areas that the General Plan proposes for pedestrian-oriented,
                                         neighborhood commercial, or mixed-use development are considered
                                         nonconforming uses. They should be regulated to ensure that they do
                                         not preclude redevelopment for more appropriate commercial uses
                                         consistent with the General Plan and do not serve as a deterrent to
                                         investment in property improvement and redevelopment.

Redwood Road and Grove Way
Castro Valley’s popular Trader Joe’s anchors the shopping center at the
intersection of Redwood Road and Grove Way. Additional retail, services,
auto-related businesses, and restaurant uses occupy the shopping center
and the strip commercial developments fronting on Redwood Road. A
church is also part of the shopping center. The southerly side of Grove
Way is dominated by several large self-storage facilities. This existing
commercial development is inconsistent with the General Plan and the
property has characteristics that would enhance residential development,
such as proximity to creeks or open space. Close to Morales Court, there
are self-storage facilities intermixed with multi-family residential uses.
One strategy for this area is to limit new public storage uses near Morales
Court. Another strategy is to ensure that the area remains designated for
commercial uses. Therefore, the church site has been designated for
community commercial.
Redwood Road Corridor
Along the west side of Redwood Road, south of I-580, there are
medical, dental, and community-serving offices occupying converted
residential structures. In order to allow these uses to continue, this strip
has been designated Community Service and Offices. Adjacent to the
freeway, the existing office and storage uses provide a buffer between
the freeway traffic and single-family residential neighborhoods to the
south. The Community Commercial designation will allow these uses
to remain.
                                                                                 Support the development of a vibrant medical
                                                                                 office and commercial district that improves
                                                                                 the area’s appearance and creates a vibrant
Grove Way and Center Street                                                      district.
There is another cluster of general commercial uses at the intersection
of Grove Way and Center Street. The location of these sites near the
freeway, make them appropriate for general commercial uses such as
auto-reliant retail, fast food restaurants, gas stations, auto repair, and self-
service storage. Recent construction of multi-family residential uses on
the south side of Grove Way, east of Center Street, indicate that this area
be redesignated as residential land uses.
At the south end of Center Street near the intersection with Kelly
Street and B Street, there are a few sites with commercial uses
surrounded by residential uses. In order to provide a transition
between commercial uses in Hayward and residential uses in Castro
Valley, these sites have been designated Neighborhood Commercial.
                                                                                                                        4-53

                                         and other auto-reliant uses, which take advantage of good freeway and

Castro Valley General Plan
                                            4.10 	SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS
                                            There are several areas in Castro Valley that have significant remaining
                                            development potential and have conditions which require additional
                                            planning efforts such as steep slopes or biological resources. Special
                                            plans or regulations should be prepared to guide development in these
                                            areas. There are several types of planning documents that could serve
                                            this function. A Specific Plan requires policies governing circulation,
Madison-Common Specific Plan Area           land use, and infrastructure, and must include financing mechanisms.
                                            A Precise Plan establishes regulations specific to a particular site or
                                            group of properties, and provides detailed guidance regarding site
                                            access and circulation as well as development standards. Design
                                            guidelines can be prepared that guide site planning, lot configuration,
                                            building placement on lots, and other development standards.
                                            Madison-Common
                                            A Specific Plan for the Madison Avenue-Common Road area was
                                            prepared in the 1970’s and amended in 2006. The area is in the
                                            valley of a canyon, and portions of many lots have steep slopes. The
Steep slopes and poor access will constrain
development of vacant land on John Drive.   streets that serve this area are very narrow and pose limitations for
                                            emergency access vehicles. The area also has significant biological
                                            resources, contains a creek, and serves as a wildlife corridor.
                                            EBMUD Site
                                            The East Bay Municipal Utilities District owns a 24-acre parcel at
                                            Sydney Way, Stanton and Carlton Avenues, which is zoned for single
                                            family development. Steep slopes constrain access to the flatter parts
                                            of the site that may be suitable for development. The Plan proposes
                                            to require a detailed master plan or specific plan for development of
                                            the site, and to require land dedication rather than impact fees to meet
                                            open space requirements.
                                            John Drive Area
                                            Despite its proximity to Interstate 580 and Castro Valley Boulevard,
                                            development of vacant lands in the southwestern part of Castro Valley,
                                            north of the Neighborhood Church, will be hampered by steep slopes
                                            and poor access. Infill development of this area must be sensitive to
                                            the existing residential neighborhood and has to be planned to avoid
                                            overburdening local streets.

Crow Canyon Road Area
Crow Canyon Road is a scenic corridor through Crow Canyon and is
a gateway to the community that functions as an alternate route for
commuters from the San Ramon area. Development of the remaining
larger parcels must be sensitive to the area’s biological resources as
well as the corridor’s visual character. The oak riparian woodland
along Crow Creek serves as an important migration route and natural
habitat. Development will also be constrained by the steep terrain and
susceptibility to landslides and wildfires.                              Juvenile Justice Center.
Jensen Road Area
Development of the remaining vacant lands off Jensen Road must be
sensitive to the area’s steep topography and natural resource values.
Formerly part of the Jensen Ranch, this area is characterized by
grassland vegetation that serves as an important natural habitat and
migration route. In addition, portions of the parcels located south of
Jensen Road are adjacent to I-580. Regulations for new development
in this area should ensure that sensitive uses including residential
dwellings are designed and constructed to limit the potential noise      Fairmont Hospital.
and air quality impacts of the freeway.
Fairmont Area
The Fairmont Area comprises approximately 200 acres owned
by Alameda County. Currently the area is the site of the Juvenile
Justice Center, John George Hospital, Alameda County Medical
Center (ACMC), Sheriff’s Department, George Mark Hospice, and
other County facilities and community-based organizations. The
development potential of more than 60 acres of the Fairmont Area
is constrained by the Hayward fault, severe fire hazard potential,
susceptibility to land slides and other environmental features such as
riparian and grassland habitat areas.

Community Character
and Design
Castro Valley has a unique character that has evolved based on its
natural setting and its history. Residents of Castro Valley feel strongly
about preserving the character of Castro Valley, and enhancing the
aspects of it that they enjoy. This element contains policies and
actions to preserve and enhance the community character and design
of Castro Valley. The main features that define the desired character
of Castro Valley are:
•	  Natural Setting. The natural amenities that contribute Castro
    Valley’s quality of life include: hillsides, canyons, creeks, trees,  Castro Valley’s natural setting is a key
                                                                          feature of the community’s character.
    and the views of these natural resources.

Castro Valley General Plan
                                            •	 Neighborhood Character. There are physical features that
                                               reflect the agricultural and small-town character of Castro
                                               Valley before it became a suburban bedroom community. These
                                               include some remaining agricultural sites, undeveloped hillsides
                                               and canyons, neighborhoods with streets without curbs and
                                               sidewalks, and mature trees in front yards and along streets.
                                            •	 Downtown and Commercial Area Revitalization. 	
                                               Revitalizing the Central Business District (CBD) is one of
Mature trees in front yards and the lack of    the primary community objectives for the next 20 years. The
sidewalks along certain streets reflect the    shops, restaurants, and small businesses along Castro Valley
                                               Boulevard, along with the physical fabric of small buildings,
small-town character of Castro Valley.
                                               give Castro Valley a unique identity. Additional pedestrian
                                               access, new retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses, and major
                                               streetscape improvements are necessary to transform the CBD
                                               into the town center envisioned by the community. In addition
                                               to the CBD, there are pockets of commercial development in-
                                               termixed with the residential neighborhoods. Renovating these
                                               areas with new development and improvements is another top
                                               priority for the community.
                                            •	 Street Design: Gateways and Landscaping. Part of the long-
                                               term vision for the community is to improve the overall ap-

                                               Valley. Much of this objective can be accomplished through
                                               street design, gateways, and landscaping. There are several key
                                               locations where people enter Castro Valley, where gateways can
                                               provide a sense of arrival.
                                            •	 Community Gathering Places. While Castro Valley is not an
                                               incorporated city with a “Civic Center,” there are places where
                                               the community comes together that are identified uniquely
                                               with Castro Valley. These include the library, Castro Village
                                               Shopping Center, the post office, cafes located in the Central
                                               Business District, and other public and semi-public spaces.
                                            •	 Cultural Resources. Castro Valley has a number of older build-
                                               ings that reflect the different time periods of Castro Valley’s
                                               history. While only a handful may qualify as “historic resourc-
                                               es” according to State and federal definitions, these structures
                                               have value to Castro Valley as a local cultural resource because
                                               they give unique character to the community.
                                            Key recommendations are shown in Figure 5-1.

5.1	 natural setting
The topography of Castro Valley is a ring of hillsides surrounding a
sloping bowl. From most streets, there are views to the hillsides or
canyons of Castro Valley, which are covered with natural vegetation.
Thus, the natural setting of hillsides and canyons is an integral part of
community character. Many of the hillside areas have been preserved
as part of planned unit developments. Generally, housing is clustered
on the flatter areas of the property, while the steeper hillside areas are
                                                                              There are views to the hillsides from most
set aside as permanent open space. In order to preserve this serene           streets in Castro Valley.
and beautiful aspect of Castro Valley’s character, it is important to
preserve the views to these natural areas as infill development occurs.
It is also important to preserve the natural areas themselves, and limit
development on steep slopes. The implementation of the Biological
Resources Overlay Zone defined in Chapter 7 will also help ensure
that the natural setting is preserved.

5.2	NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER
Castro Valley is a collection of neighborhoods, as illustrated in Figure
4-5. The neighborhoods are defined by their schools and parks, the
basic geography of Castro Valley’s hills and bowl, and the major
roadways that divide different areas, such as I-580, Crow Canyon
Road, Lake Chabot Road, and Redwood Road. Residential densities
in neighborhoods range from less than one unit per net acre along
lower Greenridge Road to 14 dwellings per net acre south of I-580.
The average net residential density for the planning area is between 5
and 6 dwelling units per acre.
Figure 5-2 analyzes the physical form of a series of Castro Valley
neighborhoods based on aerial photographs, existing land use,
zoning, road structure, and intersections. The residential development
typologies highlighted are explained here, in generally chronological
order of development:
•	  The Multi-Family study area is just north of Castro Valley
    Boulevard and south of Somerset Avenue. Anita Avenue and
    San Miguel Avenue run north-south, connecting Castro Valley
    Boulevard with Somerset Avenue. Development in this area oc-
    curred gradually, from the layout of the lots in the 1920s to the
    construction of apartments through the 1980s.
•	  The Long Lots neighborhood is a testament to the agricultural
    heritage of Castro Valley. Long, narrow lots were originally
    used for chicken farming starting in the 1920s and continuing
    through the 1950s. Today, many of these lots are being subdi-
    vided. Private roads, like the very narrow one off Proctor in
    “street pattern” diagram, provide access to the new lots.
•	  Postwar “starter” homes laid out on a street grid can be found
    both west of the high school and south of I-580. The lots in
    these areas are smaller and very regular.
•	  Lot sizes in residential subdivisions developed from the 1960s
    through the 1990s tend to be fairly regular; street layouts are
    curvilinear, with a preponderance of cul-de-sacs. Many, like
    Columbia and Palomares Hills are planned developments (PD),
    which enable greater design flexibility by allowing deviations
    for development standards required by the zoning code and
    set aside substantial areas as permanent open space. The most
    recent neighborhood form study area shows a very dense PD off
    Sydney Way.
                                                                                                            5-7

                    way of measuring height that relates height limits
                    to the contours of the land. Require buildings to
                    step down following the slope of the lot.

                    the building height) so as to not be monumental
                    in scale or appearance.
               •	 Establish height limits for retaining walls of 4-6

Castro Valley General Plan
                           5.3 	 DOWNTOWN AND COMMERCIAL AREA
                                    REVITALIZATION
                           Central Business District
                           The creation of a pedestrian-friendly town center with a variety of
                           retail and services uses and public spaces, and improving Castro
                           Valley Boulevard are two of the highest priorities for the Castro Valley
                           community over the next 20 years. Residents would like to create a
                           true community center with an abundance of shops and restaurants,
                           an attractive comfortable walking environment, and public spaces
                           where the community comes together. To achieve these goals, Castro
                           Valley needs a multi-faceted program of streetscape improvements;
                           business retention and attraction; façade improvements; and catalyst
                           projects. This program is a top priority for the County Redevelopment
                           Agency’s efforts in Castro Valley. The General Plan builds on the
                           Central Business District Specific Plan and the Redevelopment CBD
                           Land Use and Development Strategy to guide the revitalization
                           process.
                           One important step has been the approval of the Redevelopment
                           Agency’s Strategic Plan, which includes a development strategy and
                           urban design proposals that will define a vision for the CBD and
                           improve the future economic potential for downtown Castro Valley.
                           The Plan’s objectives are to create:
                           •	  a downtown where people want to go and spend time;
                           •	  an environment that will support economic vitality;
                           •	  a pedestrian friendly main street atmosphere
                           The first phase of the Strategic Plan is a series of street improvements
                           intended to help turn Castro Valley Boulevard into a pedestrian-oriented
                           “Main Street” for the community. These improvements include
                           reconfiguring traffic lanes and providing on-street parking with bicycle
                           lanes that will maintain adequate traffic capacity on the Boulevard
                           while creating an inviting pedestrian environment. The first phase of
                           the project, between Redwood Road and San Miguel Avenue, features
                           widened sidewalks with ample seating areas, a canopy of street trees
                           and planter beds, landscaped bulb-outs, street furnishings and gateway
                           markers.

Other Commercial Areas
As described in the Land Use Chapter, there are a number of
general commercial and neighborhood commercial areas outside the
Central Business District. Many of these areas are auto-reliant strip
commercial centers and dominated by surface parking. Improving the
appearance of these areas will be accomplished over time through
renovation and redevelopment; façade improvement programs;
adoption and implementation of development standards and design
guidelines; and the enforcement of regulations and maintenance                 Improve Castro Valley Boulevard appearance

                                    LANDSCAPING
                           The primary roadways of Castro Valley are a major determinant of
                           community character, because every resident sees and experiences
                           those streets every day as they travel to and from their homes. The
                           arterials that carry large traffic volumes are not considered to be
                           particularly attractive, and improving them with additional landscaping
                           would greatly enhance community character. The commercial façades
                           along these arterials are also a significant determinant of community
                           character. While some buildings have been renovated over the years,
                           many have not and the building faces that front the streets look old
                           and in some cases dilapidated. Improving the building fronts with
                           new paint, signs, awnings, and materials would greatly enhance the
                           community character of Castro Valley.
                           Although previous efforts to create a welcome sign for the community
                           were not successful, adding gateway features at key entrances into the
                           community would give Castro Valley a stronger identity and remains
                           a good idea. The gateway features could be a simple structure, such
                           as a sign, a landscape feature, or some combination.
                           Some roadways are heavily landscaped, and do not have curbs and
                           gutters, which contributes a unique “rural” character that Castro
                           Valley residents value. These byways should be preserved without
                           curbs and gutters, except where sidewalks are critical for pedestrian
                           safety and safe routes to schools.

                                         5.5	community gathering places
                                         Having places and events where the community comes together is a
                                         critical component of community identity. When people identify with
                                         the place where they live and know others who live and do business
                                         in the community, they are more likely to offer support to neighbors
                                         and become more involved in local improvement projects. Castro
                                         Valley residents are very committed to their community, as evidenced
                                         by locally-driven improvement projects, such as the performing arts
                                         theater at the high school and the new library.
                                         Castro Valley needs attractive, comfortable places where residents
                                         can gather to continue to foster this community spirit. The new Castro
                                         Valley library will be very valuable in this regard, and is planned to
                                         include a community meeting room in addition to library facilities.
                                         Similarly, the creation of a central plaza in the Central Business
                                         District would be an important addition to this effort. There is also
                                         a need for places for regular community events, such as the small
                                         but successful farmers’ market at the BART station. There may be
                                         opportunities to create more such venues in cooperation with the
                                         Castro Valley Unified School District or the Medical Center.

                           Community History
                           Castro Valley has a rich cultural history that predates the late
                           18th century exploration of the region by Spanish expeditions. In
                           addition to the style and pattern of the built environment, the area’s
                           natural features have also helped to define this important aspect of
                           the community’s character. Archaeological research shows that the
                           planning area was probably once occupied by Chochenyo-speaking
                           members of the Costanoan groups who found the central basin of
                           the San Lorenzo watershed, surrounded by rolling hills and steep
                           canyons, to be an ideal location for hunting and fishing. The Native
                           American resources that have been discovered on ridges, mid-slope
                           terraces, and near water courses such as San Lorenzo, Cull, and Crow
                           Creeks is evidence of their presence.
                           During the 19th century, Spanish ranchers found that the grassy hills
                           surrounding the valley were ideal grazing lands. Until the early part
                           of the 20th century, much of the land in the planning area, which was
                           once part of Guillermo Castro’s Rancho San Lorenzo, was devoted
                           to grazing and, well into the last century, the primary land uses
                           were agricultural. The climate and soils created optimal conditions
                           for cultivating vegetables and fruit orchards while proximity to the
                           redwood groves that flourished in the nearby East Bay hills stimulated
                           the development of logging and sawmill operations.1 The region’s
                           topography also provided protection from San Francisco Bay winds,
                           creating a temperate climate that was particularly well-suited for
                           raising chickens. By the end of the 1920’s, Castro Valley was one of
                           northern California’s primary poultry industry centers.
                           Historic Structures and Sites
                           During the building boom that followed World War II and up until
                           the 1970’s, most of Castro Valley’s 19th century structures and some
                           of those built in the first half of the 20th century were demolished as
                           the area changed from an agriculture-based economy to a suburban
                           bedroom community. Castro Valley’s built environment presents a
                           variety of architectural styles and development patterns that track
                           the community’s history since the late 19th century and also typify
                           different parts of the community. One of the most prevalent older

1920’s to 1940’s is what is called Period Revival architecture. These
buildings include homes with features associated with California’s
Spanish and Mexican periods such as stucco walls and tile roofs and
Tudor-style cottages with half-timbered upper floors. Castro Valley

    Works Project Administration. Corlett and his firm designed a
    number of school, hospital, and other public projects, including
    many built under WPA. Among these are the Alameda County

place, record, or manuscript which a lead agency determines to be
significant. Generally, a resource is considered to be historically
significant if it meets the criteria for listing in the California
Register. However, a lead agency under CEQA is not precluded from
determining a resource is significant that is not listed in (or determined
eligible for listing in) the California Register, not included in a local
register, or identified in a historical resources survey as a historical
resource, as defined in the Public Resources Code.
Under CEQA, any project that may cause a substantial adverse change
in the significance of a historical resource is a project that may have
a significant effect on the environment. Projects that may affect
archaeological sites are also subject to review under CEQA even if the
site does not meet the law’s criteria for defining historic resources but
is a “unique archaeological resource” as defined by the law.
Several state laws address the importance of Native American
involvement in the development review process and provide
requirements for the treatment of human remains and grave goods
and protection of cultural places. Among these is the California
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 2001.
This Act was adopted to conform to the federal Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and is intended to ensure that
all California Indian human remains and cultural items are treated
with dignity and respect. In addition, sections of the California Health
and Safety Code address the discovery of human remains outside a
dedicated cemetery and provide requirements for consultation with
appropriate Native American individuals for disposition of the
remains. Government Code Sections 65352.3, 65352.4, 65562.5 also
require local agencies to consult with identified California Native
American Tribes, as part of the general plan adoption or amendment
process and prior to the dedication of open space. To comply with
these requirements, the County contacted representatives of the
Ohlone, Costanoan, Miwok, and Patwin tribes and provided copies
of draft policies and other materials but did not receive any response.
State law also offers a number of incentives for historic preservation.
These include the option of using the State Historic Building Code11
to regulate alterations to designated properties and tax relief under
the Mills Act.12 The program, which is only applicable to income-

                           The Alameda County Parks, Recreation, and Historical Commission
                           advises the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors
                           on matters related to historic resources. The Historic Preservation
                           Ordinance for the County of Alameda adopted January 10, 2012
                           established procedures for maintaining a County Register of Historic
                           Resources, designating landmarks, and reviewing alterations
                           to designated properties.13 The ordinance contains criteria for
                           designating several categories of historic properties and districts
                           including landmarks, historic preservation districts, contributing
                           resources within preservation districts, structures of merit, and
                           conservation areas, which do not meet the criteria for designation as
                           districts but are nevertheless distinguished by cultural, historical, or
                           visual characteristics. The ordinance is also intended to qualify the
                           County as a Certified Local Government under the National Historic
                           Preservation Act. This recognition would allow the Commission
                           to review and comment on projects subject to Section 106 of the
                           Federal act.
                           Prior identification and evaluation of historic resources will facilitate
                           the development of appropriate strategies for their preservation
                           and protection in advance of the development review process. The
                           formulation of other preservation tools, such as design standards and
                           guidelines, would also allow a more proactive approach to resource
                           protection. Design review criteria, standards, and guidelines can be
                           established through an overlay district in the Zoning Ordinance or
                           through a specific plan. The County could also allow modifications to
                           setback, height, and other standards to ensure that new buildings and
                           additions are compatible with the existing neighborhood development
                           patterns. These special standards and guidelines would supplement or
                           supersede the County’s Residential Design Standards and Guidelines
                           for the Unicorporated Communities of West Alameda County.

                eligible for designation to the maximum extent
                feasible. Enhance the maintenance of key historic
                structures such as the Stanton House, Strobridge
                House, and the Adobe Arts Center, and ensure
                that they remain, or are relocated, to attractive and
                prominent settings consistent with their character

                toric resources but reflect Castro Valley’s history
                and traditions. Possible strategies include:
                  •	 Conservation districts for older neighborhoods
                      with a unified distinctive character, such as the
                      neighborhood of Eichler homes;
                 •	 Lower densities or conservation easements
                      in environmentally sensitive areas that reflect
                      Castro Valley’s agricultural history such as:
                      Palomares Canyon and properties with barns
                      and stables located along creek beds and
                      Crow and Cull Canyon Roads.
 Policy 5.6-3 	 Consider Cultural Resources in Development
                Review Process. Integrate consideration of his-

Circulation
The circulation network serves as the community’s arterial system,
allowing residents to move through the community and have access to
jobs, stores, community facilities, services, and friends by car, public
transit, bicycle, or walking. Castro Valley enjoys a very central location
in the San Francisco Bay region near the junction of Interstates 580 and
238, within commuting distance of job centers in the East Bay, the South
Bay, San Francisco, and eastern Alameda County. The street network
provides access to the Central Business District as well as to the adjacent
communities of San Leandro and Hayward. The local street network is
self-contained and somewhat limited due to the topography of the hills      Pedestrian safety near schools is especially

and the bowl. Most residents must travel down from the sloped areas to
Castro Valley Boulevard on a few streets in order to get to shopping areas,
and commute outside the community to jobs. There are very few east-
west collector streets; and Castro Valley Boulevard is the community’s
only centrally-located east-west arterial. Castro Valley residents enjoy
the benefits of a BART station, AC Transit bus service, and bicycle
routes. Pedestrian routes exist but many improvements are needed.
This Element establishes policies for automobile, transit, bicycle, and
pedestrian travel within and through Castro Valley.
                                                                                                               6-1

Castro Valley General Plan
                                         6.1	 CIRCULATION SYSTEM PLANNING
                                         Castro Valley’s circulation network is made up of roadways, the BART
                                         transit system, public bus transit, trails, bike paths, and sidewalks. The
                                         overall goal is to create a comprehensive “multi-modal” circulation
                                         system, which offers residents different ways to move around the
                                         community and beyond. The circulation system should be integrated
                                         with the land use so that safe, efficient connections are provided
                                         between residential neighborhoods, employment centers, shopping,

                                         are likely to be built in Castro Valley, improvements are needed to
                                         ensure safety and more efficient travel. The street network and major
                                         circulation improvements called for are shown in Figure 6-2.
                                         Currently, Castro Valley residents primarily travel by private
                                         automobile. The diagram of daily travel patterns in 2005 in Figure 6-1
                                         shows that over three quarters of the daily trips from Castro Valley
                                         travel outside of the community to jobs and other destinations.

This reflects the fact that Castro Valley is predominantly a residential
community. One-third of the external trips head south towards
Hayward and beyond; 17 percent travel west; 15 percent head north;
and 11 percent have destinations to the east. About one-quarter of the
daily trips are internal to Castro Valley.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 76 percent of workers
living in Castro Valley commuted to work alone in a private
automobile; 11 percent carpooled; 7 percent used public transit; and
                                                                           Castro Valley Boulevard and Grove Way

on increasing walking, biking, and public transit use; promoting
carpooling and ridesharing; and managing parking. Topography is a
limiting factor for walking and biking in Castro Valley. However, new
General Plan policies, programs, and circulation and project analysis
methodologies will help evaluate and mitigate potential impacts on
and improve access to alternative modes of travel.

6.2	 ROADWAY NETWORK
Regional Roads
Castro Valley is located at the mouth of a primary natural pass through
the East Bay Hills that connects to the Tri-Valley area of Alameda
and Contra Costa Counties and beyond. Interstate 580 was built in
the pass, and traverses Castro Valley. The I-580 corridor provides the
regional access between the Tri-Valley communities of Dublin, San
Ramon, Danville, Pleasanton, and Livermore, as well as the Central
Valley, and the East Bay communities of Hayward, San Leandro, and
Oakland. This corridor includes the BART line located in the median
of I-580 as well as a few parallel arterial roadways, such as Castro
Valley Boulevard. Just west of Castro Valley, I-580 veers north
toward Oakland. Interstate 238 continues west toward Interstate 880,
which runs north-south from San Jose to Oakland.
While convenient freeway access provides some advantages
for Castro Valley, it also has considerable negative impacts. As
significant new housing has been developed along the I-580 and
I-680 corridors of eastern Alameda County and in the Central Valley,
traffic levels and congestion on I-580 have increased substantially.
In addition, the I-238 connection between I-580 and I-880, despite
recent improvements, creates a bottleneck that results in congestion
along I-580 through Castro Valley.
As shown in Table 6.2-1, freeway segments through Castro Valley
currently operate at level of service D, except for the westbound lanes
in the evening that operate at LOS E. Due in large part to additional
development in eastern Alameda County, San Joaquin County, and
other areas east of Castro Valley, traffic will increase along I-580 in
the future.

                                      Regional transportation improvements that have been recently
                                      completed or are planned or programmed to improve traffic circulation
                                      in Castro Valley include: widening I-238, reconfiguring the I-580/
                                      Redwood Road ramps as a full diamond interchange; reconfiguring
                                      the Center Street ramp to Grove Way; and removing the westbound
                                      on-ramp from Castro Valley Boulevard just west of Center Street.
                                      Studies are underway for alternatives to the State Route I-238 Bypass
                                      through the City of Hayward, which would provide connection from
                                      I-580 south to State Route 92. By 2025, the volume-to-capacity ratio
                                      would be at or worse than the existing levels. However, the freeway
                                      will operate within acceptable standard at LOS E or better.

Castro Valley Boulevard, arterial
                                      •	   Arterials. Arterials are the primary roads providing access from
                                           the freeways. They provide connections from Castro Valley to
                                           the surrounding communities. The arterial roadways are limited
                                           to Castro Valley Boulevard, Fairmont Drive-Lake Chabot Road,
                                           Redwood Road, Grove Way east of Redwood Road, Center
                                           Street south of Grove Way, and Crow Canyon Road. Castro
                                           Valley Boulevard is the primary east-west arterial, while Lake
                                           Chabot Road, Redwood Road and Crow Canyon Road are the
                                           major north-south arterials. Average daily traffic volumes range
                                           from 10,000 to 25,000.

•	  Collectors. Collectors provide access within and between
    neighborhoods. Collectors carry the trips from the local streets
    to the arterials. Collectors include Center Street, Norbridge
    Avenue, Miramar-Stanton Avenue, 167th-Somerset Avenue.
    Average daily traffic volumes typically range from 5,000 to
    10,000. Many segments of these collector streets are similar
    to residential streets, because they have homes and driveways
    fronting the roadway, and were not designed for the traffic
    volumes of collector streets.
•	  Residential Streets. Residential streets make up the remainder
    of the local roadways. Average daily traffic volumes are typical-
    ly well below 5,000. These streets provide direct access to front-
    ing residential properties. Travel speeds and traffic volumes
    should be low.

Castro Valley General Plan
                           Arterials
                           In addition to the freeways, the Metropolitan Transportation
                           Commission has designated several roadways within Castro Valley
                           as part of the Metropolitan Transportation System (MTS). MTS
                           routes are those considered essential to regional mobility. The MTS
                           designated roadways in the Castro Valley General Plan Area include
                           Castro Valley Boulevard, Center Street, Grove Way, Crow Canyon
                           Road, and Redwood Road. These are the primary arterials of Castro
Somerset Avenue, collector
                           Valley.
                           Regional circulation backs up onto Castro Valley Boulevard and
                           other local roads close to the freeway, affecting the quality of life for
                           residents. Castro Valley Boulevard is used extensively by regional
                           traffic when the I-580 corridor becomes congested. In addition
                           through-traffic uses Crow Canyon Road from San Ramon and other
                           local roads to avoid congestion on the freeways and Castro Valley
                           Boulevard. Other local streets, such as Grove Way and Center Street,
Residential street
                           are also used to avoid the I-580 westbound back-up at I-238. The
                           highest levels of congestion occur at the Norbridge and Strobridge
                           Avenues intersection with Castro Valley Boulevard, because this
                           is the primary location for traffic to access I-580 and I-238. The
                           segment of Castro Valley Boulevard west of Lake Chabot Road also
                           experiences significant congestion, which is likely to increase in the
                           future.
                           Castro Valley Boulevard, East Castro Valley Boulevard and Grove
                           Way (east of Redwood Road) are the only east-west arterials in Castro
                           Valley. These are all concentrated along the I-580 corridor, leaving
                           a severe lack of east-west arterials in the northern parts of Castro
                           Valley. Local residents use the east-west collector roadways, such as
                           Seven Hills Road, Heyer Avenue, Miramar Avenue, 167th Avenue,
                           and Somerset Avenue, to reach local destinations such as schools and
                           to avoid the congestion on Castro Valley Boulevard. This increased
                           through-traffic often exceeds the posted speed limits creating safety
                           concerns for adjacent neighborhoods.

Local traffic flow is impeded at select locations during peak periods
where traffic flow is constrained by the width of bridge crossings
or by specific destinations. This occurs on Heyer Avenue near Cull
Canyon Road, due to the limited width of the dam bridge. The high
volume of traffic on the crossing, coupled with the narrow roadway,
also restricts bike and pedestrian usage at this location. Plans have
been developed to add turn lanes and other improvements at the
bridge crossing. Traffic congestion also occurs on Center Street near
Fernwood Court due to the narrow bridge crossing over the creek.
Given existing development it, would be very difficult and extremely
costly to widen that crossing. Problematic traffic congestion has
also been noted by community members near the Post Office on
Santa Maria Avenue and on John Drive/Regent Way near Foothill
Boulevard.
Local Road Operations
Major roadway segments and intersections were studied to ascertain
existing levels of service and future conditions with projected growth.
Table 6.2-2 lists existing and projected intersection operations,
while Table 6.2-3 shows existing and projected roadway segment
operations.
The capacity of a roadway or intersection—the maximum number of
vehicles that can be handled in a given time period—is affected by
the facility’s characteristics, such as number of lanes, lane widths,
grades, and operating conditions. The Level of Service (LOS) concept
is generally used to measure the amount of traffic that a roadway
or intersection can accommodate, based on maneuverability, driver
dissatisfaction, and delay. The LOS ranges from LOS A, or free-flow
conditions, to LOS F, or congested conditions, and varies according
to the type of roadway.
The vast majority of roadways within Castro Valley are projected
to operate at an acceptable level of service of D or above. The
intersections of Redwood Road/Castro Valley Boulevard and Center
                                                                                          6-11

Castro Valley General Plan
                                             Street/Grove Way currently operate at level of service D; however,
                                             over the course of the 20-year planning period, the level of service
                                             is projected to decrease to Level E. It would be highly problematic
                                             to further widen these intersections, due to existing businesses and
                                             buildings. To widen intersections would also impact pedestrian
                                             circulation, making crossing distances extremely long and increasing
                                             pedestrian safety risks. The General Plan includes policies to allow
                                             Level of Service E in these situations and in other conditions where
                                             goals for transit operation or pedestrian circulation need to be
                                             balanced with automobile circulation. The actual level of service
                                             should be monitored over the planning period to ascertain if levels of
                                             service deteriorate more than projected.

6.3	 Residential Streets
When Castro Valley Boulevard and I-580 become congested,
motorists seek alternatives to the arterials and use collectors and
residential streets to bypass congestion. Local residents use the east-
west collector roadways, such as Seven Hills Road, Heyer Avenue,
and 167th-Somerset Avenue, to reach local destinations and to avoid
the congestion on Castro Valley Boulevard.
Alameda County has a Residential Neighborhood Traffic Calming              Regional circulation backs up onto
                                                                           Castro Valley Boulevard and affects the
Program that provides a community initiated process for identifying        quality of life for Castro Valley residents.
traffic calming measures to reduce and/or discourage through traffic
on local and minor collector residential roadways. Traffic calming
measures include speed enforcement; neighborhood speed watch
program; roadway striping; raised crosswalks; raised intersections;
street trees; bulb-outs; speed humps; chicanes; roundabouts; diverters;
and full roadway closures. The implementation of these measures can
be used to address issues related to speeding and cut-through traffic.
In addition to the cut-through traffic, traffic congestion around local
elementary and middle schools during the morning drop-off and
afternoon pick-up affect local circulation. These conditions are a
particular concern on Heyer Avenue between Redwood Road and
Cull Canyon Road due to Canyon Middle School, Castro Valley
High School and Vannoy Elementary School; and on Center Street
between Castro Valley Boulevard and Heyer Avenue to the Creekside
Middle School.

Castro Valley General Plan
                                          Because of the existing pattern of development, collector streets,
                                          such as Somerset and Heyer, have issues such as speeding, lack of
                                          continuous sidewalks for pedestrian access, access from private
                                          roadways serving multiple residential units, and limited visibility
                                          from driveways due to on-street parking and overgrown trees and
                                          landscaping. The closure of San Leandro Hospital could exacerbate
                                          traffic and safety concerns on 167th-Somerset because this collector
                                          will provide the most direct connection to Eden Medical Center from
                                          the areas east of I-580 that are now served by the San Leandro facility.
Roadway striping helps to reduce traffic
speeds.

(AC Transit), as illustrated in Figure 6-4. Ridesharing refers to more
than one person sharing a ride in one vehicle and includes carpooling
and vanpooling. According to the 2000 Census, 7 percent of Castro
Valley residents used public transportation and almost 11 percent
shared rides to commute. The County goal is to increase transit
ridership to at least 15 percent and ridesharing to at least 20 percent
of the total trips by 2020.
                                                                                                                   6-19

                                        The Castro Valley BART station of the Dublin-Pleasanton line
                                        is located in the downtown area north of I-580 near the Redwood
                                        Road intersection. This line provides direct service to Oakland, San
                                        Francisco and the San Francisco International Airport. San Francisco
                                        is the most common destination for both work and non-work trips
                                        on BART, with approximately 26 percent of Castro Valley workers
                                        using BART to commute to the city. Two other stations, Bayfair
Castro Valley BART station              and Hayward, also serve the area. The Bayfair station is a transfer
                                        point for the Dublin-Pleasanton and Fremont-Richmond lines.
                                        Hayward station is on both the Fremont-Richmond lines and
                                        Fremont-Daly City.
                                        The Castro Valley BART station creates an opportunity for higher
                                        density, transit-oriented development near the downtown. New
                                        residential and employment uses near the station will support new
                                        ridership. However, there is a need to improve the main pedestrian
                                        and bicycle routes to the BART station from surrounding areas in
AC Transit Service to the Castro Valley
BART station
                                        central Castro Valley, so people living within a half-mile radius can
                                        comfortably walk or bike to the BART station.
                                        Bus Transit
                                        Eight AC Transit bus routes, NX 4, M, 50, 80, 84, 87, 91 and 93,
                                        travel through Castro Valley, and four additional routes serve the
                                        surrounding area. AC Transit buses serve the Castro Valley BART
                                        station and downtown as well as medical facilities and recreation
                                        activities at Don Castro Park (AC Transit route 80), and the Cull
                                        Canyon bike & hike trails (AC Transit route 87). The frequency of
                                        these routes is generally 15 to 30 minutes. Paratransit service is also
                                        provided for users with special needs.

Castro Valley General Plan
                                            6.5	 Bicycle Circulation
                                            Castro Valley is at a key location within the regional trail system, located
                                            at the juncture of Lake Chabot Regional Park, Cull Canyon Regional
                                            Park, and Don Castro Park. An updated Alameda Countywide Bicycle
                                            Plan was adopted by the Alameda County Congestion Management
                                            Agency in October 2006. The plan identifies key regional bikeway
                                            corridors in Castro Valley. The community’s existing bikeway network
                                            is mapped in Figure 6-5.
Additional bike lanes and other bike
facilities are needed to provide safe
routes for bicycle travel in Castro Valley. The bicycle circulation system in Castro Valley is comprised of
                                            trails and on-street bicycle lanes. Bicycle facilities are defined as the
                                            following three classes, according to Chapter 1000 of the Caltrans
                                            Highway Design Manual:
                                            •	   Class I: Provides a completely separated facility designed for
                                                 the exclusive use of bicyclists and pedestrians with crossing
                                                 points minimized.
                                            •	   Class II: Provides a restricted right-of-way designated lane for
                                                 the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles with through
                                                 travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited, but with
                                                 vehicle parking and crossflows by pedestrians and motorists
                                                 permitted.
                                            •	   Class III: Provides a right-of-way designated by signs or perma-
                                                 nent markings and shared with pedestrians and motorists.
                                            Castro Valley currently has about eight miles of Class II bikeways
                                            along portions of Redwood Road (1.6 miles), Foothill Boulevard (1.3
                                            miles), Grove Way (1.0 mile), Norbridge Avenue (0.5 miles), East
                                            Castro Valley Boulevard (1.3 miles), Five Canyons Road/Parkway
                                            (1.3 miles), Crow Canyon Road (0.5 miles), and Cull Canyon
                                            Road (0.5 miles). The topography of the East Bay hills creates a
                                            circuitous street pattern in many of the residential neighborhoods
                                            as development has moved into the hillside and canyons, where the
                                            diversity and use of alternative transportation modes are limited. In
                                            addition, existing roadway and traffic conditions are not conducive
                                            to biking. Therefore, the existing bicycle network in Castro Valley is
                                            limited and disconnected.
                                            The 2006 Countywide Bicycle Plan proposes the addition of several
                                            bike paths in Castro Valley that would provide improved connectivity
                                            to the existing network. Additional Class II and Class III bicycle
                                            facilities are proposed along Redwood Road, Castro Valley Boulevard,

Castro Valley General Plan
                                        6.6	 Pedestrian Circulation
                                        The pedestrian circulation system in Castro Valley is comprised of
                                        trails, sidewalks, and walkways. There are numerous recreational
                                        opportunities and trails in close proximity to the community. However,
                                        the street environment is primarily automobile-oriented with wide
                                        roadways, high levels of traffic, and discontinuous sidewalks, and is
                                        not conducive to walking.
                                        In the downtown area, pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, marked
                                        crosswalks, and curb ramps; however, the sidewalk network is not
                                        comprehensive. There is a strong desire in the community to make
                                        central Castro Valley a more pedestrian-friendly retail environment,
                                        and to change the character and image of Castro Valley Boulevard.
                                        There are also opportunities to better connect the BART Station to
                                        surrounding properties, the central shopping area, and residential
                                        neighborhoods, in order to make BART transit more convenient and
                                        accessible. Another proposed improvement for the downtown area is
                                        a pedestrian link from Castro Valley Boulevard along Castro Valley
                                        Creek to Norbridge Avenue.
                                        In the residential neighborhoods, the pedestrian facilities are limited
                                        in part due to the topography that limits the construction of sidewalks
                                        and the desirability of walking. Access to bus stops in residential
                                        areas is also problematic. Sidewalks are discontinuous and parked
                                        cars often impede walkways for pedestrians. In addition, automobile
                                        traffic conflicts with pedestrian circulation on Somerset Avenue in the
Improving pedestrian, bicycle, and auto

to ensure the safety of children and    Creekside Middle School, Heyer Avenue, and Redwood Road. Heyer
promote accessibility.                  Avenue in particular is a problem due to its inconsistent street and
                                        sidewalk layout, lack of space for pedestrians, and limited visibility,
                                        all on a major east-west circulation corridor.
                                        The Alameda County Pedestrian Master Plan for Unincorporated
                                        Areas, which was adopted in July 2006, addresses many pedestrian-
                                        related issues in Castro Valley. The plan identifies key pedestrian
                                        activity corridors in Castro Valley, which include Castro Valley
                                        Boulevard, Redwood Road, Lake Chabot Road, Center Street, Seven
                                        Hills Road, Somerset Avenue, Heyer Avenue, Anita Avenue, Foothill
                                        Boulevard, Miramar Avenue, and Fairmont Drive. Numerous priority
                                        projects are listed in the Master Plan. The 2006 Pedestrian Master

Biological Resources
Castro Valley has significant biological resources, primarily
concentrated in creek corridors, canyons, and hillside open space
areas. Many of the eastern hillside areas have been set aside as
permanent open space as part of Planned Unit Developments, but
other areas do not have similar protection. Castro Valley is also
immediately adjacent to regional parks and County Measure D
open space conservation areas. Open space areas within Castro
Valley function as wildlife corridors for species to cross between
larger habitat areas. This element addresses the protection of Castro
Valley’s biological resources, including animal species, plant species,  Castro Valley has significant biological

and wildlife habitat. Its main provision is the creation of a Biological corridors, canyons, and hillside open space

and review requirements on properties with significant biological
resources.
Alameda County is updating its Resource Conservation, Open Space,
and Agriculture (ROSA) elements. The Castro Valley General Plan
and the County ROSA must be consistent with one another. The
updated ROSA will replace existing documents, including the 1966
Scenic Route Element, the 1973 Open Space Element, and the 1977
Specific Plan for Areas of Environmental Significance. The ROSA
elements will also address plans and policies for Measure D lands.

pockets woven throughout residential
neighborhoods, primarily along creeks. plant species. The eastern portions of the General Plan Area support
                                       primarily native habitats. Large, undeveloped portions of this area,
                                       typically on steep hillsides or in canyons, have been set aside as open
                                       space as part of planned unit developments. Ornamental landscaping
                                       with large trees, shrubs and other vegetation may provide potential
                                       nesting habitat for raptors known to nest in urbanized areas and other
                                       special-status bird species.
                                       As shown in Figure 7-1, oak riparian woodland, coastal scrub,
                                       and grassland vegetation serve as the primary wildlife movement
                                       corridors for common and special-status wildlife species within the
                                       Castro Valley planning area. Crow Creek and San Lorenzo Creek are
                                       deeply incised creeks with well-developed riparian areas. These two
                                       creeks serve as a primary migration route through the eastern half of
                                       the planning area for both aquatic and terrestrial species.
                                       For this element, non-native dominant habitat is defined as areas
                                       supporting ruderal vegetation (non-native plant species favoring
                                       disturbed sites), ornamental or naturalized non-native trees (such as
                                       Monterey pine and eucalyptus), and shrubs (such as cotoneaster).
                                       Non-native dominant habitats also may serve as movement corridors
                                       when continuous with habitats supporting native vegetation. Wildlife
                                       corridors allow animals to have an adequate range of habitat area
                                       to search for food, flee from predators, and find protected areas for
                                       newborns. In an urbanized area, continuous wildlife corridors, such
                                       as creeks, are particularly important.
                                       All areas supporting native vegetation or providing suitable habitat
                                       for special-status species are considered sensitive habitat areas,
                                       including oak riparian woodland and naturalized native trees that
                                       provide potential nesting habitat for bird species. Sensitive habitat
                                       areas also include creeks and wetlands with the potential to be
                                       considered jurisdictional by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under
                                       Section 404 of the Clean Water Act or by the California Department of

                                                                          into Palomares Hills, and open space
status animal species that have been observed in the Castro Valley        preserved as part of that 1980’s residential
planning area are yellow warbler and steelhead trout. Yellow warbler      subdivision.
(Dendroica petechia) is a State species of special concern. Steelhead
(Onchorhynchus mykiss) are a federally-listed Threatened Species,
and a CDFG Species of Special Concern and have been observed in
San Lorenzo Creek, Castro Valley Creek, and Crow Creek in the last
ten years. The planning area also includes portions of the Critical
Habitat for Alameda whipsnake (USFWS, 2006).
The planning area potentially supports the following special-
status animal species, based on the fact that the type of habitat that
supports these species exists in Castro Valley: Steelhead, California
tiger salamander, California red-legged frog, Alameda whipsnake,
Western pond turtle, California horned lizard, Yellow warbler,
Burrowing owl, Sharp-shinned hawk, white-tailed kite, Bats (Myotis
spp., Pacific western big-eared bat, and greater western mastiff bat),
Lum’s micro-blind harvestman, great blue heron, Cooper’s hawk,
and red-tailed hawk. In addition, the following special-status plant
species have the potential to occur in the planning area: Santa Cruz
tarplant, alkali milk vetch, big-scale balsamroot, fragrant fritillary,
Diablo helianthella, and Robust monardella.

Biological Resources Overlay Zone
Figure 7-2, Biological Resources Overlay Zone (BROZ), illustrates
the biological resource priority levels throughout Castro Valley.
The purpose of the Overlay Zone is to protect areas with important
biological resources, such as creeks, hillsides, and riparian areas,
by requiring special review of proposed development projects. The
review process would be required on all sites with high priority
biological resources and on large sites (over two acres) with moderate
or low priority biological resources.                                      Oak riparian woodland is a high priority
                                                                           habitat for preservation.
Special review may involve environmental review, site plan and
development review, and/or the application of County policy or
ordinance requirements during review of development permit
applications. The special review process will: evaluate the actual
value of the habitat on the property; establish site planning parameters
to preserve the most critical and/or most sensitive habitat areas; and
establish conditions of approval to protect special status species
during construction and occupancy. The special review requirements
should be proportionate to the scale of the development project and
the amount of valuable habitat on the property. On larger properties
with high priority biological resources, the special review should
require a biological assessment by a qualified biologist. For small
home additions, application of standard conditions during building
permit review would be more appropriate.
Development is allowed on parcels within the BROZ; however, the
review process shall determine the level of development allowed
and the design features necessary to protect biological resources. In
order to ensure the protection of resources, property owners may not
necessarily entitled to the maximum amount of development allowed
under the zoning on BROZ parcels.
Priority levels shown on the map are based on a habitat area’s
biological sensitivity and its role as habitat for threatened species. For
example, oak/riparian woodland is considered the most biologically
sensitive habitat, while coastal scrub and grassland are considered
common plant communities. However, these communities may
have higher preservation value when they provide potential habitat
for threatened species or suitable habitats for supporting special-
status plants. In addition, grassland habitats have the potential
to contain wetland habitats and/or small drainages that are a high
priority for preservation. Isolated patches of non-native dominant
habitat surrounded by development are considered a low priority for
preservation.
                                                                                                                    7-5

Castro Valley General Plan
                           Future field surveys may identify features within grassland and non-
                           native dominant habitats that would increase the preservation value
                           of certain areas within these habitat types (i.e. wetlands and other
                           aquatic features). The priority scheme for habitats within Castro
                           Valley is as follows:
                           High Priority
                           •	  Drainages
                           •	  Oak Riparian Woodland
                           •	  General Plan designated natural open space areas
                           •	  Coastal scrub on both sides of the Castro Valley Creek
                               Improved Channel reach
                           •	  Coastal scrub just east of Cull Canyon Drive
                           •	  Coastal scrub between Jensen Road and Castro Valley Blvd/
                               Villareal Drive
                           Moderate Priority
                           •	  Other Coastal Scrub areas
                           •	  Grasslands
                           Low Priority

 Policy 7.1-1	 Major Wildlife Corridors Protection. Protect the     shown here, provide critical wildlife habitat
               major wildlife corridors that run through or are ad- corridors as well as flood protection.
               jacent to Castro Valley:
               (1) the corridor along the East Bay Hills in the
               forest and chaparral between major interstate
               highways; and
               (2) along creeks.
 Policy 7.1-2	 Comprehensive Habitat Preservation. Preser ve
               a continuous band of open space consisting of a
               variety of plant communities and wildlife habitat
               to provide comprehensive rather than piecemeal
               habitat conser vation.
 Policy 7.1-3	 Open Space Preservation. Preser ve the unde-
               veloped areas designated as open space within
               planned unit developments as permanent open
               space.
 Policy 7.1-4	 Open Space Objectives. Require that open space
               provided as part of a development project be de-
               signed to achieve multiple objectives, including
               but not limited to: recreation, scenic values, habi-
               tat protection, and public safety.
 Policy 7.1-5	 Riparian Habitat. New development shall not dis-
               turb any riparian habitat.
 Policy 7.1-6	 Watershed Plan Coordination. Encourage the
               formation of a San Lorenzo Watershed Commis-
               sion charged with ensuring coordination between
               multiple agencies and overseeing preparation of a
               comprehensive watershed plan.
                                                                                                             7-11

7.2	 CREEKS AND STREAMS
Creeks play a critical role in wildlife habitat protection, water quality
protection (by filtering pollutants), surface water drainage, and flood
prevention. There are several perennial and seasonal creeks within
the Castro Valley planning area (see Figure 7-1). The main ones
include Crow Creek, Cull Creek, San Lorenzo Creek, Castro Valley
Creek, and Chabot Creek. Several unnamed tributaries convey flows
to these creeks; however, this map shows only few of them. Various
                                                                          Riparian vegetation along creek channels
creek segments are natural, managed in concrete-lined or earthen          provides habitat and migration routes
channels, or contained in a closed conduit (culvert). As mentioned        for wildlife, helps to control flooding, and
in Section 7.1, the well-developed riparian areas along Crow Creek        also improves water quality by filtering
                                                                          pollutants.
and San Lorenzo Creek are important wildlife habitats and corridors.
These drainage patterns within Castro Valley are shaped by the
region’s topography, which consists of steeper areas located along
the foothills of the Diablo Range that gradually flatten out onto
an alluvial plain. Water drains from higher elevation areas in the
adjacent undeveloped land outside the urbanized area, through Castro
Valley, and then down through Hayward and San Lorenzo before it
reaches San Francisco Bay. Sections of San Lorenzo Creek, Chabot
Creek and Castro Valley Creek have been altered over the years with
channels and culverts to convey higher flows.
The County has a Watercourse Protection Ordinance (Chapter 13.12
of the County General Code) that applies across the unincorporated
area of Alameda County. Its purpose is to safeguard and preserve
watercourses, protect lives and property, prevent damage due to
flooding, protect drainage facilities, control erosion and sedimentation,
and enhance the recreational and beneficial uses of watercourses.
In order to better protect creeks and riparian corridors and enhance
their benefits for wildlife and Castro Valley’s quality of life, specific
actions should include revisions to the ordinance.

                                            vegetation contributes to the character of the area and provides
                                            other environmental benefits. The term “urban forest” is sometimes
                                            used to describe all of the vegetation, both public and private, in a
                                            commentify. In Castro Valley, the urban forest comprises vegetation
                                            in the planning area’s neighborhood, community, and regional parks;
                                            street trees; community gardens; and even ornamental landscaping
                                            and backyard vegetable gardens on private property.
                                            This variety of vegetation helps to manage stormwater by preventing
                                            erosion and plays a crucial function in water quality protection by
                                            filtering pollutants. Trees beautify neighborhoods, increase property
                                            values, reduce noise and air pollution, and create privacy. Trees also
                                            provide shade for recreational enjoyment, buildings, and paved areas.

Site planning with trees in appropriate locations can reduce the need
for air conditioning and associated energy consumption. Although
most of the orchards and farms that once abounded in Castro Valley
have been replaced by development, an increasing number of
residents are cultivating home gardens that provide food as well as
environmental benefits.
The County’s Tree Ordinance protects larger trees in public right-
of-ways but no similar protection exists for trees on private property.
Although the Castro Valley Central Business District Specific Plan
includes landscaping requirements and guidelines, there are no
comparable provisions applicable to development in other parts of
the planning area.

Community Facilities,
Parks, and Schools
The quality of local schools has become one of the major factors
influencing decisions about residential location in the San Francisco
Bay area and much of California. Access to attractive parks and other
recreation facilities and cultural amenities such as libraries also make
a community a desirable place to live. Neighborhood and community
parks are especially valued in Castro Valley because the existing
acreage of local parks is relatively small in proportion to the number
of residents. This part of the plan provides policies and proposals

8.2	 PARKS AND RECREATION
Castro Valley has about 325 acres of neighborhood and community
parks, which is approximately 5.3 acres of local parkland for every
1,000 residents, as described in Table 8.2-1. This is about the same
amount of parkland that the residents of Hayward enjoy (5.0 acres
per 1,000), and more than San Leandro (1.57 per 1,000) and the
unincorporated area of San Lorenzo (1.63 per 1,000). In addition
to neighborhood and community parks owned and operated by the
                                                                                      The tennis court at Bay Trees Park is heavily-

also have access to about 5,600 acres of East Bay Regional Park
District facilities within or adjacent to the community. A more
important measure of the adequacy of parklands in urbanized areas
is the distance residents need to walk (ideally) or drive to reach a
neighborhood park. As shown in Figure 8-1, most Castro Valley
neighborhoods are within a 10-minute walk of a neighborhood or
community park. However, except for residents of Hillcrest Knolls
and the northern part of El Portal Ridge, most of the neighborhoods
in the western part of Castro Valley do not have a park within a
10-minute walking distance.

Castro Valley General Plan
                           Castro Valley is part of the 64 square mile service area of the
                           Hayward Area Recreation and Park District (HARD), which serves
                           more people than any other local recreation district in the State.
                           The District serves the City of Hayward , as well as the major
                           unincorporated areas of Castro Valley, San Lorenzo, Cherryland,
                           Ashland and Fairview. Since its formation in 1944 to operate recreation
                           programs on school playgrounds, HARD has continued to coordinate
                           its operations with local school districts and about half of Castro
                           Valley’s neighborhood parks are School Parks that are adjacent to or
                           part of public school facilities.
                           Local and School Parks
                           HARD defines a local park as a combination playground and park
                           area designed primarily for non-supervised, non-organized recreation
                           activities. These parks generally range from 3 to 10 acres in size and
                           serve an area of approximately ¼- to ½-mile radius around the park.
                           Local parks form an integral part of the neighborhood and create a
                           sense of community by providing a place to engage in informal sports
                           and playground activities and also provide social gathering areas. Local
                           parks typically include children’s playground equipment with adjacent
                           sitting areas, individual family picnic areas, open grass areas for multi-
                           generational and informal activities, such as kite-flying, dog walking,
                           youth sports/activity areas, and frisbee tossing. Ten of Castro Valley’s
                           neighborhood parks are school district facilities that are developed
                           on school land and available for recreation use by the general public.
                           Castro Valley’s 20 local and school parks, as HARD calls them,
                           comprise a substantial proportion of the community’s neighborhood
                           parks. Table 8.2-2 lists and describes all of the local parks and identifies
                           school parks with an asterisk.

                                             Community Parks and Special Use Facilities
                                             Community parks are larger than local parks and provide a wider
                                             variety and higher intensity of recreational uses. The focus is on more
                                             active and structured uses that are available to larger segments of the
                                             community. In general, community park facilities are designed for
                                             organized activities and sports, although individual and family use
                                             is also encouraged. The service area of a community park is roughly
                                             a two to three mile radius. Typical facilities include a children’s
                                             playground with distinct areas for preschool and older children, with
                                             adjacent sitting areas; water play under controlled conditions, as
                                             appropriate; shaded group picnic areas (including shelters); athletic
                                             fields (e.g., soccer, softball) and courts (e.g., basketball, tennis, and
                                             bocce ball). Castro Valley has six community parks (see Table 8.2-3)
                                             as well as two regional parks, Cull Canyon and Don Castro, which
                                             provide the same type of recreational function. Table 8.2-4 lists
                                             Castro Valley’s special use facilities and community centers.

                                              Service Standards
                                              HARD has established park standards that provide a basis for evaluating
                                              the adequacy of existing facilities and estimating how much and what
                                              kind of parks should be provided to serve Castro Valley in the future.
                                              Based on these standards, although Castro Valley doesn’t have enough
                                              neighborhood park acreage to meet community needs, the total acreage
                                              available to Castro Valley residents meets the combined standard of 5
                                              acres of local and community park facilities for every 1,000 residents.
                                              Alameda County has also adopted the standard of 5 acres per 1,000
                                              persons or 218 square feet per person as the basis for its parkland
                                              dedication ordinance.1 Additional parkland will be needed, however,
                                              to maintain the current standard for local and school facilities in the
                                              future. Because planning area residents have easy access to almost
                                              5,600 acres of regional facilities within and adjacent to the planning
                                              area, the amount of regional parkland far exceeds the HARD standard
                                              of 3 acres per 1,000 residents. All of the regional facilities are well
                                              within HARD’s half-hour driving time radius and much of the regional
                                              parkland is even within walking distance for many Castro Valley
                                              residents. Table 8.2-6 compares existing conditions to HARD’s park
                                              standards for its service area and shows how much additional acreage
                                              the plan proposes to add to maintain the present standard for local and

Several of the community’s newer parks, including Deerview,
Palomares Hills and Five Canyons, were developed as a result of
dedication requirements imposed on major subdivisions. Although
the County’s park dedication ordinance applies to all residential
development except for senior and affordable units, in most cases
developers pay a fee in lieu of dedicating land. The ordinance requires
residential developers to dedicate or improve land or facilities or
pay in-lieu fees based on the amount of land needed to provide five
acres per thousand persons or 218 square feet per person. As of July
2006, the fee for new single-family homes was $11,550. The fees for
multi-family units, second units, and mobile home parks are $10,200,
$5,775, and $7,975 per unit respectively. These fees make it possible
to acquire a limited amount of land for small new parks, but are not
adequate to pay for full-size neighborhood or community park sites
and cannot be used for ongoing operations and maintenance. As a
result, HARD heavily relies on voter-approved parcel taxes to cover
these costs.
PARKS AND RECREATION GOAL
  GOAL 8.2-1	         Provide and maintain, in coordination with other
                      public agencies, a system of local public park and
                      recreation facilities offering a variety of active,
                      passive, and cultural recreational opportunities
                      that is adequate to meet the diverse recreational
                      needs of community residents and visitors. Also
                      consider the additional demands of those who
                      work in the community but are not residents.

                                              Castro Valley residents have easy access to East Bay Regional
                                              Park District trails but, in contrast to more recently developed
                                              communities, there are relatively few trails and pathways connecting
                                              neighborhoods to one another or to the extensive resources that
                                              surround the community. Because most of the planning area was built
                                              up before communities recognized the value of making provision for

recreation facilities as integral concepts of

                                               This began to change during the decade of the 1990’s due to both

                                               in the CVUSD was above 8,900 for the 2008-09 school year; Castro
                                               Valley High School and all of the CVUSD middle schools are now
                                               at capacity and few spaces are available in the elementary schools.
                                               Except for Jensen Ranch Elementary, which opened in 1995, and
                                               Canyon Middle School built in 1964 on the site of a closed high

                                               School have provided some much needed additional space. The
                                               CVUSD is also modernizing several sites and undertaking seismic
                                               and security upgrades.
                                               Of the four districts that serve the planning area, CVUSD has
                                               experienced the most significant increase in enrollment, showing
                                               steady growth of 11.5 percent since 2000-01. The San Lorenzo
                                               schools had a more modest increase of only 4 percent during the
                                               same period. Declining enrollment in the lower grades suggests
                                               a downward trend in coming years. In contrast to the other three
                                               districts, HUSD is the only one that lost enrollment with a decline of
                                               8.7 percent between 2000-01 and 2008-09.

Castro Valley General Plan
                           Vergil Court provide a variety of programs including career training,
                           professional development, and English as a second language.
                           Castro Valley’s schools are a particularly important community
                           resource because many school sites are part of the HARD system of
                           school parks. The Castro Valley Unified School District is also well
                           regarded for the quality of its educational program, which has made
                           the community particularly desirable for households with children.
                           In return, Castro Valley residents have supported the CVUSD by
                           approving a series of bond measures to finance projects including
                           seismic and security upgrades, improved library and science facilities,
                           and upgrades to athletic facilities and playfields.
                           Although the ratio of pupils to teachers is slightly higher in the
                           CVUSD than the three other districts that serve the planning area,
                           a higher percentage of CVUSD teachers are fully credentialed (98.9
                           percent in FY 2008-09). CVUSD is the only one of the four districts
                           that met its yearly progress goals under the Federal No Child Left
                           Behind Act. Only 8.7 percent of the students are English learners,
                           compared with about a third of the students in the other three districts.
                           Reflecting the planning area’s population, the majority of the students
                           are either Caucasian or Asian compared with the other three districts,
                           in which more than 80 percent of the students are Hispanic.
                           Because of Castro Valley’s status as an unincorporated area, its schools
                           play a particularly important role in defining the community’s identity.
                           The recent completion of the performing arts center at Castro Valley
                           High School, now the home of the Castro Valley Center for the Arts
                           Center, has heightened the District’s critical function. Nevertheless,
                           not all of Castro Valley is within the CVUSD borders. While the Five
                           Canyons area is included in the District, the portion of Castro Valley
                           located south of I-580 and west of Grove Way is in the Hayward
                           District and most of the westernmost part of the planning area is
                           in the San Lorenzo District. These divisions may be an obstacle to
                           creating the level of cohesion needed to promote and maintain the
                           community identity that many Castro Valley residents seek.

8.5	CHILDCARE
                                                                               Large family day-care facility in a residence
Castro Valley has the highest proportion of children with parents in the       near downtown
workforce among all of Alameda County’s cities and unincorporated
towns. According to the 2000 census, children aged 12 and younger
accounted for more than 16 percent of Castro Valley’s population
and about 35 percent of all of the households in Castro Valley have
children under the age of 18. About 63 percent of Castro Valley
children under the age of 6 and 74 percent of children who are 6 to
17 years old had two working parents or a working single parent. Of
these single-parent households, 5.7 percent have a female head.
While children in Castro Valley over two years old demand child care
at a similar rate to the county, the availability of care for those age
groups is higher at the local level, resulting in an apparent surplus. The
estimated surplus in preschool slots and school-age slots is based on
data for children living in Castro Valley and not for children that live in
the surrounding unincorporated areas such as Cherryland and Fairview.
Because these areas have few, if any, child care providers, parents must
place their children in facilities nearby or near their place of work.
Their reliance on Castro Valley providers may explain why the number
of slots available in Castro Valley appears to exceed demand. Castro
Valley parents with children aged two to four years are more likely to
demand family child or center-based care. Approximately 54 percent
of children two to four demand center-based or family childcare, which
is similar to the 52 percent countywide. Forty-six percent of the city’s
child care supply is for preschool aged children, and an additional 44
percent serves school-aged children, resulting in a surplus of 314 and
78, respectively.
Determining the demand for childcare is difficult because it is often
unclear whether parents’ choices reflect their preferences or result from
location and cost constraints. Based on statewide patterns for different
provider types and income levels, Castro Valley has an existing shortfall
of at least 300 licensed childcare spaces. If all families in which both
parents or a single head of household works demanded licensed
                                                                                                                        8-27

Castro Valley General Plan
                           childcare, Castro Valley would need more than three times the number
                           of spaces available in the community’s 86 licensed and license-exempt
                           child care centers and family child care homes. Despite the projected
                           aging of Castro Valley’s population, the County’s Need Assessment
                           Report anticipates that the demand for spaces is expected to increase by
                           about 8 percent within the life of the plan. Moreover, even though the
                           percent of children living below the poverty level in Castro Valley is
                           lower than countywide (3 percent compared with 9 percent countywide
                           according to the 2000 Census), the cost of childcare remains an obstacle
                           for many families.
                           In 2004, the County’s Child Care Coordinating Council received
                           321 requests for childcare referrals for 388 children needing care.
                           Despite the demand, the Council reports that childcare providers
                           have had difficulty receiving the necessary approvals to add childcare
                           slots. In addition, providers have met with community resistance to
                           proposals for opening new centers or expanding existing services in
                           unincorporated areas of Alameda County including Castro Valley.

                           8.6	 LIBRARY SERVICES
                           The new Castro Valley Library at 3600 Norbridge Avenue is one of ten
                           local branches owned and operated by the Alameda County Library.
                           The $22.3 million dollar facility is three times the size of the former
                           facility at 20055 Redwood Road. Although the majority of Castro
                           Valley residents use their own facility, they are also entitled to use any
Castro Valley Library.     of the County’s other branch libraries. The Alameda County Library
                           also operates a bookmobile, which makes stops in Castro Valley. In
                           addition to receiving a dedicated share of property taxes, the County
                           Library is funded by a portion of the County’s business license and
                           utility users taxes generated by the County’s unincorporated areas.
                           The $22.3 million facility, on a 2.95-acre County-owned site at the
                           eastern end of Norbridge Avenue, was built with a $13.9 million
                           grant from the State Office of Library Construction. The new library
                           has 145 parking spaces, enough space for 161,000 books, magazines,
                           CDs, videos and other materials, up from 105,000 in the old library.
                           Other features include 87 computer terminals (up from 18 in the
                           former building) and 6,435 square feet for children’s services, which
                           is more than twice the space in the old building.
                           The new library also offers a bookstore operated by the Friends of
                           the Library, a café, a 2,000-square-foot community meeting room,
                           and a multi-purpose education center. The education center is being
                           developed under a Joint Use Agreement with the Castro Valley
                           Unified School district and will include a homework center, family
                           literacy center, career center, and computer-learning center.
                           The library’s downtown location—about two blocks from the BART
                           Station in an area the General Plan proposes for a multi-family
                           housing, commercial activity, and civic buildings—creates the
                           potential for the facility to function as a community gathering place
                           and civic center. The future use of the existing library site has not
                           been determined.

                                             The Alameda County Social Services Agency provides services to
                                             Castro Valley residents in need through its office at the Eden Area
                                             Multi-Service Center, 24100 Amador Street in Hayward. HARD’s
                                             Kenneth Aitken Senior Center offers recreational, educational, and
                                             social services to about 4,000 people a month, most of them well
                                             over 60 years of age. The Hayward Senior Center, just outside of
                                             the planning area, also serves significant numbers of Castro Valley
                                             residents.
                                             Castro Valley is within the Eden Township Health Care District
                                             (ETHD), which was established in 1948 to build and operate Eden
                                             Medical Center. The facility provides emergency room, trauma center,
                                             surgical, birthing, acute psychiatric and long-term care services at
                                             its main hospital in Castro Valley. Other ETHD medical facilities
                                             include Laurel Grove Hospital, a 31-bed inpatient acute rehabilitation
                                             unit treating individuals who have experienced a disabling injury
The existing hospital building (top picture) or illness; the 122-bed San Leandro Hospital; and Baywood Court

Facility.
                                             In 1998, ETHD sold the Medical Center to a Eden Health affiliate,
                                             making ETHD unique among the County’s health care districts
                                             because it no longer directly operates a hospital. ETHD’s primary
                                             function is currently to provide oversight of Sutter-affiliated facilities
                                             in the district. The publicly-elected members of the District Board
                                             serve on the governing Board of Directors of the Medical Center
                                             and also manage the Community Health Fund. As a result of the
                                             affiliation with Sutter, ETHD was able to establish the Community
                                             Health Fund, a permanent endowment that supports public and non-
                                             profit health programs serving ETHD residents.
                                             With 415 full-time and 604 part-time employees, Eden Medical Center
                                             is Castro Valley’s largest single employer. The Medical Center has
                                             also attracted a variety of related medical and support uses, including
                                             laboratories, medical and dental offices, and convalescent facilities
                                             that generate additional jobs. The area around the Medical Center
                                             is projected to experience a 50 percent increase in employment by
                                             2025, representing about 14 percent of the anticipated job growth in
                                             Castro Valley.
                                             To comply with the State’s Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act,
                                             Sutter Health must upgrade or replace the existing patient care
                                             facilities before 2014. After receiving approval from the Board of

Supervisors in June 2009, Sutter Health began work on the $320
million major upgrade and expansion of the Medical Center. The new
facility will include:
•	   A 230,000 square foot, seven-story, 130-bed Acute Care
     Hospital;
•	   An 80,000 square foot, four-story Medical Office Building con-
     nected to the hospital with a covered, open-air bridge;
•	   A 160,000-square foot six-story parking structure adjacent to                 Fairmont Hospital
     the existing parking structure fronting Lake Chabot Road; and
•	   Relocation of the helistop to an earthen knoll about 185 feet
     northeast of the present helistop.2
The existing hospital building will be demolished following
completion of the new hospital. The project also requires removal
of four existing medical office buildings on the site, the Laurel
Grove Rehabilitation Hospital, and the 42-unit Pine Cone Apartment
complex on Stanton Avenue.
In addition to Eden Medical Center, the Planning Area’s important
health services facilities also include Fairmont Hospital and the John
George Psychiatric Pavilion at Alameda County’s Fairmont campus.
The Fairmont facilities provide a variety of social and health services
to residents of the planning area and the rest of the County and also
contribute to the area’s employment base.
Fairmont Hospital, 15400 Foothill Boulevard, and the John George
Psychiatric Pavilion, 2060 Fairmont Drive, are both components of
Alameda County Medical Center.3 Fairmont Hospital was originally
established in 1864 as the Alameda County Infirmary and has been
providing rehabilitation services to County residents since the 1920’s.
In addition to a 50-bed Acute Rehabilitation Center, Fairmont now
includes a 90-bed skilled nursing facility that provides long-term care
services to patients following acute hospitalization, a 20-bed neuro-
respiratory unit, and the oldest HIV clinic in the East Bay. Fairmont
averages 11,000 annual outpatient visits and 400 admissions.
The John George Psychiatric Pavilion provides services to adults
experiencing severe and disabling mental illnesses. The 80-bed

                           facility, which is the service provider for virtually all of the acute
                           psychiatric emergencies in Alameda County, also provides in-patient
                           psychiatric services and crisis consultation voluntary services. In
                           2005-06 the Pavilion admitted 3,138 patients and accommodated an

                           Valley are set forth in Section 4.8 of this General Plan. These
                           proposals acknowledge the role the Medical Center plays as one
                           of the community’s major sources of employment and economic
                           engines. The proposed policies and actions support upgrading and
                           modernization of the Medical Center so it can continue providing
                           health services and jobs for the community. This plan proposes to
                           design the hospital site and surrounding properties in the Professional-
                           Medical District to achieve the community’s goals for improving the
                           area along Lake Chabot Road in a way that will minimize negative
                           effects on surrounding residential properties.

Public Services and
Utilities
The capacity and quality of public services, utilities and infrastructure
significantly affect the quality of life enjoyed by those who live, work,
and own property in Castro Valley. In addition to the community
facilities discussed in Chapter 8, the basic urban services and utilities
include: roads; flood management including drainage, erosion and
siltation control; water supply and service; gas and electric power;
wastewater management; solid waste collection, recycling, and
disposal; police services; and fire protection services. Many of these
services require a substantial investment in infrastructure that is a major
factor in determining the amount, location, and type of growth that a
community can anticipate. Service adequacy will also affect its ability
to attract the kind of new development that Castro Valley residents and
business owners would like to see in the future.
This chapter provides policies and proposals to ensure that the public
services and utilities the community relies on will have the capacity
to serve new development under the General Plan without degrading
existing service levels.
                                                                            9-1
Castro Valley General Plan
                           9.1	 PROVISION OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC SERVICES
                           As an unincorporated community, Castro Valley relies on Alameda
                           County and a variety of single- and multi-purpose special districts
                           to develop, operate, and maintain these services. Like the residents
                           of San Leandro, Hayward, and other Alameda County cities, Castro
                           Valley residents use County services such as health and social services,
                           courts, criminal justice, and voter registration. All of western Alameda
                           County, including the incorporated cities, receives water from the
                           East Bay Municipal Utility District and is within the Alameda County
                           Flood Control and Water Conservation District. But, unlike residents
                           in nearby incorporated places, Castro Valley residents must also look
                           to the County or, in some cases, special districts for police and fire
                           protection, maintenance of streets and road, drainage, street lighting,
                           animal control, and a variety of other services. Moreover, while all of
                           the properties within a single incorporated area are typically within a
                           single service district, in Castro Valley there are two or more different
                           districts that provide some services. In addition to being covered by
                           four different school districts, for example, two different sanitation
                           districts, Castro Valley and Oro Loma, provide wastewater collection
                           and treatment, solid waste collection, and recycling and green waste
                           services to the Castro Valley planning area.
                           These conditions not only mean that Castro Valley residents have to
                           compete for declining revenues on a countywide basis but also that
                           in some cases they don’t have the same opportunity as residents in
                           incorporated communities to collectively seek redress through the
                           election process. In the past, similar conditions lead to the creation of
                           new cities such as San Ramon, Dublin, and Moraga. More recently,
                           however, economic trends and the high cost of local government
                           operations have made this option increasingly infeasible.

                           State law1 requires that the Alameda County Local Agency
                           Formation Commission (LAFCO) conduct a review of the adequacy
                           and efficiency of municipal services provided by public agencies
                           at least once every five years or whenever a change in the agency’s
                           organization or Sphere of Influence (SOI) is proposed. LAFCO
                           initiated a countywide review of municipal services and SOIs in
                           January 2003 and completed the review in 2007. The review involved

an inventory of the affected agencies and services, general data
collection relating to SOIs and services, the creation of a municipal
services directory, development of a comprehensive set of GIS
maps, an SOI boundary map verification process, and preparation
of municipal service review reports dealing with the public safety
services provided throughout Alameda County. The information
from such reviews will help the community and decision-makers
to regularly evaluate the adequacy and need for services in Castro
Valley relative to other places in Alameda County.
Existing Funding for Public Services
Because levels of state and federal funding are insufficient to support
public services and other mandated countywide programs, the
services delivered to Castro Valley and other communities depend
primarily on property taxes, sales taxes, and other locally raised
revenues. Since the voters approved Propositions 13 and 218, which
limit the ability of local public agencies to increase property taxes
based on a property’s assessed value, local agencies have had to find
other mechanisms for raising revenues. Although the General Plan
anticipates a modest increase in population, the additional property,
sales and use taxes and fees that would be generated by development
in the planning area, would probably not result in a comparable
increase in revenues available to support local services because
the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF)2 requires a
substantial proportion of any increase in property taxes to be returned
to the State to help pay for K-12 education.
Moreover, the sales tax does not directly follow population increases,
unless they are accompanied by commercial development. This Plan
includes policies intended to promote additional retail activity in the
Castro Valley central business district, which could help to retain
some sales tax revenues that now go to San Leandro, Hayward, and
other East Bay cities. Nevertheless, the sales tax is still a relatively
poor revenue source for county governments. Although counties
and cities receive the same basic tax levied on sales within their
boundaries, on a per capita basis, counties on the average earn only
about two-thirds as much as cities. Compared to the sales and use
tax revenues received by Castro Valley’s neighboring communities,
Alameda County’s per capita sales and use tax revenues range from
less than half of what San Leandro receives to about two-thirds of

                           receipts have dropped 20 percent—from $106.68 per capita in FY
                           1998-99 to $85.03 in FY 2008-09. This is less than the 27 percent
                           average decline experienced by counties statewide and not as much
                           of a drop in revenues as San Leandro and Hayward have experienced
                           but their per capita revenues remain significantly higher than the
                           County’s.3
                           The County Service Area Law (Gov. Code Sec. 25210.1 et seq.) is
                           one of the primary means of providing expanded service to residents
                           of unincorporated areas who are willing to pay for extra services. The
                           Five Canyons, Street Lighting, and Castro Valley Library Community
                           Service Areas are among the existing CSAs in the planning area.
                           The Five Canyons CSA, which provides storm drainage services,
                           supplemental street maintenance services on public roads, erosion
                           control, and maintenance of public areas, was established in 1994
                           to serve the newly developed area.4 The Library CSA, which dates
                           from 1957, was established by the Board of Supervisors to finance
                           construction of the old library on Redwood Road. It was not used to
                           pay for construction of the new library but may be reactivated as a
                           financing mechanism for capital and maintenance costs for the new
                           library.5
                           The law allows residents or county supervisors to initiate the
                           formation of a CSA, which may span all unincorporated areas of a
                           county or only selected portions. Subject to the approval of voters in
                           the CSA, it may issue general obligation or revenue bonds or form
                           improvement areas in order to issue bonds that specifically benefit
                           the CSA.

Other Funding Mechanisms
The Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act provides another method
beyond property taxes of financing needed improvements and services
within a district. The Act allows any county, city, special district
or joint powers authority to establish a Mello-Roos Community
Improvement District (CID) to finance public improvements and
services. Improvements allowed under the Mello-Roos Act include
streets, sewer systems, and other basic infrastructure, police and fire
protection, ambulance services, schools, parks, libraries, museums
and other cultural facilities. A proposed district includes all properties
that will benefit from the improvements to be constructed and must
receive at least a two-thirds majority vote of the property owners
within the proposed boundaries. If approved, a Special Tax Lien is
placed against each property in the CID to fund improvements. If the
project cost is particularly high, municipal bonds can be sold by the
CID to provide additional funding.
Other tools that local governments use to help fund improvements are
Landscaping and Lighting Assessment Districts (LLAD) and Business
Improvement Districts (BID). The Landscaping and Lighting Act
of 1972, allows local governmental agencies to form Landscape
and Lighting Assessment Districts for the purpose of financing
the costs and expenses of landscaping and lighting public areas.
Approved uses include installation and maintenance of landscaping,
statues, fountains, general lighting, traffic lighting, recreational and
playground courts and equipment, and public restrooms. The Act
also allows acquisition of land for parks and open spaces, plus the
construction of community centers and municipal auditoriums or
halls. A majority vote of property owners within a proposed LLAD is
required to enact the assessment district.
The Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989 and the
Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1984 authorize
the formation of districts that are funded by assessments on owners
who will benefit from projects undertaken by the district. BIDs are
public/private partnerships that can finance improvements such as
parking facilities, street and sidewalk improvements, parks, street
furniture, and street lighting as well as marketing and economic
development programs. Some BIDs also pay for services such as
security and sanitation to supplement those offered by public agencies.

9.2	 FIRE AND POLICE SERVICES
Fire Protection
The Alameda County Fire Department (ACFD) provides fire and
paramedic service to Castro Valley except for the Five Canyons
area, which is within the Fairview Fire Protection District (FFPD).
ACFD operates four fire stations in Castro Valley and FFPD operates      The Alameda County Fire Department
one station in the planning area. ACFD Station 3, located outside        operates four fire stations in Castro Valley;
                                                                         a fifth is under the Fairview Fire Protection

protection services for Hillcrest Knolls, El Portal Ridge, and the
Fairmont Area.Three of the fire stations need seismic retrofitting and
ACFD Station 5, at 18770 Lake Chabot Road, has been identified as
candidate for replacement.
Under the Alameda County Mutual Aid Plan, the ACFD may request
mutual aid from other fire departments in the County. Mutual aid is a
reciprocal agreement and practiced statewide among fire agencies for
incidents that may exceed the response capabilities of a community
such as wildland or interface fires.
                                                                         The Alameda County Fire Department

higher in Castro Valley than in Alameda County as a whole. However,
Castro Valley has an average square mile coverage area per station of
7.6 square miles compared to the countywide median of 3.7 square
miles per station. The ACFD responds to 81 percent of its calls for
fire and medical emergencies in 3 minutes, or less, which is higher
than the 4:53 minute median for all fire departments in the county
and exceeds the National Fire Protection Association guideline of a
6-minute response at least 90 percent of the time.
Large parts of Castro Valley that border the East Bay Regional Park
District and undeveloped resource conservation lands outside the
Measure D boundary are particularly susceptible to wildland fires.
In some of these areas access roads don’t meet Uniform Fire Code
standards and there is inadequate water pressure. Water pressure is
also sub-standard in some areas closer to the Central Business District
that are proposed for infill development where older water mains are
not adequate to meet pressure requirements for fire protection.
Additional information about fire hazards and proposed policies and
actions are in Section 10.1 of Chapter 10 (Natural Hazards and Public
Safety).

                                             Alameda County’s Extended Police Protection County Service Area
                                             (CSA), administered by the County Sheriff’s Office, was established
                                             by the Alameda Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in

serves Castro Valley from the sub-station on
Foothill Boulevard at 150th Avenue.
                                             The CSA serves an area of 428.3 square miles with a population of
                                             183,149, about a third of who live in Castro Valley. Based on the 2000
                                             Census, the Sheriff’s Department estimated that it provides services
                                             to approximately 136,000 residents in the County’s unincorporated
                                             areas, of whom roughly 43 percent are Castro Valley residents.
                                             From the Eden Township Substation on 150th Avenue in San Leandro,
                                             the county sheriff provides emergency dispatch services, receiving
                                             911 calls and dispatching patrols. The sub-station occupies a building
                                             originally constructed in 1953 that is overcrowded and inadequate
                                             to meet the Sheriff’s Office’s needs despite several alterations. The
                                             Office’s Records and Crime Analysis divisions are located in a separate
                                             building that also houses the Emergency Services Dispatch Center.
                                             The Sheriff’s Office also operates the Community-Oriented Policing
                                             and Problem Solving (COPPS) program providing bicycle patrols,
                                             community walks, and works with residents on a variety of programs.
                                             Average response times for the Sheriff’s Office are 11:48 minutes for
                                             calls requiring an immediate emergency response and 17:13 for non-
                                             emergency calls requiring an urgent response. This is substantially
                                             higher than the 4:25 median emergency response time for all Alameda
                                             county police service providers. Response times in Castro Valley
                                             are somewhat better than in the less-densely developed Livermore
                                             Valley. On a per capita basis, the Department’s staffing levels are
                                             lower than countywide with 1.4 sworn officers per 1,000 residents
                                             compared with 1.6 per 1,000 residents for all county police service
                                             providers.
                                             The Sheriff’s Office proposes to consolidate its existing law
                                             enforcement facilities in a new 220,000 square foot complex to
                                             be constructed on the site of the existing Fairmont Animal Shelter
                                             on Fairmont Drive. The proposed project will allow relocation of
                                             services from the Eden Township Station as well as the Coroner’s
                                             Bureau now located in downtown Oakland.

Emergency Planning
The federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) requires that
cities, counties, and special districts have a Local Hazard Mitigation
Plan to be eligible to receive FEMA hazard mitigation funds. To assist
local governments in meeting this requirement, ABAG has received
a grant from FEMA to prepare a multi-jurisdictional plan that fulfills
the Act’s requirement. Cities and counties can adopt and use all or
part of this multi-jurisdictional plan in lieu of preparing all or part of
a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.
CARD (Collaborating Agencies Responding to Disasters) is a non-
profit agency that was created after the Loma Prieta earthquake and
the Oakland Hills firestorm to provide disaster preparedness/response
support to Alameda County Community Based Organizations
(CBOs). CARD helps service providers get prepared, stay prepared
and be better able to keep staff and clients calm, safe and ready to
respond appropriately in an emergency. Members of our community
who are seniors, children, disabled, homeless, non-English speakers,
low-income or otherwise in need of ongoing support, become the
“First Victims” because they often have little or no ability to address
their own preparedness, response and recovery needs.

                                          in the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. EBMUD
                                          has water rights that allow for delivery of up to a maximum of 325
                                          million gallons per day (mgd) from the Mokelumne River, subject to
Chabot Reservoir, which dates from the    availability. Water from this source requires little treatment to meet
1870’s, is one of two EBMUD terminal      high-quality water standards. The secondary water source is runoff
reservoirs adjacent to the planning area.
                                          from local watersheds which is collected and stored in the system’s
                                          reservoirs. The amount of local runoff that can be used ranges
                                          between 15 and 25 mgd during normal hydrologic years, and none
                                          during drought conditions.
                                          EBMUD has two terminal reservoirs adjacent to the planning area—
                                          Chabot and Upper San Leandro—that provide standby storage when
                                          Mokelumne River supply is temporarily unavailable. In addition,
                                          there are approximately 150 domestic well users and approximately
                                          100 known irrigation wells in the planning area. The groundwater
                                          wells are generally located in rural areas near Crow Canyon Road,
                                          Norris Canyon Road, Cull Canyon Road, Sunny Slope Avenue, Eden
                                          Canyon Road, Hollis Canyon Road, Palomares Road, and Dublin
                                          Canyon Road.
                                          Water Demand
                                          Water consumption within the EBMUD service area has remained
                                          relatively level in recent years despite the continuing growth in the
                                          number of accounts. In 2004, the total water consumption was 224 mgd,
                                          approximately 570 gallons per day per account. Typically, approximately
                                          46 percent of the water is consumed by single-family residential uses,
                                          17 percent by multi-family residential uses, 17 percent by industrial and
                                          petroleum processing uses, 14 percent by commercial and institutional
                                          uses, and 6 percent by irrigation. EBMUD’s 2005 Urban Water
                                          Management Plan (UWMP) projects that the water demand in 2025 will
                                          be 279 mgd, with an adjusted planning level of demand of 230 mgd
                                          based on water conservation and recycled water programs (Projections
                                          based on ABAG Projections 2005). This is equivalent to approximately
                                          510 gallons per day per account. In a normal hydrologic year, the existing
                                          supply will be sufficient to meet demand.

During drought periods, EBMUD’s primary and secondary water
sources cannot meet the projected customer demands, despite
rationing, water conservation, and recycling programs.6 In a multi-
year drought scenario, the available supply decreases each year.
Based on 2005 UWMP projections, if 2025 were the third year of a
drought, there would be only 151 mgd available supply. Therefore,
EBMUD employs integrated water resource management strategies to
plan for and meet customer water demands. These strategies include:
supplemental water supply initiatives (the Freeport Regional Water
Project, the Bayside Groundwater Project, and regional desalination
projects); recycled water projects, and water conservation efforts.
When completed in late 2009, the Freeport Regional Water Project
will be able to provide EBMUD access to up to 100 MGD of water
diverted from the Sacramento River during dry years.
Global climate change may not only result in a decrease in
precipitation affecting water supply but also increased the demand
for water. EBMUD analysis of projected future demands showed
that a 4° centigrade increase in average daily temperatures between
1980 and 2040 accompanied by a 20 percent decrease in precipitation
could result in a 3.6 percent increase in customer demand or 10
MGD.7
Water Conservation
Because of the potential for global climate change to decrease available
water supplies, water conservation is an important initiative for more
than just during drought periods. Alameda County recognizes that the
community needs to reduce water use within existing and future buildings
and landscapes. In 2005, within the EBMUD Service District, 70 percent
of the water was used in residential buildings, 20 percent in commercial
and industrial buildings, 5 percent for irrigation, and 5 percent other uses.
(Consulting, 2005) The County’s goal is to reduce indoor water use by
20 percent and outdoor water use by 50 percent by 2020.
EBMUD’s Water Supply Management Program 2040 Plan, which
identifies and recommends solutions to meet dry-year water needs
through the year 2040, establishes a goal of providing 39 MGD of future
supply from conservation and 11 MGD from recycling.8 Alameda

Castro Valley General Plan
                           County requires development to comply with the requirements of
                           the State’s model water-efficient landscaping ordinance.9 Another
                           strategy to reduce outdoor water consumption would be to require
                           that new development comply with the Castro Valley Sanitary
                           District’s Bay-Friendly Landscaping Guidelines. These guidelines
                           are based on a whole-system approach to the design, construction
                           and maintenance of the landscape intended to support the integrity
                           of the San Francisco Bay watershed. The guidelines promote the
                           development of landscapes that reduce waste and recycling materials,
                           reduce use of chemical fertilizers, conserve water, energy and topsoil,
                           use integrated pest management to minimize chemical use, and
                           reduce stormwater runoff.
                           Water System
                           EBMUD’s water supply system consists of a network of reservoirs,
                           aqueducts, water treatment plants, pumping plants, and distribution
                           facilities. Castro Valley is served by the Upper San Leandro/Orinda
                           Water Treatment Plant. EBMUD has numerous on-going improvement
                           projects for the water system. The most significant is the $189 million
                           Seismic Improvement Program (SIP). As part of SIP, an 11-mile
                           long emergency transmission pipeline between Castro Valley and the
                           San Ramon Valley, called the Southern Loop, was built to provide
                           an alternate water supply route after a major earthquake. The other
                           necessary seismic improvement work has been completed in Castro
                           Valley. EBMUD has determined that it has sufficient system capacity
                           to serve growth anticipated in the Castro Valley area through 2030
                           based on projections in the Alameda County 2000 General Plan.

                           Collection and Treatment Systems
                           The Castro Valley Sanitary District (CVSD) provides and maintains
                           the sewage collection system that serves most of Castro Valley.
                           CVSD’s current service area includes virtually all of the land within
                           the voter-approved Urban Growth Boundary. Oro Loma Sanitary
                           District provides the sewage collection system for the Hillcrest Knolls
                           and El Portal Ridge neighborhoods. The only developed areas that
                           continue to rely exclusively on private septic systems are off Crow
                           Canyon Road beyond Cold Water Drive, off Cull Canyon Road, and
                           in Palomares Canyon.
                           The Oro Loma Sanitary District treats CVSD sewage at the Oro Loma/
                           Castro Valley Water Pollution Control Plant in San Lorenzo, of which
                           CVSD owns 25 percent. The plant discharges to San Francisco Bay
                           through pipelines operated by the East Bay Dischargers Authority.
                           Improvements Needed
                           The federal government has ordered Alameda County and its cities to
                           reduce the amount of water that flows into the sanitary sewer system.
                           Half of the water that enters the sewers during wet weather comes from
                           deficient private sewer laterals, downspouts and yard area drains – all
                           of which are the responsibility of owners. Because older laterals are a
                           significant source of infiltration and inflow, some jurisdictions require
                           testing of sewer laterals prior to the sale or property and mandate
                           replacement or repair of lines that fail.
                           CVSD has a grant program that pays up to 50 percent of the cost of
                           replacing or repairing building laterals with a maximum reimbursement
                           of $2,000 per building lateral. The lateral, which connects a home’s
                           plumbing system to the public sewer main, is the property and
                           responsibility of the property.

Wastewater Recycling
CVSD and OLSD do not presently have programs for recycling any
wastewater flows. However, State law allows EBMUD to require the
use of recycled water for non-domestic purposes when it is of adequate
quality and quantity, available at reasonable cost, not detrimental
to public health, and will not harm plant life, fish, or wildlife. To
date, EBMUD has been able to promote the use of recycled water
through incentives rather than using this mandate. These incentives
are primarily in the form of subsidies to fund facility retrofits and rate
discounts providing lower connection fees for new customers who
use recycled water..
WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT GOAL
  GOAL 9.4-1	         Ensure the availability of adequate and effective
                      wastewater collection and treatment to protect
                      public health and safety.
WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT POLICIES

                      new development to incorporate water conserva-
                      tion measures.
  Policy 9.4-3	       Update Sewer System. Expand programs to re-
                      place and repair aging public and private sewer
                      lines to prevent water quality problems and comply
                      with federal and state requirements.

                           Stormwater, the portion of rainfall that does not infiltrate into the
                           soil, is a concern in urban areas where impervious surfaces limit
                           infiltration. Stormwater flows down from Castro Valley and the
                           Hayward hills to storm drains, channels, and pipelines leading to San
                           Lorenzo Creek and on to San Francisco Bay. Sulphur Creek and the
                           Estudillo and Bockman Canals also flow to San Francisco Bay.

owns and manages most storm drains in Castro Valley, located in Flood
Control Zone 2. Within Zone 2 there are 81 miles of natural creek,
five miles of earth channel, 12 miles of concrete channel, two miles
of improved channel, 44 miles of underground pipe, and two pump
stations. In addition there are two reservoirs, Cull Canyon and Don
Castro, which are maintained for flood control. Both reservoirs have
siltation and seismic issues that need to be addressed. Stormwater
quality issues are addressed in Chapter 10: Natural Hazards
and Public Safety.

                           9.6	 SOLID WASTE
                           The Castro Valley Sanitary District (CVSD) and the Oro Loma
                           Sanitary District (OLSD) handle refuse collection and disposal in
                           the planning area. The Districts collect solid waste, and generally
                           haul it to the Davis Street Transfer Station, and then to the Altamont
                           Landfill east of Livermore, contracts with Waste Management of
                           Alameda County. Altamont Landfill has an expected closure date of
                           2071. The Districts’ solid waste program expenses are mainly funded
                           by user fees. CVSD and OLSD are both members of the Alameda
                           County Waste Management Authority (ACWMA), a countywide
                           organization to divert materials from the landfill into reuse, recycle
                           and reduction programs.
                           The enactment, in 1989, of the California Integrated Waste
                           Management Act (AB 939) has resulted in a major refocusing of
                           CVSD activities in an attempt to meet the goals mandated by this
                           legislation of reducing the amount of material sent to the Altamont
                           Landfill by 25 percent by the year 1995 and by 50 percent by the
                           year 2000. Alameda County has set a countywide goal at 75 percent
                           diversion by 2010.
                           As a first step, the CVSD implemented a residential curbside recycling
                           program in April of 1991. In late 1994, a yard waste collection
                           program was implemented and has resulted in a large diversion of
                           residential “green waste”, such as grass clippings and yard trimmings.
                           OLSD also diverts waste through recycling programs, including a
                           residential curbside, commingled recycling program, residential
                           food scraps recycling program, and commercial recycling services.
                           Alameda County Household Hazardous Waste facilities dispose of
                           most household toxics, such as paint, batteries, and motor oil.
                           The CVSD’s 1995 and 2000 diversion goals were easily achieved
                           with the residential recycling and green waste programs; however, in
                           order to meet the year 2010’s diversion goal of 75 percent reduction,
                           commercial recycling and food waste programs are being explored
                           for implementation. In 2002, CVSD launched its residential curbside
                           food waste collection and construction and demolition debris
                           recycling programs. In 2003, the CVSD’s waste diversion rate was
                           61 percent. In 2000, OLSD exceeded the state mandated diversion
                           requirement with a waste diversion rate of 71 percent.

                           Non-municipal utilities, such as those providing electricity, natural
                           gas, telephone, and cable television, are important elements of
                           contemporary life, making it necessary to ensure these services
                           are available and adequate to meet the demands of Castro Valley’s
                           residents and businesses. However, because above-ground utility
                           wires and telecommunications equipment often have a negative
                           visual impact on a community, such facilities should be located and
                           designed to minimize these effects to the extent possible.
                           NON-MUNICIPAL UTILITIES GOAL

                      including co-location on existing structures.
9.8	 PUBLIC STREETS
The appearance and safety, both real and perceived, of public
streets play a large role in defining the character of any community.
According to the LAFCO’s Municipal Service Review, about a third
of the streets and roads in Alameda County and 23 percent of the
roads in the unincorporated area need to be rehabilitated but, because
of funding shortfalls, local agencies are, for the most part, unable
to keep up with the backlog of deteriorating streets. The backlog of
deferred maintenance in all of the unincorporated areas of the County
is about $71.1 million or $150,000 per street mile, which is higher
than the countywide average of $146,675.
In Castro Valley, the County Public Works Agency (PWA) is
responsible for capital improvement and maintenance of the public
streets in the planning area including repair and preventative
maintenance for pavement, other hardscape repairs, drainage, bridges,
landscaping, street trees and traffic signals. PWA also maintains
more than 4,000 Castro Valley street lights under contract with the
Street Lighting County Service Area (CSA). The Five Canyons CSA
                                                                                                                  9-25

Castro Valley General Plan
                           contracts with the PWA to maintain eight miles of public roads and
                           provide other services including landscaping, graffiti control, erosion
                           control, and maintenance of retaining walls in the Five Canyons area.
                           Road maintenance is funded primarily by gas taxes with other
                           funding from revenues from the voter-approved Measure B sales tax,
                           State Traffic Congestion Relief funds and, in CSAs, assessments and
                           service charges. The allocation of Measure B funds for local streets
                           and roads is based on population and street miles. There are significant
                           constraints on the financing of street services in all California
                           communities because of voter-approved limits and requirements on
                           tax increases and new taxes. One option that the PWA has proposed
                           in order to provide additional funding for street maintenance is the
                           creation of a new CSA, similar to the Street Lighting CSA, which
                           would make it possible to increase funding through voter-approved
                           assessments.10
                           The following policies deal only with street maintenance and
                           improvement. Issues of auto, bike, and pedestrian traffic flow are
                           addressed in the Circulation Element (Chapter 6).
                           PUBLIC STREETS GOAL
                             GOAL 9.8-1	         Maintain public streets in good condition to protect

Natural Hazards and
Public Safety
Castro Valley’s physical setting includes areas of steep topography,
creeks, and canyons. These features can pose risks related to soil
erosion, landslides, and flooding; and can create difficulties for
emergency vehicle access. The presence of several fault lines,
including the Hayward Fault, makes Castro Valley particularly
susceptible to geologic hazards associated with seismic activity
including ground shaking, landslides, and liquefaction. The
urbanized area of Castro Valley is also immediately adjacent to East
Bay Regional Parks land and permanent open space lands of Alameda
County—areas with high fire risk due to the presence of combustible      Castro Valley’s physical setting contains

vegetation, the lack of fire breaks, and the limited access. Thus, there
are a number of natural hazards that pose public safety risks in Castro
Valley. This element describes the risks and includes policies and
actions to minimize the risk of damage to property or injury to people.

                                              Fire hazard potential is largely dependent on the extent and type of
                                              vegetation, known as surface fuels, that exists within a region. Fire
                                              hazards are typically highest in wooded, undeveloped areas, because
                                              trees are a greater source of fuel than low-lying brush or grasslands.
                                              Although suburban or urban areas or rocky barren areas have minimal
                                              surface fuels, fires that begin in vegetated wildland areas can spread
                                              into adjacent developed areas, called the wildland-urban interface,

next to regional parks and large areas of
undeveloped land, which can increase the
fire hazard risk for residences.              In Castro Valley, the areas with the greatest risk rim the community
                                              to the north, east, and south where residential neighborhoods
                                              border undeveloped wooded or grassy areas. State law requires the
                                              California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to designate
                                              Very High Fire Severity Zones based on the potential threat from
                                              wildfire hazards. The zones include areas where the responsibility
                                              for preventing and suppressing fires is primarily the responsibility
                                              of the State and areas where local agencies are responsible for fire
                                              protection. (Figure 10-1) In January 2009, the Alameda County

                                              Factors contributing to a Very High Fire Severity Zone designation
                                              include the following features:
                                              •	 Availability and type of fuels (presence of highly combustible
                                                  vegetation, etc.),
                                              •	 Weather (high velocity winds and high temperatures with low
                                                  humidity),
                                              •	 Topography (hill and canyon areas can accentuate the climatic
                                                  conditions described above), and
                                              •	 Development density.
                                              In areas of high fire hazard, the risk to structures from fire exposure is
                                              based on the materials with which they are built (i.e., a concrete structure
                                              would resist fire more than a structure covered with wooden shingles)
                                              and proximity to fuel sources, such as trees, shrubs, wooden decks
                                              and fences, and woodpiles. The ability of fire protection assistance to
                                              access a site is also an important issue when determining fire risk. Fire
                                              engines need adequate water sources, roads, and turning radii in order

to adequately fight fires. Risk is reduced in areas where development
meets more stringent design requirements. Fire risk is also reduced
in areas with public streets, which are typically better maintained and
where parking restrictions are enforced. Both of these conditions are
important to maintaining emergency access.
Some of the areas of Castro Valley with the greatest potential for
infill residential development are in the upper hillside areas close
to the regional park and open space lands where there is high fire
hazard risk. Other areas have fire hazard risk because small water
distribution pipes reduce available water pressure. According to
the Alameda County Fire Department, the water lines in some of
the higher density areas of the community located near the Central
Business District are only four inches in diameter when pipes with
a six-inch diameter or larger may be necessary to provide adequate
water pressure and flows for fire suppression.
Approaches to reducing fire risk in the urban/wildland interface
typically include a combination of vegetation management and
modification, structural requirements, land use planning, and public
education. Different jurisdictions have incorporated provisions to
address these issues in hazard mitigation plans, habitat conservation
plans, and fire management plans as well as zoning and subdivision
ordinances, development review guidelines and wildland-urban
interface codes intended to augment building and fire codes in interface
areas. In addition, many jurisdictions have established procedures
to ensure that fire officials are involved in the development review
process to ensure that both the configuration of development and the
structures themselves are designed to mitigate fire hazards.
The County Public Works Agency uses an Integrated Vegetation
Management Program to control plants that may pose a fire danger,
obstruct drainage water, or interfere with maintenance of County
facilities. The Integrated Vegetation Management Program does not
currently apply to private property owners. In addition, Chapter 6.44
of the County’s General Ordinance prohibits vegetation that may
increase fire hazards, but the ordinance does not identify specific
vegetation management measures for which private property owners
are responsible in order to reduce fire hazards on their properties.
The State has amended the Building Code standards that deal with
materials and construction methods for exterior wildfire exposure
and local agencies must either accept the new provisions or adopt an
amended version of the State code. In contrast to the previous code,
                                                                                                            10-5

Castro Valley General Plan
                           which required construction methods intended to limit fires that start
                           in a structure from spreading, the new requirements impose standards
                           designed to limit ignition potential by resisting the intrusion of flame
                           or burning embers from a vegetation fire. Because the State code only
                           applies to new construction, some jurisdictions that have existing
                           developed areas in the Wildland-Urban Interface have exercised the
                           option to amend the State requirements to apply the fire resistive
                           standards to additions and alterations. Other local amendments have
                           made ancillary structures like carports, trellises, arbors, and similar
                           structures subject to requirements and required the installation of
                           automatic sprinklers of work that exceeds a threshold value.

               the use of appropriate fire resistant building materi-
               als, installation of fire sprinklers, and/or vegetation
               management, and that such requirements shall be
               based on a property’s access, slope, water pres-
               sure, and proximity to wildland areas. Such require-
               ments shall apply particularly to projects proposed
               within Very High Fire Zone Areas as identified in
               Figure 10-1, Fire Hazards, but may also apply to

               an increase in density so that any inadequacy of
               water pressure for fire hydrants and fire flows for
               fire suppression purposes is identified early in the
               development review process. Also identify if the
               roadway serving the project is deficient in terms of
               access for emergency vehicles. Identify any access
               improvements that may be required, for example
               roadway widening along property frontage, or ad-
               ditional off-street parking.

10.2	 HYDROLOGY AND FLOODING HAZARDS
Creeks and Surface Water Drainage
Castro Valley is located in the southern San Francisco Bay hydrologic
region. Watersheds within the region are defined by creeks, streams,
and other surface water drainages that originate in the upland areas
near Mount Diablo and flow down toward the Bay. Drainage patterns
within Castro Valley are shaped by the region’s topography, which
                                                                            Water drains down from the hills through
consists of steeper areas located along the foothills of the Diablo         Castro Valley, then through Hayward and San
Range that gradually flatten out onto an alluvial plain.                    Lorenzo, and into San Francisco Bay.
The majority of Castro Valley is within the San Lorenzo Watershed,
which includes Chabot, Castro Valley, Cull, Crow, and Sulphur Creeks.
Several unnamed tributaries flow into these creeks. The western portion
of the planning area is within the San Leandro Watershed. San Leandro
Creek rises on the east side of the Oakland hills, runs into Upper San
Leandro Reservoir and then Lake Chabot before flowing west through
San Leandro and into San Francisco Bay near Oakland International
Airport. Various creek segments are natural, or managed in concrete-
lined or earthen channels, or are contained in a closed conduit (culvert).
Figure 10-2 shows floodplains and channel construction types for
different creek segments. Chabot Creek and Castro Valley Creek have
been improved over the years to convey adequate flows to avoid or
reduce flooding. Several ponds that act as detention basins are present
along Cull, San Lorenzo and Chabot Creeks. Small, natural ponds may
occur within some of the creeks and tributaries.
•	   Crow Creek is a perennial stream. It has not been dammed but
     the portion just upstream of its confluence with Cull Creek has
     been contained with a concrete box culvert.
•	   Cull Creek has good water quality and excellent wildlife habitat.
     In 1963, this stream was dammed approximately 0.25 miles up-
     stream of the Crow Creek confluence. The dam has a capacity of
     310 acre feet.
•	   San Lorenzo Creek is controlled by the Don Castro Dam built in
     1964. The dam has a capacity of 380 acre feet and is located just
     downstream of the Palomares Creek confluence.
•	   Castro Valley Creek flows year round from the hills through
     the urbanized portion of the community. The creek is primarily
     contained in incised or concrete channels but a portion flows
     through earthen channels.
•	   Chabot Creek is mostly urbanized except along Carlos Bee Park.

                                             Surface Water Quality
                                             Pollutants discharged into the creeks in Castro Valley come from
                                             both point and nonpoint sources. A point source is any discernible,
                                             confined, and discrete conveyance (e.g., a pipe discharge) of
                                             pollutants to a water body from sources such as industrial facilities or
                                             wastewater treatment plants. Point source pollution in Castro Valley
                                             is generally limited to permitted pipeline discharges that are subject
                                             to prohibitions by regulatory agencies, water quality requirements,
Some areas of Castro Valley, such as         periodic monitoring, annual reporting, and other requirements
Palomares Road, still get water for domestic designed to protect the overall water quality of the creeks and
purposes from wells.

                                             Nonpoint pollutant sources are sources that do not have a single,
                                             identifiable discharge point but are rather a combination of many
                                             sources. Examples of nonpoint sources include stormwater runoff
                                             from parking lots contaminated with petroleum products, pesticides
                                             from farming operations, or sediment from soil erosion.
                                             While all the creeks in the planning area have some issues with
                                             erosion, siltation, and urban or agriculture runoff, only San Lorenzo
                                             Creek is listed as impaired. The pollutant diazinon has been identified
                                             in this creek, which indicates agricultural pesticides have entered
                                             it through runoff and sewer lines. Even though there are no major
                                             discharges to Castro Valley Creek, copper has been found in it.
                                             Groundwater
                                             The Castro Valley groundwater basin (No. 2-8) is part of the San
                                             Francisco Bay hydrologic region. The basin is three square miles
                                             in area bounded on the east by the San Lorenzo Creek and by the
                                             Hayward Fault on the west. The principal water bearing units within
                                             the basin are Pleistocene alluvial deposits including clays, silts,
                                             sands, and gravels.
                                             A study conducted in 1984 by EBMUD showed that the annual
                                             recharge for the central Castro Valley area was estimated to be 250
                                             acre feet per year. It was also estimated that the maximums well yield
                                             was 0.14 million gallons per day. Groundwater outside the central
                                             sub-basin area is replenished by direct infiltration and percolation
                                             of rainfall (approximately 18 to 24 inches annually); excess applied
                                             irrigation water and subsurface inflow from adjacent foothills.
                                             Groundwater quality in the basin is characterized by bicarbonates with
                                             calcium and sodium as the predominant cations or combination of

chemical elements. The central Castro Valley sub-basin was also rated
high on the potential contamination list due to shallow groundwater
contamination from underground storage tanks at various locations.
Therefore, groundwater use within the central Castro Valley area
should generally be restricted to non-potable purposes.
There are approximately 150 domestic well users and approximately
100 known irrigation wells in use in the planning area. The wells
are generally located in rural areas near Crow Canyon Road, Norris
Canyon Road, Cull Canyon Road, Sunny Slope Avenue, Eden
Canyon Road, Hollis Canyon Road, Palomares Road, and Dublin
Canyon Road.
Flooding Hazards
Flood-prone areas are generally located in topographic lows and in
close proximity to streams and creeks. Flooding could result from
storm runoff or dam failure. During larger storms, flooding could
                                                                           Storm drainage channels and creeks in
occur primarily as sheet flow in streets and along stream channels.        Castro Valley are part of the flood control

addressed through flood control projects by the ACFCWCD. Castro
Valley lies in the Flood Zone 2 of the Alameda County Flood Control
and Water Conservation District (ACFCWCD).
Flood zone mapping by the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
published by Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA)
indicate that the Castro Valley area is most prone to flooding
along Chabot and Castro Valley Creeks. As shown on Figure 10-2,
approximately 132 acres near the concrete and improved channels
in the southern portion of Castro Valley are designated as 100-year
flood plains, and approximately 250 acres spread around the creeks
and closed channels in the northern portion of Castro Valley are
designated as 500-year flood plains. However, there are other creeks
and culverts in the area that could experience localized flooding during
large storm events. Most drainage systems within Castro Valley are
adequate to carry runoff from a 10-year storm and a 15-year storm.
The policies in Chapter 7: Biological Resources will have co-benefits
for protecting water resources in Castro Valley. The proposed
Overlay Zone will limit development and require special permit
review that would minimize changes in runoff patterns by retaining
natural drainage patterns, contribute to improved water quality, and
potentially reduce water pollutant sources.

                                               Castro Valley is subject to risks from seismic activity. Castro Valley
                                               is located in the San Andreas Fault Zone, one of the most seismically
                                               active regions in the United States. The San Andreas Fault Zone
                                               has generated numerous moderate to strong earthquakes in northern
                                               California and the San Francisco Bay Area. The region experienced
                                               large and destructive earthquakes in 1838, 1868, 1906 and 1989.

                                               Andreas Fault Zone, runs through the western part of Castro Valley
                                               crossing Highway 238 west of the I-580 interchange. According to the
                                               USGS, the fault system that includes the Hayward and Rodgers Creek

the Hayward Fault would, in all probability, cause extensive damage in
Castro Valley.
In addition to the Hayward Fault, several others, including the west
and east Chabot Faults and the so-called Carlos Bee Fault, cross
the western part of the planning area to the east of the Hayward
zone. Other regional faults, including the San Andreas, Calaveras
or Rodgers Creek, could also affect Castro Valley. A moderate to
major earthquake on any of these faults could topple buildings,
disrupt infrastructure, cripple the transportation system, and trigger      Older “soft-story” buildings with habitable
                                                                            space above garages are some of the more

35,000 years.
This is accomplished by preventing the construction of buildings
used for human occupancy on surface traces of active faults. Before
approving a project within a designated Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone,
the county must require a geologic investigation to demonstrate that
the proposed buildings would not be constructed across an active or
potentially active fault.
Besides fault rupture, however, earthquakes can also give rise to various
secondary seismic hazards including ground shaking, liquefaction
and subsidence, ground rupture and slope instability. These seismic
hazards and their aftermath can cause structural damage, bodily harm
and loss of human life. The California Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
of 1990 (California Public Resources Code Section 2690 et seq.) was
adopted to address seismic hazards other than surface rupture, such
as liquefaction and seismically induced landslides. The Act specifies
that the lead agency for a project may withhold development permits
until the applicant conducts geologic or soils investigations to identify
potential hazards and recommend measures intended to reduce hazards
associated with seismic activity and unstable soils.
Ground Shaking Susceptibility
Ground movement during an earthquake can vary depending on
the overall magnitude, distance to the fault, focus of earthquake
energy, and type of geologic material. The composition of underlying
soils, even those relatively distant from faults, can intensify ground
shaking. Areas that are underlain by bedrock tend to experience less
ground shaking than those underlain by unconsolidated sediments
such as artificial fill or unconsolidated alluvial fill. The strongest
ground shaking in Castro Valley is anticipated to occur as a result of
                                                                                                                 10-21

                           an earthquake on the Hayward fault, due to its immediate proximity.
                           Ground shaking typically causes over 90 percent of all earthquake
                           damage. California has two shaking zones 4 and 3. Castro Valley
                           is within Zone 4, which applies to areas located nearest to active
                           earthquake faults and where ground shaking poses greater hazards
                           than Zone 3. State law requires local governments in Seismic Zone
                           4 to have an earthquake loss reduction program for unreinforced
                           masonry buildings.2 This includes buildings constructed of brick
                           and hollow clay tile, which are not as common in Castro Valley
                           as they are in older parts of Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward.
                           Castro Valley does, however, have many Multi-story buildings and
                           “soft-story” buildings with habitable space above garages, which
                           are among the most vulnerable building types. These building types
                           are concentrated in the central Castro Valley neighborhoods north of
                           Castro Valley Boulevard.
                           The Modified Mercalli (MM) intensity scale is commonly used to
                           measure earthquake effects due to ground shaking. The MM values
                           for intensity range from I (earthquake not felt) to XII (damage nearly
                           total), and intensities ranging from IV to X could cause moderate
                           to significant structural damage (see Table 10.3-1). Maximum
                           anticipated ground shaking intensities within the Castro Valley area
                           are illustrated in Figure 10-3. Ground shaking could be Category X,
                           Very Violent, in the westernmost areas of Castro Valley closest to
                           the Hayward Fault; and Category IX, Violent, in the entire western
                           half of Castro Valley. In the eastern half of Castro Valley, ground
                           shaking is predicted to be Category VIII, Very Strong. Based upon
                           the MM intensity scale, damage in areas immediately bordering the
                           fault could be significant.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a phenomenon whereby unconsolidated and/or near-
saturated soils lose cohesion and are converted to a fluid state as a
result of severe vibratory motion. The relatively rapid loss of soil
shear strength during strong earthquake shaking results in temporary,
fluid-like behavior of the soil. Soil liquefaction causes ground failure
that can damage roads, pipelines, underground cables, and buildings
with shallow foundations. Liquefaction more commonly occurs in
                                                                                EBMUD has replaced the original dam at
looser, saturated unconsolidated or artificial fill sediments located           Upper San Leandro Reservoir.
in reclaimed areas along the margin of San Francisco Bay but
liquefaction can also occur in creek channels.
The areas susceptible to liquefaction in Castro Valley are, for
the most part, low-lying lands along the creeks that flow into San
Lorenzo Creek. These include lands within areas that are also in the
FEMA-mapped flood plains along Chabot, Castro Valley, Cull, and
Crow Creeks and in Eden and Hollis Canyon in the eastern part of
the planning area.3
Dam Failure Inundation
Based on maps that dam owners are required to file with the State
Office of Emergency Services, several Castro Valley neighborhoods
are susceptible to flooding that could occur as a result of dam failure.
Such failures are typically associated with seismic activity. The
Upper San Leandro and Chabot Reservoirs are the largest facilities
that could affect the planning area but most of the areas subject
to inundation are undeveloped lands outside the County’s Urban
Growth Boundary. Two other reservoirs, Almond and South, pose a
more substantial threat to residential neighborhoods.4
Copies of these maps are also provided to the appropriate public
safety agency of any city and/or county likely to be affected. Most
local agencies overlay these inundation maps onto their parcel map
systems.

                           Landslides
                           A landslide is a mass of rock, soil and debris displaced down slope
                           by sliding, flowing, or falling. Ground failure is dependent on
                           topography and underlying geologic materials, as well as factors such
                           as rainfall, excavation, or seismic activities that can precipitate slope
                           instability. Steep slopes and downslope creep of surface materials
                           characterize areas most susceptible to landsliding. Landslides are
                           least likely in topographically low alluvial fans and at the margin of
                           the San Francisco Bay.
                           The areas with the highest susceptibility to landslides in Castro
                           Valley are in the upland areas in the northern and eastern parts of the
                           planning area and in steep hillside areas above Foothill Boulevard and
                           Hillcrest Knolls in the El Portal and Fairmont Ridge neighborhoods as
                           illustrated in Figure 10-4. The State Division of Mines and Geology’s
                           maps identify the area to the south of the County Justice Center and
                           to the north east of Alameda County Medical Center as particularly
                           susceptible to earthquake based on previous occurrence of landslide
                           movement, geologic conditions and proximity to the Hayward Fault.

SOILS AND SEISMIC SAFETY ACTIONS
 Action 10.3-1	 Geotechnical Study Requirements. Require geo-
                technical studies prior to development approval
                in geologic and/or seismic hazard areas identified
                in Figure 10-4, Soils and Seismic Hazards, or as
                identified by future studies by federal, state, and
                regional agencies. Require or undertake compre-
                hensive geologic and engineering studies for criti-
                cal structures regardless of location. Critical struc-        Establish a seismic retrofit program that
                tures are those most needed following a disaster or           would encourage property owners, on
                those that could pose hazards of their own if dam-            a voluntary basis, to seismically retrofit
                aged. They include utility centers and substations,           residential properties containing four or
                water reservoirs, hospitals, fire stations, police and        more units by waiving building permit fees.
                emergency communications facilities, and bridges
                and overpasses.
 Action 10.3-2	 Adoption of and Amendments to California Building
                Code. Adopt and amend as needed the most cur-
                rent version of the California Building Code (CBC) to
                ensure that new construction and renovation proj-
                ects incorporate Earthquake-resistant design and
                materials that meet or exceed the current seismic
                engineering standards of the CBC Seismic Zone 4
                requirements.
 Action 10.3-3	 Seismic Retrofit Program. Establish a seismic ret-
                rofit program that would encourage property owners
                to, on a voluntary basis, seismically retrofit residen-
                tial properties containing four or more units by waiv-
                ing building permit fees.
 Action 10.3-4	 Use of Soils and Seismic Hazards Map at Coun-
                ty’s Planning Counter. Place a copy of Figure 10-4,
                Soils and Seismic Hazards, at the County’s Plan-
                ning Counter to advise project applicants in Castro
                Valley that the property is in an area at risk for liq-
                uefaction, landslides or ground-shaking.
 Action 10.3-5	 Adoption of Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan. Adopt
                and amend as needed a Natural Hazards Mitigation
                Plan in order to maintain eligibility for full federal as-
                sistance in the event of a natural disaster, per the
                requirements of the federal Disaster Mitigation Act
                of 2000.
 Action 10.3-6	 Steep Slopes. On sites with slopes with an existing
                grade greater than 30 percent, require all develop-
                ment to be located outside of the 30 percent slope
                area.
                                                                                                                     10-29

                                                     slopes to control erosion.
                                                  •	 Plant materials for revegetation should not
                                                     be limited to hydro-seeding and mulching with
                                                     annual grasses. Trees add structure to the soil

                                                  •	 Ensure blending of cut-and-fill slopes within
                                                     existing contours, and provision of horizontal
                                                     variation, in order to mitigate the artificial ap-

                                                  •	 Ensure structural integrity of sites previously
                                                     filled before approving redevelopment.
                             Action 10.3-8	      Alquist-Priolo. Require all development within
                                                 the Alquist-Priolo areas to conform to retrofitting
                                                 requirements.
                           10.4	 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
                           Risks Associated with Hazardous Materials
                           Castro Valley, while primarily a residential community, includes
                           variety of land uses where current or historical activities may pose
                           potential environmental and health and safety risks. Releases, leaks,
                           or disposal of chemical compounds, such as petroleum hydrocarbons,
                           on or below the ground surface can lead to contamination of underlying
                           soil and groundwater. Disturbance of a previously contaminated area
                           through grading or excavation operations could expose the public to
                           health hazards from physical contact with contaminated materials or
                           hazardous vapors.
                           Risks related to hazardous materials also include accidents involving
                           vehicles transporting hazardous materials or hazardous wastes,
                           accidental spills or leaks, and improper use, handling, storage,
                           transport, and disposal of hazardous materials. In addition, improper
                           disposal of household-generated hazardous waste, such as used
                           motor oil, paints, and solvents can also impact water quality in local

                                                                   Chapter 10 | Natural Hazards and Public Safety
waterways. Response to hazardous materials spills is provided by the
Alameda County Fire District, which provides emergency response
services for Castro Valley.
Sites with Soil or Groundwater Contamination
Areas where historic or on-going activities have resulted in the known
or suspected release of hazardous materials to soil and groundwater or to
the air are identified by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality
Control Board and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA.)
These sites are designated as either Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks
(LUFT) sites or SLIC (Spills, Leaks, Investigations, and Cleanups)
sites, which are non-fuel contamination sites, or air emission sites.
Many of these sites are former industrial facilities and dry cleaners,
where chlorinated solvents were spilled, or have leaked into the soil or
groundwater.
Within Castro Valley, the majority of the sites with contamination are
clustered around the commercial area of Castro Valley Boulevard. This
contamination may be the result of underground storage tank (UST)
releases, spills, accidental releases or other activities involving the
use of hazardous materials. Contamination can be cleaned up using a
variety of soil and groundwater remediation techniques. Site clean up
is required under Federal, State, and local regulations whenever a site
with contamination is proposed to be redeveloped.
Overall a Low Level of Risk
Because Castro Valley is primarily residential, has no areas zoned
for industrial uses, and because hazardous materials use and disposal
is heavily regulated, the likelihood of conflicting uses, or potential
exposure to hazardous materials or conditions, would be limited.
Impacts related to routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous
materials; or accidental release of hazardous materials in Castro
Valley would also be less than significant because existing federal,
State, and City regulations require that these hazards be investigated
during the project planning process and measures to eliminate them
be incorporated in the project design prior to completing the project
approval process. There are no Castro Valley sites on the State
Department of Toxic Substances Control’s Hazardous Waste and
Substances Site List - Site Cleanup (Cortese List).
Prior to approval of final maps and improvement plans for any
development project within Castro Valley, plan review and approval
                                                                                                           10-31

Castro Valley General Plan
                           by the Alameda County Fire District is required. Internal roadways
                           and ingress/egress for each site would be required to meet State and
                           local standards regarding turning radius, road width, and emergency
                           vehicle access, thereby preventing potential impacts to emergency
                           evacuation or response. Castro Valley is not located within two miles
                           of a private or public airstrip or within an area covered by an airport

Noise
Although a common characteristic of life in any urban or suburban
area, noise not only reduces the quality of life but can also affect the
health of people who live and work in a community. The predominant
sources of noise in Castro Valley are vehicular traffic and BART.
Because Interstate 580 runs directly through Castro Valley, noise
from traffic directly affects those parts of the community located
along and upslope from the freeway. BART noise is also significant
for the areas closest to the tracks. To a much lesser degree, there
are noise impacts along the heavily trafficked streets – Castro Valley
Boulevard, Lake Chabot Road, and Redwood Road and Center Street          I-580 is the main permanent source of noise
                                                                         in Castro Valley, due to high speed auto
– that can affect nearby properties. This chapter is intended to ensure
                                                                         traffic, compounded by the high volume of
compliance with State requirements and also minimize the impacts of      traffic.

                                             Noise can be defined as a sound or series of sounds that are intrusive,
                                             irritating, objectionable, or otherwise disruptive to daily life.
                                             Background or ambient noise is, for the most part, the product of
                                             many distant noise sources, which together constitute a relatively
                                             stable noise background exposure. The individual contributors are
                                             usually unidentifiable. In a relatively dense suburban environment,
                                             background noise typically includes cars, trucks, horns, construction,
                                             trains, and voices. Noise levels are also affected by short duration
                                             single event noise sources such as aircraft flyovers, leaf blowers,
The BART line is another major noise source,
                                             motorcycles, barking dogs, and sirens, which are readily identifiable
although it only generates sound in short    to the individual. When it consistently occurs at a very high volume

                                             hospitals, nursing homes, auditoriums, natural areas, parks and
                                             outdoor recreation areas are generally more sensitive to noise than are
                                             people in commercial and industrial establishments. Consequently,
                                             noise standards for these sensitive land uses are more stringent than
                                             for those at less sensitive uses. To protect various human activities in
                                             sensitive areas, lower noise levels are generally required.
                                             This part of the Castro Valley Plan is intended to ensure continuing
                                             compliance with State requirements and promote a comprehensive
                                             program for achieving acceptable noise levels throughout Castro
                                             Valley.
                                             11.1	 NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND
                                                       MEASUREMENT
                                             Noises vary widely in their scope, source, and volume, ranging from
                                             individual occurrences such as leaf blowers, to the temporary noise
                                             of construction activities, to the fairly constant noise generated by
                                             traffic on I-580 and Castro Valley Boulevard and by BART trains.
                                             The major noise source in Castro Valley is vehicle traffic. Traffic
                                             noise depends primarily on the speed of traffic and the percentage of
                                             truck traffic. The primary source of noise from automobiles is high
                                             frequency tire noise, which increases with speed. In addition, trucks
                                             and older automobiles produce engine and exhaust noise, and trucks
                                             also generate wind noise. While tire noise from autos is generally
                                             located at ground level, truck noise sources can be located as high

                                                                             Chapter 11 | Noise
as ten to fifteen feet above the roadbed due to tall exhaust stacks
and higher engines; sound walls are not effective for mitigating such
noise unless they are very tall.
When noise levels are reported, they are expressed as a measurement
over time in order to account for variations in noise exposure. A
decibel (dB) is a unit of measurement that indicates the relative
amplitude of a sound. The most common method of characterizing
sound in California regulations is the A-weighted sound level or dBA.
This scale gives greater weight to the sound frequencies to which the
human ear is most sensitive. Because sensitivity to noise increases
during the evening and at night, when excessive noise interferes
with the ability to sleep, systems for describing environmental
sound incorporate noise penalties to account for this difference. The
Community Noise Equivalent Level, CNEL, is a measure of the
cumulative noise exposure in a community, with a 5 dBA penalty
added to evening (7:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.) and a 10 dBA addition
to nocturnal (10:00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m.) noise levels. The Day/Night
Average Sound Level, Ldn or DNL, is similar to the CNEL, with the
exception that the evening time period weighting is dropped.
11.2	 NOISE REGULATION
In addition to the provisions of this Plan, there are a number of other
County policies and regulations applicable to noise conditions in
the Castro Valley planning area. The Countywide Noise Element
established interior and exterior noise average noise levels (Ldn) of
45 dBA and 55 DBA respectively for residential land uses based on
Federal noise level standards. The Noise Element also references
noise compatibility standards developed by the Association of Bay
Area Governments, which identified a CNEL of 65 dBA or less as
a basis for finding little noise impact on residential land uses, 65
to 70 dBA as a moderate impact, and any level above 70 dBA as a
significant impact.1
The County’s Noise Ordinance (Chapter 6.60 of the County General
Code, October 2006) implemented the Noise Element by establishing
acceptable exterior noise standards for land uses that augment the
requirements of the Alameda County Building Code, which establishes
standards for interior noise levels consistent with the noise insulation
standards in the California State Building Code, using the A weighted

                           noise for commercial properties than for residential uses, schools,
                           hospitals, churches, or libraries. The Building Code establishes a
                           standard of 45 dBA inside of new residential construction and requires
                           acoustic analysis to show that new structures have been designed so
                           that interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources do not exceed
                           45 dB in any habitable room.
                           The County Noise Ordinance also regulates identifiable shorter
                           duration noise sources such as the operation of audio equipment
                           and electric or gas powered tools and noise from animals and birds.
                           The Ordinance defines these occurrences as a Noise Disturbance if
                           they cause frequent or continuous noise that is “plainly audible” at a
                           distance of 50 feet from the source.
                           Table 11.1-1 shows the number of cumulative minutes that a
                           particular external noise level is permitted, as well as the maximum

11.3	 NOISE SOURCES IN CASTRO VALLEY
The dominant sources of noise throughout the community are
transportation-related. For roadways, more noise is generated as
vehicle speed and weight increase, although the noise is continuous
and background in nature. Interstate 580 is the main source of
roadway noise in Castro Valley, although major thoroughfares with
higher speeds, traffic volumes, and truck usage also generate notable
levels of noise. These roadways include Castro Valley Boulevard,
Lake Chabot Road (north of Strobridge Avenue and east of Interstate
580/Foothill Expressway), Grove Way (east of Center Street), and
Redwood Road/”A” Street. Areas above I-580/Foothill Expressway
are exposed to traffic noise levels ranging from 68 to 73 dBA at a
distance of 50 feet of the roadway during the day and 59 to 69 dBA
at night according to noise measurements conducted by Illingworth
& Rodkin for the Eden Area General Plan in 2006. Other roadways
with higher than acceptable noise levels were 158th Avenue and Lake
Chabot Road near I-580. Noise levels 50 feet from the roadway
measured 64 to 69 dBA on 158th Avenue and 70 to 75 dBA on Lake
Chabot Road.
BART trains are another transportation feature that generates
significant levels of noise, although for a short duration. In Castro
Valley, the BART trains are located within the median of I-580 so these
noise sources impact the same areas. Depending on meteorological
conditions, residents living some distance from BART may also hear
trains.
Eden Medical Center Castro Valley is the most significant noise
source in the planning area that is not part of the transportation
system. In addition to generating vehicle traffic, a noise source that
is not regulated by the County Noise Ordinance, the noise impacts
from hospital operations include loading dock activities, mechanical
equipment, and flights to and from the helistop. A log of helicopter
operations during a 21-month period in 2006-08 recorded 149
helicopter flights, about a third of which occurred between the hours
of 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.2

Castro Valley General Plan
                           11.4	 2025 PROJECTED NOISE CONDITIONS
                           Due to population, job growth, and economic development expected
                           in Castro Valley under the updated General Plan, automobile traffic
                           is anticipated to increase on the community’s arterial streets. In
                           addition, continued development near Dublin and Livermore will
                           increase automobile traffic on I-580 and may increase the frequency
                           of BART trains. However, increased traffic congestion may lower
                           speeds on local roads and I-580, which would reduce noise levels.
                           In addition, proposed infill development will increase temporary
                           point sources of noise from construction activities. Because the Plan
                           proposes to increase residential development closer to and within
                           the Central Business District, it will also increase the proportion of
                           Castro Valley’s future population that would be exposed to the higher
                           noise levels generated along the I-580 corridor.
                           Figure 11-1 shows the expected future levels of noise generated by
                           Castro Valley’s transportation corridors in 2025. As the map shows,
                           noise levels above 70 dBA are only expected around I-580, with noise
                           levels gradually dissipating to below 55 dBA about a half mile from
                           the highway. The major surface streets in Castro Valley will generate
                           some noise as well, with land near Lake Chabot Road experiencing
                           up to 55 dBA and property along Redwood Road, Center Street, and
                           Crow Canyon Road receiving up to 60 dBA in noise. The Central
                           Business District is largely in a 60 dBA zone, because of sound from
                           I-580 and BART operations.
                           Eden Medical Center will continue to generate noise that affects
                           residential areas to the north and west but some features incorporated
                           in the new hospital should help to reduce the impact of mechanical
                           equipment and loading dock activities. Despite the construction of
                           a sound wall along Stanton Avenue, the noise received by nearby
                           residents from delivery trucks using the loading dock on the west
                           side of the new hospital will exceed County noise standards. The
                           Stanton Avenue sound wall and a sound barrier around the central
                           utility yard will reduce noise from mechanical equipment to levels
                           that meet the county’s exterior noise standards. In addition to the
                           sound barrier around the yard, enclosures will be installed around
                           emergency generators and boilers and rooftop HVAC equipment.
                           The new helistop, 185 feet northeast of the current location, is not
                           expected to increase noise levels but helicopter overflights at night
                           will continue to disturb nearby residents.

 GOAL 11.1-1	   Protect residents and workers in Castro Valley
                from noise that affects comfort and health.
                Reduce noise to within established noise limits to
                the maximum extent feasible; curtail the increase
                of noise levels in the future; and mitigate noise im-
                pacts on sensitive uses through siting and design.

                noise-sensitive uses in areas with projected noise
                levels greater than 70 dBA. Where such uses are
                permitted, require incorporation of mitigation mea-
                sures to ensure that interior noise levels are ac-
                ceptable.
 Policy 11.1-2	 Traffic Speeds and Noise Standards. Establish traf-
                fic speed limits at levels that will not produce noise
                levels that exceed established County noise stan-
                dards.

Air Quality and
Climate Change
This chapter discusses the potential impacts of air quality and
global climate change on residents’ quality of life and health. The
predominant source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in
Castro Valley is vehicular traffic. Because Interstate 580 runs directly
through Castro Valley, air pollutant emissions from traffic directly
affect the areas alongside the freeway. This chapter includes policies
and actions to minimize the impacts of air quality on Castro Valley
residents and businesses. In addition, this chapter includes strategies,
policies, and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new
growth and government operations and services in Castro Valley.
                                                                         12-1

Castro Valley General Plan
                           12.1	 AIR QUALITY
                           Air Quality Regulations
                           Reduction of air pollutants will contribute to the quality of life for
                           those who live and work in Castro Valley by improving their health.
                           Motor vehicle transportation, including automobiles, trucks, transit
                           buses, and other travel modes, is the major contributor to regional
                           air pollution, so any further progress in air quality improvement now
                           focuses heavily on transportation sources.
                           The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) is the
                           regional agency with regulatory authority over emission sources in
                           the Bay Area, including Castro Valley. Specific rules and regulations
                           adopted by the BAAQMD limit the emissions that can be generated
                           by various uses and/or activities, and identify specific pollution
                           reduction measures that must be implemented in association with
                           various uses and activities. Emissions sources subject to these
                           rules are regulated through the BAAQMD’s permitting process and
                           standards of operation. Through this permitting process, including
                           an annual permit review, the BAAQMD monitors generation of
                           stationary emissions and uses this information in developing its air
                           quality plans. Any source of stationary emissions developed within
                           Castro Valley, as well as equipment related to construction, is subject
                           to the BAAQMD Rules and Regulations.
                           There are no monitoring stations located within Castro Valley. Levels
                           of air quality in Castro Valley can generally be inferred from ambient
                           air quality measurements conducted by the BAAQMD at its nearby
                           monitoring stations, at San Leandro Station and the La Mesa Station
                           in Hayward.
                           Pollution Sources
                           On average, there has been less than one incidence of the state one-
                           hour ozone standard being exceeded per year over the last five years.
                           The 8-hour ozone standard has been exceeded twice over the last
                           five years at the La Mesa station in Hayward, but the standards have
                           not been exceeded at the San Leandro station. Bay Area emissions
                           of the ozone precursors ROG and NOx are expected to decrease by
                           approximately 24 and 36 percent, respectively, between 2005 and
                           2020 largely as a result of the State’s on-road motor vehicle emission
                           control program, as vehicles meeting more stringent emission
                           standards enter the fleet and all vehicles use cleaner burning gasoline

                                                                     Chapter 12 | Air Quality and Climate Change
and diesel fuel or alternative fuels.
The Bay Area does experience levels that exceed the state PM-10
and PM-2.5 standards on a fairly regular basis. PM-10 and PM-2.5
consist of particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter
and 2.5 microns or less in diameter, respectively. PM-10 and PM-2.5
represent particulate matter of sizes that can be inhaled into the air
passages and the lungs and can cause adverse health effects. Generally,
contributors to PM concentrations in Castro Valley are primarily urban
sources, dust suspended by vehicle traffic, and secondary aerosols
formed by reactions in the atmosphere. Particulate concentrations
near residential sources generally are higher during the winter, when
more fireplaces are in use and meteorological conditions prevent the
dispersion of directly emitted contaminants.
Direct PM-10 emissions in Alameda County are expected to increase
by approximately 19 percent between 2005 and 2020. (California Air
Resources Board, 2006). This increase would be primarily from an
increase in fugitive dust, an anticipated increase in the vehicle miles
traveled, stationary sources (such as industrial activities) and area
sources (such as construction and demolition, road dust and other
miscellaneous processes). Fugitive dust refers to particulate matter
not emitted from a duct, tailpipe or stack, which becomes airborne
due to the forces of wind, man’s activity, or both. Activities that
generate fugitive dust include vehicle travel over paved and unpaved
roads, brake wear, tire wear, soil cultivation, off-road vehicles, or
any vehicles operating on open fields or dirt roadways, wind erosion
of exposed surfaces, storage piles at construction sites, etc. PM-2.5
emissions in Alameda County are projected to remain steady over the
same period (California Air Resources Board, 2006), as the reduction
in emissions from on-road and off-road engines would be offset by
an increase in their activity and also an increase in industrial growth.
The standards for carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide,
and lead are being met in the Bay Area, and the latest pollutant trends
suggest that these standards will not be exceeded in the foreseeable
future (ABAG, 2001).
Sensitive Land Uses
Land uses such as schools, day care centers, hospitals, and
convalescent homes are considered to be relatively sensitive to poor
air quality because the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are
more susceptible to respiratory infections and other air-quality-
                                                                                                            12-3

Castro Valley General Plan
                           related health problems than the general public. Residential areas are
                           also considered sensitive to poor air quality because people are often
                           at home for extended periods. Recreational land uses are moderately
                           sensitive to air pollution, because vigorous exercise associated with
                           recreation places a high demand on the human respiratory system.
                           Some persons are more sensitive than others to air pollutants. The
                           reasons for heightened sensitivity may include health problems,
                           proximity to the emissions source, and duration of exposure to air
                           pollutants.
                           The California Air Resources Board recommends against locating
                           sensitive uses within 500 feet of a freeway. The basis for the
                           recommendations is a number of studies that identify an association
                           with respiratory symptoms, asthma exacerbations and decreases in
                           lung function in children. In traffic-related studies, the health risk
                           attributable to proximity was seen within 1000 feet and was strongest
                           within 300 feet. California freeway studies show about a 70 percent
                           drop in particulate pollution levels at 500 feet. (California Air
                           Resources Board, April 2005.)

12.2	 CLIMATE CHANGE
Global climate change (GCC) is currently one of the most important
and widely debated scientific, economic, and political issues in the
United States. GCC refers to a change in the average weather of the
earth that may be measured by wind patterns, storms, precipitation,
and temperature. The baseline by which these changes are measured
originates in historical records identifying temperature changes that
have occurred in the distant past, such as during previous ice ages.
The rate of temperature change has typically been incremental, with
warming and cooling occurring over the course of thousands of
years. In the past 10,000 years the earth has experienced incremental
warming as glaciers retreated across the globe. However, scientists
have observed an unprecedented increase in the rate of warming
over the past 150 years, roughly coinciding with the global industrial
revolution.
Although GCC is now widely accepted as a concept, the extent and
speed of change to be expected, and the exact contribution from
human sources, remains in debate. Nonetheless, the world’s leading
climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), have reached consensus that global climate change is very
likely caused by humans, and that hotter temperatures and rising
sea levels will continue for centuries no matter how much humans
control their future emissions. In particular, human influences have:
• 	 very likely contributed to sea level rise and increased storm
    surge during the latter half of the 20th century;
• 	 likely contributed to changes in wind patterns, affecting extra-
    tropical storm tracks and temperature patterns;
• 	 likely increased temperatures of extreme hot nights, cold nights
    and cold days;
• 	 more likely than not increased risk of heat waves, area affected
    by drought since the 1970s, and frequency of heavy precipita-
    tion events. (IPCC, November 2007)
According to the California Climate Action Team (CCAT),
accelerating GCC has the potential to cause a number of adverse
impacts in California, including but not limited to: a shrinking Sierra
snowpack that would threaten the state’s water supply; public health
threats caused by higher temperatures and more smog; damage to
agriculture and forests due to reduced water storage capacity, rising
temperatures, increasing salt water intrusion, flooding, and pest
                                                                                                            12-7

                           coastlines; increased wildfire risk; and increased electricity demand.
                           (CCAT, April 2006) These impacts have and will continue to have
                           considerable costs associated with them.
                           While all of these impacts may be felt to some extent in the Bay Area
                           generally and Castro Valley specifically, of particular concern are
                           high temperatures and the negative impacts on air quality, and water
                           quality and water supply issues. Recent studies indicate that hot days
                           correlate with poor air quality days, and air pollution is contributing
                           to more annual deaths and cases of respiratory illness and asthma
                           (Jacobson, 2008). In other areas of the Bay Area, sea level rise and the
                           resulting potential for intermittent flooding and gradual inundation is
                           a concern that must be addressed.
                           Greenhouse Gases
                           Gases that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere are called greenhouse
                           gases (GHGs). These gases play a critical role in determining the
                           Earth’s surface temperature. Part of the solar radiation that enters
                           Earth’s atmosphere from space is absorbed by the Earth’s surface.
                           The Earth reflects this radiation back toward space, but GHGs absorb
                           some of the radiation. As a result, radiation that otherwise would
                           have escaped back into space is retained, resulting in a warming of
                           the atmosphere. Without natural GHGs, the Earth’s surface would
                           be about 61°F cooler. (CCAT, April 2006) This phenomenon is
                           known as the greenhouse effect. However, many scientists believe
                           that emissions from human activities—such as electricity generation,
                           vehicle emissions, and even farming and forestry practices—have
                           elevated the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere beyond
                           naturally-occurring concentrations, contributing to the larger process
                           of global climate change. The six primary GHGs are:
                           •	   Carbon dioxide (CO2), emitted as a result of fossil fuel com-
                                bustion, with contributions from cement manufacture;
                           •	   Methane (CH4), produced through the anaerobic decomposition
                                of waste in landfills, animal digestion, decomposition of animal
                                wastes, production and distribution of natural gas and petro-
                                leum, coal production, and incomplete fossil fuel combustion;
                           •	   Nitrous oxide (N2O), typically generated as a result of soil
                                cultivation practices, particularly the use of commercial and
                                organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production,
                                and biomass burning;

•	   Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), primarily used as refrigerants;
•	   Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), originally introduced as alternatives
     to ozone depleting substances and typically emitted as by-prod-
     ucts of industrial and manufacturing processes; and
•	   Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), primarily used in electrical trans-
     mission and distribution systems.
Alameda County Climate Change Initiatives
In June 2006, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors established
the County Climate Change Leadership Strategy. The County,
along with 11 jurisdictions, committed to becoming members
of the global organization Local Governments for Sustainability
(ICLEI) and participating in the Alameda County Climate Protection
Project (ACCPP). In committing to the project, the participating
jurisdictions embarked on an ongoing, coordinated effort to reduce
the emissions that cause global warming, improve air quality, reduce
waste, cut energy use and save money. The Castro Valley community
participates in the project through Alameda County. The County aims
to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80 percent below
1990 levels by 2050.
To achieve these targets, the County prepared a Climate Action
Plan (CAP) to determine appropriate actions to reduce local GHG
emissions and facilitate monitoring and reporting. The CAP contains
plans for the County’s own government operations and for private
development in the unincorporated areas. In addition to developing
the CAP, the County has initiated several other activities to help
achieve its GHG emissions reduction goals. These include the
adoption of green building ordinances for County buildings and
certain private development projects; the Alameda County Green
Business Program; and increased use of alternative fuels for County
County Greenhouse Gas Inventory
One of the first steps to creating the Climate Action Plan was
to complete an emissions inventory. Table 12.2-1 shows the
unincorporated County’s total greenhouse gas emissions from the
major sectors for the year 2005. The residential population and
employees in the unincorporated portions of Alameda County are
emitting approximately 930,039 tonnes of CO2e emissions each
year. Burning fossil fuels in vehicles and for energy use in buildings
and facilities is a major contributor to the County’s greenhouse gas
                                                                                                           12-9

                                            emissions. Fuel consumption in the transportation sector is the single
                                            largest source of emissions, contributing almost 60 percent of total
                                            emissions. The estimated emissions from transportation include trips
                                            on local roads and locally-generated highway trips but omit “pass
                                            through” trips that originate or end in other counties. The residential
                                            and commercial/industrial sectors represent emissions that result from
                                            electricity and natural gas used in buildings and facilities. Emissions
                                            from waste landfill sites and the energy use associated with water
                                            consumption represent account for 6.6 percent of the total emissions.
                                            Castro Valley Emissions
                                            The Baseline Emissions Inventory for Unincorporated Alameda
                                            County for the year 2005 can be used to estimate the emissions
                                            from residents and employees (service population) in Castro Valley.
                                            Assuming that Castro Valley residents and employees use the same
                                            average amount of energy and generate the same average amount
                                            of waste as the other residents and employees in unincorporated
                                            Alameda County, in 2005, Castro Valley generated 356,465 tonnes of
                                            CO2e emissions per year. Due, however, to Castro Valley’s location
                                            within the regional transportation system, the planning area accounts
                                            for about 56 percent of the County’s vehicle mileage even though its
                                            share of the County’s service population is only 40 percent. Adjusting
                                            the average emissions from transportation to reflect Castro Valley’s
                                            larger share of mileage, increases the estimated emissions from the
                                            planning area to 446,656 tonnes per year. Table 12.2-2 summarizes
                                            the findings. To help achieve the County’s 15 percent reduction target,
                                            the greenhouse gas emissions from Castro Valley should be reduced
                                            to less than 379,658 tonnes per year by 2020.

Climate Change Adaptation and GHG Reductions
In addition to reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions and
potentially slowing the rate of climate change, Alameda County is
working to develop strategies to help communities adapt to the effects
of climate change. In areas of the County near the San Francisco
Bay, issues related to potential sea level rise will be evaluated and
addressed. The short-term focus for the Castro Valley planning area
and other areas of the County will be on integrating land use and
transportation, reducing water and energy consumption and reducing
waste generation.
Community Climate Action Plan
The County will implement the adopted CAP within Castro Valley.
The draft CAP identifies measures that the County could implement
throughout the unincorporated areas to try to reduce GHG emissions
by 15 percent by 2020. The draft CAP focuses the County’s efforts
into six action areas to reduce greenhouse gases: transportation,
land use, building energy, water, waste, and green infrastructure.
Within each action area there are strategies, measures and specific
implementation actions that will allow the County to measure
progress. Where appropriate, the quantified goals identified in the
CAP have been incorporated into the Castro Valley General Plan.
                                                                                                                     12-11

Castro Valley General Plan
                           General Plan Policies Addressing Climate Change
                           Many General Plan policies, particularly those related to land use,
                           circulation, public utilities, biological resources, and community
                           character and design, will help to reduce the total GHG emissions
                           and limit climate change impacts on the community. The General
                           Plan will also be updated to incorporate the strategies of the Alameda
                           County Community Climate Action Plan when it is adopted.
                           •	  Land Use and Development. The General Plan land use poli-
                               cies focus on infill residential development and commercial
                               renovation to accommodate anticipated growth, rather than
                               developing in new areas. The land use and development strate-
                               gies include: establishing an infill opportunity zone around the
                               Castro Valley BART station to facilitate higher levels of devel-
                               opment within easy access of regional public transit; 	
                               and supporting local and home-based businesses to reduce
                               commute traffic.
                           •	  Community Character and Design. Revitalizing the Central
                               Business District and other commercial areas is one of the
                               highest goals for the Castro Valley General Plan and the com-
                               munity. Improving the look and feel of the commercial areas
                               will support new commercial uses that will serve the local com-
                               munity and help to reduce the number and length of trips that
                               residents and local workers have to drive.
                           •	  Transportation. The transportation policies prioritize balancing
                               the needs of transit riders, pedestrians, and bicyclists with the
                               needs of drivers and create new opportunities for Castro Valley
                               residents to travel by alternative modes.  Since transportation
                               is the largest source of GHGs in Castro Valley, measures that
                               reduce dependence on traveling by private automobile have the
                               greatest potential to reduce total GHGs.  
                           •	  Biological Resources. Preserving and improving natural habitat
                               is a primary proposal in the General Plan. In addition, there are
                               policies that support expanding the urban forest and community
                               gardens. These initiatives are intended to improve air quality by
                               providing for carbon sequestration and support local food net-
                               works in order to limit the need to transport food products.
                           •	  Public Services and Utilities. This chapter contains strategies
                               that will help to reduce greenhouse gases – water conservation
                               and recycling measures, and solid waste reduction and recy-
                               cling. Shrinking water demand through conservation and recy-
                               cling will reduce the amount of GHG produced while transport-

Measure D Excerpts Pertaining to the
Castro Valley Canyonlands
Section 13. Castro Valley and Palomares Canyonlands
The Castro Valley and Palomares Canyonlands, for purposes of this ordinance, are an area demarcated on
February 1, 2000, by the eastern city limits of the City of Hayward, north to the Urban Area Boundary in
the Fairview Area Specific Plan of Sept. 4, 1997, to U.S. I-580, east to the eastern, northern, and western
boundaries of the Palomares Hills development (Assessor’s Designated Parcels 85-A-1645-7, 85A-1650-
1-1, 85A-1600-5, 85A-1600-4-4, 85A-1600-3, 85A-1600-2, 85A-1550-2-8, 85A-1600-6, 85A-100-5,
85A-100-4-2, 85-5100-5, 85-5100-4-2, 85A-1-18, 85A-1-7, 85A-1-8), to Crow Canyon Road, south to the
intersection of Coldwater Drive, to the eastern and northern boundaries of the Greenridge development and
the northwestern and western boundaries of the Briar Ridge development (Assessor’s Designated Parcels
85-1600-2-74, 85-1600-2-58, 85-1600-3-2, 85-1400-4-8, 85-1400-6, 85-1510-10-3), to Cull Canyon Road,
south to Heyer Avenue, to the boundaries of the Columbia development (Cull Canyon Regional Recreation
Area and Assessor’s Designated Parcel 85-1200-1-7), to the boundary of East Bay Municipal Utility District
watershed lands (Assessor’s Designated Parcels 84D-1400-2-28, 85-1000-2), to Redwood Road, to the
eastern boundaries of Anthony Chabot Regional Park and Redwood Regional Park, to the Alameda-Contra
Costa County line, east to the boundary of the East County Planning Area, south to the city limits of Dublin,
west to the boundary of the East County Planning Area, south to the city limits of Fremont, west to the city
limits of Union City, north to the city limits of Hayward; and an area commonly known as Chabot Terrace
(Assessor’s Designated Parcels 79-100-1, 79-100-2, 79-110-1, and 79-110-2) (See Map, Appendix 1). Listed
Assessor’s Designated Parcels are fully included in the demarcated area.
These Canyonlands are subject to the same restrictions with respect to minimum parcel size, amount and
nature of development, development envelopes, floor area ratios and maximum floor areas, and permissible
uses as are imposed in the Resource Management Description of Land Use Designations in the East County
Area Plan. In addition Policies 81A, 106A, 107A, 113A, 113B and 236, and the provisions governing
clustering in Program 36, of the East County Area Plan shall apply to the canyonlands. Policy 144 of that
Plan shall apply without regard to Urban Growth Boundaries.
Resource Management requires a minimum parcel size of 100 acres and a maximum building intensity for
non-residential uses of .01 FAR, but not less than 20,000 square feet. One single family home per parcel is
allowed provided that all other County standards are met for adequate road access, sewer and water facilities,
building envelope location, visual protection, and public services. Residential and residential accessory
                                                                                                           A-1

Castro Valley General Plan
buildings shall have a maximum floor space of 12,000 square feet. Apart from infrastructure under Policy
14A, all buildings shall be located on a contiguous development envelope not to exceed 2 acres, except they
may be located outside the envelope if necessary for security reasons or, if structures for agricultural use,
necessary for agricultural use. Subject to the provisions of the Initiative, this designation permits agricultural
uses, recreational uses, habitat protection, watershed management, public and quasi-public uses, areas
typically unsuitable for human occupation due to public health and safety hazards such as earthquake faults,
floodways, unstable soils, or areas containing wildlife habitat and other environmentally sensitive features,
secondary residential units, active sand and gravel and other quarries, reclaimed quarry lakes, and similar
and compatible uses. Sand and gravel quarries allow a range of uses including sand and gravel processing,
associated manufacturing and recycling uses requiring proximity to quarries, reclamation pits, and public use
areas. This designation is intended mainly for land designated for long-term preservation as open space but
may include low intensity agriculture, grazing, and very low density residential use.
Agricultural Support Services
Policy 81A: In areas designated Large Parcel Agriculture, the County shall permit agricultural processing
facilities (for example wineries, olive presses) and limited agricultural support service uses that primarily
support Alameda County agriculture, are not detrimental to existing or potential agricultural uses, demonstrate
an adequate and reliable water supply, and comply with the other policies and programs of the Initiative.
Ridgelines
Policy 106A: Structures may not be located on ridgelines or hilltops or where they will project above a
ridgeline or hilltop, as viewed from public roads, trails, parks and other public viewpoints, unless there is no
other site on the parcel for the structure or on a contiguous parcel in common ownership on or subsequent to
the date this ordinance becomes effective. New parcels may not be created that have no building site other
than a ridgeline or hilltop, or that would cause a structure to protrude above a ridgeline or hilltop, unless there
is no other possible configuration.
Visual Protection
Policy 107A: To the extent possible, including by clustering if necessary, structures shall be located on that
part of a parcel, or on contiguous parcels in common ownership on or subsequent to the date this ordinance
becomes effective, where the development is least visible to persons on public roads, trails, parks and other
public viewpoints. This policy does not apply to agricultural structures to the extent it is necessary for
agricultural purposes that they be located in more visible areas.
Policy 113A: In all cases appropriate building materials, landscaping and screening shall be required
to minimize the visual impact of development. Development shall blend with and be subordinate to the
environment and character of the area where located, so as to be as unobtrusive as possible and not detract
from the natural, open space or visual qualities of the area. To the maximum extent practicable, all exterior
lighting must be located, designed and shielded so as to confine direct rays to the parcel where the lighting
is located.

Alteration of Landforms
Policy 113B: To the maximum extent possible, development shall be located and designed to conform
with rather than change natural landforms. The alteration of natural topography, vegetation, and other
characteristics by grading, excavating, filling or other development activity shall be minimized. To the extent
feasible, access roads shall be consolidated and located where they are least visible from public viewpoints.
Policy 236: The County shall approve new development only upon verification that an adequate, long-term,
sustainable, clearly identified water supply will be provided to serve the development, including in times of
drought.
Clustering
Program 36: Notwithstanding any other provision of the Initiative, the County may permit residential and
other structures allowed on a parcel or adjoining parcels on land designated Large Scale Agriculture, Resource
Management or Water Management Lands on February 1, 2000, or by the Initiative, to be clustered on one
or more of the parcels on adjacent development parcels not to exceed 2 acres each. No additional residential
units may be built as a result of clustering, except a bonus of one residential unit for each 5 residential units
clustered may be permitted.
For each residential unit clustered, an area equal to the minimum parcel size otherwise applicable to the
parcel from which the unit was derived minus the area of the clustered parcel shall be protected permanently
from further development, except for agricultural structures necessary for agricultural use, by dedication of
a conservation easement on a single, continuous area to Alameda County or by other comparably effective
means.
Except as provided in this program, all clustering shall comply with the provisions of the Initiative. Care
shall be taken in permitting clustering not to impair existing or potential agricultural uses, water quality,
or environmental or visual values. Consistent with those requirements, clustering shall be configured to
maximize the amount of contiguous agricultural acreage.
Quarries and Regionally Significant Aggregate Resource Areas
Policy 144: Except to the extent required by State law, no new quarry or other open-pit mine may be approved
by the County outside the Urban Growth Boundary, unless approved by the voters of Alameda County.
Excavation not adjacent to an existing quarry site and on the same or an adjoining parcel shall be regarded
as a new quarry.
