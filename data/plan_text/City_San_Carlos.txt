San Carlos General Plan Vision Statement
 In 2030 San Carlos is a safe, beautiful, vibrant and livable community with tree-lined streets, open space, public art, high-quality architecture
 and state-of-the-art infrastructure. We enjoy a balance of residential, schools, retail, commercial and industrial uses and services that enhance
 our quality of life, support the fiscal health of the City and sustain a robust local economy. Downtown San Carlos is the heart of the commu-
 nity – a place to experience and savor the joys of daily life while enjoying a mix of stores and services.
 Housing in San Carlos meets the needs of a diverse community. People who work in San Carlos can afford to live here. San Carlans are also
 able to work for employers located within the community. The City pursues creative solutions to economic development objectives and encour-
 ages innovative environmentally sustainable industries and businesses to locate and remain in San Carlos.
 San Carlos is committed to sustainability. Sustainability promotes the use of resources in the present in a manner that does not compromise
 the choices and quality of life of future generations.
 Mobility is part of the San Carlos way of life. It is precious to us, and we value our collective ability to freely and efficiently move about the
 city and region. The airport remains a unique part of our transportation system. Sidewalks, paths and bikeways connect residential neighbor-
 hoods to all commercial areas, schools, parks and open space. Destinations and places in San Carlos are accessible using all forms of transporta-
 tion.
 Quality educational opportunities, at all levels, are available to the entire community. Our outstanding educational system, providing both
 formal and informal learning opportunities, enhances our quality of life.
 Public service, charitable giving, volunteerism and citizen participation are integrated into public, non-profit and educational services offered.
 Community care services are inclusive for seniors and citizens with mental and physical disabilities.
 San Carlans enjoy a wide variety of private and public community venues, including parks, trails, community centers, arts, museums, cul-
 tural centers and clubs, faith-based places of worship and congregation, recreational facilities, sports and other civic and cultural events. We
 enjoy access to affordable and high-quality health services. The City’s government contributes to our distinctive community identity and sense
 of civic pride.

Land Us

     The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the potential physical development of the City
     and to preserve, protect and enhance the community’s current quality of life consistent with the
     City’s Vision. The Land Use Element is not designed to discourage or promote development as
     allowed in this General Plan, but rather describes the manner in which development should be
     managed in the event that it does occur. The Land Use Element is the central chapter of the
     General Plan.

             What Does Density Look Like?
             One of the functions of the land use designations is
             to establish maximum densities for residential and
             mixed-use development. Residential densities are
             typically described as the maximum number of
             dwelling units per acre. The land use designations in
             this General Plan allow for residential densities rang-
             ing from three dwelling units per acre to 59 dwelling
             units per acre. To illustrate what development at
             these densities looks like, photographs of residential
             and mixed-use buildings at varying densities are
             provided on this page to the left. It should be noted,
             however, that building size and shape is constrained
             by height limits, setbacks, and open space require-
             ments, not density. The same size building might
             have a range of density depending on the number of
             studios versus 3- to 4-bedroom units, for example.

  East and West Side Specific Plans
  Cities and counties in California often prepare "specific plans" to
  establish detailed policies and standards for a particular geographic
  area. Prior to the adoption of this General Plan, San Carlos had
  two specific plans: the West Side Specific Plan and the 1991 East
  Side Specific Plan. During the General Plan Update process, the
  contents of these specific plans were reviewed and incorporated
  into the General Plan as appropriate. This General Plan also in-
  cludes new policies for these areas. The West Side Specific Plan
  (which addressed current Planning Areas 1-3) and the East Side
  Specific Plan (which addressed current portions of Planning Areas
  2-3 and all of Areas 4-9) have been officially "retired" from use as
  City policy documents. This General Plan replaces these specific
  plans as the policy document to guide growth, conservation and
  enhancement in these two important areas of San Carlos.

  Form-Based Codes and the Urban to Rural Transect
  Action 8.1 calls for San Carlos to prepare a form-based code as a tool to implement urban design-related policies in this General Plan. Form-
  based codes are different from conventional zoning ordinances in that they focus primarily on the physical form and character of development
  and de-emphasize use regulations. Form-based codes also include development standards that graphically illustrate required massing and place-
  ment of buildings. Form-based codes are an effective tool to create mixed-use, walkable and compact development that is sensitive to existing
  development and supports a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented community.
  Form-based codes are typically based upon an urban planning concept known as the rural-to-urban transect (“transect”). At its essence, the
  transect concept features a series of zones transitioning from natural open space to a dense urban core. The transect concept maintains that
  only certain types of streets, building types, building forms and civic spaces are appropriate in each zone. In San Carlos, distinct transect zones
  might range from a Downtown zone (most dense) to low density single-family and open space zones (least dense). The diagram below illus-
  trates the concept of the transect.

Environmental Management Elemen
6 E NVIRONMENTAL M ANAGEMENT E LEMENT
        The Environmental Management Element aims to protect, preserve and enhance natural re-
        sources in San Carlos. The Element identifies San Carlos’ important open space lands and en-
        sures that future development will respect the natural and scenic qualities of those places, help-
        ing to shape the desired physical form of the community by safeguarding open space for future
        generations. The Environmental Management Element also provides direction on the conserva-
        tion of biological resources in and near San Carlos, including plants and wildlife, as well as water
        and air quality. Additionally, the Element identifies ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
        and solid waste and suggests strategies for adaptation to climate change.

                                                 The park is utilized by shoppers as a resting spot before further shopping and by customers of adjacent
Laurel Street Park                    0.3        restaurants. The park is used annually for a portion of the Chamber of Commerce Art and Wine Festival,
                                                 the Sister City Committee’s “Taste of Italy,” concerts in the park and the Kiwanis Club’s annual toy drive.
                                                 This neighborhood park gets a variety of uses throughout the year. Little League baseball uses the field area
                                                 in the spring and the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) makes use of the entire turf area in the
Laureola Park                         2.6        fall. In addition, residents utilize the turf, basketball court and the children's play area regularly. The Special
                                                 Needs Program is the main tenant of the recreation building year-round, but the building is also used for
                                                 other special interest classes and community groups.
                                                 This is currently an undeveloped park site, located across the street from Vista Park. It was originally
                                                 acquired by the City for development of a vehicular connection between Highway 280 and Crestview Drive,
                                                 which was never constructed. The site is steeply sloping up from the street, thus making access difficult.

Noise Elemen
9 N OISE E LEMENT
         The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify sources of noise in San Carlos and to define
         strategies for reducing the negative impact of noise to the community. Noise is an environ-
         mental pollutant that can threaten the quality of life and human health by causing annoyance
         or disrupting sleep and everyday activities. With the presence of significant noise sources in San
         Carlos, including Highway 101, El Camino Real, the Caltrain corridor and the San Carlos Airport,
         reducing the negative impact of unwanted and excessive noise is an important aspect of main-
         taining the city’s high quality of life and community character.

          Notes:
          1. The Residential standards apply to all residentially zoned properties.
          2. Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5 dBA for tonal noises characterized by a whine, screech, or hum, noises consisting pri-
              marily of speech or music, or recurring impulsive noises.
          3. In situations where the existing noise level exceeds the noise levels indicated in the above table, any new noise source must include mitigation that
              reduces the noise level of the noise source to the existing level.
          4. The exterior noise standards are measured at any point on the receiving property where there is, or could be in the future, frequent human use and
              quiet would be beneficial.
          5. These standards do not apply to temporary sources such as construction activities.

Currently, California is considering construction of a
high-speed train system that would link the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area and Los Angeles. The plan would be
for high-speed trains to operate through San Carlos on
or near the existing Caltrain right-of-way. Numerous
at-grade crossings along the Caltrain corridor would
need to be eliminated in order to facilitate the high-
speed trains, which would reduce noise from the
sounding of railroad train horns. The high-speed
