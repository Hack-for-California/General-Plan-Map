4.3.2. Park Planning and User Needs
Many of the issues presented in the 1988
General Plan relate to the formula driven
standards set by the National Recreation &
Parks Association (NRPA). Since that time,
the NRPA has taken a more deferential
approach to community judgment with

prescribed minimums by park type were not
feasible. The NRPA’s approach is need
based. It recognizes that each community

Locust Avenue. The park features
equestrian facilities, including an arena, with
bleachers, a water trough, night lighting and
parking for horse trailers.
Citizens of Moreno Valley consider
expansion of the trail network a high priority.
The Citizen’s Advisory Committee on
Recreational Trails, together with the
community of equestrians, has worked
extensively on the development of a trail
system. It is their desire to link all areas of
the City together with a multi-use trail
system and to enhance the City’s
equestrian      park     by    promoting    the
development of an equestrian community
around the park. There is also a desire for
a trail that crosses State Route 60.
The City should continue to develop trails,
but funding is an issue. General fund
dollars are not available to construct new
trails. Efforts should be made to obtain
private funds and grants. It has become
common for cities with equestrian
communities to require development in
certain zones to provide access to existing
trails and to construct new trails.
Multiuse trails should be designed with
considerations for safety, accessibility,
proper design and construction, signage
and relative location.        The City’s trail
network should also connect to the county
and state regional trail systems.

                       to the motorist, passenger, or pedestrian is excellent.
            B          Stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream begins to be
                       noticeable. Freedom to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected, but there is a
                       slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from LOS A.
                       The level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less than at LOS A,
                       because the presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual

                       individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions with others in the
                       traffic stream. The selection of speed is affected by the presence of others, and
                       maneuvering within the traffic stream requires substantial vigilance on the part of
                       the user. The general level of comfort and convenience declines noticeably at this

As State Route 60 traverses east through
Moreno Valley, it passes through the
Badlands area. Characterized by steep and
eroded hillsides, the Badlands form the
eastern boundary of the study area and
provide a sweeping range of hills that act as
a visual backdrop to the valley.
Expanses of open land are found throughout
the eastern portion of the study area. These
tracts of land allow for uninterrupted scenic
vistas from State Route 60, Gilman Springs

of the San Jacinto Valley and the ephemeral

Views of the San Bernardino and San

when      the City’s Housing Element was
submitted, the anticipation was that the
city’s growth would outpace even the high-
end projections (Table 8-2). However,
due to the effects of the economic
recession of the 1990s, actual population
growth was between the low-end
projection and the midrange projection.
In May of 1999, SCAG presented a
Preliminary Draft Growth Forecast for
population consisting of two sets of
population numbers (Table 8-3).      The
SCAG population numbers are based on
1994 population counts adjusted for 1997
as well as 1980 and 1990 census trends.

State Law (California Government Code                Tables 8-20, 8-21, 8-22 and 8-23 reflects
Section 65583) requires cities and counties          the density and number of vacant acres in
to provide “adequate” sites with appropriate         each zoning designation and the potential
zoning      and   development      standards,        development yield. Based on Table 8-19 it
infrastructure and public services to                was       determined    that    sites    with
facilitate and encourage the development of          redevelopment potential are not required to
a variety of housing types for a range of            accommodate the balance of the City’s

8.4.3       Vacant      Land       Inventory         identified in the inventory will meet the
Methodology                                          RHNA needs for very low-income and low-
                                                     income households.
In order to address the requirement to
accommodate the housing needs of various             8.4.4 Very Low-Income Housing Potential
income groups, the City inventoried all
vacant land with residential zoning                  Vacant parcels in the Office, Office
designations, as well as non-residential             Commercial       and   those    within    the

the existing General Plan. The city                  296 vacant acres zoned for multi-family
completed a parcel-by-parcel inventory of all        uses that could potentially result in a total
vacant appropriately zoned land as well as           331 very-low income multi-family housing
an inventory of all specific plans. The              units.29 In addition, it is anticipated that

The land inventory will assist the City in           income households, for a total of 305 vacant
making a determination of the number of              acres and 365 possible very-low income
residential units that could potentially be          units. See Attachment 1 for a graphic

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                                      MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN

  Units are calculated at 80% of the total density capacity and reflect historical development patterns in the city.
2
  Office (O) and Office Commercial (OC) allow the development of senior housing at 15 units per acre. However, a
senior development affordable to very low-income households can receive a 100% density bonus to 30 units per
acre. The above unit number assumes that 1% of the land in the city zoned O and OC has the potential to be
developed as housing for very low-income seniors.
3
  Village Office Residential (VOR) allows multi-family residential and office in the Sunnymead Village Plan. Based on
General Plan traffic study assumptions, there is potential for the development of housing units at 50% of the density
allowed in this zone.
4
  Village Commercial Residential (VCR) allows multi-family residential and commercial in the Sunnymead Village
Plan. Based on General Plan traffic study assumptions, there is potential for the development of housing units at
50% of the density allowed in this zone.
5
  Village Residential (VR) allows multi-family units in the Sunnymead Village Plan. It is anticipated that units in the
Village at Sunnymead will be built to the typical historical development pattern within the City.

 Policy
             Program
 1.1         The City will utilize its authority, resources and influence to promote the creation
             and preservation of a variety of housing types, sizes and prices to meet the
             various needs of a wide spectrum of current and future residents.
                                                  Update
 The City continues to use its authority, influence and most importantly its financial resources
 to develop and preserve affordable housing. Having begun in 1990 without a single housing
 program, the City of Moreno Valley boasts an array of effective affordable housing programs
 that meet the needs of a varied community. Under the Rental Rehabilitation Program, the
 City assisted in the rehabilitation of a total of 291 units, in seven projects. HOME and Set-
 aside funds have been used to provide assistance in the development of 104 affordable
 housing units. The City’s Home Improvement Loan Program (HILP) has provided assistance
 to very low-income owner/occupants and the Mobile Home Grant Program has provided
 assistance to very low-income households, the majority of whom are seniors. (See Table 1)

 Policy      Program
 1.1.01      The Moreno Valley Civic Activities Assistance Corporation (MVCAAC) will serve
             under contract to the RDA to develop a comprehensive housing assistance
             program and recommend a policy for use of the Low-income Housing Setaside
             Funds. The MVCAAC is chartered to provide financial and other assistance to the
             City.
             Target Dates:
             Jan., 1991 – incorporation
             Oct., 1991 – operational and financial plan
             Jan., 1992 – implementation.
                                                  Update
 MVCAAC did not at any time enter into a contract with the RDA to develop a housing
 assistance program or recommend policies for use of the low-income housing setaside funds.
 MVCAACC is no longer an active organization. The Redevelopment Agency developed and
 adopted a Comprehensive Affordable Housing Strategy to identify additional resources and
 programs to meet the City’s affordable housing needs and responsibilities. The Strategy is
 consistent with and further implements the City’s adopted Housing Element.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                         MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy      Program
 1.1.02      The RDA Low Income Housing Setaside Fund will be used in a timely manner to
             finance programs that will maximize the creation, retention and long-term
             availability of affordable lower-income housing. The Economic Development
             Department/ Redevelopment Agency (EDD/RDA) shall annually specify the
             program uses to which Housing Fund receipts will be dedicated in combination
             with funds that may be available from other sources.
 The City Comprehensive Affordable Housing Strategy is an extensive analysis of the City of
 Moreno Valley’s affordable housing and a plan for use of the setaside. The Strategy also
 identifies additional resources and programs to meet the Moreno Valley’s affordable housing
 needs and responsibilities. On an annual basis, the RDA develops a budget for use of the
 setaside funds, in compliance with state spend down requirements.
 Policy      Program
 1.1.03      By March 1, 1992, the Economic Development Department (EDD), in cooperation
             with the Planning Department, will recommend an Inclusionary Housing
             Ordinance to be adopted by the City, that will mandate that all developments
             which include more than a specified number (to be established) of residential units
             contribute to the City’s balance of affordable housing at all income levels, with the
             goal that a minimum percentage of all new housing within the City will be
             affordable to low and very-low-income households. Developers contributions may
             be in the form of actual construction of affordable units with the project itself,
             construction of affordable units at another appropriate location or contribution of
             appropriate in-lieu fees to the low-Income Housing Fund.
                                                Update
 The Redevelopment Agency’s Comprehensive Affordable Housing Strategy provides an
 extensive analysis of the extent to which housing is affordable and what programs would be
 most appropriate for the City. The City recognizes the importance of providing housing for all
 income levels as well as the need to avoid placing onerous requirements that would
 discourage or impair the private sector from providing affordable housing. Instead of
 establishing an Inclusionary Program, the City has developed a package of incentives to
 offset or minimize the cost of providing affordable housing. The incentives, include low
 interest loans for development of new affordable housing, rehabilitation, acquisition, as well
 as rent subsidies.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                          MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy      Program
 1.1.04      The EDD/RDA in cooperation with the Planning Department will develop criteria
             and control mechanisms that ensure that all housing that is directly subsidized by,
             or receives substantial economic assistance from the City (including Density
             Bonuses) in order to achieve affordability goals will remain affordable for the
             maximum feasible time (If not permanently). Such mechanisms shall be
             established and agreed upon before direct economic subsidies are granted to any
             specific project.
                                                Update
 The City of Moreno Valley utilizes affordability requirements and other control mechanisms to
 insure that units created for lower-income households are maintained affordable for the
 longest feasible period. Also, in programs where the City provides direct assistance to
 property owners, the regulatory agreement has repayment requirements that insure setaside
 funds are repaid for use again in other affordable housing programs. It is important to note
 that the City provides loans at very low interest and does not increase the housing costs of a
 lower-income household.
 Policy      Program
 1.1.05      By July of 1992, the city will have adopted an ordinance or amendment to the
             Development Code which grants a density bonus of at least 25 percent, and an
             additional incentive, or financially equivalent incentives, to housing development
             which include at least 20% of the units for lower-income households; or 10% of
             the units for very low-income households, or 50% of the units for senior citizens,
             under Government Code Section 65915.
                                                Update
 In January of 1999, the City Council adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance pursuant to
 Government Code Section 65915. No applications for use of a density bonus for affordable
 housing have been received before or since the adoption of the ordinance.
                                              Page 8-87                                July 11, 2006

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                         MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy      Program
 1.1.06      As an additional incentive to developers who construct the State mandated ratio of
             multi-family lower-income, very-low-income or senior housing units under
             Government Code 65915 and to help make apartments economically competitive
             in the construction financing market, the City will offer, when required, additional
             incentives of appropriate economic value to the construction of target affordable
             housing units. These may be in the form of regulatory incentives or concessions
             or additional density bonuses that result in identifiable cost reductions that are
             equivalent to an added 25% density bonus.
                                               Update
 In January of 1999, the Density Bonus Ordinance was adopted as an amendment to the
 Municipal Code. Additional incentives include: 50% reduction of the Development Impact
 Fee and Park Land Impact Mitigation Fee for units affordable to very low income households;
 25% reduction for units affordable to lower income households; 75% density bonus for senior
 citizen housing developments, resulting in a cumulative density bonus of 100%. In
 accordance with Government Code 65915(e), the following development standards may be
 modified: parking requirements may be reduced by one-half of a space and size or interiors
 amenities of the density bonus units may be reduced.
 Policy      Program
 1.1.07      In order to develop, coordinate and monitor the comprehensive housing programs
             set forth in this element and to ensure timely and effective execution of these
             programs, the City will provide necessary housing staff. After review of the annual
             Housing Progress Report (program 2.1.09), the City Manager may modify
             program responsibilities in order to effect the most efficient achievement of
             housing goals.
                                               Update
 Since adoption of the housing element and implementation of various housing programs,
 additional housing staff has been added. At this time there is sufficient housing staff to
 administer the existing programs.
                                              Page 8-88                                 July 11, 2006

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                            MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy       Program
 1.1.08       Through economic or non-economic incentives the City of Moreno Valley will
              stimulate the creation of 350 new mobile home spaces that are affordable to
              households of low and moderate income by 1995, with the potential for an
              additional 500 spaces by the year 2000.
              The City will encourage the development of additional mobile home and
              manufactured housing projects through the zoning ordinance and zoning
              concessions, and/or direct assistance to private or public corporations (whether
              non-profit or for profit), in the form of land cost write downs, infrastructure
              assistance, site identification and procurement, permit processing priority, or other
              methods which may be appropriate and feasible.
                                                   Update
 The RDA Affordable Housing Strategy, completed in 1993, indicates that new market rate
 ownership housing in the city is affordable to households at, or above the County median and
 that existing rental housing is affordable to households, at or above, 80% of median. Rents
 on multi-family units and even single family homes have been very low, making it infeasible to
 develop mobile home spaces without large subsidies. A more pragmatic and cost-effective
 way of providing housing affordability has been to assist in the renovation of existing rental
 units. Additionally, the city assists in the renovation of existing mobile homes by providing
 rehabilitation grants of up to $7,500.
 Policy       Program
 2.1          The City will strive to ensure that its housing programs are in accordance with
              area and regional housing needs and that new development includes housing that
              is appropriate and affordable to all segments of the population including those with
              special housing needs.
                                                   Update
 Housing programs are developed based on the needs of the city and its residents and for the
 most part needs reflect those of the larger metropolitan area. Families at 80% of median
 income can afford a home in the city without subsidy. New housing developments include an
 array of housing prices and types to address the needs of various segments of the
 population. Households with special housing needs: the elderly; handicapped and very low
 income; and large families have housing options available. These options include: a 202
 senior development; a 25 unit handicapped development; 108 units of three and four
 bedroom units affordable to households at 60% of median and below and a first time
 homebuyer program.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                          MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy        Program
 2.1.01        The EDD/RDA will work with County, State and Federal Agencies and staff to
               ensure that Moreno Valley’s housing programs benefit from any available
               assistance and that they are an integrated part of meeting regional housing
               needs.
                                                 Update
 The City of Moreno Valley has been very diligent and successful in obtaining funds to
 leverage its Low-income Housing Setaside. During the reporting period the City and the
 City’s significant financial participation in projects succeeded in leveraging set aside funds
 with California Housing Rehabilitation Program for Owners (CHRP-O) funds, HOME funds,
 Federal 202 funds, Federal Tax Credits, Federal Reserve Affordable Housing Program (AHP)
 and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds.
 Policy       Program
 2.1.02       The EDD/RDA, will work to directly subsidize the construction of at least 750 new
              housing units of various types and sizes that are affordable to very low and low-
              income households by 1995. This corresponds to 10.2% of the City’s identified
              fair share of regional housing needs of 3,375 very low and 4,023 low-income
              affordable housing units.
                                                 Update
 The RDA has subsidized the construction of new housing units. The RDA focus has been on
 providing long-term affordable housing to special needs groups and very low-income families.
 In total 104 new housing units have been constructed between 1992 and December of 1997.
 The 104 units comprise 7% of all the units constructed in the city between 1992 and 1997
 and 1% of the City’s identified fair share of regional housing needs.
 Project                                                                             Units
 TELACU – 25105 Fir Street -senior housing                                             75

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                          MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy       Program
 2.1.03       In order to meet the 1994 SCAG/RHNA figures of unmet needs (3,375 units of
              very low income housing, 4,023 units of low income housing and 3,287 units of
              moderate income housing, totaling 10,685 units) the City and RDA shall work to
              facilitate the construction of 2,137 affordable units per year between 1990 and
              1995. As a minimum objective, the City and RDA shall work to construct,
              subsidize or facilitate the construction of one-third of this annual goal, an objective
              of 712 new affordable units per year. As a maximum goal, the City shall use
              2,137 units per year, the annual unmet need figure for low-moderate income
              housing, plus an additional 1,412 units per year at upper-income, or market-rate
              prices.
              The EDD/RDA will work with private developers and non-profit organizations to
              encourage the construction, rehabilitation and/or continued maintenance of
              affordable housing units that are appropriate to the needs of seniors, handicapped
              persons, single parent and female-headed households, and large families, groups
              that are identified as being a significant numerical component of the Moreno
              Valley population with special housing needs.
                                                 Update
 As the housing element was completed, the Southern California real estate market, and in
 particular Moreno Valley suffered a significant decline. Real estate values and effective rents
 declined as much as 20% and vacancy rates, in some projects, were as high as 50%.
 Foreclosures of both single and multi-family units increased. Growth in the Riverside-San
 Bernardino Statistical Area slowed significantly and the RHNA figures of unmet need seemed
 out of proportion in a rapidly declining economy.
 The decline in the market was dramatically reflected in the city’s construction permit activity.
 In the six years between 1986 and 1991, a total of 15,756 single and multi-family permits
 were issued. In the six years between 1992 and 1997, a total of 1,562 single and multi-family
 permits were issued, a 90% decrease in permit activity. The positive result of such a
 devastating decrease in construction activity was that new units being constructed were
 affordable to households with moderate incomes and existing resale units also became
 affordable to households at between 80% and 100% of median income.
 New construction was not economically feasible without large public subsidy. The City
 continued to work with non-profit organizations, such as the Crippled Children’s Society,
 TELACU and Habitat for Humanity to develop housing for very low income and special needs
 households. Additionally, the City continued to provide rehabilitation funds to assist in the
 rehabilitation of existing and foreclosed units, both multi-family and single family, which
 provided affordable housing to low and very low income households. It is imperative to note
 that the annual goal of 2,137 units established to meet the SCAG/RHNA figures, exceeded all
 new construction during the six years of the housing element reporting time frame.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                           MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy       Program
 2.1.04       The City EDD/RDA will coordinate with the Housing Authority of Riverside County
              and will support the Authority in its application for Section 8 certificates and
              vouchers, with the goal of 400 Section 8 contracts in 1990 and such increases as
              may be available from HUD.
                                                 Update
 The City continues to be supportive of the Housing Authorities assisted housing programs.
 The Housing Authority prepares and submits its own applications for Section 8. In the early
 1990’s the number of certificates and vouchers in the city was in the range of 300, currently
 there are in excess of 1,000 vouchers and certificates in use throughout Moreno Valley.
 Policy       Program
 2.1.05       The EDD/RDA will provide City support and endorsement for nonprofit
              organizations seeking Federal or State grants to assist 200 low-income senior or
              Special needs households, annually.
                                                 Update
 Annually, the City provides an opportunity for nonprofit organizations to apply for Federal
 funds through the City of Moreno Valley Community Development Block Grant Program
 (CDBG), and the HOME program. Organizations seeking to provide social services or
 affordable housing are encouraged to apply. The City provides nonprofits with information
 regarding the requirements for applying for Federal funding. The City has also augmented
 efforts for other federal funding for project like TELACU, senior housing, Crippled Children’s
 Society and Community Housing.
 Policy       Programs
 2.1.06       The EDD will work with the department of Planning to develop a public information
              and education program to begin January of 1992, aimed at increasing public
              awareness of the need for affordable and special needs housing, what constitutes
              this type of housing, and appropriate ways of satisfying these housing needs. The
              program will seek to reduce public misunderstanding and opposition to affordable
              and special needs housing. A component of the program will also be aimed at
              increasing knowledge and awareness of affordable housing among City staff.
                                                 Update
 This program was not established due to budget constraints that resulted in staff furloughs
 and layoffs. However, through Moreno Valley’s fair housing program, its affiliation with
 Habitat for Humanity Jimmy Carter Work Project, press releases and newspaper articles in
 the local press, the City has been able to increase public awareness of the need for
 affordable housing.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                           MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy       Program
 2.1.07       The EDD will evaluate and make recommendations regarding requiring that a
              portion of the City’s General Tax revenue generated from new businesses or
              industries hiring significant numbers lower-wage workers be dedicated to the
              creation of lower-income housing that will serve the needs of these employers and
              employees.
                                                Update
 The City of Moreno Valley has the lowest per capita general fund expenditures in the Inland
 Empire for cities over 100,000. It has not been feasible to utilize a portion of the revenue for
 the creation of lower-income housing, as these funds are used to provide necessary services
 to residents. Instead, the City has worked diligently and successfully, to leverage its housing
 funds to create affordable housing opportunities for lower income households.
 Policy       Program
 2.1.09       The EDD/RDA, in conjunction with the Planning Department, shall prepare an
              Annual Housing Progress Report to be submitted to the City Council, relating to
              progress in meeting affordable housing goals and the ratio of affordability of
              residential construction permits and new housing construction during the previous
              year.
                                                Update
 Since the City Council is also the Board of Directors of the Redevelopment Agency, they are
 kept apprised of the progress the City is making in meeting its affordable housing goals.
 Consequently, an Annual Housing Progress Report has not been necessary.
 Policy      Program
 3.1         The City will seek to insure that its policies and actions do not create undue
             governmental constraint on the availability and affordability of housing in Moreno
             Valley and will seek to mitigate or remove, where possible, such governmental, as
             well as non-governmental, constraints.
                                                Update
 The City has been conscientious not to place undue governmental constraint on the
 availability of affordable housing in Moreno Valley.

 Policy      Program
 3.1.01      By July of 1992, the City Planning Department and RDA will complete a review of
             vacant, developable land and areas with redevelopment potential to determine if
             sufficient area of appropriate density districts (R-10 thru R-20) is in place to meet
             the affordable housing needs of the City (as identified in the SCAG RHNA). If
             insufficient appropriately zoned area is determined, recommendations will be
             made to increase the supply of appropriately zoned land available to meet
             identified RHNA needs.
                                                Update
 The City is currently revising its General Plan. As part of the revision, a review of the
 appropriateness of various density districts has been undertaken. By means of the revision,
 vacant, developable parcels and areas with redevelopment potential may be rezoned to multi-
 family residential (R-10 through R-20). Based on anticipated changes to the General Plan,
 zoning will allow for a total of 58,824 single family units and a total of 16,617 multi-family
 units. The build-out ratio of multi-family units would be significantly higher that that existing in
 the current housing stock.
 Policy      Program
 3.1.02      The City/RDA in an effort to reduce the impact of escalating land costs will seek to
             purchase land to be retained for future affordable housing projects that reserve up
             to 49% of their units for lower-income households. Funds from RDA, CDBG,
             Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu fees, or other sources may be utilized.
                                                Update
 The Redevelopment Agency has acquired a number of developable parcels for future
 affordable housing developments.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                            MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy      Program
 3.1.03      The City Planning Department, in cooperation with EDD/RDA will reduce the
             impact of construction costs and Development Code requirements on lower-
             income-affordable housing by developing compensatory economic incentives (and
             criteria guidelines for project affordability) that will assist in reducing the overall
             costs of low-income housing by January of 1992.
                                                Update
 The Redevelopment Agency has provided financial assistance for the construction of lower
 income, affordable housing. Under the Density Bonus Ordinance, the City will provide an
 increase of 25% above the otherwise allowable residential density. The City can also provide
 a reduction in the Development Impact Fee and Park Land Impact Fee for units built under
 the Density Bonus Ordinance and/or reduce parking requirements. All of these
 compensatory incentives will assist in reducing the cost of developing affordable housing.
 Policy      Program
 3.1.04      The City will continue to subsidize new low-income rental housing development by
             maintaining Development Impact Fees for lower-income multi-family rental units at
             levels that are less than 33% of actual economic impact per unit. Development
             Impact Fees on single and multi-family units selling or renting at levels above the
             affordability standards for median income households will gradually be increased
             until the fees on these higher prices units cover 100% of the actual economic
             impact to the City by 1995.
                                                Update
 Legally, the City cannot shift impact fees to other development in excess of that
 development’s impact. RDA has paid fees for affordable units to address impacts.

 Policy      Program
 3.1.05      The City Manager shall be given the authority to waive all or a portion of
             Development Impact Fees. If there is determined to be an exceptionally strong
             benefit in housing accessibility for lower-income and special needs groups.
                                               Update
 In the past, the Agency has paid for the development impact fees, design enhancements,
 public improvements and land acquisition for projects deemed as having a strong benefit for
 lower-income households and special needs groups. The City Manager does not have
 authority to waive Development Impact Fees for any purpose.

             condition and value of vacant land currently zoned to allow the creation of new
             mobile home park spaces in Moreno Valley by December of 1991. If sufficient
             appropriate locations are not available for the creation of 800 new mobile home
             space by 1995, the Planning Department will develop a program to increase the
             appropriately zoned area, or to otherwise provide sufficient area for the potential
             development of at least 1600 additional mobile home spaces (conditional us
             agreement, etc) within the City’s housing mix.
                                               Update
 The City is currently revising its General Plan. Although, some areas will be rezoned to allow
 for future development of multi-family housing, rezoning to increase the number of locations
 available for the creation of new mobile home spaces is not contemplated. However, mobile
 homes are allowed in any residential zone, with a conditional use permit.

 Policy      Program
 3.1.07      The City Planning Department will recommend changes to the City Development
             Code that will specifically include emergency and transitional homeless shelters in
             the uses permitted under Section 9.02.020 of the Development Code by July of
             1991.
                                               Update
 The changes to the Development Code allow emergency homeless shelters with a
 conditional use permit in the following areas: commercial districts, industrial districts, and
 business park mixed use districts. Homeless shelters are permitted in a public district,
 subject to district requirements.
             Program
 Policy
 3.1.08      The EDD/RDA and Planning Departments will endeavor to spread the cost of
             required new infrastructure over the widest possible geographic area and time
             frame through the use of Mello-Roos districts, assessment districts, phased
             development plans, or other appropriate cost sharing methods.
                                               Update
 There is a citywide fee structure for all new developments to pay for infrastructure.

 Policy      Programs
 3.1.10      In order to maintain the beneficial usage of older housing for the maximum
             economically feasible time, the Planning and Economic Development
             Departments/RDA, shall develop a Zoning Transition Management Policy (ZTMP)
             and programs which will ensure that older affordable housing in areas where the
             current zoning designation is expected to result in an ultimate change of usage
             remains safe, sanitary, habitable and available for occupation until such time as
             appropriate replacement units are available and it is necessary to remove the
             existing housing to make way for other conforming uses. This Policy and the
             programs to implement it shall be designed and adopted by October of 1991, and
             may include such elements as maintenance and repair subsidies, use of
             amendment AB1448 of the California Health and Safety Code to enforce
             maintenance by landlords, temporary management of units, or other programs
             that may be appropriate.
                                               Update
 The City has not developed a Zoning Transition Management Policy. The City will address
 the issue of maintaining the beneficial usage of older housing via revisions to the General
 Plan, the city’s enhanced code enforcement program, and housing rehabilitation programs. In
 areas of the city where housing is currently zoned for other uses, the zoning may be changed
 to a housing designation to encourage upgrading.
 Policy      Programs
 3.1.11      The Redevelopment Agency shall replace all residential units destroyed by
             Agency-assisted projects with units of comparable bedroom size and affordability
             within four years of their removal pursuant to the requirements of State
             Redevelopment Law. The replacement of such units shall be the first priority for
             the use of the RDA Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund monies.
                                               Update
 The Agency has removed ten (10) residential units. The Agency has replaced the ten units
 with new units of comparable size and affordability.
 Policy      Programs
 4.1         The EDD/RDA will seek to encourage and assist the rehabilitation and
             maintenance of lower-income affordable housing within the City.
                                               Update
 The City has a successful housing rehabilitation program, which in the past has provided up
 to $50,000 per unit for substantial rehabilitation of both rental and ownership housing. Unlike
 many cities, Moreno Valley also makes grant funds available for the rehabilitation of mobile
 homes.

 4.1.01      The EDD/RDA will coordinate with the Riverside County Housing Authority to
             participate under the Section 312 program when funding is available to secure the
             rehabilitation of substandard single family homes occupied by low-income
             households.
                                              Update
 The City of Moreno Valley encourages rehabilitation and maintenance of lower-income
 housing through a variety of programs. Assistance is provided in the form of low interest
 deferred payment loans to owner occupants as well as owners of rental properties.
 Moderate-income homeowners can receive assistance through the Homeowner’s Assistance
 for Minor Rehabilitation (HAMR) program, which provides a low interest amortized loan. Low-
 income owners of mobile homes can receive assistance through the City’s Mobilehome Grant
 Program that provides up to a $7,500 rehabilitation grant.
 The City of Moreno Valley established its own single family rehabilitation program. Under the
 Home Improvement Loan Program (HILP). Funding from RDA, HOME and CHRP-O were
 combined to provide substantial rehabilitation funds for single family homes occupied by low-
 income households.

 Policy      Programs
 4.1.02      The City will continue to utilize CDBG and/or other appropriate funds to assist low-
             income senior citizens with minor repairs to owner-occupied homes, in conjunction
             with the Riverside County Housing Authority or other agencies, with the goal of
             assisting at least 50 households per year.
                                                Update
 During the time that the County administered a Senior Home Repair Program and made that
 program available to all cities in the county, the City of Moreno Valley provided funding for the
 program. A total of $52,000, over three years, was provided from the City’s CDBG funds.
 Seniors in our community were given a $250 grant for minor repairs. However, since 1995,
 the county has only made funds available to unincorporated areas, thus Moreno Valley
 seniors were no longer eligible to receive grants. The City has compensated by providing a
 grant to mobile home owners (a large proportion of those utilizing the Senior Home Repair
 Program lived in mobile homes) and by providing a minor rehabilitation loan program as well.

 4.1.04      The EDD/RDA will work with Riverside County Housing Authority to secure and

             (including the Moderate Rehabilitation program) within Moreno Valley, with the
             goal of rehabilitating 300 lower-income rental units by 1995.
                                               Update
 Through the State HOME program, the City received funding for a HUD financed Rental
 Rehabilitation Program. The program has been continued using RDA and HOME funding.
 Given the relatively low market rents, new rental housing construction has been infeasible
 without large subsidies. Instead the publicly assisted renovation of existing rental units offers
 a more cost-effective way to provide housing affordability.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                         MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
  Policy      Program
 4.1.05       The EDD/RDA, in cooperation with the Planning Department, will complete a
              survey of residential units within the Redevelopment Area(s) of Moreno Valley,
              identifying low-income affordable and substandard units, and then establish a
              program or programs that will lead to the replacement or renovation of 5% of
              these substandard units each year. Survey completion: July 1991; Program
              initiation December of 1991.
                                                Update
 The City completed a windshield survey of residential units within the redevelopment areas.
 Based on the windshield survey a total of three single-family units were identified as
 substandard. The three units were boarded and visibly substandard. The number of
 substandard units was limited so that the establishment of a program to replace or renovate a
 percentage of units was not necessary. However, the City has established the Rental
 Rehabilitation Program, the Home Improvement Loan Program, the Mobilehome Grant
 Program and the Homeowner’s Assistance for Minor Rehabilitation Program, to replace or
 renovate housing. The programs are available citywide with priority given to projects in the
 redevelopment areas.
 Policy     Program
 5.1        The City will seek to maximize the public benefit of programs designed to increase
            the accessibility of affordable housing, especially to lower-income and special-
            needs households, including the homeless and handicapped.
                                                Update
 The City has maximized the public benefit of its housing programs by using a variety of
 mechanisms to increase the accessibility of affordable housing. The City utilizes control
 mechanisms in its loan programs to assure that units remain affordable for the longest
 feasible period. The City makes its funds available at very low, simple interest rates, defers
 payments and does not exclude households with previous bankruptcies or inferior credit
 histories from accessing the City’s affordable housing programs. The City has most recently
 adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance, which will provide incentives to developers seeking to
 develop the State mandated ratio of affordable units.

             Program
 Policy
 5.1.01      By December 31, 1991, the EDD/RDA will create requirements and control
             mechanisms that will reserve for lower-income owner or renter households, the
             benefits derived from direct or indirect incentives provided to the development of
             lower-income affordable housing through City programs for the longest feasible
             time period. These requirements and control mechanisms will be utilized in
             conjunction with all lower-income single family and multi-family or City-backed
             housing programs.
                                               Update
 The City of Moreno Valley employs affordability requirements and other control mechanisms
 to insure that units created for lower-income households are maintained affordable for the
 longest feasible period. Also, in programs where the City provides direct assistance to
 property owners, the regulatory agreement has repayment requirements that insures setaside
 funds are repaid for use again in other affordable housing programs. It is important to note
 that the City provides loans at very low interest and does not add to a lower income
 household’s housing costs.

             Fund and any other sources with other City, County or State programs, and /or
             with other private non-profit organizations in order to create the maximum number
             of affordable lower-income units.
                                              Update
 The City of Moreno Valley has been very diligent and successful in obtaining funds to
 leverage its Low-income Housing Setaside. During the reporting period the City has
 leveraged setaside funds with California Housing Rehabilitation Program for Owners (CHRP-
 O) funds, HOME funds, Federal 202 funds, and Community Development Block Grant
 (CDBG) funds.

 Policy    Programs
 5.1.03    In order to maximize the availability of housing to lower-income seniors and special
           needs individuals in Moreno Valley, the City will consider allotting a portion of its
           CDBG funding to support the administrative expenses and promotion of a Share
           Housing Program in conjunction with the Housing Authority of Riverside County.
                                              Update
 The Shared Housing Program is administered by the Volunteer Center of Riverside County.
 The program has limited appeal to individuals looking for affordable housing in a market such
 as Moreno Valley’s where units are rather affordable. However, in 1992 the City’s
 commitment of its CDBG and Agency funds was rewarded with the completion of a new
 construction 202 senior project built in conjunction with TELACU. TELACU Villas, provides
 affordable, independent living apartment units to very low income seniors.

 TELACU Villa consists of seventy-five (75) affordable units for                     75

5.1.04       The EDD/RDA shall develop by July of 1992, a program, programs or method of
             participation in programs with other public or non-profit entities, that will assist
             families and individuals that are at risk of becoming homeless in an effort to
             prevent them from becoming homeless, through rent subsidies, job counseling,
             rental assistance, child care for working parents, or other programs that may be
             appropriate.
                                                Update
Beginning in fiscal year 1992-93, the City has provided Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funds for a program to prevent homelessness by providing monetary assistance to
families who have fallen behind on their house or rent payments. Prior to fiscal year 92-93
and including fiscal year 1997-98, the City continues to provide funding for two food
distribution programs in the City that help lower income individuals stretch their limited dollars
and prevent some of these families from becoming homeless.

CHAPTER 8 – HOUSING                                        MORENO VALLEY GENERAL PLAN
 Policy     Program
 5.1.05     The city will meet the emergency shelter needs of the homeless through
            continued financial support and other appropriate support of local and regional
            programs that provide emergency shelter and other types of assistance for the
            homeless of Moreno Valley. Important elements of the City’s program will be the
            assurance of adequate, appropriate transportation services to homeless shelters
            and support locations which may be located outside the City limits, coordination of
            various programs from a unified location, cooperation among various providers of
            homeless services, and preparation for the creation of homeless shelter facilities
            within Moreno Valley by the year 1998. The city Manager will designate a
            department to be responsible for meeting the emergency shelter needs of the
            homeless.
                                               Update
 The City has consistently provided Community Development Grant Block (CDBG) funding
 for shelter, food, counseling services, clothing and other support services to meet the
 emergency needs of homeless persons. Prior to the reporting period (1992-1997) and since
 that time, the City has continued to provide funding for homeless shelters and attendant
 services.

 Policy     Program
 5.1.06     The City Manager will designate by October 1 of 1991, appropriate City staff to
            work in cooperation with the Housing Authority of Riverside County and the cities of
            Riverside and Perris (as well as other potentially concerned entities such as the city
            of Norco and Corona) to assess the regional impact of impending termination of
            Federal and other types of mortgage and rental subsidies. By October of 1992 the
            City will develop a plan to mitigate any negative local effects of such terminations
            over the next 10 years, preferably through co-operation with the other effected
            jurisdictions to retain or replace terminated subsidies or subsidized units on a
            regional basis.
                                                Update
 The City of Moreno Valley does not have housing units affected by the termination of Federal
 mortgage or rent subsidies. The City has a total of 257 units in five Mortgage Revenue Bond
 assisted projects, with affordability controls that expired (between 1995-1999). Of the five
 projects only one, with twenty-eight (28) affordable units, was required to rent to very low
 income households. The other projects were required to make units available to lower
 income households.
 The City has provided 163 rental units at below market rents to households earning between
 50% and 60% of the county median income. The affordability controls on the units will
 remain in effect for thirty years. However, rent buy down units, are restricted only during the
 time that the City buys down the rent to an affordable level.
