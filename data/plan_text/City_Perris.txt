March Joint Powers Authority General

Referencing Exhibit 2, the City of Moreno
Valley, which adjoins the northerly
boundary of Perris east of Interstate 215, is
a rapidly growing industrial and residential
development area. In addition, plans for
significant business park, industrial, and
residential growth and development are
currently being implemented within the
Plan Area of the March Air Reserve Base.
Significant traffic volumes from this area
outside the City will utilize the north-
south arterials and the Ramona/Cajalco
corridor as well as I-215.          Further,
residential growth in Southern Riverside
County is significant, particularly in and
around the I-215 and I-15 junction. The
City of Perris has potential to be greatly
affected by this regional growth given the
availability of land and growing
employment base within the City limits. It
is therefore important to relate the City of
Perris’ Circulation system to other County
and Regional plans.

Collector Streets
The width of collector streets can range
from 40 feet to 64 feet curb-to-curb with
six feet of sidewalk on both sides
depending on the particular design and
traffic volumes to be served. Collector
streets should have adequate capacity at
their intersections with arterial streets in
order to provide adequate numbers of
traffic lanes to serve anticipated volumes
within the prescribed level of service
standard. This may mean that the curb-to-
curb width may be wider for portions of
the collector street at the approach to a
particular intersection depending on the
requirements based on a traffic study.
Local Streets
As general policy, local streets have a 60
feet right-of-way and a curb-to-curb width
of 40 feet. Six-foot wide sidewalks are
generally included in general on both sides
of local streets. In industrial areas, the
curb-to-curb width may be widened from
44 feet to 56 feet.

an estimated 28 to 50 trains move on the

Though the railroads are reluctant to
provide information on the amount of
freight originating in the County, it is
likely that the predominant mode for
freight movements in the County will
continue to be by truck in the foreseeable
future. This is certainly the trend expected
for raw agricultural commodities moving
to packing and processing facilities. For
long distance trips (i.e., outside the 800-

trains will carry approximately 50 percent
of the freight into the region, by tonnage.

Projected Travel Demand
The Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) traffic
model was used to estimate average
daily highway travel demand.
SCAG’s travel forecast model
includes land use data applied to
traffic analysis zones (TAZs) within
the plan area.       The model also
incorporates a detailed street and
highway network.
Travel demand, measured in vehicle-
trips for each of several trip purposes,
has been estimated for Year 2030.
Travel demand was estimated
considering: (1) projected land use
consistent with the Land Use Plan in
the Land Use Element in each of the
TAZs; (2) the planned transportation
network; and, (3) household
behavior. Year 2030 socioeconomic
data was developed for each TAZ by
the City of Perris and is composed of
the following information: the
number of single family and multiple
family households; population; and
the number of retail, service,
education, government and other
employment types. Since most traffic
congestion and capacity deficiencies
are experienced during peak
commute periods, forecasts of home-
based work trips (home to work,
work to home) are especially
important.

traffic volumes on principal streets and
highways in the City of Perris. Traffic
volumes for each classified street and
highway have been identified to project
expected levels of service. To determine
future LOS for each segment along the
street and highway network, segment LOS
was estimated using the Modified
Highway Capacity Manual-Based Level of
Service Tables (Appendix A). The Tables
are widely used in the Inland Empire and
consider the capacity of individual street
and highway segments based on numerous
roadway variables (freeway design speed,
signalized intersections per mile, number
of lanes, saturation flow, etc.). These
variables were identified and applied to
reflect existing traffic LOS conditions in
the plan area. A complete description of
the Modified Tables and the variables
applied to calculate segment LOS is
included in Appendix A and a summary
follows as Table CE-9. Table CE-10 and
Exhibit CE-13 identify the resulting Year
2030 average daily traffic volumes and LOS
for each street and highway segment.
Areas designated as Corridor Study Areas
in Exhibit CE-13 are expected to be
studied during the planning period and are
subject to change from the illustrated
designations prior to 2030. Exhibit CE-13
therefore identifies future LOS for the
planned regional street and highway
system.
Results of the segment analysis for the
Year 2030 indicate that a majority of the
future year street and highway segments
will be operating at LOS A through D
(reference Table CE-10). Fourteen (14)
segments referenced in Table CE-10 and

Multipurpose Recreational Trails
Recreational trails as defined by Riverside
County provide linkages and access within
parks, parkways, and principal or special
recreation areas. These trails provide
access between local populations and the
system of regional County parks and
recreation areas. They also interconnect
with other trails systems created by State
and federal parks and recreation agencies.
A variety of trail experiences are provided
by locating the trails in varied terrain,
scenic areas and interpretive points of
interest. The Riverside County General
Plan has adopted the following
classifications of multipurpose recreation
trails:
A parkway is located in, along, or adjacent
to a stream’s floodplain. Ordinarily it
extends the length of the stream but may
be broken into segments. Road and
trailside parks are part of a parkway.
Regional Trails are designed to connect
parks and provide linkage opportunities
between open space areas and regional
recreation areas.
Community Trails create linkages similar
to regional trails, but are local serving.

           Goods Movement
The efficient movement of goods in and
through the City of Perris is vital to the
City and the Inland Empire’s economy and
improves traveler safety. The ability of the
County to compete domestically and
internationally on an economic basis
requires an efficient and cost-effective
method for distributing and receiving
products. The City of Perris provides a key
link in this system with its proximity to I-
215, the rail line and March Air Reserve
Base.
Truck Routes
The existing truck AM/PM peak hour
turning movement counts are displayed in
Exhibit CE-10. Based on the current goods
movement on the circulation system it is
anticipated that Placentia Avenue will be
designated as a truck route once the
interchange at the I-215 is completed.
Additional truck routes will also include
portions of Oleander Avenue, Webster
Avenue, Indian Avenue, Morgan Street,
Ryder Street, and Case Road as depicted in
Exhibit CE-15.
Air Cargo
The March Air Reserve Base is currently a
joint use status development. The Air
Reserve Base will gradually reduce the
military use of this facility and begin to
increase the amount of goods and cargo
that can be accommodated at this site. As
the amount of goods transported into this
area via the March Air Reserve Base
increases, so does the potential to establish
viable land uses that can make use of this
facility.    This area can be used to
accommodate the increased growth in
goods movement, with the potential to
become a passenger airport.

                    Appendix A – Florida Table LOS Methodology
Florida Department of Transportation (DOT) Level of Service (LOS) Tables have been utilized
to analyze street and highway segments along the City of Perris Street and Highway System.
The Tables (referred to as "Modified Highway Capacity Manual LOS Tables”) have been used
to specifically evaluate the impacts of existing and planned growth and development on the
existing and proposed traffic circulation system.
The Florida LOS Tables were developed in 1988 by Florida FDOT in response to the passage of
significant growth management legislation during the mid-1980s, as well as to the need to comply to
standards published in the revised 1985 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The Tables were
established to:
       provide a grade LOS (A thru F) for future transportation corridor segment analysis.
        Such analysis is not available from HCM applications;
   to provide a better estimate of segment LOS versus reliance on the volume to capacity
        (V/C) ratio methodology which is not HCM-based, since it does not consider the effects
        of delay and congestion, especially at signalized intersections along rural facilities
        where passing opportunities are limited; and
   to provide a consistent process to measure LOS.
The Tables were recently updated in 2002 to reflect methodologies contained in the 1997
HCM. Because the Tables consider the effects that cause congestion and delay, they are
considered HCM-based and in accordance with the 1997 HCM wherein delay is the primary
factor used to measure LOS.
The standards incorporated in the Modified HCM-Based LOS Tables include the correlation
between urban size and highway congestion, urban infill, the different roles provided by state
facilities, the impact of development and the provision of necessary infrastructure, flexibility
in assessing special transportation areas, consideration of the relationship between highways
and exclusive transit systems servicing commuters, and recognition that numerous state
facilities are constrained and backlogged with no potential for expansion due to physical or
policy barriers. Furthermore, the LOS Tables are applicable in determining street and
highway system needs and deficiencies; directing development of long-range transportation
activities within urban areas; assessing project priorities; evaluating additional access points
such as interchanges, roads and driveways; analyzing regional and local government
transportation/circulation plans; and determining impacts from proposed developments.
Information provided in the LOS Tables includes three different types of area analysis
including: urbanized areas; areas transitioning into urbanized areas or non-urbanized areas
with a population of over 5,000; and rural undeveloped areas or developed areas with a
population of less than 5,000. The Tables are representative of peak hour and peak direction
conditions with daily volumes encompassing directional, subhourly, hourly, daily, monthly,
and seasonal peaking characteristics of traffic. Traffic conditions are evaluated considering 1)
service flow rates (considered as the maximum hourly rate at which vehicles can safely pass

                                                                                    City of Perris
                                                                                    General Plan
through an intersection during a 15-minute interval under current traffic signalization
conditions), and 2) a specified LOS.
Data provided by the LOS Tables are based upon methodologies provided from the 1997 HCM,
as well as from actual traffic and signalization conditions. It should be noted that the Tables
are considered measurement guidelines for street and highway LOS estimations, and are not to
be considered as statewide standards. The use of LOS Tables is recommended for general
planning applications necessary to evaluate street and highway LOS and through lane
requirements. The Tables are directly applicable for use within more comprehensive planning
activities in which less field data is available when planning takes longer to implement.
When dealing with the LOS Tables, default variables can be applied and include a variety of
street and highway characteristics such as number of lanes, number of signalized intersections
per mile, saturation flow rate, etc. The default variables referenced by street and highway
types above, were only applied to calculate LOS when actual known data (existing and future)
was not available. To the extent possible, actual or planned street and highway geometrics,
speeds, saturation flow, etc., were applied to calculate LOS. This information was gathered
from the County of Riverside, the cities, and the Riverside County Transportation
Commission (RCTC).
Given the extensive application of LOS Tables to various types of projects and analysis, the
Tables are considered extremely applicable to the goal of segment LOS. This conclusion is
based upon detailed comparative analysis considering various other HCM and delay-based
methodologies referenced in the HCM.

                         Appendix E – Existing Funding Sources
Senate Bill 45
Senate Bill (SB) 45 substantially revises the process for estimating the amount of State and
federal funds to be available for transportation projects in the State, as well as appropriating
and allocating the available funds, by changing the 7-year State Transportation Improvement
Program (STIP) to a 4-year program. Other revisions included: changing the components of
the regional and state transportation improvement programs, changing the name of the
Transportation Planning and Development (TP&D) Account to the Public Transportation
Account and changing the way funds are allocated from that account. SB 45 declared the
Legislature’s intent regarding budget estimates by Caltrans and the California Transportation
Commission (CTC) based on specified factors. The bill eliminated various transportation-
related programs, including traffic systems management, flexible congestion relief, commuter
and urban rail transit, and the state-local transportation partnership program. The bill
provided that Caltrans is continued as the responsible agency for the State highway system, as
specified. The Legislature, through the enactment of SB 45, establishes priorities and
processes for the programming and expenditure of State transportation funds that are at the
discretion of the Legislature and the Governor. Caltrans is responsible for the planning,
design, construction, maintenance and operation of the State highway system.
The method by which the estimate of funding is determined shall be determined by the CTC,
in consultation with Caltrans, transportation planning agencies and County transportation
commissions. This bill also allowed local agencies to have more power over funds allocated to
transportation planning projects in their jurisdiction.
State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP)
State law requires the California Transportation Commission (CTC) to adopt a STIP every
two years. Previously, the STIP allocated anticipated State and federal funding to projects
over a seven-year period, but since SB 45 has passed this process has changed. The 2000 STIP
covered a period of four years. Future STIPs will cover a period of five years. The STIP
programs State and federal gas tax funds for CTC controlled highway and commuter rail
projects. The current STIP includes a list of transportation projects proposed in the County’s
Regional Transportation Improvement Programs (RTIP) and the STIP, which are approved by
funding by the CTC. It should be noted that funding in the current STIP has been severely
reduced due to State budget shortfalls. SCAG and RCTC are working with the CTC and
other local agencies to address funding issues and will be preparing the RTIP for Riverside

Surface Transportation Program (STP)
The STP provides flexible funding that may be used by States and localities for projects on any
federal-aid highway, including the National Highway System (NHS), bridge projects on any
public road, transit capital projects, and intracity and intercity bus terminals and facilities. A
portion of funds reserved for rural areas may be spent on rural minor collectors. STP funds are
programmed through the STIP process.
Interregional Improvement Program (IIP)
The IIP deals with projects identified as providing the most adequate interregional road
system to all economic centers throughout the State. Funding for this program is equal to 25%
of all funds allocated through the SB 45 process. Caltrans submits the projects through the
STIP process to program into the STIP. The STIP is a program based on the current adopted
STIP and the most recent Project Delivery Report. It may include additional schedule changes
and/or cost changes, plus new projects that Caltrans proposed for the interregional road
system, as well as the intercity rail program, mass transit guideway or grade separation
programs. The IIP is a State funded program.
Regional Improvement Program (RIP)
The RIP deals with projects identified as providing the most adequate regional road system to
all economic centers throughout the State. Funding for this program is equal to 75% of all
funds allocated through the SB 45 process. Regional planning agencies submit the projects
through their RTIP process to program into the STIP. Currently, all State highways and other
local regional facilities are eligible for RIP funding.
State Highway Operation and Protection Program (SHOPP)
State legislation created SHOPP for Caltrans to be responsible for State highway safety and
rehabilitation projects, seismic retrofit projects, land and buildings projects, landscaping,
operational improvements, bridge replacement and the minor program. Unlike STIP projects,
SHOPP projects may not increase roadway capacity; SHOPP is a four-year program of
projects, adopted separately from the STIP cycle. The majority of the funds for this project
come from the old nine-cent State gas tax from federal funds, but a portion is also funded
through the recent State gas tax increase.
To be compatible with the Fund Estimate, a formula based on pavement condition and safety
concerns are issued to estimate an additional three years of the SHOPP.
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Program
The primary purpose of CMAQ Program is to fund projects and programs in air quality non-
attainment and maintenance areas for ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), and small particulate
matter (PM-10), which reduce transportation related emissions. The City of Perris may
submit applications for eligible projects when funds are available.

Transportation Enhancement Program
Transportation Enhancements (TE) are transportation-related activities that are designed to
strengthen the cultural, aesthetic and environmental aspects of the Nation’s intermodal
transportation system. The transportation enhancements program provides for the
implementation of a variety of non-traditional projects, with examples ranging from the
restoration of historic transportation facilities, to bike and pedestrian facilities, to landscaping
and scenic beautification, and to the mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff. The
City of Perris may submit applications for eligible projects when funds are available.
Federal Transportation Administration (FTA)
The FTA provides Federal funds for improvements in rural and urban transit operations. The
basic structure of the federal transit programs remains essentially the same, but several new
programs and activities have been added and new features have been incorporated. The
funding flexibility features first incorporated in the ISTEA and similar matching ratios to the
highway programs have been retained. The definition of a capital project has been revised to
include preventive maintenance, the provision of non-fixed route paratransit service, the
leasing of equipment or facilities, safety equipment and facilities, facilities that incorporate
community services such as daycare and health care, and transit enhancements. The FTA
sections that provide transit moneys are as follows:
Formula Grants The various Formula Grants programs are authorized for FYs 1998-2003.
After set asides for the Rural Transportation Accessibility Incentive Program, the Clean Fuels
program and the Alaska Railroad (see "Rail" programs), the remaining funding is apportioned
using three statutory formulas for urbanized areas, non-urbanized areas, and special needs of
the elderly and persons with disabilities.
Rural Transportation Accessibility Incentive Program This program provides funding for
the 5-year period of FYs 1999-2003 for over-the-road bus service. The purpose of the funding
is to help public and private operators finance the incremental capital and training costs of
complying with the DOT's final rule on accessibility of over-the-road buses. Funding may be
used for intercity fixed-route over-the-road bus service and other over-the-road service such as
local fixed route, commuter, charter, and tour service. The Secretary will allocate available
funding through a competitive grant selection process.
Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program This new program supports the global warming
initiative by providing an opportunity to accelerate the introduction of advanced bus
propulsion technologies into the mainstream of the Nation's transit fleets. When the
authorization in this formula grants account is combined with the authorization in the
Capital Investment Grants account, funding is authorized for the Clean Fuels Formula Grant
Program. Eligible projects include the purchasing or leasing of clean fuel buses and facilities,
and the improvement of existing facilities to accommodate clean fuel buses.

Clean fuel buses include those powered by compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas,
biodiesel fuels, batteries, alcohol-based fuels, hybrid electric, fuel cell, certain clean diesel and
other low or zero emissions technology. Available funds will be allocated among the eligible
grant applications using a formula based on an area's non-attainment rating, number of buses
and bus passenger-miles.
Urbanized Area Formula Grant Program Authorizations for the 6-year period are provided
for the Urbanized Area Formula Grant Program (Title 49 U.S.C. Section 5307). Under this
program, 91.23 percent of the funding is made available to all urbanized areas with a
population of 50,000 or more. For urbanized areas with populations less than 200,000,
funding may be used for either capital or operating costs at local option and without
limitation. For urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or more, the definition of "capital"
has been revised to include preventive maintenance. Operating assistance for these larger
areas is no longer an eligible expense. Also, for these larger areas, at least 1 percent of the
funding apportioned to each area must be used for transit enhancement activities such as
historic preservation, landscaping, public art, pedestrian access, bicycle access and enhanced
access for persons with disabilities.
Formula Grant Program for other than Urbanized Areas This program receives 6.37 percent
of the funding available for apportionment in proportion to each State's non-urbanized
population. Funding may continue to be used for capital, operating, State administration and
project administration expenses.
Formula Grant Program and Loans for Special Needs of Elderly Individuals and
Individuals with Disabilities This program receives 2.4 percent of formula funding available
and is apportioned based on each State's share of population for these groups of people.
Capital Investment Grants
TEA-21 also continues the current program structure of three major programs:
New starts Total funding is authorized for FYs 1998-2003. Not less than 92 percent is to be
applied to projects for final design and construction. The Secretary is to evaluate and rate
New Starts projects as “highly recommended,” “recommended” and “not recommended.” In
addition to the current report each February by the Secretary on funding recommendations, a
supplemental report is now required to be submitted to Congress each August. This report is
to describe the Secretary’s evaluation and rating of each project that has completed
alternatives analyses or preliminary engineering since the last report. In evaluating projects,
the Secretary is to consider the following new factors: population density and current transit
ridership in the corridor; the technical capability of the grant recipient to construct the
project; and factors that reflect differences in local land, construction, and operating costs. A
number of projects are identified for funding during the reauthorization period.
Fixed Guideway Modernization Authorizations for this program are over the 6-year period.
The allocation of funding under the first four tiers has been modified slightly, but will
continue to be apportioned using system-wide mileage based on data used to apportion the
funding in FY 1997. Also, the number of tiers has been increased from four to seven. The
funding in these three additional tiers will be apportioned based on actual route-miles and
revenue vehicle-miles on segments at least 7 years old.

Bus. Funding is authorized for bus and bus-related facilities over the 6-year period. A portion
is authorized for the Federal Transit Administration’s Bus Testing Facility in Pennsylvania for
each of the 6 years of the reauthorization period. A number of bus projects are identified for
funding in FYs 1999 and 2000.
Transit Benefits
The Act changes the Internal Revenue Code to help level the playing field between parking
benefits and transit/vanpool benefits. The limit on nontaxable transit and vanpool benefits is
increased from $65 to $100 per month for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001.
In addition, the bill allows transit and vanpool benefits to be offered in lieu of compensation
payable to an employee for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, giving transit and
vanpool benefits the same tax treatment given to parking benefits under the Taxpayer Relief
Act of 1997.
Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty First Century (TEA-21)
TEA-21 is also known as “federal reauthorization,” a piece of legislation passed by Congress in
December of 1998 that provides for a major restructuring of the highway program. TEA-21
was adopted to provide funding for highways, highway safety and mass transportation for six
years to improve air quality and congestion and has been a very successful program since its
inception. Similar legislation will continue to be a contributor to City of Perris transportation
improvements. Key components of this Act include a great flexibility in the programming of
projects, a level of playing field between highway and transit projects with a consistent 80/20
matching ratio, ties to the Federal Clean Air Act and Americans with Disabilities Act and
earmarked construction projects. The TEA-21 program consists of programs designed to
provide funds to special projects that must qualify through the Federal Transportation
Improvement Program (FTIP) before they receive funds.
TEA-21, as well as the Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) is changing the way transportation
planning is accomplished in California. The current Federal Transportation Improvement
Program (FTIP) fulfills each of the TEA-21 requirements and conforms to the RTP and other
regional plans. Congress is currently in the process of developing new federal reauthorization
legislation.
Transportation Development Act
The Transportation Development Act is California law, which provides funding for transit
through Local Transportation Funds (LTF) and State Transit Assistance Funds (STAF).
These funds are California State sales tax funds that are available for transit operations and
street and road purposes. The LTF has been in existence since 1972 derived from 1/4 cent of
retail sales tax collected in the State of California. STAF, in existence since 1980, is generated
by a gasoline sales tax. The LTF is distributed to each City and the unincorporated areas
based on population. In Riverside County, the LTF may be used for both transit and street
and road purposes as long as all transit needs are addressed, whereas STAF must be used for
transit purposes only.

Local Funding Sources
Local contribution to State Highways and the regional and local roadway system in the City of
Perris is optional. The only means of collecting revenue for local streets and roads is through
mitigation and developer fees. The City has the responsibility and authority to enact and
collect these fees in order to make transportation improvements.
In addition to mitigation and developer fees, the City of Perris requires dedication of right-of-
way and improvement of infrastructure to accommodate proposed developments.

                          Appendix F – Potential Funding Sources
Vehicle In-Lieu Fees
As indicated above, vehicle in-lieu fees are collected by the State and returned to the County
under Section 11005 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. The tax is paid annually by motor
vehicle owners in lieu of a county property tax on motor vehicles. These funds are deposited
in each local government's general fund (including the City of Perris), and can be used for any
purpose.
The City currently programs these funds for public facilities and services it is mandated to
provide through the general fund. Still, it is appropriate to identify motor vehicle in-lieu fees
as a potential funding source to offset the “shortfall” needed to maintain the City’s street and
highway system.
Local Sales Tax Increase for Transportation
Local sales tax revenues provide the largest single source of funding to most state and local
governments. In California, the State Legislature and Governor retain sole authority to enable
other public entities to enact sales tax increases.
Sales tax increases used for transportation purposes have a long history. For example, a 0.5
percent sales tax increase was enacted in 1988 in Riverside County to provide necessary
transportation improvements. The sales tax was extended in November 2002.
A number of other counties have also implemented sale tax increases for transportation
purposes including Alameda, Contra Costa, Fresno, Imperial, Monterey, Sacramento, San
Benito, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Barbara and Santa Clara.
A local sales tax increase for transportation improvements has proven to be a good revenue
source for the following reasons:
There is flexibility in how the revenues can be used, i.e., for highway maintenance or capital
projects, or for transit purposes.
Sales taxes have proven extremely responsive to inflation, unlike gasoline taxes. In the 1970s,
highway departments depended on gas tax revenues were hit a double flow: reduced vehicle-
miles of travel and improved fuel economy. This resulted in reduced gas tax allocations. On
the other hand, retail sales increased at least as much as inflation, and in many growing areas
more-so, indicating that a sales tax increase can keep up with inflation.
Sales taxes also tend to be a fairly reliable source of funds, therefore it is possible to sell
revenue anticipation bonds at reasonable interest rates backed by future tax receipts. This
stability permits large projects to go ahead more quickly than they would under a "pay as you
go" method.
Circulation Element                            126

                                                                                     City of Perris
                                                                                      General Plan
Sales taxes provide a very broad tax base, so that a small tax increase can produce a
considerable revenue stream. Depending on local conditions, a half-cent sales tax increase can
generate the same revenue as a 20 to 25-cent per gallon (or even more) increase in the gasoline
tax.
Historically, the electorate has been least opposed to sales tax increases since a majority of the
population uses the transportation system on a daily basis and is aware of needed
improvements.
Because a separate transportation authority outside the existing government framework is
usually formed to administer the sales tax increase, expenditures are exempted from the
existing Gann Initiative's spending limits. An increase in the Statewide gasoline tax, even
though it is really a user fee, would be subject to the Gann funding limits.
The tax is easy to administer, since similar systems for collection and distribution already
exist such as the Local Transportation Fund/Transportation Development Act (TDA/LTF)
funding process.
A local sales tax increase gives an area more local control over project selection and priority
than a gas tax increase which is collected by the State and disbursed consistent with State
allocation requirements.
The passage of the Measure A sales tax extension will ensure a continued funding source of
local transportation funds for the City of Perris. It should be noted that unlike existing sales
tax revenues (where the State keeps three-quarters of the tax collected and returns only one
quarter to the local jurisdiction), 100 percent of the increase in sales taxes are returned to the
local jurisdictions responsible for administering the allocation. A small share of the tax is kept
by the State to cover its administrative costs.
City Contributions
City contributions, composed of several funding sources, could be applied toward
construction of the City's street and highway system. This revenue source could be developed
in cooperation with the County. The amount of City contribution would be based upon the
extent of improvement to facilities located or planned within the SOI. City contributions
would be composed of several funding sources including City general funds, local agency
imposed traffic impact fees, development fees, redevelopment area funds, etc.
To implement this system in the City of Perris, an assessment of existing revenue sources to
complement the planned street and highway program would be developed. Cost estimates
associated with unfunded projects would then be divided by the number of trips generated
from planned land uses. The result would be traffic impact fees based upon cost per trip.
There is justification for the sharing of traffic impact fees between the City and the County for
new development projects of regional significance such as a regional activity center or other
large employment center. Traffic effects of such projects transcend jurisdictional boundaries;
therefore, it would be reasonable to develop fee sharing between the City of Perris and the
County.

Community Service/Special Assessment Districts for Roads
Assessment districts have been used to fund a variety of public works improvements in
California since 1911. Assessment districts are used when a well-defined and limited area of
land benefit from the improvement. An assessment may be paid in cash by the landholder, or
through installments (usually on the land owner's property tax bill). Assessments do not
require a vote of the owners or voters in the assessed area, but rather are created through
administrative procedures. Typically, assessed land owners must be given appropriate notice
and a hearing must be held. There is a mechanism for majority protest of the assessment.
Bonds issued to pay for improvements are exempt from State and federal taxes, and carry a
lower interest rate than privately raised capital. Assessments can be levied by a county, City,
or special district, and can overlap jurisdictional boundaries with the consent of local
governments involved. Special district assessments must have specified enabling authority to
levy assessments from the State Legislature.
The distribution of assessments (or "spread") is done on a formula basis, and must be
reasonably related to benefits received. The assessment can be a flat fee (e.g., $400 per acre),
or it can be related to the benefit conferred on a parcel (e.g., a graduated fee based on distance,
where land further from the improvement pays less). Operating costs may also be paid
through assessment districts.
This funding mechanism is not currently used in the City of Perris for highway construction
purposes. The City, however, should investigate this method of financing large projects. This
method may also be appropriate for local circulation improvements within a defined area of
benefit.
Local (Countywide) Gasoline Tax
A local option gas tax for streets and roads projects was enacted by the State in 1981. It may be
imposed by voters after placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors and approval of a
majority of the municipalities weighed by population. The County and its cities must agree
through a tax agreement on how the funds are to be allocated. To date, no counties in
California have adopted such a tax.
Public/Private Joint Venture Revenues
When a local jurisdiction owns excess land adjacent to its transportation facilities, the full value of such
property may be captured by leasing the air, surface, or subsurface rights. These leases can provide a steady
stream of income, usually over long lease terms (typically 40 to 99 years). Because land values in the City of
Perris are not extremely high, the value of air rights over existing City facilities is presumably nonexistent,
however, the leasing of excess surface rights may be desirable in some areas. Short-term leases can be negotiated
for surface parking, mini storage facilities, recreational uses, etc.
Redevelopment District Areas

Transportation improvement projects within incorporated jurisdictions could be funded
through the use tax increment funds provided from new or improved development located
within City redevelopment areas. City redevelopment plans would contain planned
circulation improvements required as a condition for redevelopment. Tax increments received
by the City of Perris could be applied to street and highway projects within areas covered by
Redevelopment Plans to defray the costs of such improvements.
Other State Programs
One other proposed State transportation improvement program implemented with passage of
SCA-1 on June 5, 1990, included the "State/Local Transportation Partnership Program.”
The State/Local Transportation Partnership Program provides new revenues for eligible
projects on local roads, State highways, or mass transit guideways statewide. The State/Local
Transportation Partnership Program is a "matching" program wherein the State's match never
exceeds 50%. The State's match would be dependent upon the amount of revenues requested
by local agencies for eligible projects.

Conservation Element strives for a balance
between the urban and the natural
environments. In recognizing that the
natural environment will be affected as
development occurs, the Conservation
Element provides goals and policies as a
framework        for    the     management,
preservation, and use of the City’s
resources.
This Conservation Element is arranged to
address four topical areas: Agricultural
Resources, Biological Resources, Cultural
Resources and Water Resources. It is
organized under the following categories.
   I. Existing Conditions provides a year
      2003 inventory of natural and
      cultural resources.
  II. Issues,       Opportunities,       and
      Constraints     identifies important
      conservation topics in the City of
      Perris.
 III. The Conservation Plan (Exhibit
      CN-1) depicts areas of existing
      agricultural lands, preservation plans,
      and significant water bodies. In
      addition to this exhibit, the
      Conservation Element contains other
      exhibits to depict areas within the
      City known to contain, or with the
      potential for, important cultural
      and/or natural resources. These maps
      should be used in conjunction with
      the other land use plans and maps
      contained in the General Plan to
      assure consistency, and to allow for

preserve the range of target species that
occur or which could potentially occur in
that area.      Each of the subunits is
comprised of 160-acre “cells”, where the

defined. Exhibits that depict the MSHCP

Groundwater Basin(s)
The Santa Ana River Water Quality
Control Plan divides the San Jacinto
Watershed into 14 groundwater sub-
basins. The City of Perris lies above Perris
South I, Perris South II, and Perris South III
sub-basins. The Santa Ana Watershed
Project Authority combines these three
sub-basins      into    two     groundwater
management zones, referred to as Perris
North and Perris South (See Exhibit CN-9:
Groundwater Management Zones).
Perris South I, Perris South II, and Perris
South III groundwater sub-basins are listed
for municipal and agricultural beneficial
uses. Water quality objectives have only
been established for total dissolved solids
(TDS) for each of the three sub-basins. The
TDS level objective is 2,000 mg/L for Perris
South I, 1,500 mg/L for Perris South II, and
1,200 mg/L for Perris South III.
Groundwater quality in the Perris sub-
basins is generally of poor quality due to
high concentrations of TDS and Nutrients
resulting from past and present
agricultural runoff. Due to high TDS and
nutrient levels, groundwater is no longer
used for domestic purposes and only
partially used to meet agricultural demand.

“Leap-frog” development often occurs
when agricultural lands or other open
space areas separate new development
from existing urban areas and facilities.
Development patterns such as this can
create     inefficient   and     premature
development pressures as Perris attempts
to keep pace in providing utilities, roads,
and public services. This pattern is typical
in cities experiencing high growth rates,
and Perris can benefit by adopting policies
or procedures to convert agricultural areas
to new uses uniformly and on contiguous
properties.

facility, will account for 5-10 percent of the
total life-cycle cost of the structure. In
contrast, operations and maintenance costs
will account for 60-80 percent of the total
life-cycle costs, with land acquisition,
conceptual       planning,     renewal      or
revitalization, and disposal accounting for
the remaining 5-35 percent.
Key elements of design pertaining to green
building are performance standards, cost
issues, materials selection, and building
placement. Through implementation of the
Improvement Measures noted below, the
City intends to actively inform, encourage
and guide the use of green building
standards in remodeling and designing new
and existing developments and public
facilities within the city.
           Strategy for Action
The inclusion of a Sustainable Community
section within the Conservation Element
Plan emphasizes the City’s commitment to
leadership in the community for
environmentally        conscience    building
practices. The City has significant market
influence through its proprietary agencies;
its     purchasing,      procurement,     and
contracting processes; and its regulatory,
planning, and land use powers.

                                                   HEALTHY COMMUNITY ELEMENT
Introduction
A healthy city is one that is continually improving
those physical facilities, social environments, and
community reserves which enable people to perform
all the functions of life and develop their maximum
potential. There are many conditions that have a
profound impact on a community’s ablility to lead a
healthy life. Communities that have access to vital
resources such as recreational facilities, healthy foods,
medical services, transportation options, quaility and
affordable housing, living-wage jobs, safe
neighborhoods, and quality educational services experience better health outcomes.
Purpose
The purpose of the Healthy Community Element is to promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of the Perris’s residents, workers, and visitors. The Healthy Community Element provides a framework
to implement the General Plan’s vision for a healthier sustainable Perris. This element will address
areas where public health and planning intersect, including transportation, active living, access to
nutritious food, access to health care, mental health, and environmental health.
Public Outreach/Initial Efforts to Improve
Health Outcomes
In preparation for this Healthy Community Element, the
City of Perris has used various avenues to educate
residents about the relationship between planning and
health, to understand better the community’s priorities
for health, and to provide an opportunity for citizens to
discuss their concerns about the overall health in the
community, such as healthy eating and access to
nutritious foods, and the quality and safety of the              2014 Student Presidential Active Lifestyle
pedestrian environment.                                                       Award (PALA)
In April 2013, the City of Perris adopted the Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL) Campaign Resolution.
Under this resolution the City was ordered to promote employee wellness, improve the built
environment and increase healthy food access within the City of Perris.
                                                                                                 1|Page

                                                     HEALTHY COMMUNITY ELEMENT
Since the adoption of the resolution, the City has kicked off the Live Well Campaign to provide
opportunities for citizens to live a healthier active life. The City has offered various activities and
resources to the citizens to understand and participate in healthy eating and active living. The City has
offered free workout sessions, sports clinics for children, Health Fairs, Walk to School Day, and a
Farmers Market, to name just a few of the activities. In addition, the City has adopted a Master Trail
Plan to further implement active living and design.
                 2014 Live Well Kick Off                          2014 Lake Perris Community Hike
One of the most attended events was the City of Perris’ Annual Health Fair on April 26, 2014. At this
Health Fair the City administered a survey to the residents about what they would like to see. Over 100
people responded to the survey. The data gathered at this event directly informed the content of the
Healthy Community Element. The residents that participated in the survey identified their city-wide
nutrition priorities as: creation of farmers markets; support for local markets and grocery stores to
provide more healthy food options; and limits on drive-through restaurants and liquor stores,
especially around schools. Overall, residents expressed a strong desire for clean and safe streets that
encourage walking and public gathering.

Goals and Policies
The goals and policies in this Element are the result of a comprehensive analysis of existing health and
environmental conditions along with community outreach. They reflect a progressive but realistic
approach to Perris’ current environment. It may not be realistic to expect everyone in the City to sell
their cars and start biking everywhere, but there are opportunities to promote more physical activity
through improved park access, a better walking environment, more access to public transit, and more
jobs and services that are locally available.

                                                                City of Perris to improve the environment so there
                                                                can be an effect on health. Certain segments of the
                                                                population such as young children, older adults, and
                                                                those with lower incomes are often more
                                                                susceptible to a variety of health risks.
The rate of overweight or obese adults in the City is higher than that of Riverside County or the State of
California. 32.7 percent of Perris residents are overweight or obese, compared to 25.9 percent for
Riverside County and 24.8 percent for the State of California.3 Studies have found that being
overweight or obese has strong links to other illnesses like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.

Policy Area 1: Citywide Health
Goal HC-1: Citywide Health – Foster educational opportunities that show a connection between
“place” and health.
HCE Policies
HC 1.1   Promote an understanding of the connections between the built environment and the on-
         going health challenges in the City of Perris
HC 1.2   Coordinate the development of complete neighborhoods that provide for the basic needs of
         daily life and for the health, safety, and welfare of residents
HC 1.3   Improve safety and the perception of safety by requiring adequate lighting, street visibility,
         and defensible space
HC 1.4   Encourage health promotion groups to participate at community/city-sponsored events (e.g.
         waive booth fees at fairs, etc.)
HC 1.5   On an ongoing basis, identify and address health inequities in Perris (i.e. unjust barriers that
         result in differences in environmental conditions and health outcomes) and strive to provide a
         high quality of life for all residents, regardless of income, age or ethnicity
HC 1.6   Encourage the attraction and retention of high quality grocery stores and other healthy food
         purveyors as an economic development strategy for the City. Healthy food outlets include
         full-service grocery stores, regularly-held farmer’s markets, fruit and vegetable markets, and
         convenience stores or corner stores that sell a significant proportion of healthy food
Land Use and Community Design
                                     Although conventional planning practices (such as separating
                                     residential and commercial uses, building low density areas,
                                     constructing streets primarily for automobiles, and not providing
                                     adequate transportation choices) are not the single cause of chronic
                                     health problems in the State, there is increasing documentation that
                                     they are often a contributing factor.
                                     Research indicates that auto-oriented,
                                     low density; single use places – as well as
                                     places underserved by parks and active
                                     recreation facilities – discourage physical
                                     activity and therefore contribute to an
                                     increased risk of heart disease, cancer,
stroke, and diabetes. Poor nutrition, which can be exacerbated by land use
decisions that limit people’s access to healthy food, also contributes to
these chronic diseases. Physical inactivity and poor nutrition is also a primary risk factor for obesity
                                                                                                  4|Page

(the fastest-growing disease in California, along with diabetes). Conversely, research shows that higher
density, walkable urban places, transportation choices, and access to recreation all increase physical
activity, and thus promote positive health impacts.
Policy Area 2: Land Use and Community Design
Goal HC-2: Community Design – Facilitate local efforts to improve the opportunities and choices for a
healthy and active lifestyle.
HCE Policies
HC 2.1: Implement the Perris Trail Master Plan
HC 2.2: Partner with the Riverside County Department of Public Health in its efforts to fund,
           coordinate, and implement safe-routes-to-school projects
HC 2.3: Promote increased physical activity, reduced driving and increased walking, cycling and public
           transit by:
           o Requiring where appropriate the development of compact development patterns that are
               pedestrian and bicycle friendly
           o Increasing opportunities for active transportation (walking and biking) and transit use
           o Encouraging the development of neighborhood grocery stores that provide fresh produce
HC 2.4 Promote development patterns and policies that:
           o Reduce commute times
           o Encourage the improvement of vacant properties and the reinvestment in neighborhoods
           o Provide public space for people to congregate and interact socially
           o Foster safe and attractive environments

HC 2.6 Encourage land use and urban design to promote physical activity, provide access to
           nutritious foods, and reduce air pollution
HC 2.7 Promote goals, objectives, and policies that achieve positive health outcomes. These include
           the following:
           o Redeveloping the Corridors and Districts with a diverse mix of higher-intensity uses
           o Building higher density development near existing and proposed future transit
           o Enhancing existing neighborhoods with walkable streets, a diverse mix of housing types,
               and neighborhood services (such as stores, recreational facilities, and childcare) within
               walking distance. This could also include promoting building designs that enhance
               opportunities for defensible space

Multimodal Transportation
                                       Most people in Perris drive to work, to school, and for their daily
                                       needs such as shopping. This is similar to the transportation behavior
                                       of Riverside County, where in 2008 the average household drove 66.5
                                       miles per day (21.26 miles per day per capita), according to the SCAG
                                       Regional Transportation Plan. 4
                                       Many parts of Riverside County, including the Perris area, experience
                                       high levels of traffic congestion. A large portion of residents
                                       experience long commute times, and the hours and miles spent
                                       driving continue to rise. Increased driving rates are a source of
                                       physical, economic, and environmental stress. Driving has been linked
                                       with negative health impacts, including higher rates of traffic crashes
       Kimball Transit Center          and increased levels of stress and anxiety. In addition, more miles and
                                       hours spent traveling by motor vehicle translate into greater amounts
of air pollution which in turn have health impacts.
The City would like to improve access and the effectiveness of
alternative transportation modes ultimately supporting active living
and healthy lifestyles. The transportation system should make it
easy to walk, bike, and use public transit, while also minimizing the
need to drive long distances to meet basic daily needs or get to
work. The transportation systems should be designed in close
coordination with land use patterns and the urban form, so that all
transportation facilities encourage people to drive less, walk more,
and have greater access to jobs, healthy food and community
resources.
Public transit is an approach to combat traffic congestion and
protect the environment. In 1993 The City Council approved the                        Perris Valley Line Metrolink
Downtown Specific Plan incorporating a multi-modal transportation center. Ward Kimball Transit
Center is located in Downtown Perris and serves approximately 880,000 riders annually mainly via 216
weekday buses. The City is currently undergoing the development of the Perris Valley Line (PVL)
Project. PVL will be a 24-mile extension of the Metrolink 91 Line. This line currently provides service from
Riverside to Downtown Los Angeles.

Policy Area 4: Public and Open Space
Goal 4: Public and Open Space – Facilitate the creation and maintenance of spaces for public
recreation.
HCE Policies
HC 4.1      Promote public spaces that foster positive human interaction and healthy lifestyles
HC 4.2      Foster the creation of public plazas with seating, art, and play features near shopping and
            business districts
HC 4.3       Encourage the development and display of public art to promote the history, heritage, and
            culture of Perris
HC 4.4      Provide opportunities for community gardens and local food production:
            o The City will support the use of public and private vacant lots, including school yards, for
                  community gardens, as feasible or appropriate
Healthy Economy
Income is one of the strongest
determinants of health status. When
people have access to high quality
employment that pays a living wage,
they are more likely to have access to
health care, and more likely to afford
basic necessities such as healthy food
and housing. Additionally, people with
higher incomes incur less psychosocial
stress about how to make ends meet.
21.9 percent of adults (aged 18 or
older) in the City are living in poverty.
California’s average is 13.0 percent. 7

The number of jobs in a community in proportion to the amount of housing available is an important
indicator of both the availability of housing for the City’s workforce and the availability of jobs for City
residents. The overall jobs/housing ratio in Riverside County is approximately 0.7, which includes all
cities within its jurisdiction. 8 The need to travel long distances for work or for housing increases time

lack of jobs can also diminish economic vitality, competitiveness, and sustainability.
Policy Area 5: Healthy Economy
Goal HC-5: Healthy Economy – Encourage businesses to provide meaningful employment opportunities
to residents.
HCE Policies
HC 5.1 Develop programs to attract and retain industries that can provide a living wage, provide health
         insurance benefits, and meet existing levels of workforce education
HC 5.2 Encourage local employers to adopt healthy living/healthy employee programs and practices
        such as health challenges (e.g., weight loss contests, stop smoking programs,
        lunchtime/worktime sponsored events, bike to work days), healthy food choices, and healthy
        work environments
Healthy Environment
                                              A healthy community promotes environmental protection,
                                              better use of resources, sustainability and stewardship.
                                              Sustainable development practices increase the efficiency
                                              with which buildings use resources and reduces impacts on

                                              People today are exposed to an unprecedented amount of
                                              harmful substances, ranging from particulate matter and
                                              emissions from auto and industrial sources to toxic

               Solar Carports                pesticides and ingredients found in every day household
                                             and pharmaceutical products. These harmful substances
enter into air and water supplies and accumulate in bodies causing a range of health effects such as
increased respiratory illness, cancer and other chronic health problems. Consequently decisions about
the location and mix of lands uses, transportation investments, design and building practices, and
building materials can all have an impact on the environment and human health.
The City of Perris supports the broader needs of the community and surrounding region by being a
leader in addressing community-wide objectives, to reduce impacts arising from the environmental
impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.
For energy efficiency, solar panels on carports are constructed throughout the City. The roofs of these
new carports are installed with photovoltaics panels to take advantage of clean and renewable solar

energy in City parks, the Senior Center, the Public Works Yard, City Hall, and the County Library. The
energy produced by these solar energy systems currently accounts for approximately 30% of the City
government’s energy needs.
To minimize the use of fossil fuels that contribute to green house gases and global warming, 25% of the
City’s fleet of vehicles is currently powered by an alternative fuel source: compressed natural gas
(CNG), the “Clean Air Choice.”
Policy Area 6: Healthy Environment
Goal HC-6: Healthy Environment – Support efforts of local businesses and regional agencies to improve
the health of our region’s environment.
 HCE Policies
HC 6.1     Support regional efforts to improve air quality through energy efficient technology, use of
           alternative fuels, and land use and transportation planning
HC 6.2     Support regional water quality efforts that balance water conservation, use of recycled water,
           and best practices in watershed management
HC 6.3     Promote measures that will be effective in reducing emissions during construction activities
           o Perris will ensure that construction activities follow existing South Coast Air Quality
               Management District (SCAQMD) rules and regulations
           o All construction equipment for public and private projects will also comply with California
               Air Resources Board’s vehicle standards. For projects that may exceed daily construction
               emissions established by the SCAQMD, Best Available Control Measures will be
               incorporated to reduce construction emissions to below daily emission standards
               established by the SCAQMD
           o Project proponents will be required to prepare and implement a Construction
               Management Plan which will include Best Available Control Measures among others.
               Appropriate control measures will be determined on a project by project basis, and should
               be specific to the pollutant for which the daily threshold is exceeded

I. INTRODUCTION
A.       PURPOSE
The purpose of the Housing Element of the Perris General Plan is to ensure the City establishes policies,
procedures and incentives in its land use planning and redevelopment activities that will result in the
maintenance and expansion of the housing supply to adequately accommodate households currently
living and expected to live in Perris. It institutes policies that will guide City decision-making, and
establishes an action program to implement housing goals through 2021.
The Housing Element has been designed to address key housing issues in the City. The foremost issue is
providing a mix and balance of housing types and costs to meet the needs of all segments of the
population of Perris. As such, the Housing Element makes provisions for affordable and accessible
housing for special needs groups in the City, and is designed to provide guidance in the maintenance of
existing affordable housing. These commitments are an expression of the statewide housing goal of an
“early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian, including
farm workers,” as well as an expression of the City of Perris’ goal for a suitable living environment for
every household.
B.       NEW STATE LEGISLATION
The Perris Housing Element was last updated in 2010 and is currently being updated for the years 2014 to
2021 as part of the new update cycle for jurisdictions within the SCAG (Southern California Association
of Governments) region to allow for synchronization with the 2012-2035 Regional Transportation Plan
and Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS). The Element sets forth an 8-year strategy to address
the City’s identified housing needs, including specific implementing programs and activities.
Various amendments have been made to Housing Element law since adoption of the City’s current
Housing Element. These include:
       AB 162: Requires the City, upon adoption of the Housing Element, to identify specific flood
        hazard zones in the Land Use Element and specific floodwater and groundwater recharge areas in
        the Conservation and Safety Elements.
       SB 244: Requires the City, upon the adoption of a Housing Element, to update the Land Use
        Element to include data and analysis, goals, and implementation measures regarding
        unincorporated island, fringe, or legacy communities and their infrastructure needs.
       SB 812: In addition to the existing special needs groups, the City must include an analysis of the
        housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities.
       AB 1867: Under certain conditions, the City can now count multi-unit homeownership units that
        have been converted to affordable units toward their RHNA allocation.
       SB375 Implications: For jurisdictions that do not submit their adopted 2014-2021 housing element
        update within 120 days of the October 2013 deadline, their housing element updates revert to a
        four-year cycle.
The contents of this updated Housing Element comply with these amendments and all other
requirements of Housing Element law.

C.      CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
California Government Code requires that local governments make diligent effort to achieve public
participation from all economic segments of the community in the development of the Housing Element.
In the preparation of the Housing Element Update, a number of organizations and agencies that provide
housing or housing related services were contacted. Stakeholder groups that have been identified as
influential to the development of housing and the provision of services in the community are:
      Housing Authority of the County of Riverside
      Fair Housing Council of Riverside County
      Perris Senior Citizens Center
      Mead Valley Community Center
      Perris Family Care Center
      Riverside County Office on Aging
      National Community Renaissance
      Housing and Homeless Coalition for Riverside County
      Inland Valley Habitat For Humanity
      Volunteers of America
Due to the recent economic downturn, many of these organizations have received limited funding, which
has resulted in reduced personnel and services for the community and in one instance, the
discontinuation of an organization’s operation.
The City held two workshop meetings with the Planning Commission prior to the submittal of this
Housing Element draft to HCD for informal review.
The first meeting with the Commission took place on October 17, 2012 and was intended to provide
Commissioners and the public with general information regarding the Housing Element (i.e. contents,
process, and information on the RHNA). The City’s efforts to engage the public included mailers
advertising the meetings sent directly to stakeholders, posted flyers on the City’s website, and noticing at
City Hall. No formal public comments were made at the first meeting, though many Planning
Commissioners provided valuable feedback to staff regarding important housing issues in the City and
questions on the requirements of Housing Element law.
A second workshop with the Planning Commission occurred on December 5, 2012 and was focused on
the specific sections included in the draft Housing Element update, i.e., the Housing Plan, Land Inventory
and technical background report. The Planning Commission noted the importance of community
participation in the development of a document that is so meaningful and important to the community.
The Commission suggested the City create a one-page flier or pamphlet that brings attention to the
major discussion points in the Housing Element. Comments and revisions regarding the structure and
presentation of the statistics analysis in the community profile of the Housing Element Update
document were brought forth during the meeting. The Planning Commission also noted that the Housing
Element was informative and provided a fantastic housing resource for members of the community that
would like to learn or are curious about various Housing policies and programs in the City of Perris. The
Executive Director for the Temecula Habitat for Humanity, Tammy Marine, was in attendance and was
pleased with the presentation regarding the 5th cycle Housing Element Update. Ms. Marine did not speak
during the meeting but requested a hard copy of the 2014 – 2021 Draft Housing Element Update after the
meeting was adjourned.

                                                                                              General Plan
D.       CONSISTENCY WITH STATE PLANNING LAW
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements mandated by the State of California.
Sections 65580 to 65590 of the California Government Code contain the legislative mandate for the
Housing Element. State law requires that the City's Housing Element consist of "an identification and
analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives,
financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and development of
housing" (Section 65583). In addition, the Housing Element shall identify adequate sites for housing,
including rental housing, factory-built housing, and mobile homes, and shall make adequate provision for
the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.
There is no single approved format for a Housing Element. Instead, State law defines components of
issues that must be addressed. A Housing Element should clearly identify and address, at a minimum,
each component listed below.
    1.   Review of existing Housing Element.
    2.   An assessment of existing and projected housing and employment trends to assess a locality’s
         housing needs for all income levels.
    3.   An inventory of resources relevant to meeting housing needs.
    4.   An inventory of constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.
    5.   A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the
         maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
    6.   A program that sets forth an eight-year schedule of actions the local government is undertaking
         or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the
         Housing Element.
E.       GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
The Housing Element is one of seven elements of the Perris General Plan. The goals, policies, standards
and proposals within this element relate directly to, and are consistent with, all other elements. The
City’s Housing Element identifies programs and resources required for the preservation, improvement
and development of housing to meet the existing and projected housing needs of its population. Through
the regulation of the amount and variety of open space and recreation areas, acceptable noise levels in
residential areas, and programs to provide for the safety of the residents, policies contained in General
Plan elements directly affect the quality of life for all Perris citizens.
The Housing Element is affected by development policies contained in the Land Use Element, which
establishes the location, type, intensity and distribution of land uses throughout the City, and defines the
land use build-out potential. In designating residential development, the Land Use Element places an
upper limit on the number and types of housing units constructed in the City. The acreage designated for
a range of commercial and office uses creates employment opportunities for various income groups. The
presence and potential for jobs affects the current and future demand for housing at the various income
levels in the City.
The Circulation Element of the General Plan also affects the implementation of the Housing Element.
The Circulation Element establishes policies for a balanced circulation system in the City. The element
also provides policies for essential infrastructure to all developed housing units along with mitigating the
effects of growth in the City.
The Housing Element utilizes the most current data available, and includes 2012 California Department
of Finance data when possible and 2010 Census data. All figures represented in the Housing Element are

                                                                                            City of Perris
                                                                                             General Plan
consistent with existing and projected population, employment and housing figures presented by county,
State, national and non-profit agencies.
The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan elements,
and the policies and programs in this Element are consistent with the policy direction contained in other
parts of the General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the Housing
Element will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
F.       HOUSING ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
This 2014-2021 Housing Element updates the Housing Element amended by the City in 2010 and was
found by HCD to be in compliance with established criteria. The Housing Element is designed to meet
several key objectives. These include provisions to: ensure internal consistency with the recently adopted
General Plan; meet recently enacted statutory requirements; introduce updated housing, population and
needs analysis; and incorporate the suggested staff responses to HCD comments.
The Housing Element sets forth housing goals and policies for Perris to address the City’s existing and
projected housing needs. Specific housing programs to implement these goals and policies are identified
in the Housing Program section of the updated document. The updated Perris Housing Element is
comprised of the following major components:
       Preparation of a Housing Plan to address Perris' identified housing needs, including housing goals,
        policies and programs;
       An analysis of the City's population, household and employment base, and the characteristics of
        the City's housing stock;
       An updated evaluation of housing need, including the housing needs of very low-income
        households and the disabled;
       An examination of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the production,
        maintenance, and affordability of housing;
       Preparation of an inventory of potential housing sites in the community; and
       An assessment of past housing accomplishments.

II. HOUSING PLAN
The Housing Plan includes goals, policies, and programs related to housing and are presented in this
section. The policies are established to guide the development, redevelopment and preservation of a
balanced inventory of housing to meet the needs of present and future residents of the City. It is a goal of
the City to ensure that all residents have decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing regardless of
income. This statement guides the City’s actions with respect to housing. The specific goals, policies and
actions detailed in this section provide the framework for the City’s overall housing program. Specific
policies and actions included in this element are intended to provide a wide variety of programs and tools
to implement the City’s General Plan goals. Actual programs will be implemented at the discretion of the
City in order to meet established objectives.
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address Perris’ identified housing needs and are
implemented through a series of actions and programs. Housing programs define the specific actions the
City will take to achieve specific goals and policies. The action plan includes both programs currently in
operation and new activities which have been added to address the City’s unmet housing needs. It should
be noted that the listing of a particular funding source of a particular program and/or action does not
denote that it has been allocated or appropriated as a source of funding for such a program and/or action.
  Goal 1: Promote and maintain a variety of housing types for all economic segments of the City.
Policy 1.1:      Continue to support non-profit and for-profit organizations in their efforts to construct,
                 acquire, and improve housing to accommodate households with lower and moderate
                 incomes.
Policy 1.2:      Promote development within specific plans that provide a variety of housing types and
                 densities based on the suitability of the land, including the availability of infrastructure,
                 the provision of adequate services and recognition of environmental constraints.
Policy 1.3:      Avoid concentrating housing constructed expressly for lower income households in any
                 single portion of any planning area.
Policy 1.4:      Locate higher density residential development in close proximity to public
                 transportation, services and recreation.
Policy 1.5:      Promote construction of units consistent with the new construction needs identified in
                 the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
Actions and Programs
Action 1.1:      Review and update the General Plan periodically (if an update is needed) to ensure that
                 growth trends are addressed.

              by specific plans, around the downtown and throughout the City. Focus development
              activity within the Downtown Specific Plan area where suitably zoned underutilized
              land and the potential for mixed-use projects exists for the development of affordable
              housing.

Action 1.12      To encourage the development of residential and mixed-use projects within the
                 Downtown Specific Plan area, the City will offer incentives such as a reduction in
                 development standards (i.e. lot size, parking, and open space requirements) and with
                 assistance from the Perris Housing Authority, subsidize a portion of development fees to
                 encourage lot consolidation and to promote more intense residential and mixed-use
                 development on vacant and underutilized sites within the Downtown Specific Plan area.
                 While the City is more than able to accommodate the remaining RHNA allocation for
                 the planning period on sites larger than one acre, this program allows for the City to
                 begin planning for the future by encouraging property owners to consolidate adjacent
                 properties to develop larger projects.

            including lower income households, large families, single parent households, the
            disabled, senior citizens and shelter for the homeless.

                 disabilities or are adaptable for conversion to residential use by persons with disabilities.
Policy 2.2:      Work with non-profit agencies and private sector developers to encourage the
                 development of senior housing.

Action 2.9:   Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583, the City of Perris is obligated to remove
              potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or
              development of housing for all income levels and for persons with disabilities. To address
              the needs of this population, the City amended the Zoning Code to adopt formal
              reasonable accommodation procedures. Reasonable accommodation provides a basis for
              residents with disabilities to request flexibility in the application of land use and zoning
              regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions or requirements
              from the local government to ensure equal access to housing opportunities. The City will
              provide information regarding the City’s reasonable accommodation ordinance and make
              information on the program more widely available to residents.

Action 2.11   To facilitate development of affordable housing to accommodate the 1,707 lower-income
              RHNA, the City adopted the Downtown Specific Plan in 2012 and identified
              approximately 95 acres of underutilized and vacant land. The Downtown Specific Plan
              utilizes a form based approach to regulate land uses. This form based Regulating Code
              focuses attention on the form, placement, and appropriate use of buildings (i.e. mass,
              height, site lay out) rather than traditional development standards such as minimum and
              maximum densities. Its design standards and guidelines promote an attractive and
              pedestrian-oriented environment.
              To demonstrate adequate sites for the City’s 4th cycle housing element update, the City
              included an adequate sites program (Action 2.11) to rezone sites within the Downtown
              Specific Plan for higher density residential uses. As these sites were to be rezoned to
              accommodate the City’s lower-income need the rezoned sites were required to be
              consistent with Sections 65583.2(h) and (i) and 65583(c)(1) (AB 2348) as follows:
                      Require a minimum density of 20 units per acre;
                      Ensure at least 50 percent of the lower-income need accommodated on sites
                       designated for residential use only; and
                      Permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily uses by-right, without a
                       conditional use or other discretionary review or approval.
              While sites were rezoned, not all of statutory requirements of the adequate sites
              program requirements were addressed. To comply with AB 2348, at least 50 percent of
              the remaining lower income need (854 units) will be accommodated on sites designated
              for exclusively residential uses allowing a minimum 20 dwelling units per acre. To
              address this requirement the City has identified approximately 45 acres within the
              Urban Village district which can accommodate approximately 1,575 units and will be
              zoned exclusively for residential uses as identified in Appendix A, Map 4.
              To address minimum density requirements the City will ensure sites A through L, as
              identified in Section VII Housing Resources, as well as exclusively residential Urban
              Village district sites identified in Map 4 of Appendix A, are developed at a minimum
              density of 20 units per acre. If a parcel is developed at less than 20 units per acre,
              pursuant to Government Code Section 56863, the City will immediately identify and
              zone an alternative site with established minimum density requirements consistent with
              GC Section 65583.2(h) and (i). The City will report on the progress of development in
              the Downtown Specific Plan area in its annual progress reports required pursuant to
              Government Code Section 65400 and due on April 1st of each year. The inventory of
              available sites will also be made available to the development community through
              various outreach methods.

            development of affordable housing, where appropriate and legally possible.
Policy 3.1:      When feasible, consider reducing, subsidizing, or deferring development fees to facilitate
                 the provision of affordable housing.
Policy 3.2:      Periodically review and revise City development standards to facilitate quality housing
                 that is affordable to lower and moderate income households.
Policy 3.3:      Monitor all regulations, ordinances, departmental processing procedures and fees related
                 to the rehabilitation and/or construction of dwelling units to assess their impact on
                 housing costs.

                 new construction or rehabilitation of housing for lower and moderate-income
                 households and seniors. Expedited permit processing would allow complete
                 development applications to be reviewed at an accelerated rate by City Staff in order to
                 ensure that permit processing times do not create a potential constraint on the
                 development of affordable units by adding to the overall cost of the project.

Action 3.2:      Extremely low-income households and households with special needs have limited
                 housing options. Housing types appropriate for these groups include transitional and
                 supportive housing. To accommodate this population and comply with Senate Bill 2, the
                 City amended Zoning Code Chapters 19.21 through 19.28, R-20,000 through MFR-22
                 and Section 19.34, R-5 Districts (Mobilehome Subdivisions), to allow transitional and
                 supportive housing as a permitted use without a conditional use permit or other
                 discretionary permit, subject only to those regulations that apply to other residential
                 uses of the same type in the same zone. To ensure consistency with the Perris Valley
                 Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, areas designated Airport Area I and II and within
                 Compatibility Zones A, B1, B2 and C of the Airport Influence Area as mapped at
                 www.rcaluc.org, will allow transitional and supportive housing subject to all applicable
                 restrictions places on other residential uses permitted within those areas. The City will
                 continue to monitor the inventory of sites appropriate to accommodate transitional and
                 supportive housing and will work with the appropriate organizations to ensure the
                 needs of extremely low-income residents are met. The City is committed to prioritizing

                 correct housing deficiencies, bring substandard units into compliance with City codes,
                 and improve overall housing conditions in Perris.
Policy 5.2:      Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents of the importance of
                 property maintenance to long term housing quality.
Policy 5.3:      Encourage compatible design of new residential units to minimize the impact of
                 intensified reuse of residential land on existing residential development.
Policy 5.4:      Using State HOME to funds to create plans and programs to maintain or improve the
                 character and quality of existing housing and housing environments.
Policy 5.5:      Preserve units affordable to lower and moderate-income households which are “at-risk”
                 of converting to market rate through County, State, and Federal funding mechanisms.
Actions and Programs:
Action 5.1:      As a means of further leveraging housing assistance, the City will cooperate with the
                 Riverside County Housing Authority to promote resident awareness and application for
                 County-run housing assistance programs. These programs include:
                     Home Improvement Program
                     Rental Rehabilitation Program
                     Enhanced Senior Home Repair Program
                     Department of Community Action (DCA) Utilities and Weatherization Program
                 The County offers a variety of housing assistance programs that can supplement the
                 City’s current housing programs. As the City has little control over how the County’s
                 programs are administered the City will be responsible for providing program
                 information on the City’s website, in the City’s newsletter and at City Hall.

Policy 7.1:      Encourage and support the enforcement of laws and regulations prohibiting
                 discrimination in lending practices and in the sale of housing.
Actions and Programs
Action 7.1:      The City, in conjunction with the Riverside County Fair Housing Council, shall support
                 efforts dedicated to working towards the elimination of the discrimination of housing by
                 actively pursuing any complaints of housing discrimination within the City. Information
                 detailing fair housing practices will be made available at City Hall and on the City’s
                 website. Additionally, the City will participate with the Riverside County Fair Housing
                 Council to conduct workshops and seminars about landlord and tenant responsibilities
                 and rights.

                 Potential Funding Source: CDBG
Action 7.2:      The housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities are typically not addressed
                 by Title 24 Regulations, and requires in addition to basic affordability, slight
                 modifications to existing units, and in some instances, a varying range of supportive
                 housing facilities. To accommodate residents with developmental disabilities, the City
                 will seek State and Federal monies, as funding becomes available, in support of housing
                 construction and rehabilitation targeted for persons with developmental disabilities.
                 Perris will also provide regulatory incentives, such as expedited permit processing, and
                 fee waivers and deferrals, to projects targeted for persons with developmental
                 disabilities. To further facilitate the development of units to accommodate persons with
                 developmental disabilities, the City shall reach out annually to developers of supportive
                 housing to encourage development of projects targeted for special needs groups. Finally,
                 as housing is developed or identified, Perris will work with the Inland Regional Center
                 to implement an outreach program informing families within the City of housing and
                 services available for persons with developmental disabilities. Information will be made
                 available on the City’s website.

III. QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
State Housing Law requires that each jurisdiction establish the number of housing units that will be
constructed, rehabilitated, and preserved over the planning period. The Quantified Objectives for the
Housing Element reflect the planning period from January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2021.
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is mandated by State Housing Law as part of the
period process of updating local housing elements of the General Plan. The RHNA quantifies the need for
housing within each jurisdiction during specified planning periods. The current planning period is from
January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2021. Communities use the RHNA in land use planning, prioritizing local
resource allocation, and in deciding how to address identified existing and future housing needs resulting
from population, employment, and household growth. The RHNA does not necessarily encourage or
promote growth, but rather allows communities to anticipate growth, so that collectively the region and
sub-region can grow in ways that enhance quality of life, improve access to jobs, promote transportation
mobility, and addresses social equity and fair share housing needs.
The RHNA consists of two measurements of housing need: existing and future needs.
     1.  Existing Needs: The existing needs assessment simply examines key variables from the most
         recent Census to measure ways in which the housing market is not meeting the needs of current
         residents. These variables include the number of low-income households paying more than 30%
         of their income for housing, as well as severe overcrowding, farmworker needs, and housing
         preservation needs.
     2. Future Needs: The future need for housing is determined primarily by the forecasted growth of
         housing in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving out of a parent’s home,
         by a family moving to a community for employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing
         unit. The anticipated housing needed for new households is then adjusted to account for an ideal
         level of vacancy needed to promote housing choice, a moderate cost increase, to avoid the
         concentration of lower income households, and to provide for replacement housing.
It is important to note that while the Quantified Objectives of the RHNA are required to be part of the
Housing Element and the City will strive to obtain these objectives, Perris cannot guarantee that these
needs will be met given the limited financial and staff resources, and the increasing gap in affordability of
housing resources and incomes. Satisfaction of the City’s regional housing needs will partially depend on
the cooperation of private funding sources and resources of the State, federal and county programs that
are used to support the needs of the extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
Additionally, outside economic forces heavily influence the housing market. State law recognizes that a
locality may not be able to accommodate its regional fair share housing need.
Table III-I shows the City’s total quantified objectives for the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle.
The Quantified Objectives assume optimum conditions for the production of housing. However,
environmental, physical and market conditions influences the timing, type and cost of housing
production in a community. Below is an estimate quantified objectives for the number of housing units,
broken down by income category, over the 2014-2021 planning period.

 Notes:
 (a) Construction objectives represent the City’s remaining RHNA.
 (b) Any CDBG funding received during the planning period will be used to fund projects that improve and maintain the quality of the City’s
     housing stock and residential infrastructure. The rehabilitation objective is consistent with Action 1.3 of the City’s Housing Plan.
 (c) The City will continue to work with the Riverside County Housing Authority, which provides Section 8 assistance for very low income
     rental households. The City will inform local rental property owners and eligible residents of Section 8 assistance when available. The
     conservation/preservation objective is consistent with the City’s total count of affordable units that are permanent but could potentially
     be at-risk units (see Table V-9).

IV. COMMUNITY PROFILE
Incorporated in 1911, the City of Perris is located in southwest Riverside County, approximately 80 miles
southeast of Los Angeles and approximately 80 miles northeast of San Diego, on the Inland Route of the
215 Freeway.
The housing needs of the City are determined by demographic characteristics of the population (age,
household size, employment, ethnicity), and the characteristics of housing (number of units, tenure, size,
cost). The local housing market is seldom static, constantly changing with dynamic social and economic
factors. As City demographics and household socio-economic conditions change, different housing
opportunities arise and/or must be created to meet the demand. This section explores the characteristics
of the existing and projected population and housing stock in order to define the extent of unmet
housing needs in Perris. This information helps to provide direction in updating the City's Housing
Element goals, policies, programs, and actions.
A.       DATA SOURCES
Data sources used in this needs assessment include the U.S. Census (2000 and 2010 Censuses), California
Department of Finance (DOF) 2012 Population and Housing Estimates, and various other sources. For
demographic data, estimates are used to show changes in conditions since the 2010 U.S. Census. Many of
these estimates (such as data from the California Department of Finance) are shown solely as
percentages, as the raw numbers carry a significant margin of error, especially for smaller geographies
such as counties or cities. Nonetheless, the percentages presented give a general indication of population
and employment trends.
Additional information has been drawn from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS), which is drawn from U.S. Census Bureau 2005 – 2009 American Community Survey data.
CHAS data is based on special tabulations for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) from sample Census data. Thus, the number of households in each category often deviates
slightly from the 100% count due to extrapolations to the total household level. Because of this,
interpretations of CHAS data should focus on proportions and percentages, rather than on precise
numbers.
Data contained in tables in this Needs Assessment are derived primarily from three Census data sources:
2010 Demographic Profile Data, 2010 Census Summary File 1 (SF-1) and 2010 Summary File 2 (SF-2). The
2010 Demographic Profile Data has 100-percent data asked of all people about every housing unit. 2010
Census Summary File 1 contains counts and basic cross tabulations of information collected from all
people and housing units. Finally, 2010 Summary File 2 (SF 2) contains population and housing
characteristics iterated for many detailed race and Hispanic or Latino categories, and American Indian
and Alaska Native Tribes. Therefore, differences are likely to exist between the characteristics of the
sampled population and the larger group from which the sample was chosen. As a result, tables using SF-
1 data and Demographic profile data are likely to have different population and housing totals than tables
using SF-2 data.
B.       HOUSING NEEDS SUMMARY
Table IV-1 below summarizes the housing assistance needs of all households (categorized by income
percentage of the Riverside County Median Family Income1) in Perris by household tenure
(renter/owner), household type, and “housing problems.” This count of households with “housing

problems” includes those who: 1) occupy units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or
bathroom); 2) live in overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room); 3)
have a housing cost burden exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or 4) have a severe housing cost
burden exceeding 50 percent of gross income.

According to the CHAS Databook, nearly 61 percent of all households in the City of Perris experienced
some form of housing problem. The percentage of total households that experienced some type of
housing problem was greater among renters than owners. This is because there are more single-family
homes than multi-family units in the City. The statistics as identified in Table IV-1 indicate that housing
cost burden is a contributing factor to housing problems.
C.                   POPULATION TRENDS AND CHARACTERISTICS
According to the 2010 Census, the population of Perris was 68,386 persons. In 2012, the DOF estimated a
population of 70,180 persons, a one percent increase from the 2010 Census total. The population is almost
evenly divided between male and female residents (50 percent and 51 percent, respectively). 2
Like many cities in the Inland Empire, Perris has seen significant population growth in the past 20 years
and will continue to grow as jobs and housing opportunities continue to expand at greater pace and at a
more affordable level than communities elsewhere in southern California. The Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) indicates that by 2025, one in four SCAG residents will live in the
Inland Empire compared to one in ten Southland residents who lived in the inland valleys and desert
areas in the 1950s.3

Future growth estimates predict a continued increase in population, yet at a slower rate, over the next 20
years. The Riverside County Center for Demographic Research estimates that the population of Perris
will top 84,881 by the year 2030; a population increase of 35 percent between 2010 and 2030.
Age Composition
The age structure of a population is an important factor in evaluating housing needs. The traditional
assumption is that in many communities young adults tend to prefer apartments, low- to moderate-cost
condominiums, and smaller or more affordable single-family units, while mature adults provide the
market for moderate- to high-end condominiums and single-family homes. The senior population (65
years and older) tend to generate demand for low- to moderate-cost apartments and condominiums,
community residential settings, and mobile homes.
Riverside County as a whole can be characterized as having a young population (33.7 years in 2010). 4
Perris is representative of this characteristic with a median age of 25.9 years in 2010. In Perris, preschool
and school age residents comprised nearly half (40.8 percent) of the population in 2010. Young adults
between the ages of 25 and 44 comprised 37.2 percent of the population. Residents 65 years and older
make up less than 5 percent of the total population, and the proportion of adults between 45 and
64 years of age is 17.2 percent. Currently, the majority of the population in Perris is younger (ages 0-44)
at 75.8 percent.

Ethnicity
In 2010, the majority of residents in Perris were Hispanic; constituting 71.8 percent of the population.
This population characteristic demonstrates the demographic shifts that have occurred in Perris over the
past 15 to 20 years. In 1990, non-Hispanic white residents comprised nearly three-quarters of the
population. Since then, as the Hispanic population has increased, while the non-Hispanic white
population has remained the same.
The ethnic composition of a community affects housing needs due to the unique household
characteristics and preferences of different groups. In 2010, the average household size in Perris was 4.16
persons per household. Hispanic or Latino (of any race) households had a larger average household size
of 4.69 persons per household, which indicates a potential increase in demand for larger housing units as
the Hispanic population continues to grow.

D.         EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
Employment and income are two important factors in determining a household’s ability to secure
housing. The civilian labor force of Perris was estimated to be 20,100 civilians in 2010, up from 14,750
civilians in 2005.5
Perris residents are employed in diverse industries, with the largest percent of the population employed
in educational services. The second most common sector is retail trade, with nearly 14 percent of the
residents employed in the industry. The manufacturing industry ranks third, with 12.4 percent. The retail
sector is important to consider when assessing housing affordability as salaries tend to be lower, which
decreases the amount of income available for housing. The retail sector also generally does not offer
health and other employment benefits, further increasing economic strain.

An analysis of the “jobs-housing balance” is a general measure of a community’s employment
opportunities with respect to its residents’ housing needs. Ideally, a balanced community would reach
equilibrium between employment and housing opportunities allowing residents to work and live in close
proximity. In 2010, there were an estimated 17,906 total housing units in the City, compared to an
estimated 13,044 jobs; indicating a jobs-housing ratio of 0.73. This ratio demonstrates a favorable balance
between employment and housing opportunities in the City, although there is no guarantee that
residents living in the City are employed at local businesses.

The implications of this are twofold: the City should continue to promote the provision/establishment of
employment opportunities suited to the occupational characteristics of the resident population; and the

City should maintain efforts to promote the construction of housing units with amenities and price
ranges attractive to persons employed in the City.
E.       HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Before current housing problems can be understood and future needs anticipated, housing occupancy
characteristics need to be identified in the City. The following is an analysis of household types and sizes,
income levels, presence of persons with special needs, and other household characteristics that may affect
access and demand for housing and housing programs. This section details the various household
characteristics in Perris.
Household Formation and Composition
A household is defined by the Census as all persons occupying a housing unit. Families are a subset of
households and include all persons living together who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Single
households include persons living alone in housing units, but do not include persons in group quarters
such as convalescent homes or dormitories. Other households are unrelated people living together, such
as roommates.
In 2010, the U.S. Census estimated that the City of Perris had 17,906 households. The distribution of
households as indicated by 2010 Census data show that the majority of households in Perris are families
(87.7 percent).
Household composition and size are often two interrelated factors. Communities with a large proportion
of families with children tend to have a large average household size. Such communities have a greater
need for larger units with adequate open space and recreational opportunities for children. Household
size in Perris remains higher than that of Riverside County. The City of Perris household size was 4.16
persons according to the 2010 Census, as compared to the County average household size of 3.14 persons.
Table IV-9 describes household size by renter and owner. Based on 2010 data, it appears that among both
renters and owners, there is a need especially for units with two and three bedrooms to accommodate the
majority of households with two to four persons. The Census also shows a significant number of
households with five or more persons, whose needs are best met by units with three or more bedrooms.

Household Income
According to the 2010 American Community Survey, the 2010 median household income for Riverside
County was $54,296. The median income for the Los Angeles County was slightly higher at $55,576, and
the median income for Orange County was $74,344. Household income estimates for Perris (2010
Census) by total households/families are found in Table IV-10. The 2010 Census estimates indicate that
the City experienced lower household and family median incomes of $45,251 and $43,460 respectively,
than the 2010 Riverside County medians of $54,296 and $60,573 respectively.

Lower income households may require housing with rents or payments lower than market rates. Often,
payment assistance is needed from local, state, or federal government agencies to assist these households
in securing adequate housing. The City will continue to utilize available programs administered through
the County and in conjunction with non-profit organizations to provide residents with affordable
housing.
The 2010 Census indicates the median household income in the City is $45,251, and that the distribution
of income has changed since 2000. In 2010, it is estimated that: 13.4 percent of households earned less
than $14,999 annually; 19.6 percent earned between $15,000 and $34,999 annually; 21.3 percent earned
between $35,000 and $49,999 annually; 20.2 percent earned between $50,000 and $74,999 annually; and
25.4 percent earned above $75,000 annually.
One measure of Perris’ socio-economic well-being is the number and proportion of its residents living
below federally established poverty levels. The 2010 Census reports that 29.1 percent of total persons in
Perris were below the poverty level. Poverty is calculated by the Census Bureau based on annual income
thresholds determined by the size of the family and age of members in the family. If the total family
income is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the family is considered in poverty.
F.      HOUSING INVENTORY AND MARKET CONDITIONS
This section summarizes the housing inventory in the City of Perris and prevailing market conditions.
Analysis of past trends in the housing stock provides a method of projecting the future housing needs of
Perris.
Housing Stock Profile
Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Finance indicate that the housing stock in the
City increased by 69.7 percent between 2000 and 2010. In contrast, housing stock in Riverside County
increased 36.9 percent, while other local jurisdictions and adjacent unincorporated areas of Riverside
increased their housing stock by anywhere from 20 percent (Hemet) to 34 percent (Moreno Valley).
Table IV-11 depicts projected trends in population growth compared to housing growth in Perris through
2035.

As Table IV-11 suggests, the construction of housing units will keep pace with population in the future.
The ratio of population to housing units has already increased from 3.42 persons per housing unit in 2000
to 3.82 persons per housing unit in 2010. By 2035, the ratio of persons per housing unit will drop down to
3.28 persons per housing unit.
Table IV-12 indicates that numerically, the number of Perris housing units increased by 7,353 units, or
69.7 percent between 2000 and 2010. In comparison to other jurisdictions in the region, the City’s
housing growth rate was quite substantial. The percent change of total units constructed in Perris is
greater than any other cities in the region.

Table IV-13 describes housing occupancy by tenure and housing type in 2010. Nearly 66 percent of the
total occupied housing units were owner-occupied; the remaining 34 percent of the occupied housing
stock were renter-occupied. It is apparent that 39 percent of all units in the City contain four or more
bedrooms, while 55 percent are two or three bedroom and 5 percent are one bedroom or studios. The
majority of rental units are comprised of two and three bedroom units. Despite the apparent availability
of units, it is important to determine whether local levels of housing are keeping pace with the special
needs and affordability characteristics of the overall demand.

An evaluation of the adequacy of a community’s housing stock needs to consider the type and size of
housing provided to meet the specific needs of the community, as well as the affordability of these units.
As shown previously in Table IV-9, 34.5 percent of owner-occupied households were comprised of three
to four persons, while 39.6 percent were large households with five or more persons. For renter-occupied
households the percentage of households with three or more persons was higher. Renter-occupied
households with three to four persons per household were 36.1 percent, while 41.7 percent were renter-
occupied households with five or more persons. Based on the data below, the City’s housing stock
appears to provide a sufficient amount of housing units with three or more bedrooms to meet the demand
generated by larger families. However, the majority (83 percent) of these units is ownership units, and
may be financially unattainable for many large households.
Housing Stock
According to the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau, there were 15,621 housing units in the City. Table IV-14
summarizes the City and Riverside County composition of the housing stock for the years 2000 and 2012.

 Single-family detached units comprised an estimated 76 percent of housing units in 2012. Mobile home
 units, typically classified separately from single-family detached units, provided the second most
 available housing opportunity, with 9 percent of total units. Apartment complexes with five or more
 units constituted 8 percent of total units in 2012, providing the majority of the multi-family housing in
 the City. Single-family attached and other multi-family housing (2-4 units) round out the City’s housing
 stock making up 5 percent of total units in the City.
 Census data shows that between 2000 and 2012 the construction of detached single-family units
 increased significantly with 6,849 new homes added to the housing stock. The number of larger multi-
 family developments with 5 or more units also increased substantially with 489 additions. In addition
 there were 270 duplexes and smaller multi-family housing (2-4 units) constructed and 32 mobile homes
 added to the City’s housing stock between 2000 and 2012. Prior to 2008, new construction in the City
 was predominantly single family ownership units. Since the housing stock in City of Perris is primarily
 single family homes, during the 2008–2013 planning period the City placed emphasis on the need to offer
 a range of housing types to serve low and moderate income households and senior citizens. The City will
 continue to pursue creation of more affordable rental options for those households financially unable to
 purchase homes by providing incentives to developers to construct affordable high-density rental units,

Tenure
At the time of the 2010 Census, the majority of occupied housing units in Perris were owner-occupied.
Most owner-occupied units were single-family detached, with over 90 percent of the City’s housing
stock falling into this classification. Five percent of all units are comprised of owners occupying mobile
home units. Twenty-two percent of all housing stock is comprised of multi-family units, with less than
one percent of these units under ownership status. Table IV-15 identifies occupied housing units by
tenure in 2010.

While overall homeownership has continued to increase across the nation, the relative pace in California
was slower than the rate of increase at the national level. The homeownership rate in California was 11
percent below the national average in 2011. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, overall
homeownership within the State was approximately 55.3 percent in 2011.
As of 2010, the homeownership rate in the Greater Los Angeles region, including Riverside County, was
the lowest in the State (48 percent), a result of the extremely high cost of housing in southern
California.6 In comparison the region, the homeownership rate in Perris was reported by the 2010
Census, to be 66 percent, which was greater than the State, equal to the national rate. This may be
related in part to that the affordability of housing units in Riverside County as compared to home prices
in neighboring Los Angeles and Orange Counties. Despite its high ownership rate, a challenge for the
City during this and coming planning periods will be to increase homeownership for lower income
segments of the population.
Vacancy Rates
The vacancy rate is a measure of the general availability of housing. It also indicates how well the
available units meet the current housing market demand. A low vacancy rate suggests that households
may have difficulty finding housing within their price range due to a limited supply of available housing;
a high vacancy rate may indicate either the existence of a high number of units undesirable for
occupancy, or an oversupply of housing units. The availability of vacant housing units provides
households with choices on different unit types to accommodate changing needs (i.e., single persons,

newly married couples, and elderly households typically need smaller units than households with school
age children). A low vacancy rate may serve to increase market rents and housing prices, as shortages
tend to result in higher prices and may limit the choices of households in finding adequate housing. It
may also be related to overcrowding, as discussed in later sections.
A vacancy rate between two percent and three percent for ownership housing and five percent to six
percent for rental housing is considered a “healthy” vacancy rate, so that it ensures the continued upkeep
of rental properties and keeps housing costs down. The 2010 Census indicated a vacancy rate of 3.8
percent for ownership housing and 9.5 percent for renter housing for the City of Perris, which is slightly
higher than what is considered “healthy.”
Age of Housing Stock
Most of the City’s current housing stock was constructed between 1980 and 2007. More than 80 percent
of all housing units in the City were constructed between 1980 and 2007, with nearly 58 percent of all
units built after 1990. Table IV-16 shows the age of housing units in the City of Perris.

Age is one measure of housing stock condition and a key factor for determining the need, if any, for
rehabilitation programs. Without proper maintenance, housing units deteriorate over time. Units that
are older are likely to be in need of repairs (e.g. a new roof or plumbing). As a general rule, houses 40
years or older are considered aged and are more likely to generate major repairs. In addition, older homes
may not be built to current housing standards for fire and earthquake safety.
Housing Conditions
Housing is considered substandard when physical conditions are determined to be below the minimum
standards of living, as defined by Section 1001 of the Uniform Housing Code. Households living in

substandard conditions are considered as being in need of housing assistance even if they are not actively
seeking alternative housing arrangements.
Although a housing conditions survey has not been conducted in recent years, the majority of known
substandard units and the units needing repair or replacement can be estimated by the number of
housing units built before 1960. A total of 574 housing units, (4 percent), were constructed prior to 1960.
In addition to housing code standards and structural deficiency, the lack of certain infrastructure and
utilities often serves as an indicator of substandard conditions. According to the 2010 American
Community Survey, there were 61 units lacking complete plumbing facilities, and 258 units lacking
complete kitchen facilities.
Rooms per Unit
Table IV-17 shows the number of bedrooms per unit by tenure, ranging from studio units to units with
four or more bedrooms. Rental units include traditional apartment communities, as well as single-family
homes offered for rent by the owner. The largest proportion of rental units, nearly 37 percent, is two
bedroom units, followed by three bedroom units at 27 percent. Of the total number of rental units, there
appears to be a variety of options for both small and large families, as evidenced in the distribution of
bedroom sizes available. A large proportion of rental units in the City (84 percent) had two or more
bedrooms at the time of the 2010 Census. These units are an appropriate size to meet the demand of
larger families.

The distribution of bedrooms among owner-occupied units indicates an abundance of homes with more
than three bedrooms. Roughly 42 percent of owner-occupied units had three bedrooms, while nearly 50
percent had four or more bedrooms. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates there was a lack of
smaller units among owner occupied individuals. Among the total housing stock, larger homes with four
or more bedrooms increased in the City from the previous planning period. The number of four bedroom
owner-occupied units increased from 245 units in 2000 to 5,050 units in 2010. Overall, the distribution of
bedrooms in Perris is favorable for standard and large families seeking either rental units or home
purchase opportunities. Generally, the City will facilitate the development of programs that will

Table IV-18 lists the value of housing units in the City in 2010. The 2010 Census documents a median
housing unit value of $156,000 in Perris, which is $71,900 below the 2010 County median of $227,900. The
values indicate that 14.8 percent of the houses were valued at less than $100,000; 29.9 percent were
valued between $100,000 and $150,000, 30.5 percent were valued between $150,000 and $200,000, while
24.8 percent were priced at $200,000 and above at the time of the 2010 Census. The majority of units in
2010 were valued between $100,000 and $199,999.

Since 2010, the median home prices in Perris have slightly decreased. According to the Riverside County
Center for Demographic Research, the median home value in 2011 was $143,000. The drop in the real
estate market in 2007 has decreased home prices throughout Riverside County. In Perris, median home
prices fell from $400,000 in August 2006 to $335,750 in August 2007, a 16 percent decrease. 7 Since

Existing and New Home Price Trends
When looking at housing value, the 2010 Census is useful because it provides a breakdown of price
ranges, as well as units within each price range. Contemporary data is also available through countywide
surveys gathered by private data firms, as published in local media. Based on an August 2011 survey by
DataQuick, the median home price in Perris was listed as $143,000, which is a price decrease of $17,000
from 2010. In comparison, in 2010 Riverside County’s median home price was reported at $200,000 up
$13,000 from 2010.
Table IV-20 offers representative housing prices for communities in Perris. Based on information
available, it appears the range of prices for housing is above the median housing price in the City.

includes your principal, interest, real estate taxes, hazard insurance, association dues or fees and principal mortgage insurance
(PMI). Maximum monthly payment (PITI) is calculated by taking the lower of these two calculations:
                    1. Monthly Income X 28% = monthly PITI
                    2. Monthly Income X 36% - Other loan payments = monthly PITI

According to information released by DataQuick, in October 2011, the median price for single-family
residential homes in Perris has dropped to $143,000. Following the large increase in housing prices from
2000 to 2007 the Perris housing market has been significantly affected by the housing market collapse
and economic downturn of 2008-2011. According to DataQuick, from 2007 to 2008, median home price
decreased from $358,500 to $145,477. From 2008 to 2009 the average sale price slightly increased from
$145,477 to $195,000. Between 2009 and 2011 the average median housing prices continued to decline to
$143,000. These figures have decreased enough that they are affordable to moderate-income households,
who are more likely than low- and very low-income households to have a down payment available

Housing Affordability Gap Analysis
HUD defines affordable housing costs as contract rents or mortgage payments, including taxes and
insurance, but not utilities, that are equal to or less than 30 percent of the gross income of very low-, low,
and moderate-income households.
Households spending more than 30 percent of gross annual income on housing experience a housing cost
burden, which occurs when housing costs increase faster than household income. When a household
spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs, it has less disposable income for other
necessities such as health care. Lower income households with a burdensome housing cost are more
likely to become homeless. Homeowners with a housing cost burden have the option of selling the homes
and becoming renters. Renters, on the other hand, are vulnerable and subject to constant changes in the
housing market.
Current housing affordability can be estimated for the various income groups as identified in Table IV-24
based on the 2012 Riverside County Area Median Income (AMI).

Table IV-24 identifies maximum affordable rents and purchase prices by income category for one person,
small family, four person family, and large family. Comparing housing costs and maximum affordable
prices for low-income households shows that many households are being priced out of the Riverside
County rental and ownership market. Given the median home prices presented in Table IV-18, median
home price in Perris was $156,000 in 2010, single-family home ownership is beyond the reach of all
extremely low-income households, very low-income households, and one- and two-person lower income
households.
Rental Analysis
According to the data in Table IV-24 and actual apartment rental rates, extremely low-income
households would not be able to afford rental apartments in the City given the current market trends in
the region. There are two-bedroom apartments for $525 and $543, affordable to very-low income
category. Therefore, two-bedroom apartments for $525 and three-bedroom apartments for $598 and $623
are affordable to very-low income. In 2010, in Perris, one and two bedroom units were priced at
approximately $767 per month. This rate exceeds the affordability range for most extremely low-income
and very low-income individuals. Therefore, rental prices only appear to be affordable to households in
the moderate-income and lower-income classifications.
HUD and HCD have established that a one bedroom unit is not acceptable for a four-person family. To
avoid overcrowded conditions (more than one person per habitable room), a family of four must find
housing with three rooms or more, generally making the Perris rental market challenging for extremely
low and very low-income families. Very low-income households have few rental options available to
them apart from boarding or sharing rental expenses with roommates, which could result in
overcrowded conditions.
Ownership Analysis
A comparison of the 2011 maximum affordable purchase price in Table IV-24 with actual housing prices
in the City reveal that homes are generally not affordable to lower income households, including
moderate-income households. When considering that affordability limits are based on a family of four,
and that HCD and HUD have suggested that more than one person per habitable room creates
overcrowding, this reduces the inventory of resale stock suitable for a larger family to two and three
bedroom units. In August 2012, the median price for a two bedroom house was $250,000. This is only
affordable to moderate income households based on the Riverside County median ($63,000). In recent
years, new housing construction has catered to above moderate-income households, as newer larger
homes, containing 2,500 square feet or more, are only affordable to those households earning higher
incomes. In the 2014-2021 planning period the City may need to focus housing programs to provide
homeownership opportunities (through down payment assistance, tax credits, etc.) for households with
incomes below the County median.

V. HOUSING NEEDS
The following is an analysis of current City housing conditions that presents the housing needs and
concerns relative to various segments of the population. Several factors will influence the degree of
demand, or "need," for new housing in Perris in coming years. The four major needs categories considered
in this element include:
       Housing needs resulting from population growth, both in the City and the surrounding region;
       Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units;
       Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can afford for housing; and
       Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as the elderly; persons with disabilities, including
        developmental disabilities; large families; farmworkers; families with female heads of households;
        and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
Demographic and market conditions analysis indicates that the number of households at the extreme
ends of the income spectrum will continue to grow, while the traditional middle income group will
decline in size leading to decreased participation in the housing market. It is apparent that first-time
homebuyer assistance will continue to be critical to allow low- and moderate-income households to
purchase homes. Lower income groups will need the most assistance to afford homes as prices continue
to increase. Although new homes are generally unattainable for lower income households, there are a
number of older existing homes that may be affordable to lower and moderate-income households. With
regard to rental opportunities, there appears to be a need for additional rental units that are larger (three
or more bedrooms) at rates affordable to lower income households.
A.       SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS SUMMARY
Table V-1 summarizes the housing assistance needs of lower income households (less than 80 percent of
AMI) for special needs groups in Perris by household tenure (renter/owner), household type (elderly,
small/large families), and “housing problems.” Households with “housing problems” includes those who:
1) occupy units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom); 2) live in overcrowded
conditions (housing units with more than one person per room); 3) have a housing cost burden
exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or 4) have a severe housing cost burden exceeding 50 percent of
gross income.

     problems were large family renter and owner households. Approximately 61 percent of renter and owner
     households experienced one or more housing problems. These percentages demonstrate that large family
     households are at the greatest need for assistance through housing programs.
     B.        EXISTING NEEDS
     State housing policy recognizes that cooperative participation between the private and public sectors is
     necessary to expand housing opportunities to all economic segments of the community. A primary State
     goal is the provision of decent housing and suitable living environment for Californians of all economic
     levels. Historically, the private sector responds to the majority of the community's housing needs through
     the production of market-rate housing. However, the percentage of the population on a statewide basis
     who can afford market rate housing is declining. In addition, there are other factors which affect a
     household or person’s ability to find adequate housing. Specifically, special needs groups, including: the
     elderly, persons with disabilities, including developmental disabilities, large families, female-headed

                                                                                             General Plan
households, homeless persons, and farmworkers typically experience a higher instance of housing
problems.
The following sections analyze the households in Perris that experience some type of problem in their
housing situation including overcrowding, overpayment, or a combination of both factors.
Overcrowding
In response to increasing home prices and rental rates, lower income households are typically forced to
live in smaller units that may not be appropriate in size to accommodate the number of members living in
the household. This may result in overcrowding which places a strain on physical facilities and over time
can have a negative effect on local neighborhoods.
The Census Bureau defines overcrowded housing units as “those in excess of one person per room
average.” Overcrowding is often reflective of one of three conditions:
     1.   Either a family or household is living in too small a dwelling;
     2. Familial household includes extended family members (i.e., grandparents or grown children and
          their families living with parents, termed doubling); or
     3. A family is renting living space to non-family members.
Whatever the cause, overcrowding is symptomatic of greater affordability issues. Some examples of lack
of affordability promoting overcrowded conditions include:
        Large households unable to afford larger dwellings that must then move into smaller than
         acceptable units;
        Older children wishing to leave home who are prohibited from doing so because they cannot
         qualify for a home loan and/or are unable to make rental payments; or
        Grandparents or elders on fixed incomes who are unable to afford housing suitable for their
         physical handicaps, and must often move in with their grown children or other family members.
In Perris, overcrowding occurs in 2,476 units, or 15.8 percent of all occupied households (15,671).
According to the 2010 American Community Survey estimates, this includes 1,321 owner households (12.8
percent of all 10,320 owners) and 1,155 renter households (21.6 percent of all 5,347 renters) living in
overcrowded conditions. Overall, overcrowded rental households constitute 7 percent of all households
in the City while overcrowded owner occupied households constitute 8 percent. It is anticipated that the
number of overcrowded households in the City may rise in coming years in response to regional housing
market pressures.
According to SCAG, low- and moderate-income households experience overcrowding at higher rates
than above moderate households. Specifically, very low-income (less than 50 percent of median income)
rental households experience the most overcrowding as well as low and moderate-income households
who own their home. Based on the actual number of households experiencing overcrowded conditions it
appears that lower and moderate-income owner occupied households are most substantially impacted.
In both instances, the cost for rent or purchase of a unit that is appropriate in size to accommodate all
household members without overcrowding the unit may exceed the resident’s ability to pay.

Overpayment
Consistent with HUD’s “threshold of overpayment” definition, the State Department of Housing and
Community Development has determined that, “affordable housing costs with respect to very low, low
and moderate-income households shall not exceed 30 percent of gross household income." (Health and
Safety Code, Section 50052.9). That is, when households must exceed 30% of their incomes for rent or
mortgage payments, they are left with insufficient funds for other necessities, such as food, health care,
clothing, and utilities. Specifically, high housing costs can eventually cause fixed-income, elderly and
lower income households to spend a disproportionate percentage of their income for housing.
Spending more than 30 percent of a household’s income for rent or mortgage may cause a series of related
financial problems, and can result in a deterioration of housing stock, as costs associated with
maintenance are delayed to afford more immediate expenses (e.g. food, clothing, medical care, and
utilities). Overpayment also promotes overcrowding, which leads to a variety of problems, from
accelerating the rate of deterioration, to children’s decreased performance in school, to code enforcement
issues. HUD recognizes, however, that above moderate income households are generally able to afford a
variety of housing options and are more capable of paying a larger proportion of their income for housing.
Therefore, housing overpayment estimates usually illustrate a burden on lower income groups.
Table V-2 uses Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) Databook to illustrate
overpayment by tenure. Generally, Table V-2 shows that of the 10,575 total households overpaying for
housing between 2005 and 2009, approximately 6,275 were lower income households.

In determining existing need for affordable housing it is necessary to relate income with housing costs
and rents. As discussed previously in the Housing Costs and Rents section, affordability is defined by
HUD as the expenditure of no more than 30 percent of the household income for housing costs using a
hypothetical family of four persons. Table V-3 lists the percentage of renters and homeowners spending
more than 30 percent of their monthly gross income on housing, as reported by the 2010 Census.

Table V-3, indicates that nearly 62 percent of all owner-occupied households and about 61 percent of all
renter-occupied households have housing costs that are at least or more than 30 percent of their gross
income.
There are, however, differences in how overpayment affects renter as compared to owner households.
Generally, homeowners can choose to allocate a higher percentage of their disposable monthly income
on housing costs, this allocation is justified as home ownership can be viewed as an investment
opportunity as well as a place to live. Younger owner households new to ownership may overextend
themselves financially to afford a home purchase, but maintain the option of selling the home, and may
realize tax benefits and/or appreciation in value. Overpayment among the moderate and above moderate-
income categories is not typically considered to be a significant housing issue. Renters, on the other
hand, are limited in their housing options, and are generally required to pay rents based on market
demand. The discrepancy between renter and owner households largely reflects the trend that renter
households have lower incomes and fewer options than their owner counterparts.
Special Needs Groups
State Housing Law requires that the special needs of certain disadvantaged groups be addressed. These
households typically experience difficulty in securing decent, affordable housing units. The needs of the
elderly, persons with disabilities, persons with developmental disabilities large families, female-headed
households, the homeless and farm workers are addressed below:
Elderly Persons
The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern in Perris. The City has a number of
retired residents that may be living on a fixed low income, and are at greater risk of impaction, or housing
overpayment. Additionally, the elderly may require housing units developed with specific access
allowances or in specific locations of the City to allow for greater mobility. Modifications that allow for
easier access may include: wheelchair ramps, handrails, lower cupboards and counters. With regard to
location, easy access to public facilities (i.e., medical and shopping), would be advantageous for those
experiencing mobility limitations. Finding reliable means of transportation to medical appointments,
senior centers, meal sites and shopping remains a serious problem for seniors. Many seniors lack private
transportation due to physical or financial limitations.
As reported in the 2010 census, there were 3,348 residents (4.9 percent of the total population), aged 65
years or older. The Census also shows that there were 2,292 owner-occupied households and 736 renter

households with occupants aged 65 or older. Table V-4 shows the number and percent of elderly persons
in Perris (65 and over) with mobility and/or self-care limitations, as reported by the 2010 Census. Either
or both of these conditions may indicate a need for supportive housing.

Approximately 28 percent of the elderly population is in need of either transportation or comprehensive
health care assistance. To the extent that some of this particular special needs group may also have
financial limitations, this Housing Element will describe policies and programs for their assistance.
Persons with Disabilities
Access and affordability are the two major housing needs of persons with disabilities. Access is
particularly important for the physically disabled. Persons with physical disabilities often require
specially designed dwellings to allow for easy access within the unit, as well as to and from the site.
California Administrative Code Title 24 sets forth access and adaptability requirements for the
physically disabled. These regulations apply to public buildings such as motels, employee housing,
factory built housing, and privately funded newly constructed apartment houses containing five or more
dwelling units. The regulations also require that ramp-ways, larger door widths, restroom modifications,
etc., be designed to enable free access for the handicapped. Such standards, however, are not mandatory
for new single-family residential construction.
The disabled, like the elderly, have special needs with regard to location. There is typically an advantage
for the disabled to be located near public facilities, specifically public transportation facilities.
Table V-5 shows that 3,673 persons 18 years and older in the City of Perris had a disability. A self-care
disability does not necessarily translate into a need for modified housing units; therefore it may be
difficult to estimate the number of persons with disabilities in need of housing. Of the total number of
persons with disabilities, 1,557 had a disability that either prevented them from working or made it
difficult to work. Sixty-six percent of persons with disabilities had a disability that hindered their
mobility. This figure suggests that a number of persons with disabilities rely on public transportation to
travel; consequently there is a need to provide housing units accessible to disabled individuals in areas
with easy access to public transportation.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Section 4512 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code defines a "Developmental disability" as a
disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to
continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be
closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with
mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many persons with developmental disabilities can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment
where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist
before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for persons with developmental disabilities is the
transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community based services to
approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The
Inland Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry
to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit community
agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families.
Table V-6 provides information from the Inland Regional Center of on the number of individuals with
developmental disabilities in the City of Perris. In 2012, there were approximately 609 individuals (1% of
the total population) actively utilizing services at the Inland Regional Center for a developmental
disability.

To assist in the provision of housing to meet the needs of persons living with a developmental disability,
the City will implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the Inland
Regional Center. Perris will also encourage housing developers to designate a portion of new affordable
housing development for persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental disabilities,
and pursue funding sources designated for persons with special needs and disabilities.
Large Family Households
The 2010 Census reported 2,901 households in the City of Perris with five or more persons. Large family
households require special consideration because they generally require larger dwellings with sufficient
bedrooms to meet their housing needs without experiencing overcrowding.
Difficulties in securing housing units large enough to accommodate large families are heightened for
renters, as multi-family rental units are typically smaller than single-family units. Apartment complexes
in the City offering three and four bedroom units are limited, leaving single family homes, for sale or for
rent as an ideal housing option for large families. There appears to be sufficient stock of large single
family homes in the City; and, as shown previously in the Housing Costs and Rents Section, larger single-
family rental units are generally not affordable to extremely low-income households.
Table V-7 reveals tenure of housing units by number of persons in the unit. The table shows that there
are more owner-occupied units than renter occupied units housing large families. Large households

occupied by large households..

Female-headed Households
Female-headed households are a special needs group as women leading families have proportionally
lower rates of homeownership, lower incomes, and experience higher poverty rates than other family
types. The 2006 -2010 American Community Survey, reports 912 female-headed households with children
that were below the federally established poverty level, as shown in Table V-8.

Homeless Population
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) produced by SCAG defines homelessness as:
     1.    Persons who are living or staying in emergency shelters;
     2. Persons who sleep outside, in makeshift shelters, in cars or transportation areas such as bus or
           train terminals;
     3. Persons who are considered “at risk” (i.e., doubled-up, in marginal circumstances, motel
           population with limited stay or general relief recipients whose payments have been canceled due
           to “no forwarding address”).
Enumerating the homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of this population, as
well as the existence of the hidden homeless or persons that move around in temporary housing
situations (e.g. doubling up with another household). However, according to the 2011 County of
Riverside Homeless Assessment, there were an estimated 6,203 homeless persons on any given day in
Riverside County. This assessment estimated 161 homeless persons in the City of Perris.
There are numerous factors that contribute to homelessness in Perris and Riverside County. Difficulties
in obtaining employment, insufficient education, mental illness, and substance abuse are a few of the
more traditional factors. During the past 15-20 years, new factors, however, are emerging that
significantly contribute to homelessness. Housing trends that may contribute to a rise in homelessness
include: a growing shortage of affordable housing, and a simultaneous growth in the population of low-
income renters, which has correlated with high demand and shrinking supply. The County of Riverside,
through its Department of Social Services, contracts with local community based organizations to
provide programs for the homeless in each appropriate location. An emergency shelter in Hemet
accommodates homeless persons from the Perris area.

Farm workers
Historically, Perris’ economy has been linked to agriculture; however changes in the local economy
toward production and service-oriented sectors have virtually eliminated any significant agricultural
production within City limits. In 2010, the Census reported 272 (0.4 %) persons in Perris employed in
agriculture, forestry or fishing industries (or related industries). Though some agricultural production
occurs in the City, most land previously used for agricultural activities is currently developed or
designated for commercial or residential development. As there are limited active agricultural areas in the
City, there is no apparent or explicit need for farmworker housing. Additionally, housing opportunities
for farmworkers is also addressed through programs aimed at providing a variety of housing types and
financial assistance for lower income households.
C.         ASSISTED HOUSING AT-RISK OF CONVERSION TO MARKET RATE HOUSING
State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for currently rent-restricted low-income
housing units to convert to market rate housing, and to propose programs to preserve or replace any
units “at risk” of conversion. This section presents an inventory of all assisted rental housing in Perris,
and evaluates those units at risk of conversion during the eight-year 2014-2021 planning period.
Perris contains five developments of assisted multi-family rental housing totaling 443 affordable units, as
presented in table V-9. This inventory includes all multi-family units assisted under federal, State, and
local programs, including HUD, State/local bond programs, density bonus, inclusionary, and local
redevelopment or direct assistance programs.

Loss of Assisted Housing Inventory
All of the affordable rental projects have long-term affordability restrictions, and none are at risk of
conversion during the 2014-2021 planning period. During the 2008-2014 planning period, a total of 76
units were at-risk of conversion to market rate. Affordability covenants in Perris include developments
that hold a Federal Section 8 contract and/or are financed with or Federal programs (CDBG, HOME).
The Meadowview Apartment complex is subsidized through the California Housing Finance Agency
(CHFA) and HUD Section 8.
Contract Extension
Upon filing of a Notice of Intent (NOI), HUD may offer several incentives to property owners to remain
in their contracts, including re-financing the property mortgage, and establishing higher rents charged
for the project. Pursuant to Section 65863.10 of the Government Code, the property owners of these units
must also provide one year advanced notification to each tenant household if the property owner intends
to terminate the Section 8 contract. The notice must indicate the anticipated date of conversion and
anticipated rent increase. The property owner is also required to serve notice to the City of Perris.
For projects with contracts expiring, three renewal options are available. Options for renewal are
assumed to be one of the following, although other options may apply depending on other project factors:
(1) Renew at comparable market levels, possibly adjusted upward by operating costs, which is the Mark
Up to Market option; (2) Renew at current rents with no adjustments; (3) Notify HUD of intent to opt-
out of Section 8 contract. For any project with rents currently exceeding comparable market rents, as a
fourth option the owner may request referral to the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance
Restructuring (OMHAR) for reduction of Section 8 contract rents with or without the restructuring of
rents.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a non-profit housing organization is a viable way to
preserve affordable housing for the long term and increases number of government resources available to
the project. The feasibility of this option depends on the willingness of the owner to sell, funding to
actually buy the property and the existence of a non-profit organization with sufficient administrative
capacity to manage the property. Additionally, projects in which all units are affordable, and not just a
portion of units are affordable, can participate in ownership transfers more simply and are therefore more
likely to be feasible.
D.       REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT (RHNA)
California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local housing programs
designed to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups. This effort is
coordinated by the jurisdiction’s Council of Governments (Perris is in the Western Riverside Council of
Governments) when preparing the state-mandated Housing Element of its General Plan. This “fair share”
allocation concept seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction accepts the housing needs of not only its
resident population, but for all households who might reasonably be expected to reside within the
jurisdiction, particularly lower income households. This assumes the availability of a variety and choice
of housing accommodations appropriate to their needs, as well as certain mobility among households
within the regional market.

                                                                                             City of Perris
                                                                                             General Plan
Overview of the SCAG Fair Share Allocation Process
The fair share allocation process begins with the State Department of Finance’s projection of statewide
housing demand for a five year period, which is then apportioned by the State Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) among each of the State’s official regions. The regions are
represented by an agency typically termed a Council of Government (COG). In the six-county Southern
California region, which includes Perris and all other incorporated cities and unincorporated areas of
Riverside County, the agency responsible for assigning these fair share targets to each jurisdiction is the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). For Riverside County, in this RHNA Cycle,
SCAG delegated the Riverside County regional share among its member jurisdictions to the Western
Riverside Council of Governments (WRCOG).
A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is the number of additional dwelling units that
will need to be constructed during a given eight-year planning period. SCAG estimates each
jurisdiction's future housing need in terms of four factors:
     1.   The number of units needed to accommodate forecasted household growth;
     2. The number of units needed to replace demolitions due to attrition in the housing stock (i.e., fire
          damage, obsolescence, redevelopment and conversions to non-housing uses);
     3. Maintaining an ideal vacancy rate for a well-functioning housing market; and
     4. An adjustment to avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any one
          jurisdiction.
The new construction need must be allocated to four household income categories used in Federal and
State programs: Very Low; Low; Moderate; and Above Moderate-Income, defined operationally as
households earning up to 50 percent, 80 percent, 120 percent, and more than 120 percent of the Riverside
County median income, respectively. The allocations are further adjusted to avoid an over-concentration
of lower income households in any one jurisdiction. The fair share allocation must also consider the
existing “deficit” of housing resulting from lower income households that pay more than 30 percent of
their incomes for housing costs. As discussed earlier, this is the threshold used by the Federal
government to determine housing affordability.
The 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the City of Perris is:

Thus, for the 2014-2021 planning period, Perris’ “fair share” allocation is 4,280 units. According to
Housing Element Law Section 65583, local agencies shall calculate the subset of very low-income
households that qualify as extremely low-income households (30 percent or less of the Riverside County
median income) by presuming that 50 percent of the very low-income households qualify as extremely

low-income households. For the 2014-2021 planning period, the City was allocated 1,026 very low-
income units. If 50 percent of the very low allocation is calculated to accommodate extremely low income
households, then the City must plan to accommodate 513 units for extremely low income households
during the planning period. The Housing Element will describe policies and programs that the City will
utilize to facilitate and encourage the development of housing appropriate for extremely low income
households.
E.       OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
As cities construct housing to meet their growing populations, the consumption of energy becomes a
significant issue. In urban areas, energy consumption is primary for transportation, lighting, water
heating, and space heating and cooling. The high cost of energy demands that actions be taken to reduce
or minimize the overall level of urban consumption.
Title 24, Building Energy Standards for Residential Development, establishes energy budgets or
maximum energy use levels. The standards of Title 24 supersede local regulations, and State
requirements mandate Title 24 through implementation by local jurisdictions. The City will continue
strict enforcement of local and State energy regulations for new residential construction, and continue
providing residents with information on energy efficiency.
The City’s goal is to achieve maximum use of conservation measures and alternative, renewable energy
sources in new and existing residences. By encouraging and assisting residents to utilize energy more
efficiently, historical rates of consumption can be reduced, thereby mitigating the rising cost of supplying
energy and need for new, costly energy supplies. Potentially, the social and economic hardships
associated with any future rate increases and/or shortages of conventional energy sources will be
minimized.
The City added a Sustainable Community section to the Conservation Element of the General Plan. The
Sustainable Community section of the Conservation Element establishes goals and policies to help the
City shape its overall form and appearance in accordance with the community’s fundamental values. The
section is intended to protect the environment, improve quality of life, and promote sustainability
through “green building” practices. Green building emphasizes natural resources conservation, energy
conservation, and the reduction of environmentally harmful emissions through sustainable planning,
design, and construction of residential, commercial, and industrial developments. The section includes
building techniques to facilitate and preserve sustainable development in the City. Goal 6 of the Housing
Plan implements policies and actions to promote sustainable development and apply the goals set out in
the Sustainable Community section.
The Sustainable Community section is organized into three categories:
     1.  Existing conditions of current environmental circumstances;
     2. Issues, opportunities, and constraints of sustainable development; and
     3. Strategies to ensure that future development in the City incorporates green building into its
         design. The section proposes four goals that will address several different sustainable design
         issues. These four goals are:
         a. Address the vision for energy and resource conservation and the use of green building design.
         b. Encourage project designs that support the use of alternative transportation facilities.
         c. Encourage improved energy performance above the minimum California standards.

         d. The City shall take the lead in the development community in green building, energy and
              resource conservation by example.
Each goal has specific policies and implementation measures to achieve the goals mentioned above. This
section aims to reduce the effect of future development not just on the City, but on the State and the
world.
Utility providers also encourage and facilitate energy conservation and help residents minimize energy-
related expenses, Southern California Edison (SCE) and WRCOG both offer programs to qualifying
residents of Perris. Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a variety of energy conservation services as
part of its Customer Assistance Programs (CAP). The Energy Assistance Fund assists income-qualified
residential customers facing financial hardship and manages their electricity bills during the months of
February and March.
The WRCOG HERO Program offers $325 million in private financing to residential and commercial
property owners for energy efficient and water conservation retrofits. Financing is paid back through an
annual assessment on the property owner’s property tax and in most cases, stays with the property upon
sale. These services are designed to help low-income households, senior citizens, persons with permanent
disabilities, and non-English speaking customers control their energy use. Furthermore, the 2007
Residential Multi-Family Energy Efficiency Rebate Program offers property owners and managers
incentives on a broad list of energy efficiency improvements in lighting, HVAC, insulation, and window
categories. These improvements are to be used to retrofit existing multi-family properties of two or more
units.
Perris is also a member of the Western Riverside Energy Leader Partnership (WRELP) Program which is
designed to assist local governments in leading their communities to increase energy efficiency, reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, increase renewable energy usage, improve air quality, and ensure that their
communities are more livable and sustainable. SCE funded the WRELP Program in November 2010 in
the amount of $2.1 million. During the past year, WRCOG has been working with SCE staff to begin the
projects it had outlined in its proposal. The funding is to be used to support the California Long-Term
Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan (Plan) developed by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
in 2008. The CPUC identified five strategic goals that local governments could undertake. For each goal,
the CPUC identified specific strategies and developed specific tasks that are eligible for funding under
this solicitation.
Additionally, the Southern California Gas Company offers various rebate programs for energy-efficient
appliances to customers. The Gas Company also offers no-cost weatherization and furnace repair or
replacement services for qualified limited-income customers. The Comprehensive Mobile Home Program
provides qualifying mobile home customers with no-cost energy conservation evaluations, installations
of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators, and gas energy efficiency improvements, such as duct test
and seal of HVAC systems. The Designed for Comfort program provides energy efficiency design
assistance, training, and incentives for housing authorities, owners of multi-family affordable and
supportive housing projects.

VI. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS
This section of the Housing Element examines constraints that could hinder the City’s achievement of its
objectives and the resources that are available to assist in the production, maintenance and improvement
of the City’s housing stock. Constraints to the provision of housing may include governmental, market,
infrastructure, and environmental factors. State law requires that Housing Elements analyze potential
and actual governmental and non-governmental constraints to the production, maintenance, and
improvements of housing for all persons of all income levels and disabilities. The constraints analysis
must also demonstrate efforts by the local jurisdiction to remove governmental constraints that hinder
achievement of housing goals.
A.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental constraints are policies, development regulations, standards, requirements or other
actions imposed by the various levels of government upon land and housing ownership and development.
Although Federal and State agencies play a role in the imposition of governmental constraints, the
actions of these agencies are, for the most part, beyond the influence of local government and are
therefore not addressed in this document. Generally, most governmental constraints are local, including
land use controls, building codes, processing procedures, and development fees which put in place
standards that may constrain the maintenance, improvement and/or development of housing in the City.
State and federal regulations, which the City has no control over, can also add to governmental
constraints. Regulations related to environmental protection, building codes, and other topics have
significant, often adverse, impacts on housing costs and availability. While constraints exist at other
levels of government, this section emphasizes policies and regulations that can be mitigated by the City.
Land Use Controls
General Plan
Under State law, every city must have a General Plan establishing policy guidelines for all development
within the City. The General Plan is the foundation of all land use controls in a jurisdiction and it
establishes policy guidelines for all development within the City. The Land Use Element identifies the
location, distribution and density of land uses in the City. In implementing the General Plan, the City of
Perris utilizes a number of planning tools including the Specific Plan, Zoning Regulations, and
Subdivision Ordinance. With these documents, the City establishes more specific development
standards, allowable uses, and limitations. The Perris General Plan provides for seven residential land use
designations and one commercial land use category that permits residential use in the City. General Plan
residential land use designations express densities as dwelling units per acre (du/ac). Table VI-1
illustrates General Plan land use designations that permit residential uses.

                                        which will not increase intensity or density of these
                                        areas. By allowing Mobile home subdivisions within
                                        this Land Use category, this City can provide
                                        opportunities for affordable housing.

Zoning Code
The City’s Zoning Code is in need of a comprehensive update to be consistent with the General Plan.
This update is anticipated to occur in the upcoming planning period. State law requires that the General
Plan and Zoning Code be consistent (Government Code Section 65454). Currently, there are sections in
the Zoning Code, such as the Parking & Loading Standards that still reference the City’s old zone titles.
For the purposes of discussion, development standards that reference old zone titles have been
substituted with the new zone titles that most closely match the old zone.
Zoning regulations serve as a key General Plan implementation tool. The City's Zoning Code
accommodates a diversity of residential housing types. It allows for innovation in design standards
within parameters designated in Table VI-2, provided the overall density and dwelling unit capacity is
not exceeded. The Perris Zoning Code provides for nine residential zones, an additional “light
agricultural/interim zone” that allows residential use, and two overlay zones. Each of the zones is listed
below:
          A-1 Light Agricultural/Interim zone
          R-20,000 Single-Family Residential, 20,000 square foot minimum lots

        R-10,000 Single-Family Residential, 10,000 square foot minimum lots
        R-8,400 Single-Family Residential, 8,400 square foot minimum lots
        R-7,200 Single-Family Residential, 7,200 square foot minimum lots
        R-6,000 Single-Family Residential, 6,000 square foot minimum lots
        MFR-14 Multiple-Family Residential, 6,000 square foot minimum lots
        MFR-22 Multiple-Family Residential, 6,000 square foot minimum lots

        R-5 District, Mobile Home Subdivisions
        Planned Development Overlay (PDO)zone
        Senior Housing Overlay zone (SHO)
Zoning, which must be consistent with the General Plan, establishes specific development standards,
allowable uses, and limitations. Zoning regulations control development by establishing requirements
related to height, density, lot area, yard setbacks, and minimum parking spaces. Site development
standards ensure a quality living environment for all household groups in the City, including special
needs groups, and lower and moderate-income households.
Minimum lot size requirements and design standards such as roofing materials, architectural
enhancements and landscaping may increase the costs of housing. These constraints can hinder the
creation of affordable housing for low-income and senior residents. To minimize constraints and
maintain incentive for affordable housing developers, the City relies primarily on the application of
Density Bonuses and Specific Plans.
Specific Plan Areas
Specific Plans are plans pertaining to areas or projects within the City. A specific plan is a tool for the
systematic implementation of the General Plan. It effectively establishes a link between implementing
policies of the General Plan and the individual development proposals in a defined area. A specific plan
may be as general as setting forth broad policy concepts, or as detailed as providing direction to every
facet of development from the type, location and intensity of uses to the design and capacity of
infrastructure; from the resources used to finance public improvements to the design guidelines of a
subdivision.
By Government Code, a specific plan in the City of Perris must encompass at least 75 acres of contiguous
land. It may be developed in response to a single policy issue, or to address each applicable policy of the
General Plan. It may also diverge from the issues contained in the General Plan into other subjects
viewed by the community as being of relevance.
All specific plans must comply with Sections 65450 - 65457 of the Government Code. These provisions
require that a specific plan be consistent with the City's General Plan. In addition, specific plans must be
consistent with any Airport Land Use Plan pursuant to Public Utilities Code 21676. In turn, all
subsequent subdivision and development, all public works projects and zoning regulations must be
consistent with the specific plan.
The specific plans identified in this Housing Element to accommodate the housing need for the City of
Perris are the following:
        Green Valley
        New Perris

Parking Requirements
Residential parking requirements in Perris are shown in Table VI-3. The City’s parking requirements are
typical for a city of its size, and do not constrain the development of housing. Special parking standards
have been established for the Downtown Specific Plan to accommodate mixed-use projects and foster
shared parking concepts. The City should consider establishing reduced parking standards for senior
projects and projects with affordability components when located in close proximity to transportation
routes and public services. The recently adopted Senior Housing Overlay zone (SHO) includes additional
parking requirements and references the general parking requirements. Additional parking requirements
include locating parking courts within 150 feet from the dwelling unit for which the parking space is

Open Space Requirements
To improve the living environment of residential neighborhoods, communities typically require housing
to have a certain amount of open space, such as yards, common space, and landscaping. For single-family
homes, open space is reflected in setbacks, yard sizes, and lot coverage requirements. In addition to the
typical requirements, such as lot coverage, that ensure that open space is provided, multiple-family
projects (e.g. apartments and condominiums) are also required to have dedicated open space in lieu of
private yards. Both multi-family residential zones in the City have private and public open space
requirements.
For both the MFR-14 and MFR-22 zones, private open space requirements include having a minimum of
150 square feet of contiguous and usable outdoor living space that is enclosed by a solid fence for each

individual ground floor unit of a single-family dwelling. Above ground units are required to have a
minimum of 75 square feet of private open space. For specifics on the open space requirements for MFR-
14, please refer to Section 19.26.090.H.2.a of the Zoning Code.
A minimum of 150 square feet of common open space is to be provided for each unit, exclusive of
driveways and sidewalks. Of the required open space, a minimum of 30% shall be permanent
landscaping.
Density Bonus
In response to State mandated requirements and local needs, the City has adopted ordinances/regulatory
mechanisms that permit higher densities than generally permitted. Known as a “density bonus,” state law
allows a developer to increase the density of a residential development by up to 35% over the otherwise
maximum allowable residential density if provisions are made to contain at least any one of the
following:
     1.  20% of the units for lower income households, or
     2. 10% for very low-income households, or
     3. 50% of the total dwelling units of a housing development for qualifying residents (qualified to
         receive federal housing assistance, such as Section 8).
Also, one additional incentive or financial equivalent (such as modified development standard or
waiver/reduction for application or development fees) is granted by the City to all residential
developments meeting the 20 percent density bonus requirement for lower income housing. The City of
Perris complies with the Density Bonus provisions required by State law (Chapter 4.3, Section 65915) for
residential zones. The density bonus shall apply to housing developments consisting of five or more
dwelling units.
The density bonus is a valuable tool for jurisdictions to create more affordable housing for seniors and
lower income families. A potential developer may submit a written preliminary proposal for development
to determine the means for complying with the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. The preliminary
proposal may be submitted prior to any formal requests for General Plan amendments, Zoning
amendments or subdivision map approvals. Within 90 days of receipt of a complete preliminary
proposal, the City shall notify the developer in writing of the procedures with which it will comply. To
date, this type of density bonus provisions have not been utilized for new projects.
Applicants/Developers also have a density bonus option with the Planned Development Overlay zone.
This overlay zone grants a density bonus of up to 10 percent when certain criteria are met (as established
by the overlay zone). The following criteria must be satisfied in order for a developer to receive a 10
percent density bonus:
       The proposed density increase is compatible with surrounding land uses and will not adversely
        affect the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, or convenience.
       Suitable infrastructure either exists or will be concurrently constructed to serve the proposed
        project (i.e., streets, water, sanitary sewer, power, drainage facilities, etc.).
       The project is in close proximity to schools, shopping, and related residential support services.
       The project is well planned, exhibiting excellence in architectural, site and landscape design.
       The project creates a superior residential environment as evidenced by the provision of open
        space that is directly accessible to dwelling units.

To qualify for a density bonus under the Planned Development Overlay, the proposed project must satisfy
the above criteria and be approved by the Planning Commission and City Council.
Senior Housing Overlay
A Senior Housing Overlay (SHO) zone may be combined with any of the City’s conventional residential
or commercial zone districts. This district is designed to provide for residential uses that are appropriate
for the development of housing for seniors, recognizing their unique lifestyles and needs, by allowing
higher densities with a maximum of 50 dwelling units to the gross acre and a mix of uses including
multi-family residential, attached single-family residential, and detached single-family residential. Higher
design and construction standards, as well as the provision of specific site and building amenities for the
elderly are intended to be implemented in the SHO. Some of these standards include no step entries into
buildings, along with widened doorways and hallways to accommodate the use of wheelchairs. These
standards along with ADA and Universal Design building principles will be implemented into housing
developments in the SHO. Development incentives for qualified projects in the SHO include:
       A reduction in number of parking spaces per dwelling unit;
       The waiving of park development fees; and
       A maximum allowable density of 50 dwelling units to the gross acre.
Any development within the SHO must be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and City
Council.
Planned Development Overlay Zone
A Planned Development Overlay zone (PD) may be combined with any of the City’s conventional zone
districts. The purpose of a PD overlay zone is to allow flexibility in the mixture of land uses and
development criteria by encouraging superior architectural and site design which emphasizes
conservation of open space, provision of recreational amenities, and pedestrian connections between
buildings. The PD zone also encourages projects to include a variety of housing types or combinations of
residential and non-residential uses by allowing diversification in the relationship of uses, buildings,
architectural design, lot sizes, yard areas, and open spaces which may not be achievable under other
zoning districts. This district is designed to provide for those uses or combinations of uses which are
most appropriately developed in a comprehensive and coordinated fashion. It is intended to be applied
only to those areas which by reason of their proximity to other zoning districts, existing development,
topography, geographic location, size, or shape require special consideration to be properly integrated
into the community and adjacent developed districts. Any development within a PD overlay zone must
be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and City Council.
Second Dwelling Unit Requirements
In response to state mandated requirements and local needs, the City of Perris allows the development of
both attached and detached second dwelling units. Traditionally intended for elderly or other members
of owner-occupant families, the example of compact, infill development has become a crucial strategy for
meeting the growing rental housing demands in Perris and southern California.
Both attached and detached second dwelling units require a secondary residential unit permit prior to
construction and is subject to review and approval by City Council. Both attached and detached second
dwelling units must comply with all development standards for new single-family dwelling units along
with the standards mentioned below.
The following standards shall apply to attached second dwelling units:

                                                                                                City of Perris
                                                                                                General Plan
       The total floor area shall not exceed 30 percent of the existing living area of the primary residence;
       The architecture must be consistent with the existing unit architecture and material;
       One enclosed garage, off-street parking space, with a minimum area of 250 square feet shall be
        provided in addition to that required for the primary unit;
       The second dwelling unit must be connected to a public sewer; and
       The character and appearance of the primary residence shall be maintained to appear as a single-
        family unit.
For detached second dwelling units the following standards apply:
       A detached unit may be attached to an accessory structure, such as a detached garage;
       The total floor area of the second unit shall not exceed 75 percent of the total square footage of the
        living area of the primary unit;
       Architecture of the new unit shall be consistent with the existing unit architecture and material;
       One enclosed garage, off street parking space, with a minimum area of 250 square feet shall be
        provided in addition to that required for the primary unit. The garage shall be attached to the
        second unit;
       The second dwelling unit must be connected to a public sewer; and
       Mobile homes as second units are allowed only in RR/A and A-1 zones or lots containing more
        than 20,000 square feet .
Constraints to the development of second dwelling units are minimal beyond the cost of building
materials and the required secondary residential unit permit.
Government Code Section 65852.2 requires applications for second units to be considered ministerially
without discretionary review and a public hearing. Currently, the City’s Second Dwelling Unit ordinance
requires applications to be reviewed by the Director of Planning and City Council. City Council
approved Ordinance number 1264 on December 8, 2009 to amend chapters 19.08 and 19.81 of the Zoning
Code for second units to conform to the State of California’s second unit law.
Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Program (MSHCP)
In 2003, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors adopted the Riverside County Multiple Species
Habitat Conservation Program (MSHCP), which is a criteria-driven Habitat Conservation Plan intended
to create a network of permanent open space. The intent is to conserve a variety of natural communities
that would ensure survival of numerous species of plants and animals. The City of Perris is within the
MSHCP boundaries, thus additional constraints on the provision of affordable housing for land within
the MSHCP Reserve area may occur. However, the majority of MSHCP reserve land is concentrated
southwest of the Perris Valley Airport towards Canyon Lake. More than likely, the MSHCP will not
interfere with future residential development due to the land being designated Open Space. The MSHCP
is a governmental constraint that is beyond the City’s control, as it is a multi-jurisdictional program.
The MSHCP will reduce the land area available for a variety of uses, including residential development.
Any development proposals for lands within the MSHCP Reserve area are subject to specialized review
procedures which may create additional constraints to development of affordable housing. The MSHCP
may also create additional constraints due to the MSHCP fees, which are applied per dwelling unit.
Specific fee amounts are listed under “Additional Development Fees”.

The March Joint Powers Authority General Plan is a long-range comprehensive plan that outlines use
and development of the former March Air Force Base (AFB). The governing body that oversees the
redevelopment project is the March Joint Powers Authority (JPA), a local reuse agency comprised of four
public entities. The City of Perris one of the four agencies that make up the March JPA.
U.S. Air Force Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study (AICUZ)
Portions of Perris Planning Area 1 are included within March Air Reserve Base Accident Potential Zones I
and II and the Clear Zone as delineated in the AICUZ document. The AICUZ recommends that local
jurisdictions such as the City of Perris prohibit new construction in the Clear Zone and restrict the types
and intensities of uses on sites within the Accident Potential Zones to mostly non-residential, low-
occupancy uses. Hence, Planning Area 1 is generally made up of industrial land use designations along
the western end, which is near the former March AFB. New development on Specific Plan and R-6000
zoned sites in these areas may be subject to review by ALUC. Future residential development is located
in the outer portions of the zone, to the south, which are within the City of Perris limits.
March Air Reserve Base / Inland Port Airport Joint Land Use Study
Portions of the City are located within the Airport Influence Area (AIA) of March Air Reserve Base,
formerly March Air Force Base. The Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) utilizes the Air Installation
Compatible Use Zone study (AICUZ) as a resource in evaluating development applications within the
AIA. Airport Zone maps were adopted in 1986, but the maps relate back to the categories in the 1984
Riverside County Airport Land Use Plan (ALUP). There is no available evidence that a Base-specific
written text was ever adopted. Park West, Harvest Valley, and a portion of the New Perris Specific Plan
are constrained under the existing ALUP, which limits residential density to one dwelling unit per 2½
acres in certain areas. The City overruled ALUC’s determinations of inconsistency for the Park West and
Harvest Landing Specific Plan projects. In the current draft of the text for the new MARB Airport Land
Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP), the Harvest Landing and Park West Specific Plans are proposed to be
exempted from the Plan’s density limits, such as the three dwelling units per acre limit in proposed Zone
C1.
Per State law, the Housing Element must undergo review and approval by Riverside County ALUC. On
March 13, 2013, ALUC determined that the Housing Element is consistent with the Airport Land Use
Plan.
Perris Valley Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
Perris Valley Airport (PVA) is a privately-owned, public-use airport generally located southeast of the
intersection of Ellis Avenue and Goetz Road within the City of Perris. A total of 148 aircrafts are based on
this field, and an average of 94 aircraft operations’ occur per day. The Riverside County ALUC is required
to prepare and adopt an airport land use compatibility plan for each airport within its jurisdiction. The
current Perris Valley ALUCP was adopted in 2011, and no further changes are anticipated at this time. A
conflict between the Perris Valley ALUCP and Specific Plan land use designations occurs within
portions of the Green Valley Specific Plan. Coordination between the City of Perris and ALUC has
resulted in the provision of additional Compatibility Policies that allow for development at a greater
density and intensity in areas northerly of Ellis Avenue, including the Downtown Specific Plan, than
would otherwise have been provided pursuant to County-wide criteria. The Downtown Specific Plan
was reviewed by ALUC and determined to be consistent with applicable Plans in 2010, and the Perris
Valley ALUCP was designed to recognize the consistency determination of that Plan.

Residential Care Facilities and Housing with Supportive Services
The Zoning Code accommodates both small and large residential care facilities. Small residential care
facilities that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by-right in nearly all of the residential zones, with
the exceptions of the R-4 and R-5 zones, and are treated as standard residential uses, consistent with
State law.
Large residential care facilities and care centers are subject to the review and approval of a conditional
use permit. The City’s Zoning Code indicates that large residential care facilities (7 to 12 persons) require
a permit with conditions of approval and is required to comply with development standards of the
applicable zone and additional parking standards to ensure that there is adequate off-street parking for
employees and those residing at the facility.
Residential care centers (12 or more) require a conditional use permit and are deemed a non-residential
use in the Zoning Code. Residential care centers have more stringent development standards that include
standards such as: minimum floor area, requirements for common areas and recreational and
entertainment facilities, trash receptacles, etc.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing
Emergency shelters provide housing for homeless persons for a limited period of time, while transitional
and supportive housing facilities provide support and housing for persons transitioning out of
homelessness into permanent housing. Providing adequate housing for the homeless must be
demonstrated in the Housing Element. To comply with SB 2, the Housing Element must identify a zone
suitable to develop at least one (1) emergency shelter in the planning period.
The City amended the Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters as a permitted use in the General
Industrial (GI) zone, particularly the GI land that is bounded by Malbert Road to the north and
Mountain Avenue to the south; located at least 1,200 feet southerly of Ellis Avenue. This area is located
within Perris Valley Airport Compatibility Zone D in which residential uses are currently permitted.
Coordination between the City of Perris and Riverside County Airport Land Use Commission has
resulted in the provision of additional Compatibility Policies that would allow for development, under
specific conditions, within the Zone D at a greater density and intensity. Portions of this area are in
transition from older manufacturing and warehouse uses to office and retail commercial uses. As a result,
environmental impacts associated with industrial uses are reduced making the area more suitable for
residential development. The amount of available land zoned GI in the southern portion of Perris is
sufficient to accommodate at a minimum one (1) emergency shelter.
The City’s adopted ordinance includes objective development and management standards described in
the Senate Bill 2 statute, below:
         The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the facility
          (maximum 100 beds per acre)
         Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the standards do not require
          more parking for emergency shelters than for other residential or commercial uses within the
          same zone.
         The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas.

The Coachella Valley Housing Authority currently has a transitional and supportive housing project
located in the MFR-14 Zone scheduled to go to hearing in February 2013. The project will provide a total
of 15 units to serve as transitional and supportive housing. The City has amended the Zoning Code to
allow transitional and supportive housing as a permitted use by right, except within Airport Areas I and
II as mapped at www.rcaluc.org and within Compatibility Zones A, B1, B2, and C of the Airport
Influence Area of Perris Valley Airport, in effect as of July 1, 2011, in all residential zones.
Single Room Occupancy Housing Facilities
Generally, single room occupancy (SRO) housing facilities are buildings with a common entrance
containing a cluster of at least five rental units which provide sleeping and living facilities for one or two
persons, where kitchen and/or bathroom facilities may be shared. The City‘s Zoning Code permits SRO’s
in the Multi-Family Residential (MFR-22) Zone as a permitted use by right except within the Airport
Area I as mapped at www.rcaluc.org and within Compatibility Zones A, B1, and B2 of the Airport
Influence Area of Perris Valley Airport, in effect as of July 1, 2011 in the MFR-22 zone. Additionally, the
ordinance revision includes a limit of 75 rooms per acre of land.
Farmworker Housing
The City of Perris has the A-1 zone that is for existing agricultural uses and also acts as a “holding” or
interim zone that is in place until the site/property can be developed consistent with the General Plan.
This zone permits any uses permitted in the R-6,000 zone, which includes attached and detached one-
family dwellings and small family day care homes. Neither zone specifically references farmworker
housing.
Manufactured and Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing is permitted by right in all zones which permit single-family houses, pursuant to
State law. Additionally, mobile homes are permitted in the R-4 and R-5 Districts. Mobile home parks are
subject to a conditional use permit in all other residential zones.

Building Codes and Enforcement
Building and safety codes regulate new construction, alteration, and reconstruction of buildings, and are
intended to protect occupants from unnecessary risk of fire, structural collapse, unsanitary conditions,
and injury or loss of life. While building and safety codes are adopted for the purposes of preserving
public health and safety, and ensuring the construction of safe and decent housing, they have the
potential to increase the cost of housing construction and/or maintenance. The City of Perris’ Building
Code provides regulations necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its residents. The
City has adopted into its Codes and Ordinances the 2010 Uniform Building, Plumbing, Mechanical Fire
and Electrical Codes (ICBO, NFPA), which establish construction standards for all residential buildings.
Residential code enforcement in the City is performed proactively and on a complaint basis by the
County of Riverside Code Enforcement Department, with four inspectors and support staff assigned to
the City of Perris.
On and Off-Site Improvements
Site improvements and property dedications are important components of new development and
contribute to the creation of decent and affordable housing. Residential development in Perris requires
site improvements that vary by size and location. These improvements may include, but are not limited
to:
       Separate and adequate distribution lines for domestic water supply;
       Sewage collecting system where main lines of an adequate disposal system are available;
       Adequate grading and surfacing of streets, highways, and alleys;
       Concrete curbs and gutters;
       Concrete sidewalks;
       Fire hydrants at locations designated by the City engineer and Fire Department;
       Traffic control devices;
       Necessary barricades and safety devices;
       Utility facilities including, but not limited to, wires, cables and ducts for distributing electricity,
        communication, and cable television;
       Fees for, or dedication of, parks and recreation facilities;
       Roadway widening;
       Street lighting; and
       Median islands.
Site improvements are required to ensure that there is adequate infrastructure for and access to a site.
Site improvements also help in making the project more compatible with surrounding neighborhoods;
however, these site improvements can act as a constraint on the development of housing due to the

significant commitment in cost for the developer, which in turn is carried over into the purchase price of
the home by the developer. To encourage the development of affordable housing many of these
requirements and dedications can be waived by the City to help mitigate cost impacts.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires localities to analyze potential and actual constraints upon housing for persons with
disabilities, demonstrate efforts to remove governmental constraints, and include programs to
accommodate housing designed for people with disabilities. The City has no special zoning or land use
restrictions that regulate the siting of housing for persons with disabilities. However, one of the purposes
of the City’s Senior Housing Overlay zone (SHO) is to ensure that federal regulated requirements related
to the Americans Disabilities Act (ADA) and Universal Design principles are incorporated within senior
housing developments.
The definition of “family” may limit access to housing for persons with disabilities when municipalities
narrowly define the word, discriminating against group homes for persons with disabilities on the basis
of familial status. Perris defines “family” to mean an individual or two or more persons related by blood or
marriage or a group of not more than six persons, excluding servants, who are not related by blood or
marriage, living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit. The City’s definition of “family”
does not limit access to housing for persons with disabilities any more than other forms of group homes.
Pursuant to State law, Perris permits state-licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons
in all of its residential zoning districts by right. State-licensed residential care facilities providing care for
7 to 12 persons with special needs are subject to review and approval of a large residential care permit.
Residential care centers providing care for 12 or more persons with special needs are subject to review
and approval of a conditional use permit. The review and permitting of residential care facilities and care
centers pertain to development standards such as parking, hours of operation, noise, traffic circulation,
and security, which may affect the approval certainty of these care facilities and care centers. The
provisions and extended review procedure associated with these projects requires a significant
commitment in time and financing that may discourage the development of these residential care
facilities and care centers.
Americans with Disabilities Act
The City's building codes require that new residential construction and rehab construction comply with
the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA provisions include requirements for a minimum
percentage of units in new developments to be fully accessible to persons with physical disabilities.
Unlike the Uniform Building Code (UBC), enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of
the City, but is mandated under federal law. Compliance with building codes and the ADA may increase
the cost of housing production, and can potentially impede the rehabilitation of older properties required
to be brought up to current code standards.
Reasonable Accommodation
The Housing Element must analyze potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance
and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities and demonstrate local efforts to remove
governmental constraints that hinder the City from meeting the need for housing for persons with
disabilities. The Housing Element must include programs that remove constraints or provide reasonable
accommodation for housing designed for persons with disabilities.
Action 2.8 of the Housing Plan addresses reasonable accommodation procedures, thus providing
individuals with disabilities or household’s equal housing opportunity through residential unit

                                                                                              General Plan
modifications intended to improve mobility and accessibility, and to provide the flexibility necessary for
developing housing for individuals with disabilities. The City amended the Zoning Code to formally
adopt reasonable accommodation procedures.
Governmental Constraints Processing
Local Processing and Permit Procedures
Builders and developers frequently cite the cost of holding land during the evaluation and review process
as a significant factor to the cost of housing. Holding costs associated with delays in processing have
been estimated to add between 1.1 percent and 1.8 percent to the cost of a dwelling unit for each month of
delay. Processing times vary with the complexity of the project. Approval for single-family homes, multi-
family development projects with less than five dwelling units, and other minor tenant improvements
can usually be processed within two weeks after submittal to the City.
Multi-family development projects with five or more dwelling units are subject to review and approval
by the Planning Commission and may include review by the City Council. Typically the Planning
Commission will determine if the proposed project will have any adverse impact on nearby properties
and uses. Multi-family projects may take an average of 8 weeks to process typically due to minor
adjustments and/or variance requests, however if a project is able to comply with all existing
development standards, approval may be achieved in less time. Eight weeks to review a site development
permit is very typical for a jurisdiction this size and is comparable to surrounding cities in the Riverside
County area. The minimum processing time, as well as the public hearing, can pose a constraint to the
development of multi-family projects as a delay in the review process increases holding costs of the land,
which is often then reflected in the housing cost. To address this constraint, as outlined in Action 3.1 of
the Housing Plan, the City shall prioritize development processing time of applications for multi-family
developments to assist in decreasing the development processing time; thus, decreasing the holding cost
of the land. The City will work with affordable housing developers to understand any time sensitive
issues and costs, and how the processing time will affect the developer’s ability to produce units for very
low- and low-income units.
Projects in PD or SHO overlay zones or other projects requiring Conditional Use Permits, Zoning
Amendments, or other discretionary actions necessitate a higher level of review, resulting in a longer
processing timeline, usually 60 to 90 days. The City of Perris’ development approval process is designed
to accommodate, not hinder, appropriate development. Table VI-6 provides a list of the average
processing times for various procedures from application to City Council approval of a project.
Currently, the City does not have a formal procedure for expediting projects with affordability
conditions. As supported by reasonable processing times, and the relative facility of permit procedure,
the City's processing and permit procedures do not constrain the development of housing.
The Planning Division of the Development Services Department is the lead agency in processing
residential development applications and coordinates the processing of these applications with other
City departments and agencies. The time required to process a development entitlement applications can
have significant cost implications for affordable housing. Changes in zoning designations or standards
may be typical of entitlement requests accompanying proposals for affordable housing. As indicated in
Table VI-6, zone change requests can be accommodated in as few as 60 days.

Development Fees and Exactions
The City and other agencies charge various fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing
development permits and providing local services. These deposit-based fees help ensure quality
development and the provision of adequate public services. In addition, developer fees and exactions
imposed on new development can help to minimize impacts on existing infrastructure and enable
required upgrades of infrastructure consistent with demands of the new development. State law requires
that these fees be reasonably related to the mitigation of the identified impact, and that they be
proportionate to the extent of impacts associated with any given development project. These
development fees are typically passed on to renters and homeowners in the price/rent of housing, and
thus affect housing affordability.
The City’s Planning Division Deposit-based Development Fee Schedule is outlined in Table VI-7. As
previously mentioned, City fees are comparable to other local jurisdictions and are not considered to be a
major constraint to the development of affordable or market rate housing. Additional fees, such as
development impact fees for public facilities and services, drainage, water and sewer, and environmental
fees are also presented.

3627 (adopted in 2012). By 4/1/2013 the rates will be:
         Single-Family Residential                $8,873.00 per single-family residential unit
         Multi-Family Residential                 $6,231.00 per multi-family residential unit
According to the City of Perris Ordinance No. 1263 (adopted in 2009), the following new development is
exempt from TUMF payment:
    1. Low income residential housing;
    2. Government/public buildings, public schools and public facilities; and
    3. The rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of any habitable structure in use.

B.        NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Environmental Constraints
Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic conditions that provide the
greatest threat to the built environment. The City has identified areas where land development should be
carefully controlled. The following hazards may impact future development of residential units in the
City:
        Seismic Hazards: While no known active faults exist in the Perris Valley, it does lie between the
         San Jacinto and Elsinore faults. Portions of the area are subject to liquefaction, which occurs
         when a mass of soil collapses from a sudden loss of cohesion due to an earth tremor or to a sudden
         increase in groundwater from an external source. Perris is also subject to surface rupture, ground
         shaking, and ground failure. The greatest potential danger is the collapse of older residential units
         constructed from un-reinforced masonry, and explosions of petroleum and fuel lines. Some of
         Perris’ historic and culturally significant buildings are among the most hazardous in case of
         earthquakes. As in most of southern California, conflict exists between landmark preservation
         and the elimination of public danger from seismic damage. The City’s Seismic Safety and Public
         Safety Elements, as well as the adopted Uniform Building Code, contain policies that address
         seismic activity.
        Flooding: The Perris planning areas are within the San Jacinto River Basin which drains through
         the San Jacinto River Valley and Perris Valley from the San Jacinto Mountains and terminates in
         Lake Elsinore. Perris is located in the flat Perris Valley, and is located in Flood Insurance Rate
         Map (FIRM) flood zones of AE, A, X, and X500. Of these flood zones, mandatory flood insurance
         purchase requirements apply to developments in the zones AE and A. Most of the flood zones are
         concentrated in the lower, flatter lands within the City.
         In addition to the 100- and 500-year floodplains that pose a threat to flooding in the City, Perris is
         also susceptible to flood inundation associated with dam failure. However, the State and City
         have taken precautionary measures to ensure maximum public safety for those located
         downstream of the lake; this includes lowering the water level of the lake while additional
         analysis is performed on Perris Dam.
        Toxic and Hazardous Wastes: There are several commercial land uses within the City that may
         produce/handle hazardous materials. As a mostly residential City, Perris does not consider
         toxic/hazardous waste an overwhelming concern or constraint to the development of housing.
        Fire Hazards: The most serious fire threat within the City is the natural fire cycle of the
         surrounding hills, which become thick with brush and other natural materials after rainy periods.
         Like most southern California cities on the urban fringe, the late summer fires that result from the
         accumulation of this brush have the potential to spread into the City proper. Since the City center
         is largely developed, there is less potential for fire in central City communities. Other fire hazards
         within the City may be associated with heavy industrial uses, older commercial and residential
         structures, the presence of hazardous materials, and arson.
        Noise: Residential land uses are considered the most sensitive to loud noise. The principal noise
         sources in Perris generate from the primary transportation systems, including Interstate 215,
         Highway 74, major and secondary arterials, railroad lines, the Perris Valley Airport, the March Air

C.       OTHER CONSTRAINTS
Land Prices
The cost of land directly influences the cost of housing. In turn, land prices are determined by a number
of factors, most important of which are land availability and permitted development density. As land
becomes scarcer, the price for land increases. In terms of development density, land prices are positively
correlated with the number of units permitted on each lot. Thus, a higher density lot may command a
higher price than one designated for lower densities, but upon completion the developer may realize a
higher profit margin based on a greater number of units sold.
Housing Market
In recent years, vacant residential land sales have increased due to the highly active Southern California
housing market. Even in this market environment, there are significant differences in land prices in the
region. In general, land prices in Riverside County are more affordable than the pricier Los Angeles and
Orange County markets; in fact, the lack of inexpensive residential land in Los Angeles and Orange
Counties was a major impetus for the development of the Inland Empire, including Perris and western
Riverside County.
Within the Riverside County market, there are also significant differences in land prices. Master-planned
communities in Temecula, Corona, and parts of the Coachella Valley have generally garnered higher
residential land prices than more established communities in central, southern and parts of eastern
Riverside County.
Although they remain a significant cost component of a new home, land prices in Perris do not
significantly constrain the production of housing, relative to surrounding jurisdictions. In fact, the land
costs in Perris are more conducive to construction than other areas of Riverside County, and have
contributed to the potential for single-family market rate units to be constructed which are generally
affordable to moderate, and in some cases, lower income households.
Construction Costs
The cost of building materials for residential construction rose dramatically until 2008. However,
according to the U.S. Department of Labor, the overall cost of residential construction materials rose by
only 2 percent between 2011 and 2012, with steel costs increasing 0.4 percent and the cost of cement
increasing 1.5 percent. With the slowdown in the real estate market from 2008 and 2012, the price of
construction materials has shown a significant decrease from the 2006-2008 construction boom. The 2
percent increase in overall construction costs experience over the past year is primarily due to increased
labor costs.
The type of product largely determines the cost of construction. About 25 percent of Perris’ existing
inventory was constructed prior to the 1980s. These older homes, in some cases, reflect a lesser degree of
amenities (such as less square footage, or the provision of carports instead of a two car garage) than the
more contemporary tract developments in newer parts of Riverside County. These older homes generally
reflect a lower resale market price than newer products crafted with supplemental amenities and more
technologically advanced materials. When considering the overall housing affordability in the Perris
market, the purchase prices of these older homes are affordable even to residents in the very low-income
category.

                                                                                                City of Perris
                                                                                                General Plan
The cost of labor is based on a number of factors, including housing demand, the number of contractors
in an area and the unionization of workers, but it is generally two to three times the cost of materials.
Prevailing wages may also be an additional constraint on construction costs. In the State of California, all
public works projects must pay prevailing wages to all workers employed on the project. A public works
project is any residential or commercial project that is funded through public funds, including federally
funded or assisted residential projects controlled or carried out by an awarding body. The prevailing
wage rate is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a
particular craft, classification, or type of work within the locality and in the nearest labor market area.
Twice a year, prevailing wage rates are determined by the director of the California Department of
Industrial Relations. A prevailing wage ensures that the ability to get a public works contract is not
based on paying lower wage rates than a competitor, and requires that all bidders use the same wage
rates when bidding on a public works project. The California Department of Industrial Relations
provides link to the current prevailing wages for a journeyman craft or classification for each county in
California. Prevailing wages may constrain construction of affordable housing because they are often
higher than normal wages.
Together, the cost of building materials and construction labor are the most significant cost components
of developing residential units. In the current southern California market, construction costs are
estimated to account for upwards of 50 percent of the sales price of a new home. Typical construction
costs for high-density apartment (20 units per acre) developments run around $150,000 per unit
including $10,000 per unit for structured parking. Hard construction costs for development of medium-
density (15 units per acre) condominiums over podium parking run approximately $200,000 per unit,
including $35,000 per unit for the parking structure.
The data indicates that construction costs in the Perris vicinity can constitute approximately 40 percent
of the cost of a single-family detached housing unit. These figures are even more noteworthy considering
that the cost of raw land constitutes only four to 14 percent of the cost of a housing unit. Typically, in the
private sector market, the development of residential units is a business and investment venture.
Therefore, developers seek the greatest return for their investment. As with most businesses, a
constraining factor in the area of profitability continues to be the market place where developers sell
their products. To a great extent, the market place sets the upper end of the profit margin with overhead
costs for construction constituting the lower parameter of profit.
The construction cost of housing affects the affordability of new housing and can be a constraint to the
creation of affordable housing in the City and greater Riverside County region. Particularly with the
tightening of mortgage lending standards, homebuilders have slowed construction of new homes, which
could potentially affect the provision of affordable housing. A reduction in construction costs can be
brought about in several ways. One such method involves a reduction in amenities and quality of
building materials in new homes (still above the minimum acceptability for health, safety and adequate
performance), which may result in lower sales prices. State Housing Law provides that local building
departments can authorize the use of materials and construction methods if the proposed design is found
to be satisfactory and the materials or methods are at least equivalent to that prescribed by the applicable
State building codes.
In addition, pre-fabricated, factory built housing may provide lower priced products by reducing labor
and materials costs. As the number of units built in scale increases, savings in construction costs over the
entire development can be realized, particularly when combined with density bonus provisions. The City
may implement a variety of programs to write down land costs or provide other developer incentives
such as flexibility in development standards to increase affordability, subject to the developer providing a
percentage of units with affordability restrictions.

Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Increases in interest rates
decrease the number of persons able to afford a home purchase. Decreases in interest rates result in more
potential homebuyers introduced into the market. National policies and economic conditions determine
interest rates, and there is little that local governments can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can,
however, “leverage” funds by offering interest rate write-downs to extend home purchase opportunities
to lower income households. In addition, government insured loan programs may be available to reduce
mortgage down payment requirements.
First time homebuyers are the most impacted by financing requirements. Mortgage interest rates for new
home purchases are about 3.5 percent for a fixed rate-30 year loan in 2012. Lower initial rates may be
available with Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPMs), Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM’s), and Buy-
Down Mortgages. However, variable interest rate mortgages on affordable homes may increase to the
point that interest rates exceed the cost of living adjustments, which is a constraint on affordability.
Although interest rates are currently low, they can change significantly and substantially impact the
affordability of the housing stock.
Interest rates in 2012 are not a constraint to affordable housing; however more strict lending standards
could pose a constraint to affordable housing. An increase of one percentage point can make a monthly
payment out of reach for many lower income households. As such, financing for long term mortgages is
generally available in Perris, subject to normal underwriting standards.
A more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the housing stock and
the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment requirements. Typically, conventional home loans
will require 80 percent loan-to-value and represents the largest constraint to homebuyers. Other
programs, such as those for first-time homebuyers, can find down payment requirements between 5
percent and 20 percent. However, more recent events in the housing market have made it more difficult
for prospective home buyers to secure a home loan.
The year 2012 saw a record number of foreclosures in California. Information obtained online indicated
that there were approximately 842 homes in Perris that were in foreclosure. Perris experienced the
highest number of foreclosures compared to its neighboring cities. There were 794 foreclosures in
Murrieta, 284 foreclosures in Bellflower, 371 foreclosures in Pico Rivera, and 354 foreclosures in San
Jacinto. However, the number of foreclosure homes in Perris is significantly less than Riverside County as
a whole, which experienced 16,476 foreclosures in 2012.
The greatest impediment to homeownership, however, is credit worthiness. According to the Federal
Housing Authority, lenders consider a person’s debt-to-income ratio, cash available for down payment,
and credit history, when determining a maximum loan amount. Many financial institutions are willing to
significantly decrease down payment requirements and increase loan amounts to persons with good
credit rating. Individuals with a poor credit rating may only qualify for higher interest rates or a loan
amount insufficient to purchase a house. Poor credit rating can be especially damaging to lower-income
residents, who have fewer financial resources with which to qualify for a loan. The FHA is generally more
flexible than conventional lenders in its qualifying guidelines and allows many residents to re-establish a
good credit history.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to report lending
activity by census tract. Analysis of available HMDA reports do not indicate documented cases of
underserved lower income census tracts in the City. Table VI-10 presents the disposition of home
purchase loan applications in 2011 by number of loans approved and loans denied. The data is for the
Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSA, which includes the City of Perris. The data includes purchases

received from above moderate-income households (earning greater than 120 percent of Median Family
Income [AMI]). Moderate-income households (80 to 120 percent of AMI) and lower-income households
(less than 80 percent AMI) accounted for approximately 8 percent and 2 percent, respectively (please
note that there is a slight margin of error in the percentage calculations because the sum of the total
applications for each income category does not equal the actual total count). The overall loan origination
rate can be expected to contract further as a recent national survey conducted by the Federal Reserve
found that more than half of banks responding reported they had tightened their lending standards for
sub-prime mortgages.

 VII. HOUSING RESOURCES
 This section summarizes the land, financial, and administrative resources available for the development
 and preservation of housing in Perris. The analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land
 resources for future housing development; the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future
 housing needs, the financial resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative
 resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs and policies.
 A.         REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION (RHNA)
 Perris’ Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the 2014-2021 planning period has been
 determined by SCAG to be 4,280 housing units, including 513 units for very low-income households,
 681 units for low-income households, 759 units for moderate-income households, and 1,814 units for
 above moderate-income households.8

 Identifying Adequate Sites
 State law requires that a community identify an adequate number of sites to accommodate and facilitate
 production of the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City has sufficient land to
 accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the City must identify “adequate
 sites.” Under State law (California Government Code section 65583.c.1), adequate sites are those with
 appropriate zoning and development standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and
 encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels. Land considered suitable for
 residential development includes the following:
          Vacant residentially zoned sites;
          Vacant non-residentially zoned sites which allow residential uses (such as mixed-use);
          Underutilized residentially zoned sites that are capable of being developed at a higher density or
           with greater intensity; and
 8
     In RHNA, there are rounding differences in some localities between the total housing need and the sum of the four income
     groups. In such cases, communities may choose which of the income categories it will adjust by one unit to maintain
     consistency with the approved total housing need. For Perris, the one unit difference has been allocated to the above
     moderate-income category.
 9
     AB2634 mandates that localities calculate the subset of the very low-income regional need that constitutes the communities
     need for extremely low income housing. As an alternative to calculating the subset, local jurisdictions may assume that 50
     percent of the very low income category is represented by households of extremely low income (less than 30 percent of the
     AMI).

       Non-residential zoned sites that can be redeveloped for, and/or rezoned for, residential use (via
        program actions).
An important component of the Perris Housing Element is the identification of remaining sites and
future housing development opportunities in the 2014-2021 planning period. Since Perris has a sufficient
amount of undeveloped land, the majority of sites identified in the Sites Inventory focus on vacant sites
within Specific Plan Land Use Designations. Opportunities for residential development in the City fall
into one of three categories:
       Land within Specific Plan Land Use Designations;
       Vacant land that is designated for residential use; and
       Underutilized residentially zoned sites where the current use of the property is less than the
        maximum density allowed by the General Plan designation.
The following maps identify sites within the City that fall under one of the three categories identified
previously. The “Key Map” at the bottom right-hand corner of each map outlines the geographic location
of the area within the City.

Residential Sites Inventory and Analysis of Suitability and Availability
The maps identify sites that the City determined to be ideal for accommodating future housing, including
affordable housing. Analyses based on potential environmental constraints, infrastructure, and realistic
development capacity calculations are discussed. Estimates of potential capacity on the vacant or
significantly underutilized land are based on a ratio of 85 percent, which was established in the City’s
General Plan as the average rate for residential development (not including a density bonus) to account
for development standards such as lot coverage requirements, parking, setbacks, open space,
infrastructure and public facilities. This rate has been applied in calculating the capacity for vacant and
underutilized sites to ensure that it is consistent with projections contained in the General Plan.
Summary of Land Available
Perris is a growing community and has a sufficient amount of vacant and underutilized land to
accommodate new development. The majority of vacant sites in the City of Perris include land designated
Specific Plans (SP). For these sites, information on the number of residential units is based on land use
plans for the respective specific plan. Each site with a SP designation listed in Table VII-2 is followed
with the name of the adopted Specific Plan in parentheses/vacant land within sites designated Specific
Plan have the potential to generate a total of 14,636 housing units, of which 3,673 units are in a zone
allowing a density greater than 30 dwelling units per acre. It is anticipated that a majority of the City’s
remaining RHNA can be accommodated in the specific plan areas. A parcel-specific listing of these
available sites is provided in Appendix A.
Each specific plan, except for the River Glen SP, shown in Map 5, has at least one zone that allows
medium to high density residential development, ranging approximately from 14-22 dwelling units per
acre. Additionally, the Downtown Specific Plan adopted in January 2012, includes two zones that can
accommodate densities at an average of 35 dwelling units per acre. Zoning in the Downtown Specific
Plan area will be discussed later in this chapter under the heading “Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate
Housing for Lower Income Households.”

Underutilized Residentially Zoned Sites
Underutilized sites are located in the eastern portion of the City bounded by Rider Avenue and Bradley
Street adjacent to the Villages of Avalon and May Ranch Specific Plans. The sites have been identified as
underutilized because the current uses on the sites (single-family residences) are not built to the
maximum density permitted within the MFR-14 zoning designation. Table VII-4 lists underutilized land
that is designated for residential use. The sites have the potential capacity for 194 residential units. A
parcel-specific listing of the sites is provided in Appendix A.

Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate Housing for Lower Income Households
Density is a critical factor in the development of affordable housing. Maintaining low densities typically
increases the cost of construction per unit, while higher density development lowers the per-unit land
cost and facilitates construction in an economy of scale. In addition to the potential for density bonus
provisions, more intense residential development is achieved through a number of mechanisms, including
clustering of residential development and zero lot line development, subject to City development
standards. Clustering of housing can produce higher densities on a portion of land while creating space
for amenities, and retaining the overall density assignment of the entire property. This method is effective
when portions of the property not utilized for residential development can be developed with compatible
uses, such as open space/recreation, parks, schools and public facilities.

Affordability is typically correlated with density. The State Housing and Community Development
Department (HCD) has established “default densities” that by definition are considered sufficient to
provide market-based incentives for the development of housing for lower-income households. For
jurisdictions with a population greater than 25,000 and located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA) with a population of more than 2 million, the default density is 30 dwelling units per acre (or
higher). Perris has a population greater than 25,000 and is within the Riverside MSA; consequently the
default density for the City is 30 dwelling units per acre.
The Perris Downtown Specific Plan
To implement the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City amended the Perris Downtown Specific Plan in
January 2012. The new Downtown Specific Plan amended the existing Downtown Specific Plan that was
adopted in 1993. The amended Downtown Specific Plan updates the original specific plan to focus goals
and policies on smart growth and new urbanism principles, such as walkability, transit-oriented
development, higher densities, and sustainable development. The intent of the new Downtown Specific
Plan is to transform the downtown into the “lively center” of the City with a mix of uses, and establish a
pedestrian-friendly live/work district in the City. To achieve this, the Specific Plan utilizes a form based
approach to regulate land uses. This form based Regulating Code focuses attention on the form,
placement, and appropriate use of buildings (i.e. mass, height, site lay out) rather than traditional
development standards such as minimum and maximum densities. Its design standards and guidelines
promote an attractive and pedestrian-oriented environment. Despite the lack of defined densities within
the Specific Plan document, the Environmental Impact Report makes assumptions for average densities
to determine build-out and appropriate level of service for infrastructure. The Specific Plan area and
specific land use districts are shown in Figure 1.

                                                                                                              General Plan
For the 2014-2021 planning period, the entire Specific Plan area has been identified as an opportunity site
to accommodate the fifth cycle RHNA allocation. To facilitate and encourage the development of housing
units affordable to very low- and low-income residents, the Downtown Specific Plan has two districts,
the Downtown Promenade and Urban Village, which both accommodate densities of 35 dwelling units
per acre. These densities exceed the established default density for Perris. The Downtown Promenade
district permits one- to three-story commercial block buildings, stacked flats, or courtyard buildings
with retail uses on the ground floors and office and/or residential uses above. The majority of land zoned
DP is located along “D” Street and west of Perris Boulevard. The Downtown Promenade district has an
average density of 32 dwelling units per acre. The Urban Village district permits three- to five-story
stacked flats, row-houses, courtyard housing, live-work, and mixed-use commercial block buildings. The
Urban Village district allows neighborhood serving commercial uses on the ground floor only with
residential uses above. In order to provide ground floor commercial uses, residential uses must be
provided above. A 100% non-residential use is not permitted. However, a 100% or exclusive residential
use is permitted and strongly encouraged. To demonstrate this, selected sites within the Urban Village
district have been identified exclusively for residential uses. The majority of the area located south of 5th
Street consists of vacant, underutilized sites, which makes this a prime location for residential and
mixed-use infill development. The Urban Village district accommodates densities of 35 dwelling units
per acre and is assumed to accommodate approximately 2,918 dwelling units.
The Specific Plan also identifies three districts that only permit residential uses: Semi-Rural, Suburban,
and Neighborhood. Of the districts identified for exclusively residential development, the City
anticipates that the Urban Village, Suburban and Neighborhood districts will serve as the primary areas
to comply with AB 2348 and accommodate portions of the lower (very-low and low) income RHNA. The
Neighborhood district allows 1 to 3 story detached houses, duplexes, triplexes, courtyard housing, and
row houses at an assumed average density of 20 dwelling units per acre and the Suburban district allows
1 to 2 story detached houses and duplexes at an assumed average density of 15 dwelling units per acre.
Both districts allow only residential development and accommodate densities appropriate for moderate
and lower income households. As there is no maximum permitted density it is assumed that the projects
developed will range in intensity based on their location and the product type allowed. To comply with
AB 2348 provisions the City will ensure that an adequate number of parcels that allow residential only
development are available during the planning period.
In addition the Suburban and Neighborhood districts, the Downtown Specific Plan includes an Urban
Village district that is intended to promote the development of higher density residential uses, with
commercial development allowed only on the first floor of new developments. The Urban Village district
allows 3 to 5 story stacked flats, rowhouses, courtyard housing, live-work, and mixed-use block
buildings. Uses open to neighborhood serving commercial on the ground floor with residential uses
above. The Specific Plan describes the Urban Village district as follows:
         “The intent of the Urban Village is to allow for mixed-use and multiunit residential buildings with first
         floor ancillary commercial uses within walking distance of Downtown and the MetroLink Station. The
         Urban Village is envisioned to include an interior pedestrian paseo that provides access to Downtown
         and the adjacent commercial district. Building heights would range from three to five stories, with parking
         provided on the streets as well as in parking structures and surface lots behind buildings.”
This text restricts the types of development that are allowed in the Urban Village district and ensures
that commercial only projects will not occur. In addition to the text provided describing the
development intent of the land use districts, the Specific Plan also includes a maximum build-out table
establishing the maximum number of units and square footage for each district. Table VII-5, below, is
included in the Specific Plan in Chapter 4, Development Framework. As shown, the Urban Village district

does not provide commercial square footage and is intended for residential uses with first floor ancillary
commercial uses. If retail square footage is created in the Urban Village on the first floor, this would
either, a) decrease the permitted square footage in the total allowed, meaning that more residential units
would be developed in another district, or b) that the density of the residential projects within the Urban
Village would increase, which is typically correlated with more affordability. Given the majority of
residential units will be developed in the Urban Village district, exclusively residential sites totaling
approximately 45 acres and accommodating approximately 1,575 units (at a density of 35 du/ac) have
been selected exclusively for residential uses and are identified in Appendix C .

Vacant Parcels within the Downtown Perris Specific Plan
The downtown is an ideal location for the development of future affordable housing as many public
service buildings such as the library, City Hall, senior center, recreation center, police facilities, medical
clinic, County of Riverside administrative building and the future Metrolink train station are located in
the downtown. In light of this, the City anticipates accommodating the majority of its lower-income
RHNA obligation within the Downtown Specific Plan area. To achieve this there are numerous vacant
parcels throughout the Specific Plan area within each land use district. Table VII-6 provides a summary
of the vacant parcels within the Specific Plan area by land use district, while a parcel specific inventory is
provided in Appendix C.

   Zones that allow mixed use development are calculated at a 50 percent development capacity, except for the Urban Village
district which assumes 75 % residential capacity as non-residential development is only allowed as an ancillary use on the first
floor of buildings. Additionally the City has committed to monitor land in this district to ensure that they meet the provisions of
AB 2348.
2
   The potential unit capacity cannot exceed the maximum buildout assumptions shown in Table VII-2. (i.e.for the Semi-Rural
district is 6 dwelling units for the Specific Plan area and the maximum for Fourth Street Gateway village is 186 units.)
As shown in Table VII-6 there are approximately 98 acres of vacant land in the Specific Plan area that can
accommodate approximately 1,323 residential units. Of the total number of units at least 1,136 units
would be developed on land within districts that allow development products consistent with at least 20
dwelling units per acre. Furthermore, approximately 577 units can be accommodated on land that
permits exclusively residential uses.
Underutilized Sites within the Downtown Perris Specific Plan
In addition to the vacant parcels identified within the Specific Plan area there are a number of
underutilized sites that are developed well below their capacity and are ready for redevelopment.
Current development is concentrated along D Street, including a mix of single-family housing, multi-
family housing, retail, professional, industrial, auto-repair, and underutilized/vacant parcels. There is
generally potential for redevelopment along Perris Boulevard, a smaller arterial that is currently
developed with lower density multi-family housing and underutilized industrial uses located east of D
Street. Another opportunity area includes parcel grouping situated along Perris Boulevard, between First
Street and Third Street. There are several parcels with underutilized uses, adjacent to vacant lots,
presenting ideal opportunities for redevelopment.
Sample Housing Opportunity Sites within the Downtown Perris Specific Plan
To illustrate the development potential of the area, a detailed description and aerial image of specific
sites are provided in the following pages to illustrate examples of housing opportunity sites within the
Specific Plan area to accommodate affordable housing. Sites inventoried are at least an acre in size and
have been identified by City staff or land owners as prime for redevelopment. The City will offer
incentives to further facilitate and encourage the redevelopment of these sites, prioritizing funding
opportunities for extremely low- and very low-income housing.

Acreage: 3.1 acres
Existing Land Use: Vacant
Estimated Housing Potential: 109 units
APNs: 311-120-023 and 311-120-007
Description: Site A is two parcels totaling 3.1
acres. The sites are continuous and located east of D Street adjacent to the 215 northbound on-ramp. The
sites contain a flat surface, look unfinished, and consist of gravel, earth and unmaintained vegetation
growth. The area, configuration of the lots, and prevalence of other residential uses in the vicinity make
this site conducive for residential development.
Affordable Housing Development Incentives and Requirements: The proposed density would allow the
development of 109 units. The City’s Staff would coordinate with developers to market, find qualified
low-income tenants, and administer their resale controls for the affordable units. Depending upon
market conditions and other factors, the entire site could be made affordable. To further encourage and
facilitate the development of affordable units for low- and very low-income families on the site, the City
will offer a menu of development incentive opportunities including: fast track processing, density bonus
incentives, flexibility in development and parking standards, as indicated in the Housing Plan.

                                                      residential homes. The structures occupy only a
                                                      minimal amount of the space on the site.
Approximately 80 percent of the site is paved for vehicular circulation and storage purposes. The existing
cement batch plant is in the process of relocating to another site. The area, configuration of the lots, and
prevalence of other residential uses in the vicinity make this site conducive for conversion to residential
development.

                                                    north of 6th street and is occupied by one separate
                                                    single-story structure. The majority of the site,
                                                    approximately 90 percent, is surface parking for the
                                                    City of Perris Public Works Yard. The two other
                                                    structures on the lot are being used for residential
                                                    purposes. The maintenance level on all structures
appears low and neglected. Dead vegetation is also prominent around the site. The land owner (City of
Perris), area, configuration of the lots, and prevalence of other residential uses in the vicinity makes this
site conducive for residential development
Affordable Housing Development Incentives and Requirements: The proposed density would allow
the development of 44 units. The City’s Staff would coordinate with developers to market, find qualified
low-income tenants, and administer their resale controls for the affordable units. Depending upon
market conditions and other factors, the entire site could be made affordable. To further encourage and
facilitate the development of affordable units for low- and very low-income families on the site, the City
will offer development incentive opportunities including: fast track processing, density bonus incentives,
and flexibility in development and parking standards, as indicated in the Housing Plan.

Accommodation of the 2014-2021 RHNA
The Downtown Specific Plan area has incredible potential as a transit-oriented, multi-modal village for
the City of Perris. Much of the area is currently vacant and underutilized, however the addition of the
Perris Valley Metrolink line will encourage reinvestment and create a positive change. In order for the
Downtown to be revitalized and grow, the population needs to be increased in a strategic pattern of
residential development. The Downtown Specific Plan provides the policies and zoning for this to occur.
Table VII-7 provides a summary of development potential within the Specific Plan area on vacant as well
as developed parcels. To accommodate their 2014-2021 RHNA allocation, the City has identified the
entire Specific Plan area which includes vacant as well as developed and underutilized parcels. Generally,
vacant land opportunities have been given priority as they are more readily available to accommodate
new development; however the City does expect redevelopment of older and underutilized parcels to
occur (see Housing Opportunity Sites). To complete Table VII-7, the acreage and development capacity
for vacant sites within each district were removed from the total acreage and build out assumption to
determine the potential number of units on developed parcels. These generalizations are intended to
show how the City can more than accommodate their RHNA allocation and are not based on real
development projects. Generally, vacant land opportunities have been given priority as they are more
readily available to accommodate new development; however the City does expect redevelopment of
older and underutilized parcels to occur (see Housing Opportunity Sites). Consequently, Table VII-7
first shows the acreage and development capacity for vacant sites within each district which were then
subtracted from the total acreage and build out assumption to determine the potential number of units
on developed parcels. These generalizations are intended to show how the City can more than

As shown in Table VII-8, the City is more than able to accommodate their 2014-2021 RHNA allocation of
4,280 units. Based on the permitted densities, vacant land in the Harvest Landing Specific Plan, New
Perris Specific Plan, Downtown Specific Plan, and the Green Valley Specific Plan can accommodate the
City’s moderate income RHNA allocation of 759 units. These planning areas all allow for densities
between 15 and 20 dwelling units per acre. To accommodate their lower income RHNA, including the
very low and low income allocations, totaling 1,707, the City has identified opportunities in the
Downtown Specific Plan area where development products are anticipated to average at least 35
dwelling units per acre. Table VII-8 also shows that there are numerous opportunities for market rate
housing throughout the City both in and outside of Specific Plan areas. As mentioned previously, a
parcel-specific listing of the sites is provided in Appendix A. In total, the City has zoning in place to

Note: Totals shown in parentheses indicate a surplus of units.
To further encourage the development of affordable units the City anticipates offering development
incentives, such as reductions in parking standards to facilitate lot consolidation of smaller sites to create
opportunities for more intense residential development in the downtown area. This lot consolidation
coupled with development incentives will facilitate the economies of scale necessary for the development
of affordable housing. Action 1.12 of the housing plan implements development incentives to promote lot
consolidation.
Environmental Constraints
Potential environmental constraints to future development of sites identified in Tables VII-2, VII-3, and
VII-4 include the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) and seismic and flooding
hazards, which are addressed in the Non-Governmental Constraints Section of the Housing Element.
Locations identified in the Sites Inventory were compared with all hazards maps included in the City’s
Safety Element; none were found to be within areas that have development restrictions due to risk of
damage from disasters (such as floods, wildfires, or seismic events). The sites inventoried in Tables VII-2,
VII-3, and VII-4 already have a residential land use designation which was determined based on
surrounding land uses and has already examined potential environmental constraints. Aside from the
constraints mentioned above, there are little additional constraints that would impede the development
of new housing units in the future on the identified sites.
Infrastructure
The City’s Land Use Element indicates that several improvements are needed through the Year 2030 to
address: unimproved or deteriorated roadways and roadways without sufficient capacity for anticipated
new development; inadequate storm drain infrastructure; insufficient parkland and recreation facilities;
and inadequate public safety facilities. The City understands that improvements can be achieved with a
comprehensive approach that includes reviewing infrastructure plans for each application for
discretionary approval of General Plan amendments, tentative parcel or tentative tract maps, or
development proposals that includes extension of an existing street or construction of a new street. The
City requires that project applications for new development be reviewed for adequate infrastructure.
Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is enough capacity to service new

Constraints Section of the Housing Element.
B.      RESOURCES
Implementation Tools
A variety of federal, State and local programs are available to create and/or maintain rental and purchase
affordability for lower income households and for persons with special needs. These programs are also
available to other jurisdictions for potential acquisition, subsidy, or replacement of units at-risk. Table
VII-9 summarizes financial resources available to the City, private and non-profit parties to
preserve/create housing that is affordable.
In previous years, the primary source of funds for affordable housing activities in Perris was from the 20
percent Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside fund. The Consolidated Plan 2009–2014 allocated
funding for housing programs during that period, as indicated below:
Provide Assistance to Enable Homeownership
      Homeowners Assistance Program
      Foreclosure Acquisition Program
Rehabilitate and Preserve Ownership Housing
      Substantial Rehabilitation Program
      Senior-Home Repair
      Residential Beautification Program
Expand Affordable Housing through New Construction
     Affordable Housing
On December 29, 2011 the California Supreme Court ruled to uphold ABx1 26, which dissolved all
redevelopment agencies (RDAs) in the State. A companion bill, ABx1 27, which would have allowed
RDAs to continue to exist, was also declared invalid by the court. The court’s decision required that all
RDAs within California be eliminated no later than February 1, 2012. Per Resolution CRA 141, the City of
Perris Redevelopment Agency was dissolved. The Perris Housing Authority was selected to be the
Successor Agency responsible for all of enforceable obligations owed.
The City previously relied on estimated redevelopment housing set-aside revenues ranging from
$624,720 to $656,720 annually to support the development of affordable housing and the implementation
of programs outlined in the Housing Plan. For the 2014-2021 planning cycle, the City is currently
implementing and administering programs provided by the State of California, such as the HOME
Investment Partnership Program to assist first time home buyers and to provide loans for the
rehabilitation of owner-occupied residences, and the HUD Neighborhood Stabilization Program to fund
new construction of single-family homes and to facilitate new ownership of foreclosed homes through
the City’s acquisition, rehabilitation and resale of these homes.

VIII. PROGRESS REPORT
The Progress Report reviews the previous Housing Element’s goals, policies, and implementation actions
that were to be implemented during the previous planning period. The City of Perris’ previous Housing
Element identified seven goals that the City anticipated to achieve during the previous planning period.
Each program has specific policies that were to be accomplished to facilitate the construction of
affordable housing and to maintain the existing affordable housing stock. Each policy consists of
implementation actions with quantified objectives that were to accomplish the goals established in the
Housing Element. Each implementation action had a timeframe for completion along with a responsible
agency to monitor the policies.
The accomplishments are listed on the right column of the table and display the progress, effectiveness,
and appropriateness of the program. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65588, local governments
shall review their Housing Element and evaluate the following:
    1) The progress of the City or County in implementation of the Housing Element;
    2) The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals and
         objectives; and
    3) The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
         attainment of the State housing goal.
The following table reviews the continued progress in implementation, the effectiveness of the Housing
Element, and the appropriateness of the City’s housing goals since 2008.

underutilized land are based on a ratio of 85 percent, which was established in the City’s General Plan as
the average rate for residential development (not including a density bonus) to account for development
standards such as lot coverage requirements, parking, setbacks, open space, infrastructure and public
facilities.
As discussed in Section VI, Housing Constraints Analysis, portions of the City are located within the
Airport Influence Area (AIA) of the March Air Reserve Base (MARB), formerly March Air Force Base
(AFB). The Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) utilizes the Air Installation Compatibility Use Zone
study (AICUZ) as a resource in evaluating development applications within the AIA. Airport Zone maps
were adopted in 1986, but the maps relate back to the categories in the 1984 Riverside County Airport
Land Use Plan (ALUP). Park West Specific Plan (Map 3), Harvest Landing Specific Plan (Map 2), and a
portion of the New Perris Specific Plan (Map 3) are constrained under the existing ALUP. The City
overruled ALUC’s determinations of inconsistency for the Park West and Harvest Land Specific Plans.
The adopted 1984 ALUP is undergoing on update and the current draft text for the new MARB Airport
Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP), the Harvest Landing and Park West Specific Plans are proposed
to be exempted from the Plan’s density limits.
Perris Valley Airport (PVA) is a privately-owned, public-use airport generally located southeast of the
intersection of Ellis Avenue and Goetz Road within the City of Perris. A conflict between the Perris
Valley ALUCP and Specific Plan land use designations occurs within portions of the Green Valley
Specific Plan (Map 5). Coordination between the City of Perris and ALUC has resulted in the provision
of additional Compatibility Policies that allow for development at a greater density and intensity in areas
northerly of Ellis Avenue, including the Downtown Specific Plan (Map 4), than would otherwise have
been provided pursuant to County-wide criteria. The Downtown Specific Plan was reviewed by ALUC
and determined to be consistent with applicable plans in 2010, the Perris Valley ALUCP was designed to
recognize the consistency determination of that Plan.
The Housing Element Land Inventory identifies (via the Airport Constraints column) those parcels
whose residential development potential is constrained by the density restrictions included in either the
1984 Riverside County Airport Land Use Plan, as applied to the March Air Reserve Base Airport
Influence Area, or the Perris Valley Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. Once the Draft MARB ALUCP
is adopted, constraints from the MARB will be modified which will result in less constrained parcels. It
must be noted that current airport constrained parcels are not relied on to meet the City’s RHNA.
It is also important to note for the Downtown Specific Plan, that in some instances the parcel specific
tables may not exactly match the total number of acres or units shown in the Housing Resources section
of the Housing Element. Inconsistencies in the acreage of a district are attributed to the removal of
parcels classified as right of way from the district total and in most instances results in only a small
discrepancy. With regard to unit capacity, the tables shown in this appendix calculate the maximum
development capacity for each individual parcel within the Specific Plan area. Based on this, the total
unit capacity for a given district may exceed the build out assumptions shown in Table VII-2 of the
Housing Resources section. When the total number of units accommodated in a district exceeds the
maximum build out assumptions, the maximum build out assumptions take precedence and cannot be
exceeded.

accommodating land use and development.
Information in this section will inform the
community and its leaders when setting
development priorities, understanding
necessary trade-offs, and choosing among
alternatives.
The City of Perris is divided into ten (10)
Planning Areas (Exhibit LU-1) for purposes
of analysis in Existing Conditions.
Boundaries of some planning areas were
drawn to reflect natural or manmade
physical divisions: the I-215 Freeway and
the San Jacinto River are examples of
manmade       and    natural boundaries,
respectively.     Other planning areas
encompass communities defined by
similarities in land uses or development
patterns: properties in Planning Area 6 are
in Downtown Perris and include the bulk
of the oldest structures and infrastructure
in the City. Yet other planning areas are
comprised of properties whose future
development will be shaped by common
constraints or opportunities: for example,
large, undeveloped parcels covered by
portions of the Multiple Species Habitat
Conservation Plan corridor are joined as
Planning Area 10.
The Existing Conditions section begins
with an overview of the ten Planning Areas.
A summary table of land use characteristics
of each Planning Area follows and provides

This Planning Area is characterized by
low-density residential uses and open

significant infrastructure improvements.
Emergency services response times need to
be addressed because of the distance to
existing police and fire facilities, and
because of the impact of deteriorated
roadways on those response times. New
facilities for fire and police services may
need to be built to accommodate new
growth in this area. The nearest future

Plan area, across the river to the north of
the Planning Area.

              Land Use Map
The Land Use Map shows the locations
and distribution of land in each of the land
use categories identified in the Land Use
Plan (Map provided separate from this
document).
Development Potential
The planning period for the General Plan is
2030.     Rapid growth and consequent
changes in the City of Perris will likely
require significant update of this General
Plan prior to 2030. A planning period
through the year 2030 for the General Plan
was selected, however, so that future traffic
conditions for the City could be projected
using the computer traffic model for
western Riverside County. This model
incorporates development potential and
employment projections included in the
City of Perris General Plan 2030.
The General Plan provides development
data for the base year of 2002, for the year
2030, and at full-build-out consistent with
the General Plan.         Because of the
abundance of undeveloped land in the City
of Perris in 2003, the General Plan assumes
that complete build-out of the City will
occur sometime after the year 2030.
Implementation of the land use plan
including the types of land uses, their
distribution, the density and intensity of
development, and assumptions about the
timeframe within which this development
will occur yields the projections about
residential        and       non-residential
development in Tables LU-26, LU-27 and
LU-28.

     uses. Accident potential risk levels
     in both portions of Zone C2 are
     judged to be moderate to low with
     flight training aircraft activity being
     the primary concerns
   Zone D (Flight Corridor Buffer) -
     is intended to encompass other
     places where aircraft may fly at or
     below 3,000 feet above the airport
     elevation either on arrival or
     departure. Additionally, it includes
     locations near the primary flight
     paths where aircraft noise may be
     loud enough to be disruptive. Direct
     overflights of these areas may occur
     occasionally. Accident potential risk
     levels in this zone are low.
   Zone E (Other Airport Environs) -
     contains the remainder of the
     Airport Influence Area (AIA). Noise
     impacts are low (this area is beyond
     the 55-CNEL noise contour), and
     risk of accidents is low. Airspace
     protection is the major concern in
     that aircraft pass over these areas
     while flying to, from, or around
     March ARB/IPA.
   The High Terrain Zone - serves a
     more focused purpose than the
     preceding eight zones. It is intended
     to identify locations where objects
     may be hazards to the aircraft
     operating in the airport’s airspace
     and require careful review. This zone
     is within the FAR Part 77 surfaces
     for March ARB/IP.

NOTES:
Policies referenced here are from the Riverside County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan adopted by the Riverside County ALUC
for other airports beginning in October 2004. A complete copy of the Riverside County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan is
available on the Riverside County Airport Land Use Commission website at www.rcaluc.org.
1. Residential development must not contain more than the indicated number of dwelling units (excluding secondary units) per gross
acre. Clustering of units is encouraged provided that the density is limited to no more than 4.0 times the allowable average density for
the zone in which the development is proposed. Gross acreage includes the property at issue plus a share of adjacent roads and any
adjacent, permanently dedicated, open lands. Mixed-use development in which residential uses are proposed to be located in
conjunction with nonresidential uses in the same or adjoining buildings on the same site shall be treated as nonresidential
development for the purposes of usage intensity calculations; that is, the occupants of the residential component must be included in
calculating the overall number of occupants on the site. A residential component shall not be permitted as part of a mixed use
development in zones where residential uses are indicated as incompatible. See Countywide Policy 3.1.3(d). All existing residential
development, regardless of densities, is not subject to ALUC authority.
2. Usage intensity calculations shall include all people (e.g., employees, customers/visitors, etc.) who may be on the property at a
single point in time, whether indoors or outside.
3. The uses listed here are ones that are explicitly prohibited regardless of whether they meet the intensity criteria. In addition to
these explicitly prohibited uses, other uses will normally not be permitted in the respective compatibility zones because they do not
meet the usage intensity criteria. See Riverside County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, Volume 1, Appendix D for a full list of
compatibility designations for specific land uses.
4. As part of certain real estate transactions involving residential property within any compatibility zone (that is, anywhere within an
airport influence area), information regarding airport proximity and the existence of aircraft overflights must be disclosed. This
requirement is set by state law. See Countywide Policy 4.4.2 for details. Easement dedication and deed notice requirements indicated
for specific compatibility zones apply only to new development and to reuse if discretionary approval is required. Avigation
easements are to be dedicated to the March Inland Port Airport Authority; the federal government is precluded from receiving
easement dedications. See sample language in www.marchjpa.com/docs_forms/avigationeasement.pdf.
5. The total number of people permitted on a project site at any time, except rare special events, must not exceed the indicated usage
intensity times the gross acreage of the site. Rare special events are ones (such as an air show at the airport) for which a facility is not
designed and normally not used and for which extra safety precautions can be taken as appropriate.
6. Clustering of nonresidential development is permitted. However, no single acre of a project site shall exceed the indicated number
of people per acre. See Countywide Policy 4.2.5 for details.
7. Clear zone (equivalent to runway protection zone at civilian airports) limits that delineate Zone A are derived from locations
indicated in the March Air Reserve Base AICUZ study. Zone A is on Air Base property or otherwise under military control.
8. Hazards to flight include physical (e.g., tall objects), visual, and electronic forms of interference with the safety of aircraft
operations. Land use development that may cause the attraction of birds to increase is also prohibited. Man-made features must be
designed to avoid heightened attraction of birds. In Zones A, B1, and B2, flood control facilities should be designed to hold water for
no more than 48 hours following a storm and be completely dry between storms (see FAA Advisory Circular 150/5200-33B).
Additionally, certain farm crops and farming practices that tend to attract birds are strongly discouraged. These include: certain
crops (e.g., rice, barley, oats, wheat – particularly durum – corn, sunflower, clover, berries, cherries, grapes, and apples); farming
activities (e.g., tilling and harvesting); confined livestock operations (i.e., feedlots, dairy operations, hog or chicken production
facilities, or egg-laying operations); and various farming practices (e.g., livestock feed, water, and manure). Fish production (i.e.,
catfish, trout) conducted outside of fully enclosed buildings may require mitigation measures (e.g., netting of outdoor ponds,
providing covered structures) to prevent bird attraction. Also see Countywide Policy 4.3.7.
9. March ARB must be notified of any land use having an electromagnetic radiation component to assess whether a potential conflict
with Air Base radio communications could result. Sources of electromagnetic radiation include microwave transmission in
conjunction with a cellular tower, radio wave transmission in conjunction with remote equipment inclusive of irrigation controllers
and other similar EMR emissions.
10. Other than in Zone A, construction of a single-family home, including a second unit as defined by state law, on a legal lot of record
is exempted from this restriction where such use is permitted by local land use regulations. Interior noise level standards and
avigation easement requirements for the compatibility zone in which the dwelling is to be located are to be applied.
11. Non-residential uses are limited to 25 people per gross acre in Accident Potential Zone (APZ) I and 50 people per acre in APZ II
and elsewhere in Zone B1. Single-acre intensity limits are 100 people/acre throughout Zone B1.
12. In APZ I, any proposed development having more than 20% lot coverage must not provide on-site services to the public. Zoned
fire sprinklers are required. Also, in APZ I, site design of proposed development should to the extent possible avoid placement of
buildings within 100 feet of the extended runway centerline; this center strip should be devoted to parking, landscaping, and outdoor
storage. Maximum lot coverage is not limited outside the APZs.
13. Within APZ II and outside APZs, two-story buildings are allowed.
14. Storage of aviation fuel and other aviation-related flammable materials on the airport is exempted from this criterion. In APZ I,
manufacture or bulk storage of hazardous materials (toxic, explosive, corrosive) is prohibited unless storage is underground; small
quantities of materials may be stored for use on site. In APZ II and elsewhere within Zone B1, aboveground storage of more than
6,000 gallons of nonaviation flammable materials per tank is prohibited.

15. Examples of noise-sensitive outdoor nonresidential uses that should be prohibited include major spectator-oriented sports
stadiums, amphitheaters, concert halls and drive-in theaters. Caution should be exercised with respect to uses such as poultry farms
and nature preserves.
16. Critical community facilities include power plants, electrical substations, and public communications facilities. See Countywide
Policy 4.2.3(d).
17. For properties in either APZ I or II, any use listed as ―N – not compatible‖ for that particular APZ in Table 3-1 of the 2005 Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone Study for March Air Reserve Base. Beyond the boundaries of the APZs in Zone B1, such uses are
discouraged, but not necessarily prohibited unless otherwise specified herein.
18. All new residences, schools, libraries, museums, hotels and motels, hospitals and nursing homes, places of worship, and other
noise-sensitive uses must have sound attenuation features incorporated into the structures sufficient to reduce interior noise levels
from exterior aviation-related sources to no more than CNEL 40 dB. This requirement is intended to reduce the disruptiveness of
loud individual aircraft noise events upon uses in this zone and represents a higher standard than the CNEL 45 dB standard set by
state and local regulations and countywide ALUC policy. Office space must have sound attenuation features sufficient to reduce the
exterior aviation-related noise level to no more than CNEL 45 dB. To ensure compliance with these criteria, an acoustical study shall
be required to be completed for any development proposed to be situated where the aviation-related noise exposure is more than 20
dB above the interior standard (e.g., within the CNEL 60 dB contour where the interior standard is CNEL 40 dB). Standard building
construction is presumed to provide adequate sound attenuation where the difference between the exterior noise exposure and the
interior standard is 20 dB or less.
19. This height criterion is for general guidance. Shorter objects normally will not be airspace obstructions unless situated at a ground
elevation well above that of the airport. Taller objects may be acceptable if determined not to be obstructions. See Countywide
Policies 4.3.3 and 4.3.4. Objects up to 35 feet in height are permitted. However, the Federal Aviation Administration or California
Department of Transportation Division of Aeronautics may require marking and lighting of certain objects. See Countywide Policy
4.3.6 for details.
20. Discouraged uses should generally not be permitted unless no feasible alternative is available.
21. Although no explicit upper limit on usage intensity is defined for Zone D and E, land uses of the types listed—uses that attract
very high concentrations of people in confined areas—are discouraged in locations below or near the principal arrival and departure
flight tracks.

                                                                                   General Plan
                                                   assure that land use decisions include
                                                   consideration of noise impacts and are
                                                   consistent with the objectives of the Noise
                 Introduction                      Element.
   Defining land use patterns in accordance
   with anticipated noise levels is essential to
   creating and maintaining a high quality of
   life.    The Noise Element provides a
   description of the noise environment of
   the City of Perris as it is now and for the
   future.       The noise environment is
   characterized from the results of noise
   surveys conducted at many locations
   within the City using meters to measure
   sound intensity.
   The Noise Element identifies both
   stationary and mobile noise sources in the
   City which include: vehicle traffic; air
   traffic; the railroad; Perris Auto Speedway;
   March Inland Port; and the Perris Valley
   Airport and Skydiving Center. These are
   the most significant noise generators
   within the City of Perris and should be
   considered in decisions relative to
   placement of noise sensitive land uses.\
   The Noise Element is generally divided
   into three sections:
 I. Existing Noise Conditions provides a
      description and explanation of the
      methods used to gather data and the
      effects different noise levels have on
      people. Noise standards for particular
      land uses are included. This section
      provides noise level data for the City
      measured at multiple locations
II. Future Noise Conditions discusses the
      mobile and stationary noise sources as
      defined above.        The existing and
      projected impacts of these noise sources
      on sensitive land uses and sensitive
      receptors are set forth.
   The Strategy for Action sets forth the
   steps to be taken by the City of Perris to

a difference, since vehicles, and trucks in
particular, make more noise when
climbing grades, compared to travel along
a relatively flat road surface, as the engines
work harder (and louder) to propel the
vehicle uphill.
A number of stationary sources also
generate noise on a regular basis. Much of
this noise occurs at industrial sites that
are generally located away from sensitive
land uses.        Other notable stationary
sources include auto racing events at the
Perris Auto Speedway located adjacent to
the City at the Lake Perris State
Recreational Area, and motorcycle racing
events at the Starwest Motocross Park,
just south of the Speedway.

 The Leq represents the equivalent sound level and is the numeric value of a constant level that over the given period of
 time transmits the same amount of acoustic energy as the actual time-varying sound level. The L02, L08, L25, and L50
 are the levels that are exceeded 2, 8, 25, and 50 percent of the time, respectively. Alternatively, these values represent
 the noise level that would be exceeded for 1, 5, 15, and 30 minutes during a 1-hour period. The Lmin and Lmax
 represent the minimum and maximum root-mean-square noise levels obtained over a period of 1 second.

 The Leq represents the equivalent sound level and is the numeric value of a constant level that over the given period of
 time transmits the same amount of acoustic energy as the actual time-varying sound level. The L02, L08, L25, and L50
 are the levels that are exceeded 2, 8, 25, and 50 percent of the time, respectively. Alternatively, these values represent
 the noise level that would be exceeded for 1, 5, 15, and 30 minutes during a 1-hour period. The Lmin and Lmax
 represent the minimum and maximum root-mean-square noise levels obtained over a period of 1 second.

include the speed of the vehicles, the ratio
of the vehicles (i.e., autos, medium trucks,
and heavy trucks), the roadway logistics
(i.e., distance that traffic is observed as it
approaches/leaves, curvature of the road,
etc.), and the volume of vehicles. A
reasonable worst-case assumes a straight
road and countless iterations of the model
have shown that after about 750 feet, more
distant vehicles do not add measurably to
the modeled noise levels. As such, a
distance of 1,500 feet (i.e., 750 foot
approach and 750 foot departure) was
used in the modeling effort. Traffic was
assumed to operate symmetrically about
the centerline of the road (i.e., 50 percent
on either side).
A value of 10,000 vehicles was modeled at
a distance of 50 feet from the centerline of
the roadway for each noted vehicle ratio
and speed observed throughout the
project area. Actual projected roadway
noise levels are then calculated in a
spreadsheet and referenced to the 10,000
vehicle “standard” at a distance of 50 feet.
For example, if a truck route is projected
to carry 20,000 vehicles per day, the
spreadsheet compares this volume with
that for a truck route that included the
10,000 vehicle standard and raises the
CNEL by 3 dBA accordingly using the
formula:

Overall Findings

Leq noise levels of noise levels of
approximately 83 dBA at the western
property line. Levels of over 73 dBA Leq
were measured in the nearest parts of the
May Ranch residential community to the
south.      The City Municipal Code
addresses noise impacts in terms of the
CNEL and does not set short-term noise
limitations. Still, it is possible to calculate
a CNEL value for these racing events.
Computations were performed, assuming
that racing occurs between 6:30 PM and

purposes. For example, buildings must be
designed to withstand a given duration of
strong ground shaking or a particular
length of seismic wave. When these
factors are estimated in accordance with
the MCE, a margin of safety is built into
the minimum structural requirements of
the California Building Code.
Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment is
based on the potential ground motions
from earthquakes on several faults and the
relative likelihood of each. This type of
assessment is employed by the United
States Geological Survey (USGS) in
producing nationwide seismic hazard maps
that are modified and adopted into the
California Building Code (CBC). Based on
studies by scientists in the National
Seismic Hazard Mapping Program, it has
been determined that ground motion
values for Riverside County are among the
highest in southern California because of
its proximity to major fault systems with
high earthquake recurrence rates. The level
of potential ground motion in Perris is
30%-40% as strong as the pull of gravity.
While this level is considered Very High on
the scale of probable motion, it is lower
than most of the other cities in the County
because many of the areas within the
County fall in the Extremely High
category. Ground motion of this degree
can result in substantial damage (see VIII
and IX in Table S-1).

debris will flow downhill depends on
numerous factors, including soil depth and

cuts or drainage pipes, incongruities in
underlying bedrock, and even the presence
of animal burrows.              Fine-grained

and rapid settlement under relatively
low loads.       Collapsible soils occur
predominately at the base of mountain
ranges where Holocene-age alluvial fan
and wash sediments have been
deposited during rapid run-off events.
Soils prone to collapse are commonly
associated with man-made fill, wind-
lain sands and silts, and alluvial fan and
mudflow sediments deposited during
flash floods.      This includes cut/fill
transition lots built on hillsides where a
portion of the house is built over an area
cut into the hillside, while the rest of the
structure is built over artificial fill.
During an earthquake, even slight
settlement of fill materials can lead to a
differentially settled structure and
significant repair costs. Differential
settlement of structures also typically
occurs when heavily irrigated landscape
areas are near a building foundation.
Examples of common problems
associated with collapsible soils include:
tilting floors, cracking or separation in
structures, sagging floors, and non-
functional windows and doors.

Aircraft Hazards
The City of Perris has two airports within or near its City limits: 1) March Air Reserve
Base/Inland Port Airport (March ARB/IPA), and 2) Perris Valley Airport.
March ARB/IPA
In the 1990s, the Federal Government ceased or reduced military operations at several military
bases throughout the United States. The bases were “realigned” for civilian use and/or military
reserve uses. Subsequent to the base realignment process in 1996, March Air Force Base (AFB)
became March Air Reserve Base (ARB), and portions of the former Air Force base were
reserved for use as a commercial airport. The March Joint Powers Authority (JPA) was
created to oversee conversion and operation of the commercial airport, March GlobalPort.
The JPA includes members of the Riverside County Board of Supervisors and City Council
Members from adjacent cities.
In 1998, the Department of the Air Force completed an Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
(AICUZ) study. The objective of the AICUZ is to achieve compatible uses of public and
private lands in the vicinity of military airfields. The study completed three important tasks:
     Identification of Accident Potential Zones (APZ) and the Clear Zone
     Identification of Noise Impact Zones
     Identification of compatible uses within the above-mentioned zones

In addition to the AICUZ, Airport Influence Area boundaries around March ARB/IPA were
adopted by the County of Riverside Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) in May, 1986 and
became part of the County’s Airport Land Use Plan (ALUP). In 2005, the Department of the
Air Force updated their Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) study. In 2014, the
County of Riverside adopted a new Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP), which
includes the 2014 March ARB/IPA ALUCP. The March ARB/IPA influence areas and safety
zones are shown in Exhibit S-18. Noise contours have also been updated from the previous
2005 AICUZ study as shown in Exhibit S-17. The land use compatibility table guidelines are
shown on Table S-5.
In 2016, the City of Perris adopted an Airport Overlay Zone (Zoning Code Chapter 19.51) to
comply with the 2014 March ARB/IPA ALUCP.
Perris Valley Airport
Perris is also home to the Perris Valley Airport, a small, private airport that is a premiere
location for skydiving and ballooning enthusiasts. The Perris Airport has only an Influence

NX – (no with exceptions) – See notes indicated by the superscript.
NLR – Noise Level Reduction (NLR) (outdoor to indoor) to be achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation measures
into the

A, B, or C – Land use and related structures generally compatible; measures to achieve NLR for A (DNL 65-69 dB), B (DNL
70-
      74dB), C (DNL 75-79 db), need to be incorporated into the design and construction of structures.
A*, B*, and C* - Land use generally compatible with NLR; however, measures to achieve an overall noise level reduction do
not
      necessarily solve noise difficulties and additional evaluation is warranted, See appropriate notes below.
* - The designation of these uses as “compatible” in this zone reflects individual Federal agency and program considerations of
general

2. Within each land use category, uses exist where further deliberating by local authorities might be needed due to the variation
of
     densities in people and structures. Shopping malls and shopping centers are considered incompatible use in any accident
     potential zone (CZ, APZ I, or APZ II).
3. The placement of structures, buildings, or aboveground utility lines in the CZ is subject to severe restrictions. In a majority
of the CZs,
     these items are prohibited. See Air Force Instruction 32-7060, Interagency and Intergovernmental Coordination for
     Environmental Planning, and Air Force Joint Manual 32-8008, Airfield and Heliport Planning Criteria, for specific
     guidance.
4. No passenger terminals and no major aboveground transmission lines in APZ I.
5. Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, and air pollution.
6. Low-intensity office uses only. Meeting places, auditoriums, etc. are not recommended.
7. Excludes chapels.
8. Facilities must be low intensity.
9. Clubhouse not recommended.
10. Areas for gatherings of people are not recommended.
11. a) Although local conditions might require residential use, it is discouraged in DNL 65-69 dB and strongly discouraged
in
     DNL 70-74 dB. The absence of viable alternative development options should be determined, and an evaluation
     indicating a demonstrated community need for residential use would not be met if development were prohibited in these
     zones should be conducted prior to approvals.
     b) Where the community determines the residential uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor-to-indoor noise
     level reduction (NLR) for DNL 65-69 dB and DNL 70-74 dB should be incorporated into building codes and considered
     in individual approvals.
     c) NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning, and design and
     use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor exposure, particularly from near-ground level sources. Measures that
     reduce outdoor noise should be used whenever practical in preference to measure which only protect interior spaces.
12. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL 65-69 dB range must be incorporated into the design
and
     construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the
     normal noise level is low.
13. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL 70-74 dB range must be incorporated into the design
