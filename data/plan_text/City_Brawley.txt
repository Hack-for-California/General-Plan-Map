usually dating from periods of which only vestiges remain.
Arterial—A major street carrying the traffic of local and collector streets to and from freeways and other
major streets, with controlled intersections and generally providing direct access to nonresidential
properties.
Assisted Housing—Generally multi-family rental housing, but sometimes single-family ownership units,
whose construction, financing, sales prices, or rents have been subsidized by federal, state, or local
housing programs including, but not limited to Federal Section 8 (new construction, substantial
rehabilitation, and loan management set asides), Federal Sections 213, 236, and 202, Federal Section
221(d)(3) (below market interest rate program), Federal Section 101 (rent supplement assistance), CDBG,
FmHA Section 515, multi-family mortgage revenue bond programs, local redevelopment and in lieu fee
programs, and units developed pursuant to local inclusionary housing and density bonus programs.
A-Weighted Decibel (dBA)—A numerical method of rating human judgment of loudness. The A-
weighted scale reduces the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing.
Base Flood Elevation—The highest elevation, expressed in feet above sea level, of the level of flood
waters expected to occur during a 100-year flood (i.e., a flood that has 1 percent likelihood of occurring in
any given year).
Benefit Assessment District—An area within a public agency’s boundaries which receives a special
benefit from the construction of one or more public facilities. A Benefit Assessment District has no legal
life of its own and cannot act by itself. It is strictly a financing mechanism for providing public
infrastructure as allowed under the Streets and Highways Code. Bonds may be issued to finance the
improvements, subject to repayment by assessments charged against the benefitting properties. Creation
of a Benefit Assessment District enables property owners in a specific area to cause the construction of
public facilities or to maintain them (for example, a downtown, or the grounds and landscaping of a
specific area) by contributing their fair share of the construction and/or installation and operating costs.
Bicycle Lane (Class II facility) —A corridor expressly reserved for bicycles, existing on a street or
roadway in addition to any lanes for use by motorized vehicles.

bicycle route has no pavement markings or lane stripes.
Bikeways—A term that encompasses bicycle lanes, bicycle paths, and bicycle routes.
Blight—A condition of a site, structure, or area that may cause nearby buildings and/or areas to decline in
attractiveness and/or utility. The Community Redevelopment Law (Health and Safety Code, Sections
33031 and 33032) contains a definition of blight used to determine eligibility of proposed redevelopment
project areas.
Buffer—A strip of land designated to protect one type of land use from another with which it is
incompatible. Where a commercial district abuts a residential district, for example, additional use, yard,

prepared and certified as to its adequacy before taking action on the proposed project. General Plans
require the preparation of a “program EIR.”
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)—A State agency, established by the Housing and Home
Finance Act of 1975, which is authorized to sell revenue bonds and generate funds for the development,
rehabilitation, and conservation of low and moderate income housing.
Caltrans—California Department of Transportation.
Capital Improvement Program (CIP)—A proposed timetable or schedule of all future capital
improvements (government acquisition of real property, major construction project, or acquisition of long
lasting, expensive equipment) to be carried out during a specific period and listed in order of priority,
together with cost estimates and the anticipated means of financing each project. Capital improvement
programs are usually projected five or six years in advance and should be updated annually.
Census—The official decennial enumeration of the population conducted by the federal government.
City—City, with a capital “C,” generally refers to the government or administration of a city. City, with
a lower case “c” may mean any city, or may refer to the geographical area of a city (e.g., the city’s

operation of public facilities, as well as provide public services to district residents. Special tax
assessments levied by the district are used to repay the bonds.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)—The average equivalent sound level during a 24-hour
day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and
after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. See also
“A-Weighted Decibel.”
Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA)—A local agency created under California Redevelopment
Law, or a local legislative body which has elected to exercise the powers granted to such an agency, for
the purpose of planning, developing, replanning, redesigning, clearing, reconstructing, and/or
rehabilitating all or part of a specified area with residential, commercial, industrial, and/or public
(including recreational) structures and facilities. The redevelopment agency’s plans must be compatible
with adopted community general plans.
Compatibility—The characteristics of different uses or activities that permit them to be located near each
other in harmony and without conflict. The designation of permitted and conditionally permitted uses in
zoning districts are intended to achieve compatibility within the district. Some elements affecting
compatibility include: intensity of occupancy as measured by dwelling units per acre; pedestrian or
vehicular traffic generated; volume of goods handled; and such environmental effects as noise, vibration,
glare, air pollution, or the presence of hazardous materials. On the other hand, many aspects of
compatibility are based on personal preference and are much harder to measure quantitatively, at least for
regulatory purposes.
Condominium—A building, or group of buildings, in which units are owned individually, and the
structure, common areas and facilities are owned by all the owners on a proportional, undivided basis.
Congestion Management Plan (CMP)—A mechanism employing growth management techniques,
including traffic level of service requirements, development mitigation programs, transportation systems
management, and capital improvement programming, for the purpose of controlling and/or reducing the
cumulative regional traffic impacts of development. AB 1791, effective August 1, 1990, requires all
cities, and counties that include urbanized areas, to adopt and annually update a Congestion Management
Plan.
Congregate Care Housing—Generally defined as age segregated housing built specifically for the
elderly which provides services to its residents, the minimum of which is usually an on-site meal
program, but which may also include housekeeping, social activities, counseling, and transportation.
There is generally a minimum health requirement for acceptance into a congregate facility as most do not
offer supportive health care services, thus differing from a nursing home. Residents usually have their
own bedrooms and share common areas such as living rooms, dining rooms, and kitchens; bathrooms
may or may not be shared.
Conservation—The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction or neglect.
Cooperative—A group of dwellings or an apartment building that is jointly owned by the residents, the
common ownership including the open space and all other parts of the property. The purchase of stock
entitles the buyer to sole occupancy, but not the individual ownership of a specified unit.
Council of Governments (COG)—A regional planning and review authority whose membership
includes representation from all communities in the designated region. The Southern California

transportation facilities.
Cumulative Impact—As used in CEQA, the total impact resulting from the accumulated impacts of
individual projects or programs over time.
Day-Night Average Level (Ldn)—The average equivalent sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained
after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. See also
“Community Noise Equivalent Level.”
Decibel (dB)—A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, as it is heard by the human ear. See also “A-
Weighted Decibel,” “Community Noise Equivalent Level,” and “Day-Night Average Level.”
Dedication—The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the
acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public function
for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses often are made
conditions for approval of a development by a city.
Density—The number of families, individuals, dwelling units or housing structures per unit of land;
usually density is expressed “per acre.” Thus, the density of a development of 100 units occupying 20
acres is 5.0 units per acre.
Density Bonus—The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate additional
square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned, usually
in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the same site or at another location.
Density Transfer—A way of retaining open space by concentrating densities, usually in compact areas
adjacent to existing urbanization and utilities, while leaving unchanged historic, sensitive, or hazardous
areas.
Developer—An individual who or business which prepares raw land for the construction of buildings or
causes to be built physical building space for use primarily by others, and in which the preparation of the
land or the creation of the building space is in itself a business and is not incidental to another business or
activity.
Development—The division of a parcel of land into two or more parcels; the construction,
reconstruction, conversion, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any structure; any mining,
excavation, landfill or land disturbance, and any use or extension of the use of land.

features and locations of proposed utility services.
Development Rights—The right to develop land by a land owner who maintains fee simple ownership
over the land or by a party other than the owner who has obtained the rights to develop. Such rights
usually are expressed in terms of density allowed under existing zoning. For example, one development
right may equal one unit of housing or may equal a specific number of square feet of gross floor area in
one or more specified zone districts.

INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN
Need for a Revised Plan and Previous Planning Efforts
The effectiveness of a City's General Plan is contingent upon the practical applicability of the Plan to
changing priorities and conditions. Monitoring and reevaluating the validity of the General Plan
policies and periodically amending the Plan are essential to ensure its continued consistency and
usefulness. A comprehensive update of the Plan should be undertaken every five years to ensure
that the Plan accurately reflects the City policies, conforms to any changes in State law, reflects
current court decisions, and provides an integrated and internally consistent set of goals, objectives,
and policies designed to reflect the changing characteristics and growth of the community.
The most recent comprehensive update to the General Plan was prepared by the City of Brawley in
1995. Amendments to the General Plan have occurred since then and the Housing Element was last
updated in 2001. As a result, the Brawley City Council authorized a program in 2005 to begin to
undertake a comprehensive update of the General Plan with a planning horizon to 2030.
Location and Setting
The City of Brawley is located in central Imperial County, which is in the southeastern corner of
California near the Mexican border as shown in Figure INT–1. Brawley is located approximately 6
miles southeast of the City of Westmorland, approximately 9 miles to the south of the City of
Calipatria, 9 and 12 miles north of the Cities of Imperial and El Centro respectively, and
approximately 21 miles north of Calexico situated along the Mexican border. Within the context of
the County, Brawley is located at the intersection of State Route 78 with State Route 86 and State
Route 111. The New River flows from the southwest to the northern portion of the Brawley
Planning Area and the Union Pacific Railroad generally extends north-to-south and bisects central
Brawley.
Imperial County is located in a broad desert that has been transformed to productive agricultural
lands by the importation of irrigation water. The City of Brawley has historically played a
significant role in the agricultural economy that characterizes Imperial County. Brawley's strategic
crossroads location at several major highways and the railroad facilitates easy access for residents
and visitors, and regional shipping services. The City continues to provide a unique urban setting
for residential, commercial, agribusiness, and industrial uses. The City is distinguished by a historic
downtown commercial and civic center surrounded by a variety of distinct residential
neighborhoods, parks, some industrial development, agriculture, and a municipal airport. The
landscape around the urbanized areas is dominated by agricultural fields, scattered farmhouses, and
related agricultural structures. Scenic views are enjoyed throughout Brawley including panoramic
views of the stark topography of the Chocolate Mountains in the east and the foothills of the
Peninsular Range in the west, the New River riparian corridor, and agricultural open space.

Brawley Planning Area
The Brawley Planning Area consists of
approximately 10,845 acres and encompasses
the City’s incorporated areas and the City’s
Sphere of Influence (SOI). The City’s
incorporated areas and the SOI include
approximately 4,902 acres and 5,943 acres
respectively as shown in Figure INT-2. The
SOI includes areas that are currently under
the jurisdiction of Imperial County but are
expected to be annexed and incorporated into
the City’s boundary. The Sphere of Influence
was last approved by the Imperial Valley
                                                                    The New River
Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) in 2006 as the City’s probable
ultimate physical boundaries and service area and is to be updated at least once every five years.
History of Brawley
In 1902, J.H. Braly, a Los Angeles investor, was assigned 4,000 acres of land in the center of the
area representing the present-day City of Brawley. U.S. Government Circular No. 9 was shortly
released after Braly took control of the land and it claimed that nothing would grow in the desert
area of Imperial Valley, even with plentiful water. In response to this news, Braly sold the land to
G.A. Carter who shortly sold the land to the Imperial Land Company.
In defiance of the government circular, the Imperial Land Company ordered the new town plotted
and began promoting the agricultural potential of the area. Colorado River water was initially
diverted to Imperial Valley in 1901 and irrigated agriculture in the Valley was showing promise.
People had already begun to call the new townsite "Braly." However, Mr. Braly prohibited the use
of his name for the town because he was convinced the town would fail miserably. A.H. Heber, one
of the principals of the Imperial Land Company, suggested that the town be named Brawley: "I
have a friend in Chicago named Brawley - we'll name the town after him," said Mr. Heber. The
town developed that year with approximately a dozen tent houses and the railroad reached Brawley
in September 1903. Due to the town's location at the end of the rail, new immigrants hopped off the
train and often remained in Brawley for a while. By Christmas of 1903, the town's success was sure.
Brawley incorporated as a City in 1908. The City initially served as a bedroom community for
farmers and cattlemen working in the central part of Imperial Valley. Due to the historic location of
Brawley along the railroad, the City also served as an important trading and shipping center. For
many years, Brawley contained the largest concentration of people in Imperial Valley.

During World War II, the City of El Centro exceeded Brawley’s population due to the large military
installations located near El Centro and Brawley consequently had become the second largest city in
the Valley. Today, the cities of El Centro and Calexico each surpass the population of Brawley as a
result in part to their advantageous position near Interstate 8 and the international border. According
to the Southern California Association of Governments’ 2005 projections, the population within the
City of Brawley is 25,216. As such, Brawley is the third most populous city in Imperial County
after El Centro and Calexico.
Brawley’s strategic crossroads location with several major highways and the railroad as well as the
City’s proximity to Mexico continue to provide convenient access and opportunities for residents,
visitors and businesses. The City’s employment base, low cost of living, historic character, and
recreational opportunities have made Brawley an attractive place to live.
Purpose of the General Plan
California State law requires each City to
adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan
to guide the physical development of the
incorporated city and any land outside of the
city boundaries, which bears a relationship to
its planning activities. In essence, a city's
general plan serves as the blueprint for future
growth and development. As a blueprint for
the future, the plan must contain policies and
programs designed to provide decision makers
with a solid basis for land use related
decisions.                                                          Brawley’s City Hall
The general plan must address many issues which are directly related to and influence land use
decisions. In addition to land use, State law requires that the plan address circulation, housing, the
conservation of natural resources, the preservation of open space, the noise environment, and the
protection of public safety. These issues are to be discussed to the extent that they apply to a
particular jurisdiction. The general plan may also cover topics of special or unique interest to a city,
such as growth management and economic development.
A Vision for the Future
Whether the General Plan is a blueprint, a constitution, or set of instructions, it must be focused on a
community vision. The General Plan’s vision statement is to be achieved by the plan’s goals,
objectives, and policies. The following vision statement was instrumental in preparing General Plan
and was derived from input during the public participation process.
Vision Statement: In 2030, the City of Brawley is a desirable community that has retained its quiet,
safe, small town “village” character, a revitalized downtown, predominantly single-family character

amid the beauty of its natural open spaces, parks, the New River corridor, and stunning mountain
views. Gateways identify and beautify the City’s unique character. The downtown is vibrant,
attractive, and caters to the City’s residents with a variety of excellent dining establishments, coffee
shops, movie and civic theatres, public art, and local serving businesses, within a walkable,
pedestrian scale village atmosphere. Neighborhoods and homes are well maintained, with rich
landscaping and diverse housing styles that are in scale with their neighborhoods and allow for a
range of incomes and a variety of life stages. A wide variety of recreational opportunities are
incorporated throughout the City and linked by a comprehensive pedestrian and bike trail system.
The City supports balanced growth and the preservation of agriculture. The environmental
restoration along the New River allows for scenic and recreational opportunities. Educational
facilities, such as the extension of San Diego State University, continue to achieve the highest
academic standards in up-to-date facilities. And, a diversity of employment opportunities,
particularly higher income, non-seasonal, and youth oriented, enables residents to work within their
community.
Organization of the General Plan
State Mandated Elements
The Brawley General Plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of State law and
addresses all required issues and topics. The Plan contains the Introduction to the General Plan,
seven General Plan elements, the Implementation Program, and the General Plan Glossary. The
elements and the Implementation Program consist of the bulk of the General Plan. The seven
elements consist of the following:
    Land Use
    Infrastructure
    Resource Management
    Open Space/Recreation
    Public Safety/Noise
    Economic Development
    Housing (The Housing Element is required to be updated every five years and is typically bound
     under a separate cover)
Each of the General Plan elements examines a specific issue area, such as land use, resource
management, or infrastructure. Despite the subject division, each element's content partially
overlaps with other elements. Table INT-1 illustrates the relationship between the seven elements of
the Brawley General Plan and the seven State-mandated general plan elements.

Organization of the General Plan Elements
Each of the seven updated General Plan elements is organized according to the following format:
    Introduction
    Goals, Objectives, and Policies
    Plan
The Introduction section describes the purpose and focus of the element. It also lists other plans and
programs that are not a part of the General Plan that were used to help formulate General Plan
policies or which may be used to achieve specific General Plan policies. Many of the related
programs or plans relate to more than one element, and, as a result, each will be identified in the
appropriate element but discussed in the General Plan’s Introduction Chapter.
The Goals, Objectives, and Policies section presents the City's long-term desires for the subject area
of each element. A goal is a general expression of community values and, therefore, may be abstract
in nature. Consequently, a goal is generally not quantifiable or time-dependent. An objective is a
specified end, condition, or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining a goal. An objective
may pertain to one particular aspect of a goal or it may be one of several successive steps toward
goal achievement. Consequently, there may be more than one objective for each goal. A policy is a
specific statement that guides decision- making. It indicates a commitment of the local legislative

General Plan Update                                    INT-9
                                                                                                 J&S 00136.07

body to a particular course of action. A policy is based on and helps implement a general plan’s
objectives. A policy is carried out by implementation measures contained in the Implementation
Program of the General Plan.
Each element also contains a Plan section. The plan provides an overview of the City's course of
action to implement the identified goals, objectives, and policies. For example, the Land Use
Element contains a "Land Use Plan" which indicates the types and intensities of land use permitted
city-wide. Wherever possible, the plans contain illustrative maps, figures, and tables.
Implementation Chapter and Glossary
Following the elements is the Implementation Chapter, which identifies specific actions to achieve
the policies identified in each General Plan element. The Implementation Chapter should be
reviewed and updated periodically to help identify specific actions, schedules, responsible parties,
and measures to ensure that General Plan policies are implemented. The General Plan’s Glossary
provides a set of definitions for terms used in the General Plan, which require clarification and
understanding.
How to Use the General Plan

them and to quickly obtain a perspective on the City's policies on the subject. However, those using
the General Plan should realize that the Plan policies in the different sections are interrelated and
should be viewed comprehensively. Since Plan policies are presented as both written statements and
figures, both must be referred to when making planning decisions.
The General Plan is not a zoning ordinance or map. The General Plan text and figures are intended
to provide general, broad direction for long-range planning and should be used as a policy guide
only. The Zoning Ordinance or subsequent specific plans, on the other hand, are specific
implementation mechanisms, which must be consistent with the goals, objectives, policies, and
standards contained in the General Plan.

Public Participation Process
The public played an important role in the
preparation of the General Plan. Citizen input
was essential in formulating goals, objectives,
and policies. Public participation in the
General Plan preparation process occurred
through the following methods, which assisted
City decision makers:
    City staff identified local stakeholder
     groups and created the General Plan
     Advisory Committee (GPAC), a group of
     individuals appointed by the City Council
     representing the stakeholders groups the
     City identified to oversee the General Plan                 General Plan Public Workshop
     process. A series of GPAC meetings were
     held to discuss the General Plan update
     and gather input.
    Two public workshops were held in two different locations in the City to both inform the
     citizens about the General Plan process, and gather input and maximize participation. A separate
     session was also held with a Brawley High School government class to gain the unique
     perspective of local youth. At each meeting, a questionnaire was distributed and tabulated
     regarding what aspects of land use are most important to the residents of Brawley, including
     quality of life considerations.
Relationship to Related Plans, Programs, and Ordinances
Long-range comprehensive planning in the General Plan must be linked to the on-going actions of
the City, and the State of California requires consistency of certain local actions with the General
Plan. An action, program, or project is considered consistent with the General Plan if it furthers the
objectives and policies of the General Plan and does not obstruct the attainment of these objectives
and policies.
Following is a list of provisions in State law that requires local actions as well as related plans and
programs. These laws and related plans and programs were used to help formulate General Plan
policies and/or may be used to achieve specific General Plan policies. Some of the various
documents below that are within control of the City may need to be revised to reflect the updated
General Plan. Part of the purpose of the General Plan Update is to help provide the impetus to
update other local planning documents.
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Act
Special studies zones, usually one-quarter mile or less in width, along the traces of potentially and
City of Brawley                                                                               September 2008

recently active major faults are delineated by the State Geologist and the affected city or county must
inform the public of their locations. Disclosure of these zones may be by reference in the general
plan and on other local maps. Proposed development plans within these zones must be accompanied
by a registered geologist's report which describes any possibility of a surface rupture (Public
Resources Code Section 2621 et. seq.).
Brawley Economic Development Commission
The Brawley Economic Development Commission (BEDC) was formed as an arm of the Chamber
of Commerce in late 1990. BEDC efforts to promote economic development include: 1) internal
marketing to generate interest in the community's future; 2) targeting of specific industries that are
appropriate for the community (food/beverage processing, electronic and computer components
assembly, pharmaceuticals/biotech); and 3) expansion of tourism and related activities. The BEDC
Board includes business leaders, community activists, and other leaders within the community who
are interested in Brawley's future and wish to promote its economic growth.
Brawley Municipal Airport Master Plan, 2003
The overall intent of this master plan is to provide a guide for improvements made to the airport and,
when approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will outline a program containing
elements eligible for federal assistance.
California Air Resources Board
In California, CARB, which became part of the California Environmental Protection Agency
(CalEPA) in 1991, is responsible for meeting the state requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act
(FCAA), administering the California Clean Air Act (CCAA), and establishing the California
Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). The CCAA, as amended in 1992, requires all air districts
in the State to endeavor to achieve and maintain the CAAQS. The CAAQS are generally more
stringent than the corresponding federal standards and incorporate additional standards for sulfates,
hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibly reducing particles. CARB regulates mobile air pollution
sources, such as motor vehicles. The agency is responsible for setting emission standards for
vehicles sold in California and for other emission sources, such as consumer products and certain
off-road equipment. CARB established passenger vehicle fuel specifications, which became
effective in March 1996. CARB oversees the functions of local air pollution control districts and air
quality management districts, which in turn administer air quality activities at the regional and
county levels.
California Environmental Quality Act Law and Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the State legislature in response
to a public mandate that called for a thorough environmental analysis of those projects that might
adversely affect the environment. The provisions of the law, review procedure, and any subsequent
analysis are described in the CEQA Law and Guidelines. CEQA will continue to be instrumental in
ensuring that the impacts of all potentially significant projects are assessed and mitigated.

wildlife resources of the State. Special permits are required for any lake or stream alterations,
dredging, or other activities that may affect fish and game habitat.
California General Plan Guidelines, 2003
The 2003 General Plan Guidelines serve as a valuable reference for cities and counties in the
preparation of local general plans. It is our hope that the General Plan Guidelines will be useful not
only to city and county planning staffs, but to elected officials, planning consultants, and members of
the public.
Caltrans Project Study Report for the New Expressway Connecting State Route 86
     to State Route 111
The Caltrans Project Study Report addresses the construction of a four-lane divided expressway
from State Route 86, northwest of the City of Brawley, to State Route 111, southeast of Brawley.
The proposed improvements represent realignment and upgrading of State Route 86 and State Route
78. The project is part of a series of projects planned to address the regional highway concerns in the
Imperial Valley and provide for improved international and interstate movement of goods. Under
this alternative, regional through traffic will be diverted around the City.
Capital Improvements
Government Code Sections 65401 and 65402 require a review and report on the consistency of
proposed city, county and special district capital projects, including land acquisition and disposal,
with the General Plan.
City of Brawley Bicycle Master Plan, 2002
The primary purpose of the Brawley Bicycle Master Plan is to identify a system of bicycle routes
that will serve as a tool for planning future bicycle facilities and roadway improvements. This plan
is intended to provide a fair assessment of bicycle needs, planning opportunities, bicycle routes,
implementation costs, and funding opportunities. The Plan reassessed the existing bicycle network,
provided recommendations for improving bicycle facilities and developed a priority list for
implementation.
City of Brawley Department of Parks and Recreation Comprehensive Five Year Plan
The City Department of Parks and Recreation Comprehensive Five Year Plan was last updated in
1999 and addresses the issues, conditions, and resources affecting the delivery of park and recreation
services to Brawley residents. The City Department of Parks and Recreation is currently in the
process of completing the draft Park and Recreation Five Year Plan (2010). The plan addresses the
current park and recreation system and the potential for expansion, the evaluation of existing
resources, the establishment of open space and facility standards, and the identification of major
issues impacting the current system.

City of Brawley Downtown Revitalization Project, 1989
The City of Brawley Downtown Revitalization Project identifies a series of streetscape
improvements tailored to the evolving character of Brawley and integrates the desires and wishes of
local residents and merchants. It presents a gateway improvement program along Brawley’s major
entry thoroughfares. And, it identifies improvement ideas for the downtown’s architectural facades.
City of Brawley Emergency Operations Plan
The City of Brawley Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) was adopted in 2001 to ensure the most
effective and economical use of all resources (material and manpower) for the maximum benefit and
protection of the local population during emergency events. The objectives of the EOP are to
incorporate and coordinate all the facilities and personnel of the City into an efficient organization
capable of reacting adequately during natural or man-made disasters. The EOP provides responses
to drought, earthquake, flood, civil disorder, hazardous material incident, nuclear attack, power
failure, and radiological incident.
City of Brawley Noise Ordinance/Conditions of Approval
The City's noise ordinance, permitted by the State of California Health and Safety Code, provides a
basis for controlling excessive and annoying noise. The production of loud or unusual noise is
considered a public nuisance when it interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property of
the inhabitants of the surrounding neighborhood. The creation of a public nuisance is a
misdemeanor offense and violators are subject to civil action. The noise ordinance requires permits
for loudspeakers and sound amplifiers with the exception of movie theaters. Where applicable, the
City routinely applies several noise-related conditions of approval to a development before issuing
building permits. These conditions identify the proposed project as located in a noise impact area
and require that mitigation be provided as necessary to ensure compliance with the City's noise
exposure standards.
City of Brawley Redevelopment Plan, 2007
The City adopted the Redevelopment Plan in 2007. The purposes and objectives of this
Redevelopment Plan are to revitalize areas within the Redevelopment Project Area.
City of Brawley Service Area Plan, 2007
The City of Brawley Service Area (SAP) is intended to demonstrate the City’s intent and ability to
provide adequate services and facilities to the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) boundaries at the
time of future annexations. The plan addresses police and fire service, water, sewer, circulation,
parks and recreation, flood control, and city administration. In the plan, the methods to meet the
increasing demands are identified and financing mechanisms are discussed for each type of public
service. The SAP was last updated in 2007 and must be updated at least every five years.
City of Brawley Unreinforced Masonry Ordinance

1986 state Unreinforced Masonry Building Law. This state law requires local governments to
inventory URM buildings and establish earthquake hazard mitigation programs. The City's URM
Ordinance, which was revised in 1995, provides minimum standards for structural seismic resistance
to reduce the risk of life loss or injury during an earthquake. Conformance with the ordinance is
voluntary to allow for sensitivity to the financial needs of property owners and ensure the
preservation of Brawley's building stock.
City of Brawley Wastewater Master Plan, 1999
The City updated its Master Plan for the Wastewater Collection System in 1999, which recommends
facility and maintenance improvements for the wastewater infrastructure. The Wastewater Master
Plan will be updated as needed and is dependent upon the amount of new development.
City of Brawley Water Master Plan, 1999
The City of Brawley recently prepared a Water Master Plan in 1999, which identifies existing
deficiencies as well as increased demand from additional growth in the water service system, (i.e.,
treatment plant and distribution pipelines and pumps) and provides recommendations for
improvement projects. The Waster Master Plan will be updated as needed and is dependent upon
the amount of new development.
Cobey-Alquist Flood Plain Management Act
As state policy, this legislation encourages local governments to plan, adopt, and enforce land use
regulations for flood plain management, as well as identifying requirements for receiving state
financial assistance for flood control.
Community Redevelopment Agency
The Brawley Community Redevelopment Agency was formed in 1976 in accordance with
California Community Redevelopment Law (Health & Safety Code, Section 33000, et seq.) by the
City of Brawley to design and implement a Redevelopment Plan for a defined Redevelopment
Project Area within the City. The Brawley City Council serves as the Redevelopment Agency
Board, although the Agency is legally a separate entity from the City of Brawley. The purpose of
the Redevelopment Plan implemented by the Agency is to improve, rehabilitate, and redevelop land
within the Project Area that is characterized by conditions of blight that place a serious physical,
social or economic burden on the community. The City adopted the Redevelopment Plan in 2007.
The purposes and objectives of this Redevelopment Plan are to revitalize areas within the
Redevelopment Project Area.
County Right-To-Farm Ordinance
In response to potential threats to agricultural productivity posed by increased non-agricultural land
uses, the County adopted the Right-to-Farm Ordinance in 1990. The ordinance requires that existing
and potential owners of property near agricultural lands be notified that they may be subject to
inconvenience or discomfort from the nearby agricultural operations. Existing and potential owners
must also be notified that they must be willing to accept such inconvenience or discomfort as a

supports agricultural activity and clarifies the circumstances under which agricultural operations
may be considered a nuisance.
Development Agreements
Government Code Section 65867.5 requires that development agreements between developers and
local governments be consistent with the General Plan.
Hazardous Waste Management
Chapter 1504 of the Statutes of 1986 (Tanner Bill) requires each county to prepare a countywide
hazardous waste management plan. Each county plan is then to be incorporated into the general
plans of all cities within the county’s jurisdiction.
Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP)
Each county must either incorporate the applicable portions of its HWMP into its general plan by
reference, or adopt an ordinance requiring its land use decisions to be consistent with the portions of
the adopted HWMP that identify specific sites or siting criteria for hazardous waste facilities.
Within 180 days after approval of a county plan by the State Department of Health Services (DHS),
each city within the county is required to: (1) adopt a city HWMP that is consistent with the
approved county plan; (2) incorporate the applicable portions of the county plan into the city's
general plan by reference; and (3) adopt an ordinance requiring its land use decisions to be
consistent with those portions of the county HWMP which identify specific sites or siting criteria for
hazardous waste facilities. In addition to county HWMPs, DHS is required to prepare and adopt a
State HWMP which is reviewed annually and revised every three years (Health & Safety Code
Section 25135 et. seq.).
Imperial County Air Pollution Control District’s Air Quality Attainment Plan, 1991
The Air Quality Attainment Plan is the region’s plan for improving air quality. It addresses the
Federal Clean Air Act and California Clean Air Act requirements and demonstrates attainment with
ambient air quality standards. Imperial County adopted the 1991 Air Quality Attainment Plan for
Ozone and the 1993 State Implementation Plan (SIP) for PM10.
Imperial County Air Pollution Control District’s Rules and Regulations
The APCD Rules and Regulations are adopted by the Air Pollution Control Board and apply to the
area and activities within the County of Imperial and incorporated cities. Air districts must
implement rules and regulations and provide enforcement for the attainment and maintenance of the
California and national ambient air quality standards. The purpose of the rules and regulations is to
provide the Air District with a sound method for mitigating the emissions produced from the
operation of new commercial and residential development projects throughout the County of
Imperial and incorporated cities. The current important rules for developments are the Fugitive Dust
Rules (e.g., Rule 800 – 806) and Operational Development Fees (e.g., Rule 310). All project
proponents are required to control fugitive dust emissions and reduce exhaust emissions. They have

combination of both. These rules will assist the Air District in attaining the state and federal ambient
air quality standards for PM10 and Ozone.
Imperial County General Plan, 2006
The Imperial County General Plan was recently revised in 2006. The County’s General Plan
contains valuable information that will help the guide the County’s long term growth, which
includes the City of Brawley.
Imperial Irrigation District Water Conservation Programs
January 1990 marked the inception of construction activities by the Imperial Irrigation District (IID)
to implement 15 new projects in the Water Conservation Program. These projects were identified in
the landmark December 1988 Water Conservation Agreement between IID and the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California and in the December 1989 Approval Agreement among IID,
MWD, Palo Verde Irrigation District and Coachella Valley Water District. Major construction work
was completed in December 1997 while construction of the last project was completed in September
1998. The water conservation projects implemented through the agreement primarily focus on
increasing the efficiency of the IID's water conveyance system and conserving water in agricultural
operations.
Integrated Waste Management Act, 1989
In 1989, the state comprehensively revised its approach to solid waste management and established
the goal of reducing the state’s production of solid waste by 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by
2000. The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 codified this approach.
Landslide Hazard Identification Program
Under the Landslide Hazard Identification Program, the State Geologist is required to prepare maps
of landslide hazards within urban and urbanizing areas. Public agencies are encouraged to use these
maps in land use planning and decision making related to building, grading, and development
permits (Public Resources Code Section 2687 ([a]).

Element of the General Plan.
Government Code Section 65910 requires that every city and county adopt open space provisions in
their zoning ordinances consistent with the Open Space Element of the General Plan.
Parking Authority Projects
Street and Highway Code Section 32503 requires that parking authorities, in planning and locating
any parking facility, are “subject to the relationship of the facility to any officially adopted master
plan or sections of such master plan for the development of the area in which the authority functions
to the same extent as if it were a private entity.” The location of a parking facility, therefore, must
be consistent with the General Plan.
Project Review under California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
Title 14, California Administrative Code Section 15080 requires that, to the extent possible the
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) process be combined with the existing planning, review, and

Reservations of land with subdivisions
Government Code Section 66479 requires that reservations of land for parks, recreational facilities,
fire stations, libraries, and other public uses within a subdivision conform to the General Plan.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act requires the State Geologist to compile maps describing seismic
hazard zones. Guidelines prepared by the State Mining and Geology Board establish policies and
criteria identifying state and local agency responsibilities for development in seismic hazard areas.
Approval of development on a site within seismic hazard zones requires the preparation of a
geotechnical report and local agency consideration of the policies and criteria established by the
Mining and Geology Board (Public Resources Code Section 2690 et. seq.). Information contained
in the seismic hazard maps must be taken into account when preparing or amending the Safety
Element of a general plan.
Southern California Association of Governments Regional Comprehensive Plan and
     Guide, 1996
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is responsible for the regional
planning in Southern California, which includes the City of Brawley. SCAG has been preparing
long range growth and development plans for the Southern California region since the early 1970s
and continues to provide a framework for coordinating local and regional decisions regarding future
growth and development.
The Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide (RCPG) is meant to encourage cities within the
SCAG region to undertake consistent, region-wide planning. This document contains core policies

intended to provide local governments a basis with which to ensure consistency of their plans with
applicable regional plans under CEQA, and ancillary policies addressing important issues facing the
region. However, this plan does not regulate land use because compliance with SCAG’s regional
plan is voluntary. It should be noted that SCAG is currently preparing an updated version of the
Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide that was adopted in 1996.
Southern California Association of Governments Regional Transportation Plan, 2004
The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a multi-modal, long-range planning document prepared
by SCAG, in coordination with federal, state, Imperial Valley Association of Governments (IVAG)
and other regional, sub regional and local agencies in Southern California. The RTP includes
programs and policies for congestion management, transit, bicycles and pedestrians, roadways, and
finances. The RTP is prepared every three years and reflects the current future horizon based on a
20-year projection of needs. The RTP’s primary use is as a regional long-range plan for federally
funded transportation projects. It also serves as a comprehensive, coordinated transportation plan for
all governmental jurisdictions within the region. Each agency responsible for transportation, such as
local cities, the County, and Caltrans, has different transportation implementation responsibilities
under the RTP. The RTP relies on the plans and policies governing circulation and transportation in
each County to identify the region’s future multi-modal transportation system.
Special Housing Programs
Health and Safety Code Section 50689.5 requires that housing and housing programs developed
under Health and Safety Code Sections 50680 et seq. for the developmentally disabled, mentally
disordered, and physically disabled be consistent with the Housing Element of the General Plan.
Subdivisions
Government Code Sections 66473.5 and 66474 require that subdivision and parcel map approvals in
all jurisdictions be consistent with the General Plan.
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act, 1975
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) of 1975 requires local governments
to address mineral recovery activities through the direct regulation of mining operations, and
through planning policies that balance the mineral resource needs of the state with the maintenance
of environmental quality. SMARA requires cities and counties to adopt ordinances conforming to
state policy for the review and approval of reclamation plans and permits to conduct surface mining
operations. Upon request, the State Geologist is responsible for preparing a geological inventory
and classification of selected important mineral commodities by region. Within 12 months of
receiving the classification report and maps, a city or county must amend its general plan to include
mineral resource management policies recognizing the classification information, managing land
uses which may affect areas of statewide or regional significance, and emphasizing the conservation

INTRODUCTION TO THE LAND USE
ELEMENT
Land use is one of the most important factors                   LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS
affecting the future of Brawley and the achievement       LUE Goal 1 Balanced Development
of long-term community goals. The land use                LUE Goal 2 Compatible and Complementary
element functions as a guide to planners, the general                Development
public, and decision-makers as to the ultimate            LUE Goal 3 Revitalization of Older
pattern of development within the City of Brawley                    Commercial, Industrial, and
                                                                     Residential Uses and Properties
through 2030. The land use element has the
                                                          LUE Goal 4 Improved City-Wide Urban Design
broadest scope of the General Plan elements. It           LUE Goal 5 Economic Expansion and
plays a central role in correlating all land use issues                 Diversification
into a set of coherent development policies, which        LUE Goal 6 Development Coordinated with
relate directly to the other elements. In practice, the              Public Facilities and Services
land use element is the most visible and often-used       LUE Goal 7 Conservation of Agricultural Lands
element in the General Plan. Although all general                    and Open Space
plan elements carry equal weight, the land use
element is often perceived as being most
representative of “the general plan.”
In addition to this Introduction, the Land Use Element is composed of two sections: Land Use Goals,
Objectives, and Policies and the Land Use Plan. Specific implementation programs for this Element
are contained in the Implementation Chapter of the General Plan.
Related Plans and Programs
The scope and content of the Land Use Element are primarily governed by the General Plan
Guidelines and the Planning Zoning and Development Laws for the State. Other documents,
including the zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, specific plans, and redevelopment plans,
establish more specific policies and regulations influencing development. In addition, there are a
number of other plans and programs that are considered in the formulation, adoption and
implementation of land use policy. Related plans and programs are listed below and described in the

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
The goals, objectives, and policies contained in this element address preservation of major areas of
the City, revitalization of others, and guidance for new development in those portions of the City
presently undeveloped. The following goals, objectives, and policies focus on maintaining a balance
between residential, commercial, industrial, open space, agriculture, and public land uses promoting
high quality development; and, minimizing existing and potential land use conflicts. The
Implementation Chapter of the General Plan provides strategies to implement the policies and plans
identified in the Land Use Element.
LUE Goal 1:                Balanced Development

                                                         land use pattern that accommodates existing and
                                                         future needs for housing, commercial and
                                                         industrial land, open space, agricultural land,
                                                         and community facilities and services, while
                                                         maintaining a healthy, diversified economy
                                                         capable of supporting future City services.
                                                         LUE Policy 1.1.1: Preserve the quality of Brawley's
                                                         existing low-density single-family neighborhoods while
                                                         permitting compatible multi-family development to meet
                                                         community housing needs where best suited from the
         Single-family Homes under Construction          standpoint of current development, accessibility,

                                    commercial uses in areas of Brawley presently under-represented by such
                                    uses. Encourage the integration of retail or service commercial uses on the
                                    street level of office projects. Neighborhood-serving commercial centers
                                    should primarily provide convenience goods and services and be consistent
                                    with the scale of the surrounding neighborhood.
           LUE Policy 1.1.4:        Facilitate the development of vacant and under-utilized highway parcels
                                    with commercial uses where appropriate and compatible with surrounding
                                    uses to capitalize on their highway access and visibility.

           LUE Policy 1.1.5:     Support modification of present City boundaries in unincorporated areas
                                 within the City of Brawley's sphere of influence where they are irregular
                                 and create inefficiencies.
           LUE Policy 1.1.6:     Maintain an updated Sphere of Influence for the City of Brawley.

LAND USE PLAN
Introduction
A wide range of natural and man-made factors are considered in formulating land use policy. Areas
of special environmental significance, potential safety hazards, limitation of existing infrastructure,
the need for economic development, and the nature and character of existing development all have
influence on land use policy. By identifying the general distribution, location, and extent of all uses
of land, the Land Use Plan establishes clear and logical patterns of land use as well as standards for
future development. The Land Use Plan will include a discussion of the Land Use Map, land use
density and intensity, land use designations, capacity to accommodate future growth, special study
areas, and the relationship between land use and zoning.
Land Use Map
The Land Use Map, Figure LUE-1, illustrates land use types and distribution for the entire Brawley
planning area. The ten land use designations, depicted on Figure LUE-1, identify the type and
nature of development allowed in a particular location. The three Residential designations allow for
a range of housing types and density. The commercial and industrial designations are provided to
accommodate and encourage a range of revenue and job-generating businesses. The public facility
and open space designations are intended, respectively, to protect public lands and private lands for
necessary public services and open space uses. The agricultural designation provides for the
continuing agricultural activities outside the Brawley urban area. The transportation corridor
designation provides for current and future circulation needs within the planning area.
The Special Study Areas, depicted on Figure LUE-1, and further defined on Figure LUE-2 may
include the following: city approved master planned developments, known as Approved Specific
Plans; areas that include proposed large-scale master planned developments that have not been
approved, known as Proposed Specific Plans; and, areas that are intended to promote a mixture of
commercial and residential uses in central Brawley, known as the Downtown Overlay Districts.

Land Use Intensity/Density
The Land Use Plan uses urban
planning terminology to define the ten
land use designations. The term
"density" is used for residential uses
and refers to the population and
development capacity of residential
land. Density is described in terms of
dwelling units per net acre of land
(du/net ac). For example, 50 dwelling
units occupying 10 net acres of land is
5.0 du/net ac. Development
"intensity", which applies to non-
residential uses, refers to the extent of
development on a lot - the total
building square footage, building
height, the floor area ratio, and/or the
percent of lot coverage. Intensity is
often used to describe non-residential
development levels, but in a broader
sense, is used to express overall levels of all development types.
Floor area ratio (FAR) represents the ratio between the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot
and the total area of that lot. FAR is determined by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings on a
lot by the area of that lot. The FAR controls use intensity on a lot. For example, a similar FAR may
allow a single story building, which covers most of the lot, a two-story building with reduced lot
coverage, or a three- or more story building with substantially reduced coverage of the lot.
Table LUE-1 lists each of the land use designations shown on the Land Use Map and provides a
corresponding indication of a maximum versus an effective intensity/density level of development.
Maximum development capacity assumes the total development of the Plan on all parcels of land at
the highest permitted densities/intensities. This total build-out at the maximum permitted density or
intensity standard for a land use designation is not expected to occur. Factors such as environmental
constraints, existing land uses, the choice of a builder to build to less than maximum permitted
density/intensity all have an impact on the level or intensity of development within a particular land
use designation.
Effective development capacity assumes that under realistic circumstances, all development will not
be at maximum density or intensity based on appraisal of development constraints in the City, which
would restrict development to less than that shown by the maximum density/intensity of the Land
Use Plan. Future development on a city-wide basis is expected to occur at the effective level of
intensity/density stated in Table LUE-1. Development at an intensity or density between the
effective and maximum levels can occur only where projects offer exceptional design quality or
important public amenities or benefits above the standards required by the City's Zoning Ordinance

Land Use Designations
All land in the Planning Area is assigned one of the ten use designations described below:
Agricultural Designation
Agricultural—This agricultural land use designation provides for the continuation of agricultural
production and related industries including aquaculture (fish farms), ranging from light to heavy
agriculture. Packing and processing of agricultural products may also be allowed in certain areas
and other uses necessary or supportive of agriculture. Residential uses, when subordinate to
agricultural uses shall not exceed a maximum density of 1 single family dwelling unit per 40 acres of
land or per legal lot.
Residential Designations
Rural Residential—This residential land use designation provides for predominantly low density
residential areas, recreational lands, and the continuation of agriculture, in areas where it is desirable
to retain a rural lifestyle, characterized by large lots and/or in areas where public water and sewer
service is presently limited or non-existent. Permitted development within this designation is
contingent upon the availability of infrastructure and public services. This designation will permit

the construction of as many as two detached single family dwellings per net acre of land. Other uses
such as churches, schools, and child-care facilities, which are determined to be compatible with and
oriented toward serving the needs of very low density single family dwellings, are also allowed.
Recreational vehicle parks are allowed, subject to a conditional use permit.
Low Density Residential—This residential land use designation provides for the development of
low density detached and attached single family dwelling units including either detached or attached
(zero lot line) single family units and mobile homes. Up to two dwelling units per lot or parcel are
permitted. This designation will permit the construction of as many as nine detached or attached
single family dwelling units per net acre of land. Other uses such as churches, schools, and child-
care facilities, which are determined to be compatible with and oriented toward serving the needs of
low density detached and attached single family dwelling units, are also permitted.
Medium Density Residential—This residential land use designation provides for the development
of medium density detached and attached dwellings (duplexes, triplexes, condominiums, town
homes). This designation will permit the construction of as many as 17 detached or attached
dwelling units per net acre of land. Other uses such as churches, schools, child-care facilities,
mobile home parks, and recreational vehicle parks, which are determined to be compatible with and
oriented toward serving the needs of these residential uses are also permitted.
Commercial Designation
Commercial—Commercial activities within this designation include retail, professional office, and
service-oriented business activities serving the citywide population. Commercial uses include small
scale uses as well as large scale developments such as department stores, discount stores,
furniture/appliance outlets, home improvement centers, entertainment centers, subregional and
regional shopping centers, professional medical offices, and hospitals. The maximum intensity of
development permitted in this category is a floor area ratio of 0.60:1.
Industrial Designations
Light Industrial/Business Park—This designation permits uses which include
business/professional offices, light manufacturing, warehouse/distribution, wholesaling, large-scale
warehouse retail, service commercial activities, and public uses. Areas are generally served by
arterial roadways and freeways, providing automobile and public transit access. These areas are
characterized as major employment concentrations. The maximum intensity of development
permitted in this designation is a floor area ratio of 0.70:1.
Industrial—Industrial uses allowed in this designation include a wide range of manufacturing and
non-manufacturing uses ranging from warehouse and distribution facilities to industrial activities.
Other permitted uses include light manufacturing, storage, warehousing/ distribution, wholesaling,
large-scale warehouse retail, automobile dealerships, support commercial services and public uses.

Public Facility Designation
Public Facility—This designation includes a wide range of public, quasi-public, and private uses
such as Brawley Municipal Airport, school sites, public parklands, government administrative
offices and facilities, public facilities, libraries, hospitals, and cultural recreational activities. Active
recreation activities allowed include community recreation facilities, equestrian centers, golf
courses/driving ranges, indoor/outdoor athletic facilities, and public parklands. Sites owned by
public agencies may be combined as joint use facilities with responsibilities for improvement,
maintenance, and operations shared by the public agencies involved. These uses are distributed
throughout the city. The maximum floor area ratio permitted in this category is 0.80:1.
Open Space Designation
Open Space—The Open Space land use designation applies to all passive recreation areas in the
City such as the New River Flood Plain. Passive activities include natural preserves, designated
open space, museums, or similar cultural centers. The maximum floor area ratio permitted in this
category is 0.25:1.
Transportation Designation
Transportation Corridor—The land use designation includes major and primary arterial roadways
and railroads.
Special Study Areas
Land Use designations described above define the general types of uses allowed and their
corresponding intensities or densities. In addition to these designations, there are special study areas
within the City that may include the following: city approved master planned developments, known
as Approved Specific Plans; areas that include proposed large-scale master planned developments
that have not been approved, known as Proposed Specific Plans; and, areas that are intended to
create a mixture of residential and commercial development incentives in central Brawley, known as
the Downtown Overlay Districts. Figure LUE-2 depicts the Approved Specific Plans, Proposed
Specific Plans, and the Downtown Overlay Districts, which are further discussed below.
Approved Specific Plans:
The specific plan is an important planning tool, which can manage development and its associated
impacts within areas of the City. It is often used to address the development requirements for a
single project such as a planned community. As a result, its emphasis is on specific standards and
development criteria. Its text and diagrams will address the planning of necessary infrastructure and
facilities, as well as land uses and open space. In addition, it will specify those programs and
regulations necessary to finance infrastructure and public works projects. Specific plans must be
consistent with all facets of the general plan. Three adopted specific plans (Luckey Ranch, Brawley
Gateway, and La Paloma) are depicted on Figure LUE-2 and discussed further below.

Luckey Ranch Specific Plan: The Luckey Ranch Specific Plan (PD00-01) includes 580 acres
located north of Main Street, along the east side of Best Road, and including an area north of the city
airport. The Specific Plan proposes 633 single family dwelling units on 115 acres, 420 multi-family
units on 35 acres, 35 acres of retail commercial development, and 244 acres of light
industrial/business park and industrial development.
Brawley Gateway Specific Plan: The Brawley Gateway Specific Plan (PD01-01) includes 145
acres located along the east side of Highway 86, south of Malan Street. The amended Specific Plan
proposes 125 single family dwelling units on 25.5 acres, 300 multi-family dwelling units on 18.3
acres, 36.5 acres of retail commercial development, 5.5 acres of office commercial development, and
44 acres of light industrial/business park development.
La Paloma Specific Plan: The 409.4 acre La Paloma Specific Plan proposes 1,800 dwelling units
on 229.4 acres, 22.91 acres of commercial, 13.48 acres of light industrial/business park, and sites for
new public schools, parks, and other public facilities.
Proposed Specific Plans:
Proposed specific plans include large-scale proposed developments, which may or may not change
as a result of City review and approval. The two special study areas (Villages of Sonata and Rancho
Porter) are depicted on Figure LUE-2 and discussed further below.
Villages of Sonata: The Villages of Sonata currently proposes approximately 475 acres and is
located directly south of Panno Road and the La Paloma Specific Plan, east of Dogwood Road, west
of State Route 111, and north of Meads Road within the proposed SOI. The project proposes
approximately 226 acres of residential uses and 1,969 dwelling units. Two new school sites are
proposed along with commercial uses.
Rancho Porter: The Rancho Porter project, located south of Main Street, west of State Highway
111, east of Best Road, and generally north of Meads Road, currently proposes approximately 203
acres, consisting of 1,006 dwelling units, as well as commercial, mixed-use, and park space.
Downtown Overlay District:
All of the Downtown Overlay District (DOD) falls within the City’s Redevelopment Plan Project
Area Number 1. The DOD currently encompasses a variety of uses including the City’s civic center,
a traditional downtown commercial district, a major circulation route (Highway 78), housing, light-
industrial, and industrial uses. The purpose of the DOD is to maximize the potential of the area to
provide a more exciting and compatible mix of civic, recreational, retail, office, light industrial and
residential uses.
The City created Downtown Revitalization Guidelines in 1989 in order to help provide a better
framework to guide the character of growth and improvements within the City’s redevelopment
areas, which include the DOD. New developments in the DOD should be consistent with the
Downtown Revitalization Guidelines. The City may adopt additional guidelines or a specific plan
for the DOD following the adoption of the update to the General Plan in order to provide greater
direction for future developments. In addition to the adoption of a specific plan for the DOD,
City of Brawley                                                                             September 2008

additional programs should be created as part of the implementation of the DOD. The programs
listed below are intended as a starting point.
    Incentive Programs to assist businesses in storefront improvements;
    Downtown marketing program that strives to better position the DOD as a regional shopping
     and entertainment center; and, a
    Parking district to acquire and construct additional parking spaces.
The City’s DOD includes three sub-districts, each with a different vision. With the exception of
areas designated for industrial uses, the DOD may allow densities and/or a combination of uses that
would not otherwise be allowed by a single land use designation anywhere else in the City. New
developments in the DOD must ensure adequate buffers between any industrial and residential
properties and other sensitive receptors with regard to but not limited to the following potential
hazards: noise; hazardous and/or toxic air contaminants; and hazardous and/or toxic substances.
The following describes the general focus and intent of the three districts. However, in order to
utilize higher densities and a greater variety of uses, developments must undergo a more rigorous
discretionary review process and ensure an orderly and compatible pattern of growth, which may
include but is not limited to design guidelines and the programs listed above.
Civic Center/District I: This portion of the Downtown Brawley Overlay Area is intended to
encourage the greatest densities in the City, while maintaining a safe and small town “village”
downtown center. This is the heart of the City, which contains many opportunities for revitalization.
 The street network surrounding the City Hall, North Plaza Street and South Plaza Street, resembles
a diamond shape and provides a unique connection to the adjacent and nearby uses. The overlay
area will help to increase the area’s position as the City’s cultural, civic, and entertainment center
within a walkable, pedestrian scale village atmosphere. The District, with the exception of areas with
an industrial designation, may permit up to 25 dwelling units per net acre of land (including any
density bonuses) with a variety of residential, retail and office commercial, recreational, and civic
uses. The District does not provide any density bonuses for areas with an industrial designation.
Residential developments must include ground floor commercial uses. The maximum height of any
future development shall be as much as five stories.
The District also encompasses a few industrial designated parcels along the Union Pacific Railroad
corridor. New developments in the District must ensure adequate buffers and compatibility between
any industrial and residential properties and other sensitive receptors with regard to but not limited
to the following potential hazards: noise; hazardous and/or toxic air contaminants; and hazardous
and/or toxic substances.
West Village/District II: This district will encourage a strong connection to Main Street and the
Center Civic/District I located to the east but on a less intensive scale and with a greater focus on
residential uses. The district may permit up to 20 dwelling units per net acre of land (including any
density bonuses) with a variety of residential, retail and office commercial, recreational, and civic
uses. Residential developments must include ground floor commercial uses. The maximum height
of any future development shall be limited to three stories.

East Village/District III: This area encompasses a variety of industrial, commercial, and residential
uses. The connection to the Civic Center/District I to the west and Main Street are key elements that
should be incorporated into future developments. The area may encourage a stronger orientation of
retail and office commercial and light industrial uses but new developments in the District must
ensure adequate buffers and compatibility between any industrial and residential properties and other
sensitive receptors with regard to but not limited to the following potential hazards: noise; hazardous
and/or toxic air contaminants; and hazardous and/or toxic substances. The District, with the
exception of areas with an industrial designation, may permit up to 18 dwelling units per net acre of
land (including any density bonuses) with a variety of residential, retail and office commercial, light
industrial, recreational, and civic uses. The District does not provide any density bonuses for areas
with an industrial designation. Residential developments must include ground floor commercial and
may include ground floor light manufacturing uses with a retail outlet for the products produced on-
site as long as they are compatible with adjacent and nearby uses. The maximum height of any

LUE-2. The DOD’s underlying non-residential land use designations include the commercial, open
space, public facility, and industrial land use designations. The underlying non-residential land use
designations are not reflected in Table LUE-2 because these uses and their development projections
are reflected in Table LUE-3.

Implications of the Land Use Plan
The Land Use Plan describes the distribution of designated land uses to accommodate development
housing, population, and non-residential land uses, such as commercial/industrial businesses and
public facilities. Table LUE-3 provides a breakdown of land uses within the Brawley Planning Area
and the Downtown Overlay District for purposes of identifying the effective development capacity
of the Land Use Plan for both dwelling units/population and square footage of non-residential uses.
In arriving at effective development capacity for population growth and the number of units possible
under build-out conditions, the effective dwelling unit per net acre was multiplied by the average

persons per household. For non-residential uses, the effective floor area ratio per net acre was used
to determine the level of expected future square footage of development.
The degree to which plan capacity exceeds projected population is referred to as "overage". Some
overage is desirable to make allowance for inevitable small pockets of undevelopable land, to allow
for difficulty in recognizing development trends in completely vacant areas, to allow for unforeseen
need for public utilities, and to recognize that some owners will maintain their land in an
undeveloped state beyond the time span of the Plan. The Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) has recommended that plan capacity not exceed approximately 1.25 times the
projected population. The measurement of capacity is accomplished by dividing the maximum
population capacity of the plan by the projected population. The capacity of the Land Use Plan
encompasses a population of 45,744 in the incorporated areas and 14,798 in the sphere of influence
for a total population capacity of 60,542. SCAG's 2030 population projection for the City's
incorporated area is 49,036. As a result, the Land Use Plan’s capacity is approximately 1.23.

CIRCULATION
Introduction
The City of Brawley recognizes that the manner in which people and goods move within and
through the City is a major part of maintaining a quality living environment. Government Code
Section 65302(b) requires that all cities and counties include a Circulation or Transportation
Element as part of the required General Plan. This requirement is intended to assure that cities and
counties recognize the need to provide a circulation system that is sensitive to land uses and the
environment. The circulation system refers to the routes by which traffic moves from one place to
another and the modes by which people and goods are transported from one place to another. The
provisions of the Circulation Section of the Infrastructure Element affect the City’s physical, social,
and economic environment as follows:
Physical—The circulation system is one of the chief generators of physical settlement patterns and
its location, design, and constituent modes have major impacts on air quality, plant and animal
habitats, environmental noise, energy use, community appearance, and other environmental
components.
Social—The circulation system is a primary determinant of the pattern of human settlement. It has a
major impact on the areas and activities it serves, on community cohesion, and on the quality of
human life. The circulation system should be accessible to all segments of the population, including
the disadvantaged, the young, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled.
Economic—Economic activities normally require circulation for materials, products, ideas, and
employees, thus the viability of the community’s economy is directly affected by the circulation
element. The efficiency of a community’s circulation system can either contribute to or adversely
affect its economy.
The City’s roadway network forms the core of the circulation infrastructure and includes a hierarchy
consisting of classifications oriented in a north/south and east/west grid system. While the
automobile is the primary form of transportation, other modes are also important as well. For that
reason, the circulation network for the City of Brawley also includes an airport, bicycle and
pedestrian paths, bus routes, and parking facilities.

Circulation Plan
The Circulation Plan provides for safe and convenient movement of persons and goods at the
development intensity anticipated in the Land Use Element. The policies included in this Element
emphasize the need for a circulation system that is capable of serving both existing and future
demands while preserving community values and character. The Circulation Plan will include a
discussion of the performance criteria, roadway classifications, circulation system, parking, and
Transportation System Management and Transportation Demand Management.
Performance Criteria
"Performance criteria" are used to evaluate the ability of the circulation system to serve existing and
planned land uses. Performance criteria facilitate the comparison of future traffic volumes and
future circulation system capacity, and the assessment of the adequacy of the circulation system.
Performance criteria have a policy component which establishes a desired level of service (LOS) and
a technical component which specifies how traffic forecast data can be used to measure the
achievement of the criteria. Levels of service range from A to E, and are defined in Table IE-1.
Table IE-2 shows the maximum Average Daily Traffic accommodated by LOS A through E for the
City of Brawley                                                                                 September 2008

roadway categories described below.
The City of Brawley has established level of service C as a threshold standard to monitor the
performance of community roadways. Many cities in the more urbanized areas of southern
California use LOS D or even E for determining the performance of roadways. The City of
Brawley, however, plans to maintain the attractiveness of Brawley as a smaller city without the
traffic congestion found in many larger cities in the region. To achieve this goal, the City uses a
LOS C as the circulation performance criteria.
TABLE IE-1. Level of Service for Brawley Circulation Performance Criteria
  Level of
  Service        Description
  A              Represents free flow. Individual drivers have a high degree of freedom to select their travel
                 speeds and are generally unaffected by other vehicles in the traffic system.
  B              Represents stable flow, but individual drivers are somewhat affected by other vehicles in
                 determining travel speeds.
  C              Represents stable flow, but the selection of the speeds of individual drivers significantly affected
                 by other vehicles.
  D              Represents a condition of high-density, stable traffic flow in which speed and freedom of
                 movement are severely restricted by the presence of other vehicles. At signalized intersections,
                 some vehicles may occasionally have to wait for more than one green light in order to pass
                 through the intersection.
  E              Represents operating conditions at or near capacity. Individual vehicles have little freedom to
                 maneuver within the traffic stream and any minor disruptions can cause a breakdown in the flow
                 of traffic. At signalized intersections, vehicles regularly wait for more than one green light to
                 clear the intersection.
  F              Represents breakdown conditions. At this level of service, speeds are low, delay is high, and
                 there are more vehicles entering the roadway than can be accommodated.

Roadway Classifications
The following is a description of each of the roadway classifications in the City of Brawley:
Expressway—The main function of this classification is to provide regional and intra-county travel
services. Features include high design standards with six travel lanes; wide, landscaped medians;
highly restricted access; provisions for public transit lanes, including but not limited to, bus lanes,
train lanes, or other mass transit type means; and no parking. Minimum right-of-way (ROW) is
210 feet consisting of three travel lanes per direction, a 56-foot median, and shoulders along both
sides of the travel way. The ROW width is exclusive of necessary adjacent easements such as for
IID facilities as these vary. The minimum intersection spacing is one (1) mile.
Prime Arterial—The main function of this classification is to provide regional, sub regional, and
intra-county travel services. Features include high design standards with four to six travel lanes,
raised and landscaped medians, highly restricted access, provisions for public transit lanes, including
but not limited to bus lanes, train lanes, or other mass transit type means and no parking. Minimum
right of way is 136 feet.
Minor Arterial—These roadways provide intra-county and sub regional service. Access and
parking may be allowed, but closely restricted in such a manner as to ensure proper function of this
roadway. Typical standards include the provision for four and six travel lanes with raised and
landscaped medians for added safety and efficiency by providing protected left turn lanes at selected
locations. Some may also contain provisions for public transit lanes or other mass transit type means.
Minimum right of way is 102 feet.

Collector— These roadways are designed for intra-county travel as a link between the long haul
facilities and the collector/local facilities. Although it frequently provides direct access to abutting
properties, that is not its primary purpose. Typical design features include provision for four travel
lanes without a raised median and some may also contain provisions for public transit lanes or other
mass transit type means. Minimum right of way is 84 feet. Parking is generally not permitted.
Local Collector Street — This is designed to connect local streets with the adjacent Collectors or
arterial street system. Design standards include provision for two travel lanes and parking, except in
specific locations where parking is removed to provide a turn lane at intersections. Local Collector
streets frequently provide direct access to abutting properties, although that should be avoided where
feasible. Minimum right of way is 70 feet.
Residential Street — This street type also includes residential cul de sac and loop street and is
designed to provide direct access to abutting properties and to give access from neighborhoods to the
Local Street and Collector Street system. This classification should be discontinuous in alignment
such that through trips are discouraged. Typical design standards include provision for two travel
lanes, parking on both sides, and direct driveway access. Minimum right of way is 60 feet.
Additional functional classifications of planned roadways are intended to provide industrial-specific
service are as follows:
Industrial Collector — The main function of this classification is to provide for efficient movement
of goods for regional, subregional, and intra-county travel services. Access and parking may be
allowed, but closely restricted in such a manner as to ensure safe and proper function of industrial
traffic on this roadway. Typical design standards include provisions for up to four travel lanes and
parking on both sides. Minimum right of way is 96 feet.
Industrial Local Street — This classification is designed to connect industrial properties and areas
with the adjacent Industrial Collector, Residential, Collector or arterial system. Design standards
include provisions for two travel lanes, of a minimum of 13 feet width each, and parking. Industrial
streets frequently provide direct access to abutting industrial sites and parking of industrial-sized
vehicles. Minimum right of way is 64 feet.
In addition, the potential designation of Scenic Highway has been placed on specified roadways in
the County and may be added to others in the future. The purpose of this designation is to protect
and enhance the County's scenic aesthetic resources which are visible from major County and State
routes.
Figure IE-1 shows schematic cross-sections of each category of arterial roadway. These sections
represent desirable standards, but variation in right-of-way width and special road improvements
will occur in certain cases due to physical constraints and/or right-of-way limitations. In particular,
the median width in Expressways and Prime Arterials will vary according to the area being served,
available right-of-way constraints, and turn lane requirements.

Hence, any of the arterials classifications may deviate from the standards where physical constraints
exist or where preservation of community character dictates special treatment. Bikeway facilities
are another factor which affect the specific standards applied to various roadways. Specific design
requirements for construction for public streets are available from the City Public Works
Department.

Notes:
Residential streets are not classified on the Circulation Element.
The minimum design speed shall be used as a guideline only. Final minimum design speeds are subject to the
Director of Public Works determination and approval.
Additional through lanes, dual turn lanes, or other unusual circumstances may require additional right-of-way, road
surface widths, etc. in addition to those shown in Table IE-3.
Roads in undeveloped, unincorporated portions of the City may require different standards such as unpaved
shoulders or no curb, gutter improvements, etc.
Modification to roadway classification and any widths shown are subject to City of Brawley approval.
The Circulation Element roadway classification system does not include local City streets serving
individual parcels or private streets. The width of local and private streets will vary from those
described for the other types of roadways. Reasonable flexibility and variety is provided for in the
City's local and private street standards.

Circulation System
The planned roadway network is illustrated in Figure IE-2 and indicates the location of all of the
roads designated Expressway, Prime Arterial, Minor Arterial, and Collector. These roadway
designations represent the ultimate configuration of the specified streets. Most of these streets do
not currently meet the standards of the roadway designations and some of the identified components
of the circulation system are not yet constructed. As the City develops and traffic levels increase,
the City will construct roadway improvements to implement the Circulation Plan.
                                                        The SR 78-SR-111 Expressway (Brawley Bypass)
                                                        is a proposed eight mile, six-lane divided
                                                        expressway from State Route 86 north of the City
                                                        of Brawley to 1.5 miles south of the eastern
                                                        junction of State Route 111 and State Route 78.

                                                        of the City of Brawley in March 1993. The Draft
                                                        Environmental Document was approved May 11,

                                                        Alternative was identified as the preferred
                SR-111 Bypass Construction              alternative on November 19, 2001. The Project
                                                        Report and Final Environmental Document were
approved on February 26, 2003. Construction is planned for three stages, beginning in 2004 with an
anticipated completion in 2012.
The City of Brawley experiences substantial truck traffic within the urbanized area due to the City's
locations at the intersection of State Routes 86, 78, and 111. The agricultural sector of Imperial
Valley generates a large number of local and regional truck trips. While truck traffic is necessary for
the agricultural sector and should be supported by the City, trucking can impact urban uses if not
properly controlled. Potential impacts from truck traffic include congestion of local roadways,
excessive noise, and inappropriate truck parking in local residential and commercial areas. Through
truck traffic should be prohibited on roads with classifications of collector or lower. Figure IE-3
shows the City’s current truck route map, which will evolve over time and likely be revised once the
Brawley Bypass is completed. With the completion of the Brawley Bypass, Main Street should no
longer be a Main Truck Route. To properly channel truck traffic through Brawley, the following
criteria are established by the City to select appropriate truck routes:
    Provision of truck access to local industries;
    Prohibition of trucks along residential streets to minimize noise and maximize safety;
    Balancing of truck movements along parallel routes so that individual streets do not carry more than
     their share of trucks; and
    Provision for the travel needs of through trucks.
    Truck routes will be periodically reviewed and modified to ensure conformance to the truck route
     criteria. The City will strive to balance regional and local trucking needs with community safety and
     acceptable noise levels.

Parking
Efficient automobile transportation in Brawley is partially contingent on adequate and convenient
parking facilities. The City will implement several programs to improve existing parking and ensure
sufficient parking for planned urban development. To improve traffic flow on arterial roadways, the
City will encourage the consolidation of parking for existing development. During the review of
new development projects, the City will assess parking requirements and ensure that adequate
parking is incorporated into all proposed projects. Clustered site designs with joint parking facilities
will be promoted.
The City will also assess potential sites for off-street truck parking to reduce the impact of truck
traffic on residential areas. Off-street truck parking sites will be located adjacent to designated truck
routes.
Transportation System Management and Transportation Demand Management
Transportation System Management (TSM) and Transportation Demand Management (TDM) are
both important components of efficient circulation systems. TSM typically involves physical
improvements to the circulation infrastructure to expand capacity and accommodate more vehicular
trips. TDM typically involves strategies to reduce the demand for vehicular transportation, which in
turn reduces the need for physical improvements and contributes to better air quality.
To ensure adequate Transportation System Management in future years, the City will implement
several programs in addition to the Circulation Plan described above. The City will require the
preparation of a traffic analysis for major development proposals to identify potential impacts to the
City circulation system and identify necessary physical improvements to maintain LOS C. As traffic
volumes approach or exceed LOS C, the City will design improvements to increase the capacity
through restricting on-street parking, improved signal timing, intersection widening, and other
appropriate measures.
The City will also take actions to promote citywide Transportation Demand Management and
decrease the demand for vehicular transportation. Large employers in Brawley will be encouraged
to reduce vehicular trips by offering employee incentives. The use of alternative transportation
modes, such as transit service and bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian facilities, will be pursued as
described in the following sections. These transportation modes provide an alternative to
automobile use and consequently reduce both local and regional traffic congestion and air pollution.
Public Transit
Scheduled public transit service in Brawley is provided by Imperial Valley Transit. Buses with
capacity for 65 passengers provide transportation to/from Calexico eight times per day, from 3rd
Street & Paulin in Calexico to E Street & Rio Vista in Brawley. Service to the north to Bombay
Beach is provided by request once per week on Thursdays. The scheduled transit service provides
for the travel needs of Brawley residents and a means for shoppers to reach businesses in Brawley.
The service to El Centro and Calexico can serve commuter trips, shopping trips, and other types of
trips for travelers who are unable or prefer not to drive. The weekly service to the north serves travel

needs for individuals who come to Brawley or other commercial centers for weekly shopping trips,
medical appointments, and other needs.
Transit service in Brawley is also provided by the Brawley Dial-A-Ride system and AIM Transit,
which is a countywide dial-a-ride service for disabled persons. These services are most useful to
travelers who can make relatively few trips and can schedule their travel needs in advance. The City
will continue to coordinate with the County and the Imperial Valley Transit Authority to ensure that
public transportation is available for elderly and
disabled persons.
Existing transit service in Brawley is adequate
given the current needs and resources available for
transit. Because transit service provides an
alternative to the automobile, it should be
encouraged to meet traffic congestion and air
quality goals. As the City grows and new
development projects are implemented, expanded
transit service will be considered. The City will
require developers to incorporate transit amenities,
such as bus shelters and turn-outs, in new projects
                                                             IV Transit Links Outlying Areas to New Court
along transit routes where appropriate. During the                 Building in Downtown Brawley
design of new roadway projects, the City will
coordinate the improvements with the Imperial
Valley Transit Authority to incorporate transit amenities where appropriate.
No passenger train service is presently available in Brawley. The nearest Amtrak passenger station
is located north in the City of Indio. To make passenger train service more accessible in the future,
the City will work with the County of Imperial to promote inter-city passenger service between Los
Angeles, Riverside, and the Coachella and Imperial Valleys.
Intercity and Regional Transportation
The Brawley circulation system is interconnected with the larger regional system and is
consequently affected by modifications to regional circulation infrastructure and increased regional
traffic volumes. To avoid adverse impacts from regional traffic, the City will continue to coordinate
transportation improvements and address circulation issues with the County of Imperial, other cities
in the County, Caltrans, and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
In addition, the City will review and comment on environmental documents from the County and
nearby cities for new development projects. The City will particularly focus on potential regional
transportation impacts and request measures to mitigate traffic impacts to the Brawley Planning
Area where applicable.
The Brawley Municipal Airport is a regional transportation amenity. The City will continue to
promote expanded air operations through a number of programs including the 2003 Brawley
Municipal Airport Master Plan. In the Land Use Plan of the Brawley General Plan, land has been
appropriately designated to facilitate the extension of the airport runway to the east. Appropriate

                                                         destination areas such as schools, parks, and
employment centers. As a result, the City adopted the Brawley Bicycle Master Plan in 2002, which
identifies a system of bicycle routes that will serve as a tool for planning future bicycle facilities and
roadway improvements. The bikeway system will be implemented over time, as funding
opportunities become available through grant programs or through implementation of roadway
improvements or regular roadway maintenance. The ultimate system is designed to implement a
24.21-mile system of bicycle routes that will provide a network of bicycle lanes/routes that connect
to the schools, parks, and the City Center. Figure IE-4 shows the City’s Proposed Bicycle Facilities.
The County of Imperial has a policy that bike lanes be planned into appropriate Prime, Major, and
Secondary Arterial streets, as defined by the County General Plan. As the County plans and
constructs such bike lanes, the City of Brawley will incorporate bike lanes into City streets to
connect to planned and constructed County bike lanes.
The majority of pedestrian circulation can be best supported by adequate sidewalks along City
streets. The City will continue to incorporate sidewalks into the design of new streets. In addition,
the City will identify streets with pedestrian safety hazards and improve existing sidewalks or
construct new sidewalks. New development projects will be required to provide pedestrian linkage
between schools, parks, neighborhood commercial centers, and other public facilities. In addition,
the City will encourage pedestrian links between individual parking lots of existing and planned
commercial areas.
Substantial open space is designated in the Land Use Plan. The City will provide trails for
bicyclists, pedestrians, and equestrian uses in natural areas and future parks. The construction of
such trails will enhance the recreational opportunities available in Brawley. In addition, right-of-
ways along flood control channels, irrigation canals, utility lines, and streets can provide land for
bicycles, pedestrians, and equestrian trails. The City will inventory such right-of-ways and evaluate
their potential for trails. When the City updates its Bicycle Master Plan, it should include the
inventory of the public right of ways for potential trail expansion.

WATER
Introduction
Water is currently the most critical natural resource in California. As the City of Brawley grows, it
is important that water resources be protected and conserved, and their overall quality enhanced.
The City of Brawley provides potable water treatment and distribution for residential, commercial,
and industrial uses within the incorporated limits of the City. The City purchases raw imported
Colorado River water from the Imperial Irrigation District (IID), which delivers the raw water to the
City via IID-owned and operated canals, the Mansfield and Central Main Canals. Untreated water to
be used for agricultural purposes is delivered to customers directly from the IID canal systems while
water to be used for domestic and industrial/commercial purposes is delivered to the City’s water
treatment plant, where the water is filtered and disinfected before it is pumped into the water
distribution system.
The City's water treatment plant has a current
treatment capacity of 15 million gallons per day
(MGD) and has adequate space to allow for an
expansion of an additional 15 MGD at this facility.
 Peak water demand in Brawley during the summer
is currently about 11.8 MGD. Therefore the water
treatment plant is currently operating below
capacity. The City will continue to monitor
storage capacity to ensure that future peak summer
water demand can be met.
Large portions of the Brawley water distribution                 Mansfield and Central Main Canals
system were constructed with cast iron pipes when
the City was initially urbanized. The pipes have become internally corroded and the movement of
water within these pipes is consequently inefficient. The City has implemented a comprehensive
program to improve the water delivery system. The City will continue to implement this program as
funding becomes available.

                                  produces recycled water and determines that within 10 years it will provide
                                  recycled water within the boundaries of the City. Within 180 days of receipt
                                  of the notice, the City shall adopt and enforce a specified recycled water
                                  ordinance.
Water Plan
The City of Brawley prepared and adopted a Water Master Plan in 1999 with a planning horizon
through the year 2020. The Water Master Plan provides information that was used to help update
City of Brawley                                                                                     September 2008

                                                                                                         J&S 00136.07

the General Plan but is a separate document adopted by the City of Brawley and updated
periodically as needed. The objective of the Water Master Plan is to evaluate water facilities to
determine if the existing system meets current design criteria. The Master Plan also evaluates the
need for future water system facilities to accommodate future development as it occurs within the
City’s Planning Area. The evaluations include determining deficiencies in the existing system as
well as projecting future system needs based on projected population and land uses.
The City of Brawley also prepared and adopted a Service Area Plan in 2007 that was prepared for
and adopted by the Imperial County Local Area Formation Committee (LAFCO). This Service Area
Plan (SAP) outlines the City’s existing water services and facilities, estimates the current and future
anticipated demand for such facilities and services, and describes how necessary facilities and
services will or may be developed and extended to meet demands. The SAP is intended to
demonstrate the City’s intent and ability to provide adequate services to the SOI boundaries at the
time of annexation. An approximately 15-year planning horizon was used to forecast growth, and
the estimated demands and provision to meet demands are based on population projections until
2020.
During the development review process, water infrastructure improvements needed to serve the
proposed project will be identified. Development projects will only be approved with adequate
provision of water services and appropriate improvements to the water distribution infrastructure.
The City may consider the extension of water distribution infrastructure in coordination/cooperation
with the County to accommodate projects outside of the city limits in the sphere-of-influence as
needed.
In addition to planning and implementing water infrastructure improvement projects, the City will
encourage water conservation and water quality measures. The Resource Management Element of
the General Plan contains policies to educate residents about water conservation measures to
implement at home and includes policies to protect and enhance water quality. The Resource
Management Element also requires the incorporation of water conservation technologies in new
development projects and significant rehabilitation projects. Increased water conservation in
Brawley will reduce the impact of new development on Imperial Valley's water supply. The use of
available treated water will be more efficient and the construction of some future water infrastructure
improvements can be postponed.

WASTEWATER
Introduction
Wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal is an essential community service to protect the
public health and environment and to foster economic vitality. The City of Brawley provides
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services to residential, commercial and industrial uses.
  The system includes a collection network of pipes and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The
City Public Works Department plans, constructs, and maintains the sewage system.
                                                            The City’s wastewater collection system,
                                                            established over 70 years ago, is a gravity
                                                            flow system. Approximately half of the
                                                            municipal wastewater and stormwater
                                                            drainage collection systems are combined in
                                                            the City of Brawley. Consequently,
                                                            stormwater drainage from some portions of
                                                            the City is treated at the wastewater treatment
                                                            plant (WWTP) and accounts for a substantial
                                                            part of the treatment plant operation load.
                                                            During rain events, the combined systems
                                                            often overflow and raw sewage is spilled.
                                                            The capacity of the collection system is
                 Waste Water Treatment Plant                adequate under normal dry weather
                                                            conditions.
The WWTP is currently operating at 68% of the maximum design capacity per the standards of the
California Regional Water Quality Control-Board Colorado River Basin Region 7. The WWTP is
not in need of additional capacity to accommodate existing development. However, the WWTP
currently fails to meet regional standards for bioassays (ammonia). The City anticipates resolving its
difficulties in meeting Regional Water Quality Control Board minimum standards by the completion
of a project that consists of the installation of a recirculation pipeline and additional aerators to the
WWTP.
The capacity of the existing WWTP is 5.9 MGD, which is more than the projected average daily
flow of 3.5 MGD. With the expansion of the WWTP, it will have a capacity of 12 MGD.

POWER/COMMUNICATION
Introduction
Adequate power and communication infrastructure is required for continued growth and
development in Brawley. As planned development proceeds in Brawley, power infrastructure for
electricity, natural gas service, and communication infrastructure for voice and data must be
simultaneously constructed.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
IE Goal 9:                  Provide for Adequate Power and Communication Service and
                            Transmission Infrastructure
    IE Objective 9.1:         Ensure the provision of adequate power and communication service
                              and transmission infrastructure to serve existing and planned
                              development.

           IE Policy 9.1.8      Support the expansion of wireless facilities in public and private places.
Power/Communication Plan
IID, Southern California Gas Company, and the various communication providers operate
independently from the City of Brawley and implement plans under other regulatory agencies,
including the California Building Code and Public Utilities Commission.
The IID provides electrical power to Imperial Valley. IID’s combined estimate for December 2005
for residential and commercial consumption totals 300,648,711 KWH. Expected consumption
within the City of Brawley is to grow at an annual rate between 4 and 6 percent. Future development
within the Brawley Planning Area requires analysis by IID planners and new substations and
transmission lines may be required. The City coordinates the provision of electricity for new
development with IID to ensure that adequate right-of-ways, easements, and improvements are
provided.
The City coordinates with the natural gas supplier, Southern California Gas Company, when new
development occurs to ensure that adequate right-of-ways and easements are provided. The City has
developed policies to promote energy conservation and new development is required to conform to
State Title 24 Energy Regulations.
AT&T is the primary telecommunications service provider to the City. The California Public
Utilities Commission sets the performance standard through a series of established tariffs. The
telephone company is a publicly regulated utility and is obligated to serve the community and
improve facilities as needed to serve the community.

INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING
Introduction
As indicated above, the City's circulation and utility infrastructure requires improvements to provide
adequate service to existing development and to accommodate planned development. The cost of
implementing these improvements could be substantial. In fact, the cost could prohibit the City from
implementing a number of the required improvements unless adequate means of financing
improvements can be identified. The City has made infrastructure maintenance and expansion a
priority to encourage new development projects and stimulate the local economy. To this end,
alternative financing methods will be used to fund infrastructure improvement projects. That is, the
City will seek other methods to pay for infrastructure projects instead of drawing on the City's
General Fund, (which is primarily composed of property and sales tax revenues).
One of the basic long-term goals underlying the Brawley General Plan is to diversify and expand the
local economy. To attract new commercial and industrial uses and offer competitive incentives, the
City will retain some flexibility in determining alternative financing mechanisms for projects of
benefit to the community. The City may elect to reduce or waive particular development impact fees
or use municipal bonds to fund infrastructure improvements. Regardless of the selected financing
mechanisms, the City will ensure the adequate provision of infrastructure necessary to support future
growth.
Goals, Objectives, and Polices
IE Goal 10:                Support Well Defined and Creative Financing Methods
    IE Objective 10.1:       Define and evaluate alternative financing methods for infrastructure
                             management and maintenance costs on a citywide and area wide
                             basis.
           IE Policy 10.1.1:     Develop an infrastructure and circulation improvement fee program which
                                 will enable infrastructure and circulation improvements to be funded by new
                                 development.

                                 development.
Infrastructure Financing Plan
The City will maintain an updated development impact fee program for new development projects.
The purpose of the development impact fee program is to require developers to compensate the City
for the increased demand for municipal services and infrastructure caused by implementation of new
projects. The City began implementing a development impact fee program in 1991, which includes
impact fees for public facilities including streets.
The City is in the process of updating the development impact fee program, which will help provide
financing for facilities to meet the needs of new development through the year 2020. The impact
fees will be reviewed periodically to ensure that they directly relate to the infrastructure performance
standards and current construction and administrative costs. In addition, the City will ensure that the
impact fees are consistent with the costs incurred by the City. In lieu of paying development impact
fees for infrastructure improvements, the developer can construct the required improvements
according to City codes.
The City will also consider the use of assessment districts, industrial development bonds, Mello-
Roos Districts, and other techniques for financing improvements to serve both existing and new
development. For large infrastructure projects that will benefit several property owners, the City
will prepare a phasing plan for cumulative infrastructure improvements. The objective of the
phasing plan is to equitably share the infrastructure costs among benefitting property owners. The
phasing plan will identify the demand threshold at which point improvements will be required, the
fair share costs to be paid by benefitting property owners, and the payment schedule.

as defined in the state Government Code. According to these requirements, the Conservation
Element must contain policies that further the protection and maintenance of the State's natural
resources such as water, soils, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources, and prevents their
wasteful exploitation, degradation, and destruction.

AIR QUALITY
Introduction
Clean air is a valuable and essential resource, which affects many aspects of our daily lives. It is
vital to our health and welfare, to the local agricultural economy, and to the quality of life enjoyed
by local residents, which in turn affects the City's ability to attract new business and industry.
Air quality in the United States is governed by the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA). In addition to
being subject to requirements of the CAA, air quality in California is also governed by more
stringent regulations under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). At the federal level, the CAA is
administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). In California, the
CCAA is administered by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) at the state level and by the
Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD) at the regional and local levels. The
ICAPCD and the CARB share the responsibility for ensuring that state and federal ambient air
quality standards are achieved and maintained within the County.
The CARB designates areas within California as either attainment or non-attainment for each criteria
pollutant based on whether the California Ambient Air Quality Standards have been achieved.
Under the CCAA, areas are designated as non-attainment for a pollutant if air quality data shows that
a State standard for the pollutant was violated at least once during the previous three calendar years.
Under the California standard, Imperial County is a moderate non-attainment area for O3 and a
nonattainment area for respirable particulate matter (PM10). It classifies Imperial County as an
attainment area for CO and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Under the federal standard, Imperial
County is in “marginal” non-attainment for 8-hour O3 and “serious” non-attainment for PM10.
Significant sources of ozone constituents are on-
road vehicles; other mobile sources such as trains,
off-road vehicles, and government aircraft; the
burning of agricultural debris; and manufacturing
and industrial processes. Windblown dust and sand,
which naturally occur, constitute a large percentage
of particulate matter that contributes to PM 10 and
PM 2.5.
Ozone (O3)
O3 is a colorless toxic gas that is the chief
component of urban smog. In humans, it interferes                     Weekend Traffic on Main Street
with the transfer of oxygen to the brain and heart
tissues and is a severe eye, nose, and throat irritant.
High O3 concentration also can damage plants, synthetic rubber, textiles, and other material. Ozone
is formed by a photochemical reaction in the atmosphere among O3 precursors, which include ROG

those in automobiles and stationary factory equipment. The photochemical reaction creating O3

depends on the intensity of ultraviolet light and air temperature; high O3 concentrations in the
planning area are most common during summer and early fall.
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
CO is a colorless and odorless gas that can interfere with the transfer of oxygen to the human brain.
Motor vehicles are the dominant source of CO emissions in most areas. CO is a non-reactive air
pollutant that dissipates relatively quickly, so ambient CO concentrations generally follow the spatial
and temporal distributions of vehicular traffic. High CO levels in the planning area develop
primarily during winter when periods of light winds combine with the formation of ground level
temperature inversions (typically from the evening through early morning), resulting in reduced
dispersion of vehicle emissions. Motor vehicles also exhibit increased CO emission rates at low air
temperatures. CO hotspots are high concentrations of CO emission that accumulate around areas of
stalled traffic, such as at busy intersections and roadway segments during peak traffic periods.
Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10)
Particulate Matter is dust, smoke, and other solid matter that is commonly released into the
atmosphere from ground disturbance or direct emissions from various sources, including factories
and internal combustion engines. The federal and state ambient air quality standards for particulate
matter apply to two classes of particulates: PM2.5 and PM10. Particulates can damage human health
when inhaled into the lungs. High concentrations of particulates in the air can reduce visibility, may
corrode some materials, and can retard plant growth.
Greenhouse Gas
In addition, the State of California recently passed into law the Global Warming Solutions Act of
2006, commonly referred to as Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), which is designed to significantly reduce
GHG emissions generated by California in the short- and long-term. There is broad scientific
consensus that humans are changing the chemical composition of our atmosphere through the
buildup of climate change pollutants. Activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and
other changes in land use result in the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon
dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere. An increase in GHG emissions results in an increase in the
Earth’s average surface temperature, which is commonly referred to as global warming. Global
warming is expected, in turn, to affect weather patterns, average sea level, ocean acidification,
chemical reaction rates, precipitation rates, etc., in a manner commonly referred to as climate
change.
AB 32 recognizes that GHG reduction in California will require similar reductions by other states
and countries in order to be meaningful. As such, California’s prospective emission reductions
specified in AB 32 are an attempt to establish a global leadership role on climate change abatement
and to act as a blueprint for other states and nations to reduce their respective GHG emissions. The
heart of the bill is the requirement that statewide GHG emissions must be reduced to 1990 levels by
the year 2020. The bill requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt rules and
regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-
effective GHG reductions, as specified.
The bill authorizes the use of market-based compliance mechanisms, which are also known as cap
and trade programs. Market-based approaches to GHG emission reduction are currently in use in
Europe and have been used in the United States to address acid rain precursors; a GHG cap and

trade program is also being implemented in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states as part of the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. There is also specific language to support the use of AB 32 to
abate other air quality issues, such as ozone, particulate matter, and toxic air contaminant exposures
“to the extent feasible and in furtherance of achieving the statewide GHG emissions limit.”

                             emissions under the control of the City to 1990 emissions level to
                             support State implementation of AB-32.
           RME Policy 1.6.1:     The City will prepare and adopt a Climate Action Plan (CAP) within 2 years
                                 of adopting this General Plan Update. The CAP shall include an inventory
                                 of the 1990 level of greenhouse gas production within the City, and a
                                 projection of the level of GHG emissions by 2020. The CAP shall set out a
                                 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and specific policies and actions
                                 to be undertaken by the City to reduce production of greenhouse gases to
                                 the 1990 level by 2020. The policies and actions will include incentives and
                                 regulatory requirements to reduce levels of generation by the private sector,
                                 actions to reduce the City’s level of generation, and actions that the City will
                                 take in concert with other public agencies to reduce greenhouse gas
                                 generation. Development of the CAP will include a robust public and
                                 stakeholder process to ensure community input and ownership of the
                                 ultimately adopted CAP.
           RME Policy 1.6.2:     Include mechanisms to ensure regular review of progress toward the
                                 emission reduction targets established by the CAP, report progress to the
                                 public and responsible officials, and revise the plan as appropriate, using
                                 principles of adaptive management. Allocate funding to implement the plan.
                                 Provide funds for City staff to oversee implementation of the plan.
           RME Policy 1.6.3:     Establish a Brawley Climate Action Team (CAT) broadly representative of
                                 the community to provide formal structured input and review of the
                                 development of the Climate Action Plan.

Plan
All areas designated as non-attainment under the CCAA are required to prepare plans showing how
the area would meet the State air quality standards by its attainment dates. The Imperial County Air
Quality Attainment Plan (AQAP) is the region’s plan for improving air quality.
The programs established in the AQAP are reflected in the policies contained in this element and
related implementation plans and programs. However, it should be noted that California law
requires ICAPCD to update the AQAP every three years to accommodate all of the local City and
County General Plan updates. As of the date of this General Plan, ICAPCD has not yet updated their
1991 AQAP. As a result, the AQAP does not reflect the land use transportation and energy
conservation plans of municipalities within its District. The City shall adhere to the existing AQAP
and future revised AQAPs.

UNIQUE TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES
Introduction
                                                             Brawley possesses important natural resources
                                                             and features that warrant protection,
                                                             preservation, and management as the
                                                             community grows. While the majority of the
                                                             Brawley Planning Area is urbanized or used
                                                             for agricultural production, important natural
                                                             resources remain and contribute to the unique
                                                             character of the City. The most significant
                                                             natural features of Brawley are associated with
                                                             the New River. The New River riparian
                                                             habitat supports a variety of wildlife and its
                                                             bluffs provide topographic relief from the flat
                                                             valley. Scenic views are enjoyed throughout
                    New River Bluffs                         Brawley including panoramic views of the
                                                             stark topography of the Chocolate Mountains
in the east and the foothills of the Peninsular Range in the west, the New River riparian corridor, and
agricultural open space. The natural features and views are important to maintain a pleasant and
healthy environment for Brawley residents.
The outlying western, northern, eastern, and southern parts of the Brawley Planning Area are
unincorporated County lands. Most of the unincorporated lands are used for agricultural production
but they also contain some important natural resources that require protection. Portions of the
riparian habitat and bluffs associated with the New River are located in County unincorporated lands
in addition to some natural desert vegetation and panoramic views of surrounding agricultural
landscape and steep mountains.

Plan
As illustrated in Figure RME-1, Natural Resources for Conservation, the most significant natural
features of Brawley are associated with the New River. Because the most important natural features
are related to the New River, most of the New River corridor in the Planning Area is designated as
Open Space in the General Plan Land Use Element. The Open Space designation only allows the
development of parks and other recreational facilities. Due to the low intensity of land uses allowed
by this land use designation, the natural features related to the New River receive some protection.
To further protect important natural resources, the City will review all new development proposals
for potential environmental impacts to natural resources according to the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), including potential impacts to natural plant and animal communities, and
unique topographic landforms (e.g., New River bluffs). In addition, geologic constraints, such as
steep slopes and unstable soils, will be assessed. Potential impacts to important natural features will
be avoided by incorporating the preservation of natural resources into development projects or
mitigate impacts to resources with appropriate measures. The City of Brawley will also review all
applications for development in the unincorporated land in the Brawley Planning Area and
recommend any necessary revisions to conserve natural resources.
City of Brawley                                                                                  September 2008

                                                                                                      J&S 00136.07
To maintain the visual character of Brawley, the City will evaluate new development projects for
impacts to public views. In particular, the City will encourage the maintenance of public views of
New River corridor and minimize the disruption of public views of surrounding landscape and
distant mountains. The City will particularly focus on the preservation of public views from major
circulation roadways.

WATER RESOURCES
Introduction
Water supply and quality are particularly important resource issues as a result of Brawley’s desert
climate and geography. Urban and agricultural activity within the Planning Area is dependent on
imported water. The Planning Area is traversed by the New River, which is one of the few natural
surface streams in the region. The New River, which flows from the southwestern corner to the
northern boundary of the Brawley Planning Area, is highly polluted with raw sewage and toxic
materials as it flows through Mexico toward the United States. Once the New River crosses the
international border, it is used to collect agricultural runoff which contains pesticides, fertilizers,
high salinity levels, and sediment. The New River continues north and terminates at the Salton Sea,
which is an important wildlife refuge.

Plan
Two types of water resource issues will be addressed
by the City in future years: the quality of surface
water and the availability of water for domestic and
agricultural uses.
The City of Brawley will take measures to improve
the quality of agricultural and urban runoff that is
produced within the City and deposited into the New
River. To this end, the City will require the
                                                                                  New River
incorporation of Best Management Practices in new
development projects and rehabilitation projects pursuant to the National Pollution System
Discharge Permit (NPDES) regulations, and provide information to agricultural and industrial
operations within the City on methods to reduce or eliminate surface water contamination. The City
will also participate in regional, state, national, and international efforts to improve surface water
quality, particularly in the New River.

Urban development and agricultural production in Brawley is mostly dependent upon water
imported from the Colorado River. As the population of the southwestern United States continues to
grow, the competition for limited water supplies will escalate. The environmental impact of projects
requiring large quantities of water has been recognized and the prospect of new water projects is
low. The Imperial Irrigation District, which supplies water to Brawley for both domestic and
agricultural purposes, has already entered into an agreement to divert some of its water to the heavily
urbanized areas of southern California. The available water supply for Imperial County must be
conserved to ensure that adequate amounts are available for planned development and continued
agricultural production.
Water conservation in both urban development and agricultural activity will be promoted by the
City. New development and rehabilitation projects will be required to make maximum use of water
conservation techniques and the use of drought resistant plant species in ornamental landscaping will
be encouraged. In addition, the City will consider using reclaimed water to replace the use of
imported water for landscape irrigation; work with the County, Imperial Irrigation District, and local
farmers to develop and implement conservation strategies for agricultural production; and support
the Imperial Irrigation District in its efforts to maintain local water supplies and underground or
cover irrigation canals for safety and conservation purposes.

SOLID WASTE/RECYCLING
Introduction
Managing the creation, use, and disposal of solid waste is an essential part of life in an urban
community. Recent state legislation requires cities to aggressively pursue solid waste recycling and
source reduction.
The City of Brawley is currently served by Allied Waste Management Services, a privately owned
company that transports solid waste from residences and businesses to the Allied Imperial Landfill.
The Imperial Landfill is a Class III non-hazardous solid waste landfill that opened in January 2000
along East Robinson Road in unincorporated land on the eastern outskirts of the City of Imperial,
approximately 8 miles northeast of the City. Currently, the landfill is approaching full capacity and
the owner/operator has prepared a Landfill Plan for the site that includes development of a new cell
to provide additional landfill space. The proposed Landfill Plan would extend the facility’s life from
the remaining three to five (3-5) years to approximately thirty (30) years in order to meet the current
                                                        and future waste disposal needs of Imperial
                                                        County.
                                                        The County’s Integrated Waste Management
                                                        Board (IWMB) oversees solid waste disposal
                                                        throughout the County. Since 2002, diversion
                                                        rates for the City have steadily increased to
                                                        49 percent in 2005. As development
                                                        proceeds in Brawley, more solid waste will
                                                        be generated. The increased amounts of solid

Plan
To reduce the environmental impacts of increased amounts of solid waste, the City will comply with
the Integrated Waste Management Act by maintaining an up-to-date Source Reduction and
Recycling Plan. The City of Brawley will review its source reduction and recycling plan at least
once every five years to correct any deficiencies in these documents. If any revisions are made, they
must also be submitted to the County IWMB for approval or disapproval.
In addition, each year after approval of the City’s source reduction and recycling plan, the City must
submit a progress report to the County IWMB. The County IWMB maintains a 50 percent solid
waste diversion goal for its member jurisdictions, meaning that 50 percent of solid waste potentially
destined for regional landfills must be recycled, reused, or otherwise diverted from the landfills.

ENERGY CONSERVATION
Introduction
Energy resources are highly valued and their conservation is important for sustaining the community
and meeting future demands. In addition, reduced energy consumption will also result in the
reduction of related air pollutant emissions. Regional air quality is thereby improved from increased
energy conservation. Due to the City's location in an arid region, substantial energy is consumed
during the cooling of both residential and non-residential structures throughout the summer months.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies

CULTURAL AND PALEONTOLOGICAL
RESOURCES
Introduction
Cultural resources is a general
term that includes many types of
physical remains of past human
activities as well as other types
of resources important to Native
Americans and other ethnic
groups. Cultural resources
include prehistoric and historical
archaeological remains,
historical architectural remains
including buildings and
structures and other features of
the built environment, and
places of importance to Native
Americans.                                    Historical Image of Downtown Main Street, Brawley 1970
Brawley possesses important cultural resources, which provide a sense of history and origin. These
resources can be conserved for future generations through proper identification and planning.
Significant archaeological resources potentially occur along undeveloped banks of the New River
and on the terraces overlooking the river corridor. The Kamia culture, a desert subgroup of the
Kumeyaay (Diegueno), occupied the Valley prior to the establishment of Anglos. The Kamia lived
along surface streams in the Valley, including the New River, and practiced irrigated agriculture.
American settlement began in Brawley at the turn of the 20th Century and the City incorporated in
1908. The City initially served as a bedroom community for farmers and cattlemen working in the
central part of Imperial Valley. Due to the historic location of Brawley along the railroad, the City
also served as an important trading and shipping center. For many years, Brawley contained the
largest population concentration in Imperial Valley and a number of residential, commercial, civic,
and agricultural structures were constructed. Although many of these structures are no longer
standing, there is a potential for the existence of subsurface features such as house foundations,
privies, and trash deposits at these locations. The remaining structures and the subsurface features
represent important information about Brawley's heritage and provide a temporal context for future
generations.

will require a site inspection by a professional archaeologist during the development review process
for all projects located in the potential resource area shown in Figure RME-2. If the archaeologist
indicates that significant resources exist on the site and will be impacted by the proposed
development project, the impact shall be avoided or mitigated according to the California
Environmental Quality Act Guidelines. Mitigation may involve archaeological investigation and
resource recovery. The City will also develop and maintain an inventory of archaeological sites in
the Planning Area.

AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Introduction
The Brawley Planning Area includes productive
agricultural soils. A balance between new urban
development and conservation of agricultural
lands is important for expansion of the local
economy, conservation of prime agricultural soils
for continued agricultural production, and
maintenance of the City's rural character.
Imperial County, including the Brawley area, is                Agriculture Borders the City’s Boundaries
one of the finest agricultural areas in the world.
This is due to several environmental and cultural factors including good soils, a year-round growing
season, the availability of adequate water transported from the Colorado River by a complex canal
system, extensive areas committed to agricultural production, a gently sloping topography, and a
climate that is well-suited for growing crops and raising livestock. Agricultural production has been
one of the most important economic activities in Brawley throughout the 1900s until the present day
and is expected to play a major economic role in the foreseeable future.
If agricultural activity becomes constrained by the increased urbanization of Brawley, farmers may
find developing their land more profitable than continuing the crop cultivation and livestock
production.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
RME Goal 8:               Minimize the Loss of Agricultural Lands
    RME Objective 8.1: Conserve and protect designated agricultural lands and plan for their
                             continued use.
           RME Policy 8.1.1:     All Important Farmland, including the categories of Prime Farmland,
                                 Farmland of Statewide Importance, Unique Farmland, and Farmland of
                                 Local Importance, as defined by State and Federal agencies, outside the
                                 City’s boundaries should be reserved for agricultural uses.
           RME Policy 8.1.2:     Encourage infill development and establish buffers between agricultural and
                                 non-agricultural uses.
           RME Policy 8.1.3:     Provide adequate circulation routes for the transport of agricultural products
                                 and machinery.
City of Brawley                                                                                   September 2008
General Plan Update                                RME-31
                                                                                                       J&S 00136.07

           RME Policy 8.1.4:     Require adequate drainage facilities for all new development projects to
                                 prevent runoff into agriculture lands and subsequent erosion of agricultural
                                 soils.
           RME Policy 8.1.5:     Limit the introduction of land uses that are unusually sensitive (hospitals
                                 and schools but not housing) to farming in order to limit the potential for
                                 conflict with existing agricultural uses.
           RME Policy 8.1.6:     Prohibit "leapfrogging" or checkerboard patterns of non-agricultural
                                 development in designated agricultural areas.
           RME Policy 8.1.7:     Encourage the maintenance of existing businesses that support agricultural
                                 production and the transportation of agricultural products and encourage the
                                 establishment of similar new businesses.
           RME Policy 8.1.8:     Proposed development must be contiguous to the City's boundary, and must
                                 be sequential and orderly.
           RME Policy 8.1.9:     Where new residential uses are established next to agricultural lands, require
                                 residential developers to mitigate adverse effects from the exposure of
                                 residents to agricultural chemicals, dust and other "nuisances" in a manner
                                 that is consistent the County Right- to-Farm Ordinance.
    RME Objective 8.2: Manage the production of economically valuable agricultural
                             resources to achieve a balance between current market forces and
                             long-term community values.
           RME Policy 8.2.1:     Support the County's Right to Farm Ordinance.
Plan
Substantial acreage of Prime Farmland and Farmland of Statewide Importance is located in the
Brawley Planning Area (Figure RME-3). To protect agricultural land in Brawley, the General Plan
Land Use Element designates northern, western and southern portions of the Planning Area for
agricultural uses.
The City will support the agricultural uses of productive farmland by considering the circulation
requirements for the transport of agricultural products and machinery, enforcing the County's
Right-to-Farm Ordinance, and encouraging existing and long-term businesses supporting
agricultural production in Brawley. In addition, the City will prevent "leap-frog" development
patterns by requiring new residential or non-agricultural commercial uses to be adjacent to an
existing urbanized area. Through the City's development review process, proposed non-agricultural
projects near areas used for agricultural purposes will be assessed for potential impacts to
agricultural production and potential impacts to the proposed land use. Buffers will be required
between agricultural and non-agricultural uses to minimize land use compatibility problems.

GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES
Introduction
Geothermal resources are being developed in
Imperial Valley to provide a relatively clean
source of power. Imperial County contains one
of the largest, liquid-dominated geothermal
resources in the world. In addition, the
geothermal resources in the County are hotter
and located at shallower depths than geothermal
resources in other parts of the world. Liquid-
dominated geothermal resources can provide a
relatively clean source of power compared to
other energy sources (e.g., coal and petroleum                         Geothermal Energy Well
reserves), which have resulted in significant
impacts to the environment and society. While Imperial County is a national leader in the
development of its geothermal resources, development has not progressed as rapidly as projected
due to historically high operating costs, slow growth in utility company demand, and the relatively
low cost of oil. Known Geothermal Resource Areas occur within the Brawley Planning Area and
one geothermal energy project is located within the Brawley Planning Area, with another plant by
ORMAT currently being processed by the County.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
RME Goal 9:              Encourage Expanded Development of Brawley Geothermal
                         Resources
    RME Objective 9.1: Support the safe, orderly, and efficient development of geothermal
                             resources.
           RME Policy 9.1.1:     Coordinate any development of geothermal resources with the County and
                                 power-providing entities.
           RME Policy 9.1.2:     Review current information on existing and planned geothermal
                                 development projects in the County.
           RME Policy 9.1.3:     Monitor existing and future geothermal energy projects, located within and
                                 adjacent to the Planning Area, for environmental impacts.

Plan
The City will continue to support and encourage development of the geothermal resources within the
Planning Area. In addition to providing an alternative power source, the development of geothermal
resources will provide new jobs, stimulate local commerce, and increase tax revenue. While
geothermal projects can provide many benefits to Brawley, the potential environmental impacts
must be carefully monitored, including loss of agricultural lands, degradation of plant and animal
habitat, substantial water usage for recharge and contamination, land subsidence, and potential for
explosion and release of hazardous gases.
Related Goals and Policies
Goals and policies of the other Brawley General Plan Elements also relate to resource management
issues. Internal consistency is a major legislative requirement for all general plans. Table RM-1
shows the goals of the Resource Management Element that are related to the other Elements of the
Brawley General Plan.

INTRODUCTION TO THE
OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ELEMENT
Brawley contains considerable amounts of
open land, or "open space", which refers to              OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ELEMENT
land that is not developed with urban uses.         OSRE Goal 1:    Preservation of Designated Open Space
Expansive agricultural fields surround the          OSRE Goal 2:    Ensure Protection of Agricultural
                                                                    Lands
compact city and public parks are distributed       OSRE Goal 3:    Designate Open Space for the
throughout the urban area. The City intends                         Protection of Public Health and Safety
to preserve open space for agricultural             OSRE Goal 4:    Maintain and Improve an Adequate
production, recreational purposes, scenic                           Quantity, Quality, Type, and
enjoyment, and wildlife habitat. As the City                        Distribution of Parks and Recreational
develops, maintenance of agricultural lands                         Facilities throughout the City
                                                    OSRE Goal 5:    Support Park and Recreational
and the New River corridor will be balanced                         Programs that Reflect needs of the
with economic development interests. New                            Community
parks will be established to provide                OSRE Goal 6:    Create and Expand Efficient Park and
recreational opportunities for the growing                          Recreation Facilities and Programs
population.
This Open Space/Recreation Element meets the requirements of the State-mandated Open Space
Element as defined in Section 65302(e) of the Government Code. According to these requirements,
the Open Space Element must contain policies concerned with managing all open space areas,
including undeveloped lands and outdoor recreational areas. The Open Space Element must
specifically identify open space that is left undeveloped for the preservation of natural resources,
managed production of natural resources, protection of public health and safety, and lands for parks
and recreation.
This element addresses recreational resources and needs beyond the level mandated by State law.
The City of Brawley has determined that adequate recreational facilities are necessary to maintain a
high quality living environment and has elected to include long-term recreational policies and
programs in the City's General Plan. Since the Open Space Element must address lands for parks
and recreation, additional recreational policies and programs have been combined with the open
space policies and programs as the Open Space/Recreation Element.
In addition to this Introduction, the Open Space/Recreation Element is composed of five sections:
Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources, Open Space for Managed Production of
Resources, Open Space for Protection of Public Health and Safety, Land for Parks and Recreation
Programs. Each section contains an Introduction, Goals, Objectives and Policies, and a Plan.
Specific implementation programs for this Element are contained in the Implementation Chapter of
the General Plan.

OPEN SPACE FOR PRESERVATION OF
NATURAL RESOURCES
Introduction
Brawley contains natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. The most
significant natural resources are related to the New River and include riparian habitat for sensitive
plant and animal species, and steep bluff topography. These natural resources are easily disturbed
by development and should be preserved through an open space land use designation.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
OSRE Goal 1:             Preservation of Designated Open Space
OSRE Objective 1.1:           Preserve designated open space to preserve natural resources.
           OSRE Policy 1.1.1:    Preserve designated open space in the New River area to protect important
                                 biological habitat and preserve views of the natural river area. Maintain a
                                 buffer between the designated open space and New River area from
                                 development.
Plan
The Land Use Plan in the General Plan Land Use Element designates the entire length of the New
River Corridor within the Planning Area as Open Space, (with the exception of the area at the
intersection of the New River and State Route 78 which is designated for commercial uses). Figure
OSRE-1 shows the distribution of designated open space. Development of the land under the Open
Space designation will be limited to passive and active recreational uses. The development density
allowed under the Open Space category is very low to allow for the preservation of the riparian
features.
As development proceeds in Brawley, additional open space may be designated outside of the New
River corridor. Through the development review process, the City will evaluate proposed project
sites for important natural resources such as, but not limited to, riparian habitat for sensitive plant
and animal species and steep bluff topography. Where applicable, the City will consider requiring
the project proponent to designate the natural resource area as open space. The City will particularly
consider implementing this requirement when the natural resource area is contiguous with
previously designated open space or other important natural resources.

The Resource Management Element of the General Plan establishes policies that require assessment
of development projects within the New River corridor for potential impacts to important natural
resources. Projects will either be redesigned to avoid impacting resources in the New River corridor
or appropriate mitigation measures will be required.

OPEN SPACE FOR MANAGED
PRODUCTION OF RESOURCES
Introduction
Brawley also contains natural resources that are
used for the production of beneficial goods.
Productive agricultural soils are abundant in the
Planning Area and must be managed wisely to
avoid degradation of the soils, interference with
agricultural activities, and undue loss of acreage to
urban uses.
The historic development of the City of Brawley is
intrinsically tied to agricultural production. The          Alfalfa Fields that Could Potentially Be New Home
Imperial Valley, including the City of Brawley,                                     Sites
contains some of the world's richest agricultural soils. With the use of imported water for
irrigation, the desert landscape has been transformed to productive agricultural fields. The
livelihood of many Brawley residents and businesses depends directly or indirectly on the long-term
conservation of agricultural lands and continued agricultural production.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
OSRE Goal 2:              Ensure Protection of Agricultural Lands
OSRE Objective 2.1:           Designate identified agricultural lands outside the Brawley Urban
                              Area to prevent development, and enhance community character
                              and visual relief.
           OSRE Policy 2.1.1:     Provide adequate buffers between residential and agricultural land uses.
           OSRE Policy 2.1.2:     Prevent "checkerboard" or "leap frog" development by only allowing
                                  development to occur adjacent to existing urban uses.
Plan
Substantial amounts of land in the northern, southern and eastern portions of the Planning Area have
been designated as agriculture. The Agricultural designation provides for the continuation of
agriculture, animal keeping, and development of very low density single-family dwellings. The
City of Brawley                                                                                     September 2008

                                                                                                         J&S 00136.07
designation will permit the construction of a maximum density of two single family dwelling units
per net acre of land. Other uses such as churches, schools, and child-care facilities are also permitted
when they are determined to be compatible with and oriented toward serving the needs of very low
density single family dwelling units. Figure OSRE-2 shows the distribution of land designated for
Agricultural.
To facilitate continued agricultural production in Brawley, the City will prevent "checkerboard" or
"leap frog" development by only allowing development to occur adjacent to existing urban uses.
Implementation of this policy will maintain large, contiguous fields and minimize interference with
agricultural operations. In addition, the City will require developers to provide adequate buffers
between residential and agricultural uses to minimize the effects of dust, noise, crop-dusting
overspray, and night lighting on residential uses.

OPEN SPACE FOR PROTECTION
OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
Introduction
Various natural and man-made conditions in
Brawley, including the New River and the
Brawley Municipal Airport, could potentially
threaten the health and safety of Brawley
residents and visitors. By employing appropriate
open space areas and restricting development in
hazardous areas, the threat of these conditions can
be minimized.
                                                                        Citrus View Park (Mini-Park)
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
OSRE Goal 3:             Designate Open Space for the Protection of Public Health and
                         Safety
OSRE Objective 3.1:           Establish open space areas that help to protect the public from
                              hazards associated with floods, earthquake fault zones, unstable
                              slopes and bluffs, and airplane crashes.
           OSRE Policy 3.1.1:     Identify potential public safety hazard areas and designate the areas as open
                                  space in the Land Use Element.
           OSRE Policy 3.1.2:     Prevent development from occurring within open space areas designated for
                                  public safety reasons.
Plan
Public health and safety hazards are associated with the New River corridor. These hazards are
related to potential floods, unstable bluffs, and soil settlement. The Land Use Plan designates the
New River corridor as Open Space. This designation only allows limited types of uses at a very low
density of development. No residential uses will be developed in this area. Implementation of this
land use designation will not result in a permanent localized population and the public safety hazards
will therefore be minimal. The Public Safety/Noise Element of the General Plan contains specific
policies and programs to be implemented when development is proposed near the New River. These
policies and programs are related to the assessment of potential hazardous conditions on proposed

development sites and require appropriate design measures to reduce identified hazards.
The Brawley Municipal Airport is located in the northern portion of the urbanized area. Figure
OSRE-3 shows the relationship between the airport and the planned industrial use areas. The
objective of employing the Light Industrial/Business Park designations around the airport is to
minimize the risk of aircraft overflight incidents and potential human endangerment. The population
density in industrial use area is relatively low compared to other types of land uses, (i.e., residential,
commercial, public). In the case of an aircraft accident, the threat of human endangerment will be
much lower than if the area was developed with more intensive uses. The Public Safety/Noise
Element contains specific policies and programs to further minimize the hazards related to the
operation of the airport.

LAND FOR PARKS AND RECREATION
Introduction
The park and recreation system in Brawley is a vital part of life and character in the community. A
wide variety of parks are currently distributed throughout Brawley. As development proceeds within
Brawley according to the Land Use Plan (see Figure LUE-1), the population of the City will
increase. New residents will desire recreational activities and the capacity of existing parks and
recreation facilities to meet the demand of both the existing and new population will be exceeded.
To ensure that adequate parks and recreational areas exist in Brawley to meet the needs of residents
and visitors, the City shall continue to use a park classification system and related park standards
based on population.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
OSRE Goal 4:              Maintain and Improve an Adequate Quantity, Quality, Type,
                          and Distribution of Parks and Recreational Facilities
                          throughout the City
OSRE Objective 4.1:           Support the development and maintenance of a balanced system of
                              public and private parks and recreation facilities that serves the
                              needs of existing and future residents in the City of Brawley.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.1:    Preserve public and private open space lands for active and passive
                                 recreational opportunities. Utilize zoning and land use control as a means to
                                 preserve open space lands.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.2:    Ensure that the City's laws and related implementation tools relating to park
                                 dedication and development (e.g., ordinances, regulations, in-lieu fee
                                 schedules, etc.) reflect current land and construction costs, and are providing
                                 adequate park land and facilities concurrent with population growth.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.3:    Explore and utilize an acquisition program for open space areas other than
                                 an in-fee acquisition; such as open space easements, leaseholds, land
                                 donations, and gift annuities.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.4:    Where sites become available, the City should explore the feasibility of their
                                 purchase for additional parkland or recreational facilities in the park service
                                 areas where deficiencies exist.

           OSRE Policy 4.1.5:     Assure that the design and development of public open space results in low
                                  cost maintenance, visually un-obscured, and readily accessible open space
                                  areas.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.6:     Encourage all future public neighborhood and community parks in the City
                                  to be designed as joint-use facilities contiguous with public schools and
                                  sharing playfields, playgrounds, and other amenities wherever possible.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.7:     Encourage and, where appropriate, require the inclusion of recreation
                                  facilities and open space within future residential, industrial and commercial
                                  developments.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.8:     For privately owned open space areas located within and of benefit to
                                  particular subdivisions, require the incorporation and maintenance to be the
                                  financial responsibility of the benefitting property owners and ensure the
                                  provision of adequate notice of this responsibility.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.9:     Evaluate and, where feasible, utilize the opportunities offered by abandoned
                                  roads, railroad right-of-ways, and similar environmentally impacted or
                                  unused linear open spaces for low- maintenance greenbelts and multi-use
                                  trails.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.10:    Strive to provide Brawley with a full range of recreational opportunities that
                                  reflect the community's current and future population size and demographic
                                  character.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.11:    Design new and renovated parks for convenient and accessible use by the
                                  disabled, elderly, and otherwise less mobile persons within the community.
           OSRE Policy 4.1.12:    Establish a pedestrian and bicycle trail that links the City’s parks and
                                  recreational facilities.
OSRE Objective 4.2:           Coordinate local open space and trail areas with the regional
                              facilities of the County and nearby cities.
           OSRE Policy 4.2.1:     Coordinate with and support efforts by Imperial County, California
                                  Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and the
                                  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
           OSRE Policy 4.2.2:     Coordinate with the Del Rio Country Club to provide maximum public
                                  recreational opportunities.
Plan
As new development projects are proposed in Brawley, the City will assess the impact of new
development on the existing park and recreation system. Impacts will be assessed using the park
classifications and standards identified below. Several methods will be used to provide new park
and recreation facilities as the City population grows. The City will encourage and, where

appropriate, require the inclusion of recreation facilities and open space within future residential
developments.
Park Classifications and Standards
The City’s overall park standard is to provide five acres
of developed parkland per 1,000 residents. The park
standards for the individual park classifications (mini-
park, neighborhood park, and community park) defined
below are guidelines for development and are subject to
change.
Mini-Park: A mini-park is a specialized facility that
serves a concentrated or limited population or specific
group such as tots or senior citizens. Mini-parks are                     Thorton Park (Neighborhood Park)
typically located within neighborhoods and in close
proximity to apartments or multifamily dwellings. Mini-parks should have a service radius of less
than a quarter mile and be less than two acres in size. The standard for mini-parks is .25 -.5 acres
per 1,000 population.
                                                           Neighborhood Park: A neighborhood park is
                                                           an area for intense recreational activities such as

                                                           Community Park: Community Parks are areas
of diverse environmental quality. A community park may include areas suited for recreational
facilities such as athletic complexes and large swimming pools. The parks may be areas of natural
quality for outdoor recreation such as walking, viewing, and picnicking. They may be a
combination of the above depending on the site and the needs of the community. Community parks
serve several neighborhoods within a one–to–two mile radius and should be 15 acres or larger. The
standard for community parks is 5 acres per 1,000 population.

Tables OSRE-4, OSRE-5, and OSRE-6 summarize the calculations for the acreage projections for
the three parkland categories. The projections are based on the future Land Use Plan (see Figure
LUE-1), existing park acreage, and planned park acreage. To meet the demand for recreational
opportunities for the three parkland categories of the General Plan build-out population in 2030, up
to 22.3 acres of mini-park, 14.7 acres of neighborhood park, and 33.1 acres of community park must
be developed.

Methods to Achieving Additional Park and Recreation Facilities
The City will require the dedication of parkland, a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, as a
condition of new residential development pursuant to the Quimby Act. The City will periodically
review the requirements for park dedication and development fees to ensure that they reflect current
land and construction costs.
In addition to using the Quimby Act provisions to obtain new parkland, the City will coordinate with
the Brawley School District and Brawley Union High School District to increase joint-use facilities.
 Public school grounds, which typically contain play equipment, turfed areas, sports facilities, and
gymnasiums, often act as defacto parks. With such facilities in place, it is in the public interest that
they be used for outdoor recreation by other segments of the population in addition to students. The
City will pursue comprehensive, long-term cooperative agreements with the Brawley School District
and Brawley Union High School District to maximize joint usage. Where possible, future public
neighborhood and community parks will be located adjacent to public schools and share amenities.
When planning and designing new parks and recreation facilities, the City will solicit input from the
school district to maximize the joint use potential.
The City will continue the use of assessment districts and the Adopt-a-Park program to obtain and
maintain parkland. The City will continue to require all new subdivisions to fund the development
and maintenance of parks through assessment districts. The Adopt-a-Park program entails
encouraging civic organizations to adopt a park and assist in park maintenance. Civic organizations
can participate in fundraising events and enhance staff efforts.
Other alternative methods will also be used to meet the projected parkland requirements. The City
will explore opportunities for open space easements, leaseholds, land donations, and gift annuities to
add parks and open space for recreation. The City will identify low cost land that could be suitable
for park development, such as abandoned road and railroad right-of-way, and similarly
environmentally impacted or unused linear open space. Furthermore, the City will coordinate and
support the provision of parks and recreation facilities by other agencies, (e.g., Imperial County,
California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service), and private parties, (e.g., Del Rio Country Club).
Through appropriate park design and development, the City will minimize maintenance costs of
future parks. Designs for new parks and recreational facilities will emphasize strength, durability,
simplicity, and uniformity. These objectives for low cost maintenance will also be considered in all
improvements to existing parks. The maintenance of privately owned open space areas and parks
will be the long-term, financial responsibility of benefitting property owners. By keeping public
maintenance costs low, more funds will be available for parkland acquisition and development.
The City will emphasize stewardship in the operation and maintenance of existing parks. By taking
proper care of existing parks and thereby projecting a safe and clean image, more respectful visitors
will use parks. By emphasizing stewardship and making full use of existing parks, the City can
extend the schedule for developing new parks.

RECREATION PROGRAMS
Introduction
The population of Brawley is composed of people of different ages and backgrounds, with different
recreational needs and interests. The City presently offers a variety of recreational programs for
various ages of Brawley residents. The plan for recreational programs focuses on better meeting the
demands of the current population and providing expanded and new programs to meet projected
population growth.

           OSRE Policy 5.1.7:     Cooperate with and provide active support for all non-profit organizations in
                                  the City, which provide recreational programs which supplement or
                                  coordinate with City programs.
           OSRE Policy 5.1.8:     Work cooperatively with the Brawley school districts to provide after-
                                  school activity programs and to make maximum use of school facilities to

           OSRE Policy 5.1.9:     Explore additional recreation programs in those areas of the City where
                                  recreational deficiencies exist.
OSRE Goal 6:             Create and Expand Efficient Park and Recreation Facilities
                         and Programs
OSRE Objective 6.1:           Operate and maintain existing and future parks and recreation
                              facilities so they are safe, clean, and attractive to the public; and
                              preserve, protect, and enhance both existing and potential natural
                              recreation areas to ensure that long-term public investments and
                              values are not unreasonably preempted, compromised, or prevented
                              by neglect or short-term considerations.
           OSRE Policy 6.1.1:     Estimate and evaluate the cost of operating and maintaining parks and
                                  recreation facilities as an integral part of the park design and development
                                  process so that Brawley does not accept responsibility for parks and
                                  recreation areas which it may not be able to adequately maintain over the
                                  long run.
           OSRE Policy 6.1.2:     Require park designs (including landscape treatments, buildings, irrigation,
                                  etc.) that are durable, reasonably standardized, and economical to maintain.
           OSRE Policy 6.1.3:     Explore the creation, either directly or by condition of development plan
                                  approval, Special Benefit or Maintenance Districts and/or community
                                  facilities districts for all future public parks.
           OSRE Policy 6.1.4:     Conserve City resources by not accepting maintenance responsibilities for
                                  recreational facilities within new development projects, which by location,
                                  layout, design, or otherwise, are limited in their value to non-residents or
                                  owners, and which are more properly the responsibility of a local
                                  Homeowners' Association or Commercial/Industrial Owners' Association.
           OSRE Policy 6.1.5:     Utilize, where feasible, significant landscape features and drainage
                                  corridors/flood control channels (e.g., New River) as potential multi-use
                                  trail rights-of-way and special-use trail rights-of-way and special use
                                  recreation sites wherever possible.
OSRE Objective 6.2:           Ensure that park development and recreational policies are pursued
                              and realized in an organized, incremental, and cost-effective manner

           OSRE Policy 6.2.1:     Incrementally promote a financially self-supporting system of recreational
                                  programs and facilities through various types of user fees and funding
                                  opportunities.
           OSRE Policy 6.2.2:     While promoting a self-supporting recreation system, explore means of
                                  providing programs to those who cannot afford to pay.
           OSRE Policy 6.2.3:     Identify, evaluate, and introduce appropriate revenue-generating activities,
                                  potentially including concessionaire-operated facilities, into future
                                  community-level and regional-level parks and recreation centers.
           OSRE Policy 6.2.4:     Develop long-term agreements with the Brawley school districts and, as
                                  appropriate, other agencies that will maximize joint-use and multiple-use of
                                  facilities, eliminate program uncertainty, and reduce overall operations and
                                  maintenance costs.
           OSRE Policy 6.2.5:     When possible or advisable, ensure that new park lands and recreation
                                  facilities are (or by specific commitment, will be) fully improved before the
                                  City accepts responsibility for additional lands and facilities.
           OSRE Policy 6.2.6:     Conserve the City's Quimby Act authority by utilizing, wherever
                                  practicable, the City's broad powers to enact and enforce its General Plan,
                                  Specific Plan(s), Redevelopment Plan(s), and Zoning Ordinance to secure
                                  public recreation sites, open space, trails, and other related land use
                                  objectives of community planning significance.
           OSRE Policy 6.2.7:     Avoid duplication of services wherever possible by coordinating with and
                                  interrelating the City's parks and recreational plans with those of other
                                  agencies and private providers.
Plan
To ensure that adequate recreational programs serve the varied interests of the community, the City
will periodically solicit input from elected officials and community groups to assess the adequacy of
the existing system and identify new recreational needs. The City will ensure that all recreational
programs, services, and facilities are accessible to the disabled in accordance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act. In addition, the City will explore strategies to provide recreational programs
to those who cannot afford to pay, (e.g., corporate sponsorships, volunteers, and joint use of school
facilities and services). Where necessary, existing programs will be modified and new programs
will be developed to reflect new needs and interests as the City population expands in future years.
The City will utilize several methods to provide expanded and new programs. As development
occurs in Brawley some additional tax revenue will be available through Measure O Sales Tax and

Communities Facilities Districts to augment recreation programs. The City will also pursue joint-
use agreements with the Brawley School District and Brawley Union High School District to use
school facilities for recreational programs and provide cooperative after-school activity programs.
Corporate sponsorship will be sought for both special event and long-term programs. Revenue-
generating activities, (e.g., concessionaire-operated facilities), will be considered to generate
increased revenue for new recreational facilities and programs. The City will also coordinate with
other community recreation providers, including the Brawley School District and Brawley Union
High School District, to ensure that recreational programs and services are not being duplicated
within the City.

                                                                    Surrounding Uses
The purpose of the Public Safety/Noise               PSNE Goal 7:   Protect People Living and Working in
Element is to identify and address those                            the City from Excessive Transportation

facilities, and infrastructure. The Element                         Land Use Planning Decisions
establishes policies and programs to minimize
danger to residents and visitors and identifies actions needed to deal with crisis situations. The
Element also identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, defines areas of noise impacts,
and establishes policies and programs to protect residents from excessive noise.
In addition to this Introduction, the Public Safety/Noise Element is composed of nine sections:
Flooding; Seismic and Other Geologic Hazards; Hazards and Toxic Materials; Fire; Emergency
Preparedness Planning/Disaster Response; Aircraft Overflights; Transportation Noise; Non-
Transportation Noise; and, Noise and Land Use Planning Integration. Each section contains an
Introduction, Goals, Objectives and Policies, and a Plan. Specific implementation programs for this
Element are contained in the Implementation Chapter of the General Plan.
Related Plans and Programs
There are several existing plans and programs that are directly applicable to the aims and objectives
of the Public Safety/Noise Element. These plans and programs have been enacted through State and
local legislation and are administered by agencies that are delegated with powers to enforce State
and local laws.

FLOODING
Introduction
The climate of the Imperial Valley region is extremely arid. Rainfall generally ranges between three
and four inches per year. During the winter months, the valley is subject to various degrees of storm
flooding such as flash floods or slow floods. Flash flooding in the desert is generally limited to low-
lying drainages or washes that extend outward from the flanks of the mountains bordering the valley.
 Storm flooding can also occur in floodways of floodplains adjacent to rivers, in low-lying areas
adjacent to water sources (such as irrigation canals), and adjacent to storm drain ditches or other
low-lying areas where storm water may collect.
Most potential flooding problems in the Brawley Planning Area are related to the rise in water level
of the New River during precipitation events. Although Brawley is located within an arid climate,
flooding of the New River can occur during intermittent heavy rains. The risk of flood damage in
Brawley can be reduced through proper land use planning and actions related to new development
and/or redevelopment of land.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
PSNE Goal 1:              Reduce the Risk of Flood Damage in Brawley
PSNE Objective 1.1:           Promote policies and programs that reduce the risk to the
                              community's inhabitants from flood hazards.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.1:    Identify flood hazard areas and provide appropriate land use regulations for
                                 areas subject to flooding.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.2:    Coordinate with the appropriate agencies to assure that existing and future
                                 bridges are constructed according to accepted standards to avoid damage by
                                 flooding.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.3:    Consider participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.4:    Cooperate with the Imperial Irrigation District to plan for and make needed
                                 improvements to drainage infrastructure depositing runoff into the New
                                 River.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.5:    Require detention basins as a flood control measure where applicable to
                                 reduce the risk from flood hazards.
City of Brawley                                                                                  September 2008
General Plan Update                                 PSNE-3
                                                                                                      J&S 00136.07
           PSNE Policy 1.1.6:    Design future development located near water storage facilities to minimize
                                 damage caused by leak, rupture, or flooding from a water storage facility.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.7:    Establish open space required to protect the public from flood hazards.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.8:    Coordinate with Caltrans and road builders to ensure proper roadway design
                                 for drainage purposes.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.9:    Prevent cross-lot drainage between and within developments.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.10:   Prepare a master plan of drainage for the planning area.
           PSNE Policy 1.1.11:   New development within the Planning Area must contain onsite 100% of
                                 the stormwater run-off of a 100 year storm.
Plan
Figure PSNE-1 shows the areas subject to flooding of the New River. Flooding of the New River is
presently not considered hazardous in the Planning Area because little development occurs in the
flood channel and the elevation of the channel is substantially lower than the valley floor. Minor
flooding and ponding of surface water can occasionally occur on the flat valley floor when irrigation
canals overflow or are unable to withstand heavy precipitation. Flooding of the valley floor is
considered more of an inconvenience than a hazard.
To maintain low flood hazards, the City will continue to restrict development in the New River flood
channel. As indicated on the Land Use Policy Map in the General Plan Land Use Element and in
the Open Space/Recreation Element, the New River channel is generally designated as Open Space.
 Development of land under the Open Space designation will be limited to passive and active
recreational uses. To keep flood hazards minimal, the development intensity allowed under the
Open Space category is very low and no residential uses are allowed.
In addition to appropriate land use planning, the City will take other steps to avoid flood hazards in
the Planning Area. During the review of proposed development projects (including roadways), the
City will assess drainage conditions of the project site and require the construction of necessary
drainage infrastructure. New development within the Planning Area must contain 100% of the storm
water runoff onsite. The City will also assess the potential of the project to adversely affect off-site
drainage and require mitigation measures where needed. To maintain adequate city-wide drainage
and flood control as development proceeds in future years, the City will cooperate with the Imperial
Irrigation District to plan and construct drainage infrastructure depositing runoff into the New River,
and consider participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Earthquake-induced shock waves can cause significant structural damage to above-ground water
storage tanks that are not adequately braced and baffled. Sloshing water can lift a water tank off its
foundation and buckle the bottom of the tank. Pipes connected to tanks can be sheared off. There
are several older, above-ground water tanks in the Planning Area. If these water tanks are damaged
during an earthquake, the municipal water supply could be reduced. Efforts to suppress earthquake-
induced fires in the City could consequently be hindered. The City will periodically monitor the
stability of local water storage tanks to avoid earthquake-induced flooding.

SEISMIC AND OTHER GEOLOGIC
HAZARDS
Introduction
The Imperial Valley region is subject to seismic activity which can result in property damage and
personal injury. The seismic activity in Imperial Valley is characterized by the deformation of
recently deposited sediments, high levels of seismicity (many small earthquakes or micro-
earthquakes), evidence of recent fault displacements, and historic surface faulting. Given the
abundance of moderate earthquakes in Imperial Valley, the Brawley Planning Area is particularly
susceptible to strong ground shaking and significant earthquake damage. Strong ground shaking
from an earthquake can result in liquefaction, landslides, ground lurching, and structural damage.
Other hazards can be indirectly triggered by strong ground motion such as fire, hazardous materials
accidents, flood inundation from water tank or reservoir failure, and disruption of essential facilities
and systems, (e.g., water, sewer, gas electricity, transportation, communication, irrigation, and
drainage systems). Flooding due to damage caused by seismic activity is discussed in the previous
section, Flooding.
Other geologic conditions in Brawley are potentially hazardous including steep bluff slopes and soil
settlement and hydro compaction. Seismic and other geologic hazards can be reduced to avoid
unnecessary risk. Appropriate land use planning, building standards, and preparedness actions will
minimize exposure to these hazards.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
PSNE Goal 2:              Reduce the Risk of Seismic and Other Geologic Hazards in
                          Brawley
PSNE Objective 2.1:           Promote policies and programs that reduce the risk to the
                              community from geologic and seismic hazards.
           PSNE Policy 2.1.1:    Require review of soil and geologic conditions by a State-Licensed
                                 Engineering Geologist to determine stability prior to the approval of
                                 development in areas with potential geologic hazards, (e.g., liquefaction,
                                 expansive soils, potential faults).
           PSNE Policy 2.1.2:    Maintain and regularly update all seismic and geologic information
                                 regarding safety, and ensure the consistency of that information with other
                                 affected agencies.

Plan
The primary seismic danger in Brawley is ground shaking, and as a result City cannot directly
mitigate this hazard. Earthquakes in Imperial Valley are unavoidable. However, the City will
require that housing and other structures be designed to be as shock resistant as possible or feasible.
The City will particularly monitor the structural integrity of buildings designed for human
occupancy, critical service structures, and emergency facilities which are essential during periods of
emergency. The City will also monitor bridges and overpasses for structural deficiencies and
directly work with Caltrans, County of Imperial, and Southern Pacific Railroad to correct any
identified deficiencies. Earthquake awareness programs will be periodically promoted by the City
stressing individual preparedness and understanding of community-wide emergency procedures.
The City will require geologic investigations for all development. Development on sites with
identified geologic hazards will be restricted and mitigated to ensure reasonable safety.
Constructing buildings to minimize earthquake hazards will be balanced against City goals, and will
be required if necessary for public safety.
Unreinforced masonry buildings are particularly subject to collapse during earthquakes.
Approximately 39 unreinforced masonry buildings exist within the City of Brawley. The City's
Unreinforced Masonry Ordinance, which has recently been revised, identifies minimal standards to
increase the safety of such buildings. Conformance with the ordinance is voluntary to allow for
sensitivity to the financial needs of property owners and ensure the preservation of Brawley's
City of Brawley                                                                                   September 2008

building stock. The City will continue to encourage owners of unreinforced masonry buildings to
upgrade the structures and comply with the City's Unreinforced Masonry Building Ordinance. The
use of incentives will be continued to bring buildings up to code.
The most northern portions of the Imperial and Brawley Faults are the closest faults to Brawley
which have shown surface rupture or displacement during the past few major earthquakes in
Imperial Valley. The Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone for the Imperial Fault is located to the
south of the Planning Area (Figure PSNE-2). During the 1940 Imperial Earthquake, the Imperial
Fault ruptured the surface approximately three miles south of the Brawley Planning Area.
The New River corridor is subject to liquefaction, which occurs when loose, unconsolidated,
saturated, sandy soils are subjected to ground vibrations during a seismic event. Figure PSNE-3
shows the distribution of potential liquefaction areas. When these sediments are substantially
shaken, they lose their strength and behave as a liquid due to a sudden increase in pore water
pressure. Structures built on soils that liquefy may sink or topple over as the soil loses its bearing
strength. Pursuant to the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act, the City has designated the
portion of the Planning Area within and adjacent to the Special Studies Zone for Agriculture in the
General Plan Land Use Element. Under this designation, very low density uses can only be
developed in addition to agricultural uses. The potential hazard associated with ground rupture
along the fault will consequently be minimal because there will be little or no permanent population
near or on the fault. If development is proposed in the Special Studies Zone, the City will perform a
fault-trenching program to determine whether active or potentially active faults occur and develop
appropriate engineering parameters pursuant to state law.
The New River corridor is designated as Open Space in the Land Use Plan of the General Plan. The
primary uses under this designation are passive and active recreational facilities and low intensity
non-residential uses. The public safety hazard from liquefaction will be minimal as the City
develops because no or very little permanent population will occupy the potential liquefaction areas.
 If development is proposed in an area with high potential for liquefaction, a technical study shall be
prepared by a professional geologist/engineer to identify specific conditions. Mitigation measures
will be incorporated into the project to reduce potential liquefaction hazards.
Other geologic hazards occur in the Planning Area in addition to seismic hazards. The County of
Imperial General Plan identifies areas with landslide hazards based on information from the State
Division of Mines and Geology. No portions of the Brawley Planning Area are susceptible to
landslides with the exception of the steep bluffs adjacent to the New River. The sediments exposed
in the bluffs are susceptible to landsliding and other slope instability problems. Figure PSNE-4
shows the distribution of areas susceptible to landslides and other slope instability problems in
Brawley. Slope stability problems along the New River channel may be activated by excessive rain,
artificial introduction of water into the slope, improper site design or grading practices, and strong
ground motion during an earthquake.
Most of the New River bluffs are designated as Open Space. Under the Open Space designation,
primarily recreational uses are expected to be developed. Some other low density, non-residential
uses will also be allowed. For development projects proposed on sites adjacent to the New River
channel, the City will require a study of existing and/or potential slope problems and require
mitigation measures based on the results of the study and current grading codes.

Planting, irrigation, and drainage guidelines will be developed and implemented for all cut slopes
greater than five feet in height and fill slopes greater than three feet in height.
Some of the soils in Brawley have a high expansion or shrink-swell potential. Soils with high
expansion potential are generally found where fine-grained clayey sediments occur. When soils
expand, foundations can be weakened and structural integrity diminishes.
For all proposed development projects in Brawley, the City will require a site-specific study to
determine the shrink-swell potential of on-site soils. Appropriate mitigation measures will be
required to ensure structural integrity and protect public safety.

HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC MATERIALS
Introduction
Exposure to hazardous and toxic materials can be avoided through proper land use planning and
implementation of policy to reduce risks associated with the use, transport, and disposal of such
materials. The primary means of controlling hazardous materials is governing the siting of and
conditions imposed upon facilities that handle hazardous materials or land uses developed
adjacent to facilities using hazardous materials. The accidental release of hazardous materials
would most likely occur at businesses and agricultural operations that utilize such materials and
along transportation routes used to transport such materials.
Many of the businesses and agricultural operations that store or utilize hazardous materials in
Brawley are separate from the most sensitive land uses, such as residential neighborhoods. In the
event of an accident, the health of persons on or near the site could be threatened but residential
populations would be less affected. Underground tanks are often used to store hazardous materials
for industrial, commercial, and agricultural uses. A number of underground storage tank leaks have
occurred in Brawley and have resulted in ground and groundwater contamination. Underground
storage tanks have been managed as discovered or replaced at all operating gas stations.
Hazardous materials are transported along the Southern Pacific Railroad and State Routes 86 and
111. Liquid petroleum is transported through underground pipelines that generally parallel the
railroad. In addition, pesticides and other agricultural chemicals are transported along a number of
roads in the agricultural portions of the Planning Area. The railroad and State Routes primarily
extend through non-residential areas and a hazardous materials accident may only threaten the health
of occupants of nearby commercial and industrial buildings. The release of hazardous materials
could result in ground and water contamination. Because agricultural areas contain sparse resident
populations, few people would directly be affected by an accident involving agricultural chemicals.
However, ground and water contamination could occur.

Plan
The City of Brawley will ensure that commercial, industrial, and agricultural operations will not
potentially affect public and environmental health by establishing standard procedures to implement
during the development review process. The City will:
    Develop and implement development standards for the storage of hazardous materials to
     minimize damage caused by leaks or ruptures in storage tanks;
    Ensure that required permits from responsible agencies are obtained for projects entailing the
     production, storage, transportation, use, or disposal of hazardous materials;
    Provide a safe distance between land uses involving the production, storage, transportation,
     use, or disposal of hazardous materials and other land uses that may be adversely affected by
     such activities;
    Require development projects to conform to the regulations of the National Pollution
     Discharge Elimination System Permits; and
    Assess the threat of resident exposure to agricultural materials and require development
     designs to minimize exposure where new residential development is proposed next to
     agricultural uses.
Pursuant to the state Emergency Right-to-Know-Act, businesses using hazardous materials must
prepare a Business Plan within one year of operations. The Business Plan identifies the types of
materials used on-site and is submitted to the County Environmental Health Services and Fire
Department. The Brawley Fire Department will obtain copies of Business Plans prepared for
operations within the Planning Area to compile a data base for emergency situations.
The Imperial County Hazardous Materials Area Plan was prepared pursuant to Chapter 6.95 of the
California Health and Safety Code to protect public health and safety from hazardous materials. The
City of Brawley hereby adopts the Hazardous Materials Area Plan by reference to address hazardous
waste issues in the community. The County Hazardous Materials Area Plan establishes emergency
response procedures for hazardous material accidents. The City of Brawley Fire Department will
implement these procedures in case of an accident either at a local business, in an agricultural area,
or along a transportation route. The procedures will be activated once the Fire Department receives
notification of any hazardous materials incident.
Household hazardous wastes, (e.g., paint thinner, household cleaners, automotive products), are a
growing environmental concern. The City will adopt its own Hazardous Household Waste Plan to
minimize environmental contamination and public health hazards associated with toxic household
materials. The Plan will address education of local residents, health hazards from household
hazardous materials, and regular household hazardous waste disposal programs.

FIRE
Introduction
Potential fire hazards exist where water pressure is insufficient for fire fighting, large areas of dry
vegetation occur, and structural codes are not met. The potential for fires can be reduced through
implementation of appropriate regulation, education, and cooperative fire protection measures.
Several types of fire hazards occur in Brawley. The agricultural fields surrounding the urbanized
area are burned regularly. An uncontrolled field fire could threaten adjacent structures. Brush is a
fire hazard in some parts of the Planning Area. In addition, some of the older structures of the City
may be susceptible to fires due to systems that fail to meet current codes, (e.g., heating system,
electrical system, roofing materials).
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
PSNE Goal 4:              Reduce the Risk to the Community's Inhabitants from Fires or
                          Explosions
PSNE Objective 4.1:           Promote policies and programs that reduce the risk to the
                              community's inhabitants from fires or explosions
           PSNE Policy 4.1.1:    Work closely with the City Fire Department to continue to operate an
                                 education program regarding fire hazards for residential, commercial,
                                 industrial and agricultural uses.
           PSNE Policy 4.1.2:    Encourage the use of fire retardant roofing materials.
           PSNE Policy 4.1.3:    Establish and maintain mutual aid agreements with surrounding
                                 jurisdictions for fire protection.
           PSNE Policy 4.1.4:    Enforce building code requirements that assure adequate fire protection.
           PSNE Policy 4.1.5:    Study alternatives for upgrading emergency water line capacities in
                                 deficient areas.
           PSNE Policy 4.1.6:    Maintain service agreements with the Imperial County Fire Department, if
                                 financially feasible.

Plan
The City will reduce fire hazards within new development through adoption and implementation of
Uniform Fire Code provisions and amendments. The amendments shall address local topographic,
geologic, climatic, and development conditions. Incorporation of the Uniform Fire Code in new
development will result in structures that are more resistant to fire and maximize public safety in the
event of a fire. During the development review process, the Public Works Department and the Fire
Department will review water flow and distribution requirements for new development projects to
ensure adequate water pressure for fire fighting.
Education also plays an important role in fire safety. People must be made aware of the fire dangers
in natural and open space areas, particularly in the fire season. The City will provide public
education and information programs to disseminate information regarding potential fire hazards
related to open space areas and residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural uses. All
education programs shall emphasize fire prevention measures to minimize risks.

Plan
Each city must have a plan for response to emergency and disaster situations. The City of Brawley
has an emergency preparedness plan known as the Emergency Operations Plan. The Plan
establishes response procedures for peace and wartime disasters and it complies with the provisions
of the California Emergency Preparedness Plan and Emergency Resources Management Plan which
apply to city governments.
Emergency Evacuation
The City has designated several evacuation routes through Brawley to be used in case of
catastrophic emergencies. The extent and severity of a disaster will determine which routes and
which directions people must take in order to escape or avoid the afflicted areas. Figure PSNE-5
shows the City's emergency evacuation routes.
Emergency Response Personnel
The City Police Department and Fire Department bear most of the responsibility for providing
emergency services. In the event of a major disaster, other City, County, and State personnel
assume local emergency response roles.
Emergency Shelters
In the event of either a natural or man-made disaster, homes may be destroyed or be inaccessible for
extended periods of time. Area residents will need some form of temporary shelter. The City in
coordination with the Red Cross, Salvation Army, and state and federal agencies is responsible for
providing emergency shelter to displaced residents.

The Brawley Emergency Operations Plan contains an inventory of sites suitable for use as
emergency shelters. The site or sites used in a particular emergency depend upon the length of time
required to shelter the refugees. Sites most frequently used for shelter are schools, senior centers,
community centers, public buildings, and churches.

AIRCRAFT OVERFLIGHTS
Introduction
The Brawley Municipal Airport is located in the northern part of the City. The airport is used by
small craft. A right-hand flight pattern is used at the airport and aircraft predominantly land from the
east. Take-offs usually occur to the west and circle northeast. The location of the airport within the
City limits creates potential public safety hazard including air and noise. Accidents occurring during
take-off or landing could impact surrounding land and result in personal injury and property damage.
While the City's power to manage the operational activities of the airport is extremely limited, the
City can participate in land use control within the flight paths and the legislative process that
regulates airport operations. The risk of potential aircraft accidents can be minimized through
proper land use planning and emergency preparedness.
Annual aircraft takeoffs and landings were estimated to be approximately 70,000 annual aircraft
movements (take-offs and landings) estimated in 1999 according to the 2003 Brawley Municipal
Airport Master Plan. However, according to City staff the current number of annual aircraft
movements is closer to 50,000 annual aircraft movements. Future growth of the City of Brawley
will possibly entail additional passenger flights in and out of the area, and the addition of new
industry to the City may create the need for additional cargo trips. Expansion of the airport will
create additional opportunities for increased operations and possible commuter service.

Plan
The City of Brawley adopted the Brawley Airport Master Plan in 2003. The objective of this Master
Plan is provide a framework for the continued development of the Brawley Municipal Airport from
its current status to full satisfaction of facility requirements in a manner that is both environmentally
sound and economically viable. The Imperial County Airport Commission reviewed the Brawley
Airport Master Plan on March 19, 2003 and found the City’s Airport Master Plan consistent with the
County’s Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.
The area around the airport is largely used for agricultural purposes and very little public safety risks
from aircraft accidents are present. The Land Use Element of the General Plan designates the areas
west and north of the airport and under the flight pattern for Industrial uses, (see Figure OSRE-3 in
the Open Space/Recreation Element). The objective of employing the Industrial designation around
the airport and below the flight pattern is to minimize the risk of aircraft overflight incidents and
human endangerment. The population density in industrial use areas is relatively low compared to
other types of use areas. In the case of an aircraft accident, the risk of human endangerment will be
much lower than if the area was developed with more intensive uses. In addition, the City will
include an Airport Overlay in the City Zoning Ordinance that will establish height limitations,
restrict flight hazards, restrict land uses within runway protection zones, and protect residential uses
from excessive noise from airport operations. The City will continue to coordinate the review of
development proposals with the County Airport Land Use Commission.

TRANSPORTATION NOISE
Introduction
One of the primary sources of noise in Brawley is transportation activities. The operation of cars,
trucks, trains, and aircraft generate substantial noise levels that affect the quality of life of the
community. Within the Brawley Planning Area are several transportation related noise sources
including state highways, an airport and a railroad. These sources are the major contributors of
noise in Brawley. Cost effective strategies to reduce their influence on the community noise
environment are an essential part of the Public Safety/Noise Element.
Noise Terminology
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Sound is technically described in terms of the
loudness (amplitude) and frequency (pitch) of the sound. The standard unit of measurement for
sound is the decibel (dB). Because humans do not perceive all frequencies equally well, measured
sound levels at certain frequencies are weighted to correspond to the sensitivity of the human ear.
This frequency weighting is known as A-weighting, and sound levels that are adjusted in this way
are given in units of A-weighted decibels (dBA). Table PSNE-1 describes typical A-weighted noise
levels for various noise sources.

Noise in our daily environment fluctuates over time. Some fluctuations are minor, but some are
substantial. Some noise levels occur in regular patterns, but others are random. Some noise levels
fluctuate rapidly, but others slowly. Some noise levels vary widely, but others are relatively
constant. Various noise descriptors have been developed to describe time-varying noise levels. The
following noise descriptor is commonly used in traffic noise analysis.
Equivalent Sound Level (Leq): Leq represents an average of the sound energy occurring over a
specified period. In effect, Leq is the steady-state sound level that in a stated period would contain
the same acoustical energy as the time-varying sound that actually occurs during the same period.
The 1-hour A-weighted equivalent sound level (Leq[h]), is the energy average of the A-weighted
sound levels occurring during a 1-hour period and is the basis for noise abatement criteria (NAC)
used by Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): CNEL is an average sound level during a 24-hour
day. CNEL is a noise measurement scale, which accounts for noise source, distance, single event
duration, single event occurrence, frequency, and time of day. Human reaction to sound between
7:00 PM and 10:00 PM is as if the sound were actually 5 dBA higher than if it occurred from 7:00
AM to 7:00 PM. From 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM, humans perceive sound as if it were 10 dBA higher
due to the lower background level. Hence, the CNEL is obtained by adding an additional 5 dBA to
sound levels in the evening from 7:00 PM. to 10:00 PM, and 10 dBA to sound levels in the night
before 7:00 AM and after 10:00 PM. Because CNEL accounts for human sensitivity to sound, the
CNEL 24-hour figure is always a higher number than the actual 24-hour average.
Day-Night Level (Ldn): Ldn is also an average sound level during a 24-hour day. The difference
between CNEL and Ldn is that CNEL considers the 24-hour day divided into three periods, while
Ldn uses two periods. Ldn is obtained by adding an additional 10 dBA to sound levels in the
evening from 10:00 PM. to 7:00 AM. The two measurements are very close, and are generally
accepted as equivalent in community noise studies. Ldn is the measures used by the US

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a community noise descriptor, while CNEL is
commonly used in California.
The nature of decibel scales is such that individual decibel ratings for different noise sources cannot
be added directly to give the sound level for the combined noise source. Instead, the combined noise
level produced by multiple noise sources is calculated using logarithmic summation. For example, if
one bulldozer produces a noise level of 80 dBA, two bulldozers would generate a combined noise
level of 83 dBA. For another example, assume that a house is located at the intersection of two
streets. If the traffic on the heavily traveled street (by itself) generated 60 dBA and traffic on the
lightly traveled street (by itself) generated 50 dBA, the combined noise level caused by traffic on
both streets would be 60.4 dBA.
People generally perceive a 10-dBA increase in a noise source as a doubling of loudness. For
example, an average person would perceive a 70 dBA sound level as being twice as loud as a 60
dBA sound. People generally cannot detect differences of 1 to 2 dBA between noise levels of a
similar nature (e.g., an increase in traffic noise compared to existing traffic noise). However, under
ideal listening conditions, some people can detect differences of 2 or 3 dBA. Under normal listening
conditions, most people would likely perceive a 5 dBA change in sounds of a similar nature. Note
that when the new sound is of a different nature than the background sound (e.g., backup alarms
compared to quiet residential sounds), most people can detect changes as low as 1 dBA.
When distance is the only factor considered, sound levels from isolated point sources of noise
typically decrease by about 6 dBA for every doubling of distance from the noise source. When the
noise source is a continuous line (e.g., vehicle traffic on a highway), sound levels decrease by about
3 dBA for every doubling of distance. In traffic studies, an attenuation rate of 4.5 dBA per doubling
of distance is often used when the roadway is at ground level and the intervening ground is effective
in absorbing sound (e.g., ground vegetation, scattered trees, clumps of bushes). When the roadway
is elevated, 3 dBA of noise attenuation per doubling of distance is used because the sound-absorbing
effects of the intervening ground are limited.
Noise levels can also be affected by several factors other than the distance from the noise source.
Topographic features and structural barriers that absorb, reflect, or scatter sound waves can affect the
reduction of noise levels. Atmospheric conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, humidity levels,
and temperatures) can also affect the degree to which sound is attenuated over distance.
Echoes off of topographical features or buildings can sometimes result in higher sound levels (lower
sound attenuation rates) than normally expected. Temperature inversions and attitudinal changes in
wind conditions can also refract and focus sound waves toward a location at considerable distance
from the noise source. These effects are usually noticeable only for very intense noise sources, such
as blasting operations. As a result, the existing noise environment can be highly variable depending
on local conditions.

Noise/Land Use Compatibility Criteria
Table PSNE-2 provides guidance for the acceptability of certain development projects within
specific CNEL contours and will act as a set of criteria for assessing the compatibility of proposed
land uses within the noise environment. Table PSNE-2 depicts “normally acceptable”,
“conditionally acceptable”, “normally unacceptable”, and “clearly unacceptable” exterior noise
levels for various land use categories. The primary purpose of the noise compatibility matrix is to
identify potential conflicts between proposed land uses and the noise environment. The matrix is
usually used at the General Plan or zoning level of approvals.

                Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of
                normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
                Conditionally Acceptable
                New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise
                reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features are included in the design.
                Conventional construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air

                Normally Unacceptable
                New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or
                development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made
                and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
                Clearly Unacceptable
                New construction or development generally should not be undertaken.

California Building Noise Standards
Table PSNE-3 provides the interior and exterior noise standards for various developments. The
noise standards will act as City policy for new land uses and acceptable noise levels for development
of new land uses. The provisions of the State of California Noise Insulation Standards (California
Administrative Code, Title 24) will be enforced to specify that the indoor noise levels for
multifamily residential living spaces shall not exceed 45 dB CNEL (or Ldn) due to the combined
effect of all noise sources. The State requires implementation of this indoor standard when the
outdoor noise levels exceed 60 dB CNEL (or Ldn). The Title 24 requires that this standard be
applied to all new hotels, motels, apartment houses and dwellings, other than detached single family
dwellings. The City will also, as a matter of policy, apply this standard to new single family
developments and condominium conversion projects where feasible.

An acoustical analysis prepared by a qualified acoustical engineer, should be required in these noise
impacted areas for all noise sensitive land uses verifying that the structure has been designed, or
mitigation measures proposed, to limit intruding noise to the prescribed allowable levels.

Railroad Noise Criteria
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides guidance and criteria for evaluating noise
impacts associated with rail projects (FTA 2006). The FTA guidelines were used to assess three
types of noise impacts: 1) new residential development near existing rail lines 2) noise impacts
caused either by new rail lines constructed near existing dwellings; or 3) increases in rail traffic
along existing rail lines near existing residential areas. The FTA noise impact criteria for railroad
noise are shown graphically in Figure PSNE-6. The noise evaluation is based on comparison of the
existing outdoor noise levels and future outdoor noise levels caused by train traffic.

The FTA noise impact criteria define the allowable project noise levels, which would cause impacts
for three types of noise sensitive receivers. As shown on Figure PSNE-6 the FTA noise criteria
describe two ranges of noise impact: “severe impact”; and “moderate impact”. The FTA criteria
are applicable to several categories of land use. Category 1 includes land use where quiet is an
essential element in their intended purpose, such as outdoor concert pavilions or national historic
landmarks where outdoor interpretation routinely take place. Category 2 includes residences and
buildings where people sleep. Category 3 includes institutional land uses such as schools and
libraries. The FTA criteria do not apply to commercial or industrial land uses.

Existing and Future Noise Conditions
Airport Noise
The existing and future noise levels for the Brawley Municipal Airport were analyzed in the
Brawley Municipal Airport Master Plan (City of Brawley 2003). Figure PSNE-7 shows the noise
contours for existing conditions and Figure PSNE-8 shows the noise contours for future conditions.
Criteria for interpreting the compatibility of land uses within the contours are set forth in Table
PSNE-2.
The City’s noise analysis revealed the 65dB CNEL contour for the current conditions is located
entirely on airport property and thus does not create any land use incompatibilities based on the
noise criteria shown in Table PSNE-2. In the future conditions, the 65dB CNEL expands outward

slightly, but remains near its present location to the west and is approximately 1,500 feet further to
the east.
Traffic Noise
All noise-sensitive areas within the City are adjacent to roadways. Depending on the distance from
any given roadway, anticipated future new developments could cause increases in traffic volumes
large enough to cause traffic noise to exceed the noise criteria described previously.
Traffic noise levels near representative City streets and expressways were estimated using the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model Version 2.5 Lookup Table
spreadsheets. Existing traffic volumes and forecast future traffic volumes were obtained from the
City’s traffic forecasts (LLG 2007). The existing and 2025 traffic noise levels from expressways
and major arterials are summarized in Table PSNE-4. The noise analysis used the existing average
daily traffic volumes (ADT) and 2025 ADT estimated for the Circulation Element of the General
Plan.

Railroad Noise at Areas Other Than Crossings
The Southern Pacific Railroad runs north-south through the City. An average of 8 freight trains per
day runs the rail line. The train speed is approximately 25 miles per hour within the City. The
passing time for a train is about 3 minutes. The existing rail line passes through commercial and
industrial areas of the City, with few existing houses within 150 feet of the tracks. Locomotives and
freight cars can generate considerable noise, and could be disruptive at night at dwellings within
roughly 150 feet of the tracks.
Railroad noise was analyzed for two scenarios: 1) trains moving at steady speed along rail lines,
without sounding their horns; and 2) train horns at at-grade crossing. Steady-speed train noise
without horns is described in this section, while train horn noise is described in the next section.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Create project train noise spreadsheet was used to
estimate noise levels at various distances perpendicular to the tracks. Two land use scenarios were
evaluated: the “unshielded case” where the noise-sensitive receiver has a direct line of sight to the
rail line with no intervening buildings; and the “shielded case” where there is at least one row of
buildings between the tracks and the receiver location. In both cases the noise contour distances
corresponding to CNEL noise levels of 60 dBA, 65 dBA, and 70 dBA were modeled.
Table PSNE-5 shows the noise levels for trains moving along the rail line, without sounding their
horn. The FTA train noise model displays noise levels as Ldn rather than the CNEL metric used by
the City’s land use criteria. In most cases the modeled Ldn noise levels for train noise are expected
to be nearly the same as the CNEL. The 65 CNEL contour (which defines the lower range of the
“conditionally acceptable” land use criterion for residential areas” is 130 feet from the tracks for the
unshielded case.

Train Horns at Rail Crossings
The existing rail line crosses approximately eight at-grade public roads within the City. Federal
laws require trains to sound their horns while passing at-grade road crossings. Train horns are
designed to be loud and noticeable to serve their purpose as safety devices. As a result, train horn
noise can be disruptive at noise-sensitive receivers near the at-grade crossings, especially at night.
Noise impacts caused by train horns at at-grade road crossings were estimated using the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) Horn Noise Spreadsheet (Federal Railroad Administration, 2007).
The assessment was done based on 8 trains per day, with each train moving at 25 miles per hour and

the train sounding its horn for the minimum required time at the crossing. The baseline land use
conditions at the rail crossings were set to “light suburban” to account for background noise levels.
The FRA horn noise spreadsheet indicates the geographical extent of the “severe impact zone” and
the “moderate impact zone” described previously. Figure PSNE-9 shows a schematic diagram of the
train horn impact zones at a representative at-grade crossing. The blue-shaded area on the diagram
is the “severe impact” zone, while the red-shaded area is the “moderate impact zone”. Based on the
FTA impact criteria, the length of the moderate impact zone extends for roughly 375 feet along the
rail line in both directions away from the crossing, and the width of the moderate impact zone
extends for 690 feet perpendicular to each side of the rail line.

Areas of Special Concern
Areas of special concern within Noise Impact Areas are near the Brawley Municipal Airport. CNEL
range from 60 to 70 dB around the airport. The orientation of the CNEL contours correspond to the
east-west trending runway and the right-hand flight pattern.
The planned land uses established in the Land Use Element reflect the airport noise contours. Land
uses within the Noise Impact Areas are restricted to industrial and commercial development. One
exception is a pocket of planned rural residential development to the west of North Imperial Avenue.
 This pocket will be exposed to CNEL of 65 dB in future years. Mitigation measures may be
required to reduce interior noise to acceptable levels.

Intermittent noise is produced by trains using the Union Pacific Railroad. The intermittent noise can
be substantial and temporarily disruptive. Rail activity is modest (currently estimated at 8 train
passages per day) and the trains move slowly through the city (25 miles per hour). There are no
existing homes within 130 feet of the tracks. Therefore, train noise does not result in CNEL
exceeding 65 dBA at any existing homes.
Transportation Noise Control
The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from transportation systems is to reduce
noise at the source. However, because the City has little direct control over source noise levels
because of state and federal preemption, (i.e., State motor vehicle noise standards and Federal air
regulations), programs should be focused on reducing the impact of the noise on the community.
Cooperative efforts with state and federal offices are essential.
Noise Barriers: The most effective method for mitigating transportation noise is through reducing
the impact of the noise to the community by utilizing the site design review process and noise
mitigation measures required by the California Environmental Quality Act. To reduce noise impacts
for new projects to less than significant, mitigation through site planning, landscaping, as well as
topography, and the design and construction of a noise barrier (wall, berms, or combination
wall/berms) are the most common ways of alleviating traffic noise impacts in existing urban
environments. Setbacks can also be used to provide partial mitigation or full mitigation where a
small noise reduction is needed.
Noise attenuating barriers are commonly incorporated into projects and can be extremely effective in
reducing noise levels. The effectiveness of the barrier depends on the relative height and materials
of the barrier, the noise source, the affected area, the horizontal distance between the source and the
barrier, and between the barrier and the affected area. The City shall require the design and
implementation of appropriate noise mitigation measures for all new projects. Although noise
barriers can be extremely effective, their aesthetic effect on a neighborhood should be considered.
Noise mitigation measures must be considered in the design of Caltrans funded roadway
improvement projects. The Noise abatements should be designed to meet Caltrans feasible and
reasonable criteria in accordance with Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol (Caltrans 2006) and
Technical Noise Supplement (TeNS) guidelines (Caltrans 1998).
The City shall require the use of walls and berms in the design of new residential and other noise
sensitive land uses that are next to major roads, rail lines, commercial, or industrial to help mitigate
noise impacts. The City will also encourage the reduction of train noise by requesting that the Union
Pacific Railroad reduce speed and use welded track in good repair throughout the Planning Area.
Noise Control at the Source: The California Vehicle Code contains noise limits applicable to new
vehicles at the time of manufacture and noise regulations pertaining to the operation of all vehicles
on public roads.
The City will provide for continued evaluation and enforcement of truck and bus movements and
routes to minimize noise at the source for sensitive land uses. Regulation of traffic flow can also
significantly minimize noise impacts. The State Motor Vehicle noise standards for cars, trucks, and

The City and its citizens will also participate in planning processes for the Brawley Municipal
Airport. The City will work with the Airport Land Use Commission to ensure that changes in
airport operation do not result in excessive noise to existing and planned land uses.

NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE
Introduction
Significant noise can also be generated by other sources that are unrelated to transportation
activities, (such as industrial, agricultural, and construction operations). Non-transportation noise
can be controlled by the operator of the noise source to avoid excessive exposure at nearby noise-
sensitive receiver locations.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
PSNE Goal 8:              Protect People Living and Working in the City from Excessive
                          Non-Transportation Noise
PSNE Objective 8.1:           Develop measures to control non-transportation noise impacts.
           PSNE Policy 8.1.1:     Enforce Brawley's noise ordinance, City policies, and regulations affecting
                                  noise.
           PSNE Policy 8.1.2:     Minimize the impacts of non-transportation construction noise on adjacent
                                  land uses through limiting the permitted hours of activity.
           PSNE Policy 8.1.3:     Require City departments to observe state and federal occupational safety
                                  and health noise standards.
           PSNE Policy 8.1.4:     Require new equipment and vehicles purchased by the City to comply with
                                  noise performance standards consistent with available noise reduction
                                  technology.
Plan
People and noise sensitive areas must be protected from excessive noise generated by non-
transportation sources including commercial and industrial centers. These impacts are most
effectively controlled through the environmental and site plan review process by imposition of
mitigation measures and the application of a City Noise Ordinance.
Noise Ordinance
The existing Noise Ordinance is included in the Chapter 18 of City Code, which is outlined below:
    Sec. 18.1. Loud or unusual noises prohibited and declared nuisance.
City of Brawley                                                                                  September 2008
General Plan Update                                 PSNE-51
                                                                                                      J&S 00136.07

    Sec. 18.2. Causing noise nuisance after notice unlawful.
    Sec. 18.3. Persons liable for expense of abating nuisance; cost to be lien.
    Sec. 18.4. Civil action to abate nuisance.
    Sec. 18.5. Permit for use of loudspeakers or sound amplifiers.
The city noise ordinance is qualitative only, and does not specify numerical noise limits.
Furthermore, the city ordinance does not cover some of the categories of noise sources known to
cause noise impacts. For example, noise from vehicles on public roads, airport, and railroad is not
regulated by the noise ordinance. The noise ordinance does not set numerical restrictions on
construction noise.
The City's Noise Ordinance will be updated to reflect the policies and plans of this element. The
ordinance revisions will address the following subjects: construction activity, truck traffic, loading
and unloading operations, landscape activity, interior noise standards and exterior noise standards.
The updated Noise Ordinance will also require all City departments to comply with state and federal
OSHA noise standards, and old purchased equipment and vehicles must comply with city, state, and
federal noise standards.
The Noise Ordinance will be enforced to ensure that adjacent properties are not exposed to excessive
noise levels from stationary sources. The Economic and Community Development Department will
act as noise control coordinator. This will ensure the continued operation of the noise enforcement
efforts of the City. Following the initial update of the Noise Ordinance, the City will periodically
review its Noise Ordinance and other noise policies and regulations to conform with changes in
legislation and/or technologies, and to address new community noise issues.
Typical Mitigation for Industrial and Commercial Uses
Consideration should be given to the control of noise in new commercial and industrial
developments when noise levels would otherwise be generated that would exceed the noise level for
the district in which they are located and that would adversely affect nearby projects. The following
mitigation measures could be applied when reviewing these new projects:
    Furnaces - Acoustically treat natural draft and/or forced draft units and combustion air
     intake. Insulation of firing walls and damped and lined ducting are but a few of the
     treatments that could be considered.
    Fans - Air cooled heat exchangers can be provided with silencers where effective (i.e.,
     primarily on small, high-speed air fans). For larger coolers, quieter equipment can be
     installed.
    Motors - Quiet-design motors can be employed and located to minimize impacts on nearby
     properties.
    Centrifugal Compressors - Centrifugal compressors can be equipped with inlet and
     discharge silencers. Acoustical enclosures may also be considered.
    Centrifugal Pumps - Centrifugal pumps may be equipped with suction and discharge piping
     that has been acoustically treated. Acoustical enclosures may be considered.

    Steam and Gas Generators - Acoustical enclosures for turbines may be effective in reducing
     noise. Inlet and discharge piping may be acoustically treated and expansion joints added or
     comparable attenuative modifications made to minimize structure-borne vibrations.
    Control Valves - Quiet valves should be used whenever available. In other circumstances,
     in-line silencers can be employed.
    Atmospheric Vents, Exhaust and Intakes - Noisy vents should be equipped with silencers.
     Where safety is not an overriding concern, vents should be positioned close to the ground or
     below grade.

NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING
INTEGRATION
Introduction
The juxtaposition of incompatible land uses can result in noise impacts to sensitive receptors, (e.g.,
residential uses, schools, hospitals). Noise impacts can be avoided by considering the effects of
noise early in the land use planning process.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
PSNE Goal 9:              Incorporate Noise Considerations into Land Use Planning
                          Decisions
PSNE Objective 9.1:           Consider existing and future noise levels when making land use
                              planning decisions to minimize people’s exposure to excessive noise.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.1:    Adopt planning guidelines, which establish acceptable noise standards for
                                 various land uses throughout Brawley.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.2:    Apply the state's Title 24 noise insulation standards to the construction of
                                 multi-family housing and conversion of existing apartments into
                                 condominiums.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.3:    Utilize noise/land use compatibility standards as a guide for future planning
                                 and development.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.4:    Review proposed projects in terms of compatibility with nearby noise-
                                 sensitive land uses with the intent of reducing noise impacts.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.5:    Require new residential developments located in proximity to existing
                                 commercial/industrial operations that exceed 65db CNEL to control
                                 residential interior noise levels with 25 dB noise reduction as a condition of
                                 approval.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.6:    Require commercial uses from a mixed-use project (including residential) to
                                 comply with the Noise Ordinance. Design mixed-use structures to prevent
                                 transfer of noise from the commercial to the residential use.
           PSNE Policy 9.1.7:    Require new commercial/industrial operations located in proximity to
                                 existing or proposed residential areas to incorporate noise mitigation into
                                 project design, to comply with Noise Ordinance.

           PSNE Policy 9.1.8:    Require new residential development and office buildings located within the
                                 65 dB contour of the Municipal Airport to reduce interior noise levels by 25
                                 dB as a condition of approval.
Plan
Table PSNE-2 provides guidance for the acceptability of certain development projects within
specific CNEL contours and will act as a set of criteria for assessing the compatibility of proposed
land uses within the noise environment. Table PSNE-2 depicts “normally acceptable”,
“conditionally acceptable”, “normally unacceptable”, and “clearly unacceptable” exterior noise
levels for various land use categories. The primary purpose of the noise compatibility matrix is to
identify potential conflicts between proposed land uses and the noise environment. The matrix is
usually used at the General Plan or zoning level of approvals.
Table PSNE-1 also provides the basis for development of the specific noise standards presented in
Table PSNE-3. The noise standards will act as City policy for new land uses and acceptable noise
levels for development of new land uses. The provisions of the State of California Noise Insulation
Standards (California Administrative Code, Title 24) will be enforced to specify that the indoor
noise levels for multifamily residential living spaces shall not exceed 45 dB CNEL (or Ldn) due to
the combined effect of all noise sources. The State requires implementation of this indoor standard
when the outdoor noise levels exceed 60 dB CNEL (or Ldn). The noise contour maps can be used to
determine when this standard needs to be addressed. The code requires that this standard be applied
to all new hotels, motels, apartment houses and dwellings, other than detached single family
dwellings. The City will also, as a matter of policy, apply this standard to new single family
developments and condominium conversion projects where feasible.
For the City to achieve noise and land use compatibility, it is imperative that mitigation measures be
imposed during site planning to mitigate anticipated noise impacts on affected noise sensitive land
uses. The submittal of an acoustical analysis report analyzing anticipated noise impact levels is one
mechanism to evaluate proposed projects. The incorporation of mitigation measures as described in
this element and other action may enable a project to comply with exterior and interior noise
compatibility guidelines and standards.

INTRODUCTION TO THE
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Economic development is a key to achieving
                                                          ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
long-term community goals in Brawley.                                      GOALS
Although this Element is optional under State           EDE Goal 1: Maintain and Promote Fiscal
law, City initiatives aimed at improving the                         Strength and Stability of the City’s
economic conditions in the area are directly tied                    Economy
to the success of other long-range goals in the         EDE Goal 2: Promote Local Businesses and
                                                                     Encourage New Commerce in the
areas of land use, housing, and infrastructure.
                                                                     City

The Economic Development Element is intended                         City’s Downtown
to be a dynamic component of the General Plan.          EDE Goal 4: Achieve a Balance between Housing
The Element is directed at a wide range of                           and Employment Opportunities
economic issues that need to be dealt with during
various stages of the community's evolution and, in some cases, on a repetitive basis. Therefore, the
economic goals, objectives, and policies are of a general nature so as to encompass the directed
scope of specific initiatives described in the Economic Development Plan, whenever and as often as
they must be undertaken.
In addition to this Introduction, the Economic Development Element is composed of the following
sections: Fiscal Strength and Stability; Business Promotion; Promotion of Downtown Business
District; and Balanced Employment and Housing. Each section contains an Introduction, Goals,
Objectives and Policies, and a Plan. Specific implementation programs for this Element are
contained in the Implementation Chapter of the General Plan.
Related Plans and Entities
Aside from the City’s Redevelopment Plan, there are two major entities that directly address
economic development within the City of Brawley, which are listed below and described in the

FISCAL STRENGTH AND STABILITY
Introduction
Maintaining and promoting fiscal strength and stability is an essential step in realizing a greater
quality of life within Brawley. Expanding and diversifying the City's economic base provides a
foundation for fiscal strength and stability in the future.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
EDE Goal 1:               Maintain and Promote Fiscal Strength and Stability of the
                          City’s Economy
    EDE Objective 1.1:       Provide for the expansion and diversification of the City's economic
                             base.
           EDE Policy 1.1.1:     Maintain and support the Brawley Economic Development Commission
                                 and Chamber of Commerce and facilitate an aggressive business marketing
                                 and promotion program.
           EDE Policy 1.1.2:     Identify the types of industrial, office and commercial uses that are desired
                                 by the community and assess the market demand for those types of uses.
           EDE Policy 1.1.3:     Ensure that the land use plan includes sites supporting new job-creating
                                 industrial and commercial development.
           EDE Policy 1.1.4:     Work with federal and state agencies to develop and implement programs
                                 designed to train the undereducated and unskilled to increase their
                                 opportunities for employment.
    EDE Objective 1.2:       Implement an infrastructure improvement program to enable the
                             City to offer fully served industrial and commercial sites tied to
                             multi-modal transportation.
           EDE Policy 1.2.1:     Ensure adequate infrastructure to support new job-creating industrial
                                 development.

Fiscal Strength and Stability Plan
A strategy for maintaining and promoting fiscal strength and stability for Brawley must be tied
directly to the expansion and diversification of its economic base. The strategy is based on the
active efforts of the Brawley Economic Development Commission (BEDC), an arm of the Chamber
of Commerce, and the Brawley Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) to market and promote
business opportunities in Brawley. A major objective of the BEDC is to promote sustained
economic growth through the targeting of certain industries that represent the greatest opportunities
for long-term growth and development.
This basic objective is reflected in the Land Use Element of the General Plan through the narrative
description of land use categories or designations that allow business and commercial activities, and
through the Land Use Policy Map which identifies the physical locations and sizes of lands planned
for such uses. For example, the Map identifies a substantial amount of vacant land in the northeast
portion of the planning area around the Municipal Airport for industrial use. This land is presently
served by the Airport, the Southern Pacific Railway, and, in the future, the realigned SR 111. The
Land Use Policy Map also identifies substantial land area for future commercial development along
and in close proximity to Main Street as reflected in the Downtown Overlay Districts and close to
important transportation corridors including SR 86 and the future realignment of SR 111.
Without basic infrastructure to service land available for industrial, commercial, and residential
development, growth and economic improvement would not be possible. The Infrastructure
Element identifies the various financing mechanisms that can be used to improve and expand the
public facilities needed to support new development.

Business Promotion Plan
A primary objective for economic development in Brawley is the promotion of businesses, which
create jobs and new physical development within the City. This primary objective, if successful,
will result in increased retail sales, increased demand for housing, and an improved property and
sales tax base that will increase fiscal stability. With this as a primary objective, the City will
concentrate its energies on the following efforts aimed at promoting economic growth and
development:
1. Pursue development of diversified light industrial, agricultural services, food/beverage processing,
     electronic and computer components assembly, pharmaceuticals/biotech, and ware-
     housing/distribution development in the northeast portion of the planning area around the airport,
     Southern Pacific Railway and the new SR 111 realignment;

PROMOTION OF DOWNTOWN BUSINESS
DISTRICT
Introduction
The downtown business district is the heart of Brawley and is easily distinguished by a predominant
Spanish architectural style and the physical arrangement of its streets and buildings. As depicted on
Figure LUE-2, Special Study Areas, a large portion of the City’s downtown is located within the
Downtown Overlay District (DOD). Revitalization of the DOD is an essential component of the
City's overall approach to achieve and benefit from economic growth.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
EDE Goal 3:               Promote the Revitalization of the City’s Downtown
    EDE Objective 3.1:       Maximize the potential of the area to provide a more exciting and
                             compatible mix of uses.
           EDE Policy 3.1.1:    New developments in the Downtown Overlay District (DOD) should be
                                consistent with the vision of the DOD’s respective sub-districts and the
                                1989 Downtown Revitalization Guidelines. Modify and implement design
                                guidelines for the downtown area as needed.
           EDE Policy 3.1.2:    Promote the development of residential, recreational, and retail
                                opportunities that encourage use and activity beyond the normal hours of
                                the work week.
           EDE Policy 3.1.3:    Encourage the development of a combined governmental (City, state and
                                federal) services complex in downtown Brawley.
           EDE Policy 3.1.3:    Establish a business improvement district in the downtown area and offer
                                incentives to downtown businesses.
Promotion of Downtown Business District Plan
The City of Brawley recognizes that its economic development plan and strategy must include a
component aimed at invigorating and revitalizing its downtown business district centered along
Main Street. The City created the Downtown Revitalization Guidelines in 1989 in order to help
provide a better framework to guide the character of growth and improvements within the City’s
redevelopment areas.
City of Brawley                                                                                 September 2008
General Plan Update                                EDE-9
                                                                                                     J&S 00136.07

Revitalizing the downtown area was a common theme in the public workshops involved during the
General Plan update. As a result, the Downtown Overlay District was created and includes three
sub-districts located within the downtown as shown on Figure LUE-2, each with a different vision as
discussed in the Land Use Element. With the exception of areas designated for industrial uses, the
DOD may allow residential densities and/or a mixture of commercial and residential uses that would
not otherwise be allowed by a single land use designation anywhere else in the City. New
developments in the DOD must ensure adequate buffers between any industrial and residential
properties and other sensitive receptors with regard to but not limited to the following potential
hazards: noise; hazardous and/or toxic air contaminants; and hazardous and/or toxic substances. The
City may adopt additional development guidelines or a specific plan for the DOD following the
adoption of the update to the General Plan in order to provide greater direction for future
developments.

BALANCED EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING
Introduction
Economic development creates jobs and demand for housing. To effectively attract new industry
and commerce to Brawley, the City must ensure that adequate housing is available for those who
wish to live and work in the community.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
EDE Goal 4:               Achieve a Balance between Housing and Employment
                          Opportunities
    EDE Objective 4.1:       Support the provision of adequate housing to meet the needs of all
                             economic segments of the City.
           EDE Policy 4.1.1:     Implement the goals and policies of the Housing Element of the General
                                 Plan.
           EDE Policy 4.1.2:     Develop and implement short- and long-range programs to stimulate jobs
                                 and economic growth.
Balanced Employment and Housing Plan
The overall Economic Development Plan for Brawley must include consideration of the demand for
housing that may result from the introduction of new jobs into the community. Although the
relatively high unemployment rate indicates that many of the workers taking newly created jobs may
already be living within housing in the community, stable employment for those who are currently
unemployed will probably result in increased demand for housing units. As new jobs are created,
some of the persons filling those jobs will be moving into Brawley from outside the planning area
and those individuals and their families will be seeking suitable housing within a reasonable distance
from their place of work. These resulting conditions suggest that suitable land must be available to
provide housing for the future population of Brawley.
Implementation of the City’s Land Use Element and Housing Element of the General Plan directly
support this important component of the Economic Development Plan. For example, the Land Use
Element describes three land use designations and an overlay zone for a portion of downtown that
provide for various densities of residential development to accommodate the City's population.
Variation in densities is designed to ensure that housing choices are available to a population
consisting of different income groups and lifestyles.
City of Brawley                                                                               September 2008

The Land Use Element also includes a Land Use Policy Map describing the physical location and
extent of land designated for residential use. The Map indicates where the residential land uses exist
or will exist in the future, and provides a clear indication of the physical relationship between
residential land uses and other uses, such as commercial, industrial, public facilities, and open space.
The Housing Element of the General Plan looks directly at housing needs based on projected growth
in the community over a five-year period. Based on projected population growth, land has been
identified to accommodate new residential construction at various densities to support future housing
demand. Other housing programs included in the Housing Element are designed to maintain and
preserve existing housing within the community, as well as meet the needs of certain segments of the
population (handicapped, farm workers, and others) with specialized requirement.

Related Goals and Policies
The goals and policies described in the Economic Development Element are related to and support
subjects included within other General Plan Elements. In turn, many policies from the other
Elements directly or indirectly support the goals and policies of the Economic Development
Element. These supporting policies are identified in Table EDE-1.

HOUSING ELEMENT
State law requires that the City of Brawley’s Housing Element contain an analysis of existing and
projected housing needs as well as policies and programs to meet those demands. State law also
mandates that the City evaluate its Housing Element every five years to determine its effectiveness
in achieving its housing goals and objectives and to adopt an updated Housing Element which
reflects the results of this evaluation. The City of Brawley’s draft Housing Element (March 2008) is
internally consistent with this draft General Plan Update. The draft Housing Element is currently
being updated and is on file with the City’s Community and Economic Development Department.

IMPLEMENTATION INTRODUCTION
The General Plan Implementation Program provides a guide to the community, City staff, and
City officials to implement adopted General Plan policy and plans. The purpose of the
Implementation Program is to ensure that the overall direction provided in the General Plan for
growth and development in the City of Brawley is translated from general terms to specific
actions. The Implementation Program is a series of actions, procedures, and techniques that
carry out the General Plan policy through implementing a standard or program. Each
implementation measure will need further City Council action, either on a city-wide basis, (e.g.
zoning ordinance amendment or adoption of and development review criteria), or in individual
subareas for actions, (e.g., capital improvement projects). The City Council, by relating the
Implementation Program to the General Plan, recognizes the importance of long-range planning
considerations in day-to-day decision making. Implementation of the actions, procedures, and
techniques established in this program will be subject to funding constraints.
The Implementation Program is organized into six subsections that correspond to the General
Plan Elements with the exception of the Housing Element. The implementation programs for the
Housing Element are contained in the element. Each of the Implementation Program subsections
is comprised of measures that directly relate to the policies and plans of the corresponding
General Plan element.
Use of the General Plan Implementation Program
The City will use this Implementation Program as the basis for preparing the annual report to the
City Council on the status of the City's progress in implementing the General Plan, as described
in Section 65400 of the Government Code. Because many of the individual actions and
programs described in the Implementation Program act as mitigation for significant
environmental impacts resulting from planned development identified in the General Plan, the
annual report can also provide a means of monitoring the application of the mitigation measures
as required by AB 3180. This Implementation Program should be updated annually and
whenever the City's General Plan is amended or updated to ensure its continued consistency and
usefulness.

LAND USE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
The Implementation Program provides strategies to implement the adopted policies and plans
identified in the Land Use Element. The Land Use Implementation Program provides a guide to
the community, City staff, and City officials to be used in making daily Land Use issue decisions
in Brawley. The Implementation Program is a series of actions, procedures, and techniques that
carry out the Land Use policy through implementing a standard or program, subject to funding
constraints. The Implementation Program ensures that future development will be compatible,
provide for a balance of land uses, and allow economic expansion in Brawley.
The Land Use Element identifies the land use Goals, Objectives, and Policies of the City. The
Land Use Element Implementation Program section identifies programs, which will be utilized
to carry out land use policy in Brawley.
The City's zoning ordinance, subdivision and grading ordinances, code enforcement, specific
plans, and capital improvement projects and programs, and the City’s Redevelopment Plan serve
as tools to enable the City to guide the development and revitalization of key areas of Brawley.
IMP-LUE Goal 1:            Balanced Development
IMP-LUE Program 1.1
Zoning Ordinance: The Zoning Ordinance is the primary method by which cities implement
land use policy regulating the location, type of use, and the physical form of development. Table
LUE-5 of the Land Use Element shows the relationship between the General Plan land use
designations and zoning districts. This table identifies how properties city-wide should be zoned
to be consistent with the Land Use Policy Map. The Zoning Ordinance consists of a map, which
delineates boundaries of zoning districts and text which explains the purpose of zoning districts,
lists permitted and conditional uses, provides standards for development and includes other
regulations. Title 27 of the municipal code contains the City's Zoning Ordinance. Following
adoption of the General Plan, a revised Zoning Ordinance will be prepared.
The City will review the Zoning Ordinance and prepare amendments to achieve consistency as
necessary with the policies and standards contained in the General Plan. Adoption of Zoning
Ordinance amendments and an associated Zoning Map will provide a primary implementation
tool for the Land Use Element.

INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
IMPLEMENTATION
The Infrastructure Element Implementation Program provides strategies to implement the
adopted policy identified in the Infrastructure Element. The Program provides a guide to the
community, City staff, and City officials to be used in making daily decisions related to the
provision of public infrastructure, subject to funding constraints. The Implementation Program
is a series of actions, procedures, and techniques that carry out the Infrastructure policy through
implementing standards or programs. The City Council, by incorporating the Implementation
Program into the General Plan, recognizes the importance of long-range planning considerations
in day-to-day decision-making.
The implementation measures are intended to ensure that adequate facilities exist for
transportation and circulation of people and goods; potable water treatment and distribution;
wastewater collection and treatment; solid waste; storm water run-off; drainage system; animal
control; and power (electricity and gas) service. While providing for the maintenance of existing
infrastructure, the implementation measures also identify strategies to furnish infrastructure for
the planned growth identified in the Land Use Element.
IMP-IE Goal 1:                Provide for Adequate Local Thoroughfares and
                              Transportation Routes
IMP-IE Program 1.1
Circulation Phasing Program: The General Plan Circulation Plan identifies future roadway
improvements that must be implemented to accommodate anticipated growth in Brawley. The
Circulation Plan incorporates the planned realignment and expansion of State Route 111 to
bypass the City. The roadway classifications of the Circulation Plan are based on the realigned
State Route 111 serving as a primary north-south connector. To coordinate circulation
improvements with anticipated growth and the realignment of State Route 111, the City will
prepare a Circulation Phasing Program. The Phasing Program will address the following issues:
          How circulation improvements will be identified during the development review process
           in coordination with the Circulation Plan standards and criteria;
          How major roadway improvements associated with the State Route 111 bypass will be
           coordinated with Caltrans, phased and financed; and
          How increasing traffic volumes in the City will be accommodated during the interim
           period before the bypass is constructed.

Improvements to Arterial Highway System: Implementing the General Plan Circulation Plan
will require adding to or improving the existing roadway system. To this end, this
implementation program involves monitoring improvement priorities, establishing funding
sources, and incorporating the needed improvements into the City's Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) on a regular annual basis. The following specific actions shall be implemented:
          Evaluate and if necessary revise the current CIP mechanism to ensure the mechanism
           includes a formal method to identify the roadway improvements that need to be
           constructed within five to seven years, as identified in the Circulation Phasing Program
           (to be prepared);
          Make an annual determination of potential sources of highway funding, such as
           Proposition 111 (Congestion Management) and other state and federal sources. Ensure
           that the use of funding from other agencies for projects initiated by the City will not limit
           the use of the street in the future;
          Establish guidelines for traffic impact fees so that an equitable means can be established
           for requiring new development to pay a fair share of the needed transportation
           improvements;
          Develop capital improvements program that includes reconstruction of existing curbs,
           gutters, and sidewalks along City streets, as needed; and
          Coordinate plans for Brawley circulation improvements with regional activities so that
           the City will obtain maximum benefit from other improvement activities in surrounding
           jurisdictions. Examples include coordination with Caltrans on the State Route 111
           realignment project and coordination with the County of Imperial on improvements to
           County roads.

Alternative Financing for Infrastructure Improvements: As development continues in Brawley,
the capacity of the circulation and utility infrastructure must be expanded to accommodate more
use. The following actions will be implemented to partially relieve the City's cost burden of
financing infrastructure improvements:
          Establish performance standards for circulation, water, sewer, and power infrastructure.
           The performance standards should address a specified level of performance rather than a
           prescribed type of improvement. All proposed development projects should be assessed
           for potential impacts to City infrastructure using the performance standards.
          Revise the existing development impact fee program to include impact fees for water and
           sewer infrastructures. The impact fees should directly relate to the performance
           standards and reflect the costs incurred by the City.
          For large infrastructure improvement projects that will benefit several property owners,
           prepare a phasing plan for cumulative infrastructure improvements. Identify the demand
           threshold at which point improvements will be required, the fair share costs to be paid by
           benefiting property owners, and the payment schedule.
          Consider the use of assessment districts, industrial development bonds, and other

PUBLIC SAFETY/NOISE ELEMENT
IMPLEMENTATION
The Public Safety/Noise Implementation Program provides a guide to the community, City staff,
and City officials to be used in making daily decisions related to the protecting public safety and
preventing excessive noise, subject to funding constraints. The Implementation Program is a
series of actions, procedures, and techniques that carry out the Public Safety and Noise policy
through implementing standards or programs. The City Council, by incorporating the
Implementation Program into the General Plan, recognizes the importance of long-range
planning considerations in day-to-day decision-making.
The Implementation Program provides strategies to implement the adopted policy identified in
the preceding section. The implementation measures are intended to minimize the threat of
existing natural and man-made hazards to existing and future residents and prevent the exposure
of residential and other sensitive uses to excessive noise.
