IV    CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT
Housing Framework
The Housing Framework introduces the 2014–2021 Pasadena Housing
Element, the process of development, a synopsis of major housing issues, and
the City’s goals, policies, and programs to address its housing needs.
Appendices attached to the Framework provide supporting information.
1.        INTRODUCTION
Incorporated in 1886, the City of Pasadena is a thriving community of 138,000
persons located at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains. The City is
renowned for its vibrant economy, educational institutions, cultural and
historic amenities, strong neighborhoods, diverse housing, and quality of life.
Pasadena has been referred to as a city on the world stage, but with close-knit
neighborhoods and smaller-scale community experiences unlike anywhere
else. These amenities continue to distinguish Pasadena as one of the most
livable and sought-after communities in the State of California.
For many decades, federal and state legislation has been based on the goal of
"a decent home and suitable living environment for every American." Housing
and quality neighborhoods also play an important role in Pasadena. Yet more
than just providing shelter, housing contributes to family well-being by
providing a stable and safe environment for children to grow up, for parents
to raise families, and for seniors to retire in safety and security. The
environment or neighborhood in which housing is placed also provides the
context where interactions so important to a community can take place.
The City of Pasadena has long been at the forefront of housing policies and
programs, not only in the San Gabriel Valley but also in southern California as
a whole. In 2000, Pasadena was one of the first communities to develop a
housing vision that expresses its commitment to housing its residents.
     All Pasadena residents have an equal right to live in decent, safe and
     affordable housing in a suitable living environment for the long-term
     well-being and stability of themselves, their families, their
     neighborhoods, and their community. The housing vision for
     Pasadena is to maintain a socially and economically diverse
     community of homeowners and renters who are afforded this right.
The 2014–2021 Pasadena Housing Element is all about achieving this vision.
This vision encompasses more than simple statutory requirements. Rather it
embraces a larger commitment to achieving the best, while balancing other
important priorities in the community, including the economy, public health,
open space and other amenities, education, transportation, and other
complementary values held by residents, business, and the community.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT 1

Housing Framework
                                A.       STATUTORY AUTHORITY
                                California law requires that cities develop housing programs to address
                                existing and future housing needs in their respective communities. To comply
                                with state law and provide housing opportunities for residents, the City of
                                Pasadena prepares a housing element. The housing element is a state-
                                mandated chapter of the Pasadena General Plan and is intended to address
                                the production, maintenance, and improvement of housing. The current
                                housing element covers an eight-year planning period from 2014 to 2021.
                                The detailed statutory requirements for preparing a housing element are
                                contained in the California Government Code (sections 65580–65589.8). In
                                accordance with state law, the housing element must include: an
                                identification and analysis of its existing and projected housing needs; an
                                analysis of the various governmental and nongovernmental constraints to
                                meeting that need; and a series of goals, policies, and scheduled programs to
                                further the development, improvement, and preservation of housing.
                                This housing element has two sections: Housing Framework and Appendices.
                                The Housing Framework sets forth key housing issues in Pasadena, followed
                                by the goals, policies, programs, and resources to address them. The
                                appendices support the Housing Framework and address specific statutory
                                requirements. These appendices are as follows:
                                 Appendix A: Housing Needs. This includes an analysis of demographic,
                                  economic, social, and housing characteristics of Pasadena residents and an
                                  assessment of current and future housing needs in the community arising
                                  due to population and employment growth and change.
                                 Appendix B: Constraints Analysis. This includes an analysis of potential
                                  governmental constraints that affect the development, maintenance, and
                                  improvement of housing for all income groups and people with disabilities,
                                  commensurate with the City’s identified housing needs.
                                 Appendix C: Housing Resources. This includes an inventory of resources
                                  available to address the City’s housing needs, including available land to
                                  accommodate new housing, financial resources to support program efforts,
                                  and administrative capacity to manage housing programs.
                                 Appendix D: Program Evaluation. This includes an evaluation of current
                                  housing programs and accomplishments in addressing the housing needs
                                  identified in the 2006–2014 Housing Element. This appendix also includes a
                                  summary of comments received during this update.
                                 Appendix E: Community Initiatives. This includes the results input from
                                  many community forums held on housing issues over the decade.
                                  Although the City lacks resources to implement all these initiatives, this
                                  appendix is a resource to draw upon for creative housing solutions.
2     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT

                                                                                           Housing Framework
B.        RELATED PLANS
Pasadena’s 2014–2021 Housing Element is related to local planning efforts
and others mandated by the State of California and the federal government.
The following list describes these documents and how the City will maintain
consistency with each of them in accordance with state law.
 General Plan Housing Vision. Pasadena’s General Plan affirms eight
  guiding principles: growth and development; historic preservation;
  economic vitality; social, economic, and environmental sustainability;
  circulation and mobility; regional prominence and leadership; community
  participation; and educational commitment. The City’s Housing Vision to
  maintain a socially and economically diverse community of homeowners
  and renters is consistent with the General Plan guiding principles.
 General Plan Consistency. The Housing Element is consistent with the
  current and proposed general plan. The City will maintain consistency
  between general plan elements by ensuring that changes in the housing
  element or other elements are consistent with one another when general
  plan amendments are needed. When the Land Use, Safety and
  Conservation elements are updated pursuant to SB162, the housing
  element will be reviewed to maintain continued internal consistency.
 City of Pasadena Housing Plans. Pasadena prepares a consolidated plan
  to receive housing and community development funds from the federal
  government. Pasadena’s Consolidated Plan was last revised for the 2010–
  2015 planning period. The City also prepared its 2010–2015 Analysis of
  Impediments to Fair Housing Choice and Ten Year Plan to End
  Homelessness. The housing, community development, and economic
  needs identified during those efforts and the program commitments made
  are consistent with those in the 2014–2021 Housing Element.
 Water and Sewer Services. The Pasadena Department of Water and Power
  provides water service to the Pasadena community. Sewer services are
  provided by the Sanitation District of Los Angeles County and the Pasadena
  Public Works Department. The City transmitted its 2014–2021 Housing
  Element to these agencies so population projections could be incorporated
  into their plans. This allows purveyors to plan for infrastructure and set
  priorities to serve affordable housing—as required under Government
  Code section 65589.7—should a shortfall in water or sewer service occur.
 Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities. As required by SB244,
  cities are required to amend their land use element to address provision of
  services to disadvantaged communities within their sphere of influence.
  According to the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission,
  Pasadena does not have disadvantaged communities under the definition
  specified in SB244 within its sphere of influence. Therefore, the City is not
  required to amend the General Plan to address this legislation.
                                                                    CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT     3

Housing Framework
                                C.        PUBLIC OUTREACH
                                California law requires that local governments engage the public in the
                                development of the housing element. Specifically, Government Code section
                                65583(c)(7) states “that the local government shall make a diligent effort to
                                achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in
                                the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe this
                                effort.” State law does not specify the means and methods for participation;
                                however, it is generally recognized that the participation must be inclusive.
                                In accordance with a guiding principle of the General Plan, the City of
                                Pasadena continues to engage the community in defining City housing needs
                                and discussing creative ways to address them. During the preparation for this
                                housing element, the following outreach events were held:
                                 Land Use Workshops. During the preparation of the land use and mobility
                                  element, the City of Pasadena held at least six workshops that dealt with
                                  housing and the land use plan. Held during 2011 and 2012, these
                                  workshops focused on where the City should direct residential growth and
                                  the types of housing products desired. These strategies underpin the City’s
                                  growth strategy articulated in the housing element.
                                 Stakeholder Interviews: The City interviewed stakeholders in Pasadena
                                  about their perception of housing needs, constraints to meeting housing
                                  needs, and potential programs. Stakeholders represented a wide diversity
                                  of groups that included homeless and mental health service providers,
                                  community organizations, affordable housing organizations, developers,
                                  faith-based organizations, residents, real estate industry, and many others.
                                 Community Workshops. A community-wide workshop was held on June
                                  8, 2013, to solicit input from the public about the housing needs and issues
                                  facing the community. This workshop was extensively advertised by the
                                  Neighborhood Connections office, which notifies 90 organizations in the
                                  City with more than 1,200 members. The public was invited to attend.
                                  Comments made at the workshop are available on the City’s website.
                                 Commission Hearings. Pasadena has an active commission structure that
                                  is designed to obtain input from a broad segment of the community. The
                                  City solicited input on the housing element from four commissions: 1) the
                                  Human Services Commission on July 10, 2013; 2) the Senior Commission on
                                  July 31, 2013; 3) the Northwest Commission on August 8, 2013; and 4) the
                                  Planning Commission on September 11 and October 9, 2013.
                                Comments and recommendations received during these many public forums
                                are summarized in Appendix D of the Pasadena Housing Element.

2.        FRAMING THE CHALLENGE
Pasadena’s 2014–2021 Housing Element is prepared during a period unlike
previous decades. Changes to the housing market, demographics, and overall
economy are fundamentally different than was the case during the prior two
decades. Pasadena faces unique challenges, potential constraints, and
opportunities for furthering its housing vision.
HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGE
A volatile housing market marked the 2000s in Pasadena, California, and the
nation. From housing boom to recession and now to recovery, underlying
housing issues remain. Pasadena’s ability to further its housing vision is
largely dependent on its success in addressing the following:
  High Housing Costs. During the 2000s, Pasadena’s housing prices soared.
   Despite the foreclosure crisis, prices for single-family homes doubled: the
   median price home is about $600,000; the median priced condominium is
   $400,000. According to RealFACTS, a newer two-bedroom apartment is
   priced at an average of $2,500 per month. Though older, smaller apartment
   complexes may be charging $1,400 for similar units, the prices are still high.
   The income required to afford housing is still above moderate incomes.
  Housing Overpayment. As housing prices have increased faster than
   household income, the affordability crisis continues to worsen. From 2000
   to 2010, the percentage of renter household overpaying for housing
   increased from 43% to 51%. During the same period, the percentage of all
   homeowners overpaying for housing increased from 33% to 43%, but more
   than 50% of those with a mortgage overpay for housing. This degree of
   overpayment means that many may have to forego other life expenditures.
  Housing Quality. Overall, Pasadena’s housing stock is in good condition.
   However, certain neighborhoods still have higher numbers of older homes
   that need maintenance and repairs. Because Pasadena’s housing stock is
   older than many communities, it must address issues such as lead-based
   paint, asbestos, and other conditions associated with older structures.
   Homes also need to be closely monitored and repaired to keep structures in
   good condition and extend the useful life of the building.
  Potential Loss of Affordable Housing. Pasadena’s desirable quality of life
   has led to rapidly increasing housing prices and rents. This reality makes it
   particularly attractive for property owners to sell residential buildings to
   obtain a higher return on their investment. For publicly subsidized
   apartment projects that have covenants requiring affordable housing, as
   these covenants expire, these projects could be converted to market rate
   housing, displacing lower income renters.
Given the increasing desirability of Pasadena as a place to live and work, the
City will continue to face the challenge of meeting its housing needs.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT     5

Housing Framework
                                DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE
                                The 2000s were not only marked by a dynamic economy and housing market,
                                but also by significant demographic changes. Some of these changes were
                                more reflective of demographic patterns throughout the State of California
                                and nation. Yet aside from these national demographic patterns, other
                                demographic changes in Pasadena were more subtle and microfocused on
                                conditions unique to our community. These demographic changes included:
                                 Aging Baby Boom Generation. Over the 2000s, Pasadena’s population
                                  increased by just over 3,000 residents, but this change was largely due to
                                  the baby boom generation. Residents ages 45 and older increased by
                                  nearly 9,000—three times the City’s total population growth. Meanwhile,
                                  every other age group declined during this period of time. Although this
                                  change is being mirrored throughout California, it is more pronounced in
                                  Pasadena because the relatively higher cost of rental and ownership
                                  housing makes it more difficult to afford housing.
                                 Race and Ethnic Change. Race and ethnic changes were also evident. The
                                  City’s Hispanic population recorded the first decline, albeit slight, in several
                                  decades, while Whites recorded the first numeric increase in decades. The
                                  African American population continued its long decline in numbers, and
                                  Asians recorded the fastest percentage increase in numbers. Some of these
                                  demographic trends are clearly more localized in the San Gabriel Valley,
                                  while other changes have raised concerns over gentrification.
                                 Declining Household Size. Pasadena’s household size has been declining
                                  for decades and is below 2.5 persons. Compared to the 88 cities in Los
                                  Angeles County, Pasadena has the tenth lowest average household size, in
                                  part due to the fifth lowest percentage of families with children. This trend
                                  is due in part to national trends, including an aging population, adults
                                  marrying later in life, and couples deciding to have fewer children. The
                                  City’s large educational institutions and student population is also a factor.
                                 Increasing Household Income. In 1990, the median household income
                                  was equal to the County of Los Angeles; 20 years later it is 125% of the
                                  County’s median. With respect to lower income residents, the percentage
                                  of lower income residents is 41%—which is the same as in 1990. Above
                                  moderate income households currently make up 48% of Pasadena
                                  residents. This leaves a small percentage of moderate income residents.
                                  These changes point toward a wider spectrum of income levels, with
                                  implications for how best to address the lower and moderate income levels.
                                 Special Needs. The City of Pasadena continues to have a large resident
                                  population with special housing needs. This includes seniors, large families,
                                  people with disabilities, people who are homeless, college students,
                                  transitional at-risk youth, and other groups. Regardless of the broader
                                  demographic trends at work, Pasadena’s special needs groups continue to
                                  be one of the largest groups in need of affordable housing.

BALANCING GOALS AND RESOURCES
Pasadena has played a significant role in addressing its housing needs dating
back to the Housing 2000 discussions nearly 15 years ago. Through programs
implemented by planning and community, housing, community services, and
community organizations, Pasadena’s history has been marked by forward-
thinking housing policy. The City’s record of accomplishment of providing
quality affordable housing through new construction, rehabilitation, and
homeowner and renter assistance is well known.
In the early 2000s, Pasadena benefitted from a robust housing market that
generated significant revenues for the production of affordable housing.
However, the subsequent financial crisis affecting the nation also curtailed
Pasadena’s ability to address its housing needs. On the heels of a poor
economy, the Legislature’s actions led to the elimination of redevelopment
altogether, permanently taking millions in redevelopment funds that had
been used to eliminate blight, stimulate economic development, and finance
affordable housing in communities This resulted in a 85% decline in the City
of Pasadena’s housing production funds in just a few years.
Part of this loss was due to sharp cuts in state and federal housing grants.
These included federal community development block grants, state
homeownership grants, City of Industry funds, and other funding sources. The
economic downturn has also resulted in less sales tax, property taxes,
building permit fees, and other revenues. Significant losses in funding, along
with staff reductions in virtually every City department, continue to constrain
the ability to address housing needs. Although the economy is recovering, it
may take years for the City to restore curtailed programs.
The fiscal and administrative context facing Pasadena during this time should
not be interpreted to mean that the City has changed its commitment toward
housing. These contemporary fiscal challenges, although significant, will not
remain indefinitely, as indicators suggest improvements in the local economy.
Economic improvements, though, will not replace millions of dollars
reallocated from redevelopment. It is therefore incumbent on Pasadena to
devise creative strategies, unique partnerships, untapped funding sources,
and other means to continue advancing its housing vision.
Despite these challenges, the City remains committed to furthering its
housing vision and pursuing needed programs to address its housing needs.
Guided firmly by an inclusive housing vision, the following section sets forth
the goals, policies, and implementation programs that Pasadena is following
to address the housing needs in the community.
                                                                    CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT     7

                                Pasadena remains committed to furthering its housing vision and pursuing
                                needed programs to address housing needs in the community. The following
                                goals and policies are intended to further the City’s housing vision in balance
                                with the guiding principles and other elements of the general plan.
                                GOAL HE-1: HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOOD
                                Pasadena has a rich mosaic of neighborhoods that have developed over its
                                more than 100-year history. Each neighborhood is distinguished by its history,
                                architecture, housing types, density and urban form, and public amenities.
                                The City has established 27 historic and landmark districts and numerous
                                more neighborhood associations. Some neighborhoods comprise a single
                                block, others a square mile or more, and still others are based at a larger
                                apartment or condominium complex.
                                Natural geography and topography define many Pasadena neighborhoods.
                                Residential neighborhoods along the Arroyo or northern foothills are framed
                                by the surrounding hillsides, peaks, washes, and other features of the natural
                                landscape. Neighborhoods are also defined by urban form. While the Central
                                District offers an eclectic and highly differentiated urban form, east Pasadena
                                offers the suburban residential environments of Hastings Ranch. Southern
                                Pasadena provides single-family estate homes on larger lots.
                                Livable neighborhoods are more than the sum of housing and urban form.
                                Essential services include maintaining adequate mobility and ensuring the
                                safety of all forms of transportation. Others focus on crime prevention and
                                law enforcement activities. Still others involve providing and maintaining
                                adequate parks and recreational services, tree-lined streets and landscape
                                amenities, libraries and cultural facilities, or other services. These essential
                                services help to provide an enriching environment for residents.
                                Pasadena encourages substantial involvement from residents and its more
                                than 80 neighborhood association to assist in neighborhood improvement
                                efforts. Nonprofit organizations are also actively involved in numerous
                                community-building projects, ranging from cleanups to providing services to
                                residents. Through its Neighborhoods Connections Office, the City of
                                Pasadena seeks to engage an expansive network of local organizations
                                committed to the same goal of creating strong and healthy neighborhoods.
                                Regardless of location, urban form, or income level, Pasadena takes great care
                                and pride in maintaining and improving the quality of neighborhoods. From
                                improving infrastructure to planting landscape amenities, and from
                                monitoring the condition of existing housing to carefully guiding the design
                                and development of housing—these activities demonstrate a steadfast
                                commitment to providing a quality environment for Pasadena residents.

Housing Framework
                                GOAL HE-2: HOUSING SUPPLY AND DIVERSITY
                                Pasadena’s housing strategy is founded on principles of sustainability,
                                strategic growth, and inclusiveness consistent with the general plan.
                                Pasadena has and continues to affirm sustainable patterns of development.
                                The City is committed to providing safe, well-designed, accessible, and
                                human-scaled residential and commercial areas where people of all ages can
                                live, work, and play, including neighborhood parks, urban open spaces, and
                                the equitable distribution of public and private recreation facilities.
                                Pasadena continues to link land use and transportation planning. From the
                                streetcars of the 1900s to the modern light rail and freeways of the 2000s,

                                environmental impacts, and preserved neighborhoods surrounding the core.
                                The proposed 2014 General Plan Land Use Plan continues a highly sustainable
                                pattern of growth. Higher density development will be directed away from
                                residential neighborhoods and into the Central District, Transit Villages, and
                                Neighborhood Villages more suited to accommodating growth and change.
                                Providing a wide range of housing choices is fundamental to furthering the
                                City’s housing vision of an inclusive community and long-term sustainability.
                                Housing products and prices must be diverse and suited to different incomes,
                                lifestyles, and needs. To that end, Pasadena continues to allow the full range
                                of housing types, including multi-family rental, mixed use and transit-
                                oriented housing, manufactured and mobile homes, senior housing, student
                                housing, residential facilities, supportive and transition housing, emergency
                                shelters, and SROs, among others.
                                To guide residential development, Pasadena remains sensitive to ensuring
                                excellence in the quality, scalability, compatibility, and sustainability of
                                residential and mixed-use development. Pasadena aspires to see exemplary
                                practices in site design, building design, quality materials and colors,
                                sustainability principles, and aesthetic quality. Buildings are to be designed to
                                exemplify timeless principles, so that structures make a positive, long-lasting
                                contribution to their village, district, or neighborhood. Housing should also
                                be built in a way that promotes health and well-being.
                                While striving for excellence in residential projects, it is important to balance
                                this need with market feasibility. Pasadena strives to work within the dynamic
                                nature of the economy. Codes are written with considerable flexibility to
                                encourage creativity in design. Fees are designed to encourage the
                                production of affordable housing. Pasadena strives to process residential
                                projects in a timely manner while adhering to existing codes. Through a
                                careful balance of these competing priorities, Pasadena can facilitate the
                                production of quality housing within current market dynamics.
                                The following goal and policies further the production of housing that is
                                affordable and suitable for the varied lifestyle needs of Pasadena residents.

HE-2.4     Affordable Housing. Facilitate a mix of household income and
           affordability levels in residential projects and the appropriate
           dispersal of such units to achieve greater integration of
           affordable housing throughout the City.
HE-2.5     Adaptive Reuse. Support innovative strategies for the adaptive
           reuse of residential, commercial, and industrial structures to

           funding of affordable housing.
HE-2.8     Community Involvement. Continue and support dialogue with
           builders, advocates, nonprofits, residents, finance industry, and
           other stakeholders in addressing the housing needs of residents
           and workforce in Pasadena.
HE-2.9     Healthful Housing. Promote indoor air quality through a ban on
           smoking in apartments and condominiums and with
           construction materials that are sustainable, green, and not a
           detriment to indoor air quality.

                                GOAL HE-3: HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PRESERVATION
                                Pasadena residents value social, cultural, and economic diversity and its
                                contribution to the rich character of community life. A diverse community is
                                believed to evoke contrasting ideas, allow creative expression, foster a greater
                                appreciation of lifestyles, and ultimately, although not without conflict,
                                produce a stronger and more resilient community. The City of Pasadena has
                                the privilege to support and promote a diverse community of unique
                                neighborhoods where all residents are included and valued, where no group
                                is privileged above any other group, and where all have opportunity.
                                Pasadena’s housing policies and programs have a fundamental role in
                                preserving the social and economic diversity of the community. Pasadena’s
                                inclusionary housing program, neighborhood reinvestment strategies, rental
                                voucher subsidies, and other housing strategies preserve housing
                                opportunities for residents. Pasadena supports concepts such as aging in
                                place, barrier-free housing, and other innovative products that are designed
                                to adapt to the changing lifestyle needs of Pasadena residents. These
                                programs create, preserve, and help to maintain housing options.
                                Although affordable housing production is often the focus of state policy,
                                Pasadena’s significant stock of existing affordable housing continues to
                                provide the majority of quality and affordable housing for residents. This
                                includes assisted housing deed restricted as affordable to lower income
                                households. Pasadena has more than 4,000 units of assisted housing,
                                including over 1,440 units assisted under the City’s Housing Choice Voucher
                                program. Pasadena also has a larger inventory of non-deed-restricted housing
                                priced at levels affordable to low and moderate income households.
                                The following goals and policies are intended to further achievement of the
                                City’s housing assistance and preservation objectives.
                                GOAL HE-3
                                Expand, protect, and preserve opportunities for households to find and
                                retain housing in Pasadena and afford a greater choice of rental and
                                homeownership opportunities.

              to funding availability, education, and partnerships.
HE-3.4        Preservation of Affordable Housing. Establish and seek to
              renew long-term affordability covenants for all City-assisted
              housing projects; support the conservation of unassisted

HE-3.5        Homeownership Retention. Support the provision of
              education and resources that enable residents to make informed
              decisions on home purchases and maintaining homeownership.

              residents earning lower incomes, including persons with special
              needs consistent with City preference and priority categories
              and fair housing law.
HE-3.7        Workforce Housing. Work with major employers, educational
              institutions, health care institutions, and other employers within
              Pasadena to facilitate and encourage the development of
              workforce housing opportunities.
HE-3.8        Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation. Promote the
              acquisition, rehabilitation, preservation, or purchase of

              dispersal of assisted affordable housing developments and
              associated supportive social services for individuals and
              households throughout the community.
GOAL HE-4: SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
The City of Pasadena contains a diversity of people of all backgrounds, family
types, lifestyles, and income levels. Though adding to the richness and
diversity of the community, many residents have special housing needs. Many
of these special needs are common to all, while other special needs are more
common to people of different ages, incomes, or other factor. Pasadena is
actively involved in implementing creative responses to this challenge.
Providing housing for an aging population is one such example, where the
City makes available opportunities for residents to age in place in Pasadena.
The City is modifying its approaches to housing homeless people by blending
its traditional continuum of care approach with a housing-first/rapid reentry
approach. Increasing movement of persons with developmental disabilities
out of institutions requires new models of permanent supportive housing.
Pasadena is also exploring additional models for homeownership.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    13

4.           HOUSING PROGRAMS
The housing element vision, goals, and policies are achieved through the
implementation of 22 housing programs. These housing programs are
consistent with the general plan, City vision and mission, and state and
federal mandates. The housing program section is organized into four goal
areas—housing and neighborhood quality, housing diversity and supply,
housing assistance, and special needs.
QUANTITATIVE OBJECTIVES
To maintain consistency among planning efforts and address state law,
quantified objectives for all housing programs are provided, where possible.
Quantified objectives can refer to the number of households served, housing
units built or preserved, or other units of service planned for from 2014–2021.
The quantitative objectives are based on current funding known today.
Should funding change, the achievable objectives would change as well.
Table HE-1 provides a summary of quantified objectives for these programs.

                                PROGRAM #1: CODE ENFORCEMENT
                                Code enforcement is an important tool to maintain the quality of property
                                values in neighborhoods and commercial areas, and to protect the health,
                                safety, and welfare of residents. To achieve these goals, the City has several
                                code enforcement functions, described below.
                                 Code Compliance. Code compliance is a means to ensure that the quality
                                  of the City’s commercial and residential neighborhoods is maintained.
                                  Code compliance staff enforces state and local regulations governing
                                  exterior building conditions, property maintenance, and interior conditions.
                                  Code compliance staff also works with neighborhood groups to address
                                  common concerns. For properties found in violation, eligible property
                                  owners are directed to nonprofit organizations and City rehabilitation loans
                                  and grants for assistance in resolving code violations and making repairs.
                                 Emergency Enforcement. The Prosecutor’s Office oversees an inter-
                                  departmental effort called City Resources Against Substandard Housing
                                  (CRASH). The CRASH team includes representatives from Health, Fire,
                                  Building, Humane Society, Police, and Code Enforcement. The CRASH team
                                  works to correct substandard buildings, eliminate blight, identify solutions
                                  to neighborhood crime, and provide emergency response and abatement
                                  for the worst properties. The program also encompasses an education
                                  component to train property owners in prevention of illegal activity.
                                 Maintenance Assistance to Homeowners. The MASH program provides
                                  free services to low income, senior, or disabled homeowners unable to
                                  perform deferred maintenance on their owner-occupied, single-family
                                  homes. As a secondary function, the MASH program provides a unique
                                  program for providing on-the-job training for adults to gain the skills and
                                  work habits necessary to obtain a permanent job. MASH crews may also
                                  assist in times of emergencies, such as fire, storms, or earthquakes.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                 Continue program implementation; reallocate resources to maximize
                                  achievement of code compliance goals.
                                 Work with health department officials to coordinate efforts responding to
                                  health and safety concerns.

PROGRAM #2: NORTHWEST PASADENA
The City of Pasadena has long directed enhanced efforts at improving the
Northwest Community Plan Area. Through community building efforts,
enhanced community participation, and other efforts, the City continues to
make substantial investments in this area. Ongoing efforts are as follows.
 Community Building. Pasadena supports for-profit, nonprofit, and faith-
  based organizations that are committed to implementing community
  building efforts in the Northwest Community Plan Area. These include, but
  are not limited to: Flintridge Center, Community Bible Church through its
  work at the Kings Village and Community Arms Apartment projects, and
  numerous other nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Other efforts
  include Neighbors Acting Together Helping All (NATHA), which has
  received three-year grants from the California Community Foundation.
 Northwest Programs. The Northwest Programs Office at City Hall also
  coordinates many projects within the Northwest Community Plan Area.
  Working in conjunction with the Northwest Commission, these include
  preparation of the Lincoln Avenue Specific Plan, monitoring of capital
  improvement projects, input into the Heritage Square project,
  improvements to Robinson Park, police department activities to address
  neighborhood safety, discussions regarding the potential 710 freeway
  extension, and ongoing liaison activities with neighborhoods associations.
 Northwest Commission. The Northwest Commission is tasked with
  advising the City Council on community issues affecting residents and
  business within the Northwest Community Plan Area. Since the dissolution
  of several redevelopment project areas in 2012, the City Council approved
  changes to the Northwest Commission. The Northwest Commission now is
  responsible for fostering business retention, expansion, and relocation to
  generate new development and employment opportunities.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objectives:
 Support community building efforts by funding organizations and
  dedicating staff resources to support efforts, subject to funding availability.
 Work with the Northwest Commission to address community concerns and
  support the long-term revitalization of this area.

                                PROGRAM #3: HOUSING INSPECTION
                                The City of Pasadena maintains three housing inspection activities that are
                                essential to maintaining the quality, health, safety, and livability of residential
                                structures within the community. Described below, these include the
                                occupancy, quadrennial, and lead-based paint inspection programs.
                                  Occupancy Inspection. This inspection is designed to ensure the quality
                                   and maintenance of single-family homes, duplexes, and condominiums.
                                   Whenever a change in occupancy of an eligible unit occurs, the property is
                                   inspected for compliance with City codes. Typical items inspected include
                                   electrical, plumbing, heating, structural conditions, and health and safety
                                   items. If a housing code violation is found, the property owner is notified of
                                   the violations and given a reasonable time to correct them. Upon
                                   correction of the violations, a certificate of inspection is issued.
                                  Quadrennial Inspection. This inspection is designed to ensure that
                                   apartments are decent, safe, and well maintained. All rental properties with
                                   three or more units are inspected at least once every four years. Typical
                                   items inspected include the same as an occupancy inspection. Property
                                   owners are notified if code violations exist and, upon remedy, are issued a
                                   certificate of compliance. This program continues to be an effective way to
                                   identify code violations as they occur, before they affect the condition of
                                   the building and quality of life experienced by tenants.
                                  Lead-Based Paint Hazards. The City Public Health Department has a
                                   Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program that is designed to prevent
                                   lead exposure and, when exposure occurs, to care for children with lead
                                   poisoning. Public health nurses provide case management for children and
                                   their families affected by lead poisoning. Environmental health specialists
                                   work with nurses to identify lead sources, provide advice on lead-safe
                                   painting and remodeling, enforce City ordinances for lead reduction, and
                                   provide information and assistance to care providers of children.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                  Continue implementation of housing inspection programs.
                                  Continue to educate the community about health and safety hazards.
                                  Cross-train inspectors to identify and address health and safety hazards.

PROGRAM #4: HOUSING REHABILITATION
Pasadena’s housing is generally older than other communities. Because of its
age, maintaining housing in good condition is a critical priority in Pasadena.
Described below, the City offers three programs to encourage the
maintenance, repair, and improvement of rental and ownership housing.
 Maintenance Assistance to Homeowners. The MASH program provides
  free services to low income, senior, or disabled homeowners unable to
  perform deferred maintenance on their owner-occupied, single-family
  homes. As a secondary function, the MASH program provides a unique
  program for providing on-the-job training for adults to gain the skills and
  work habits necessary to obtain a permanent job. MASH crews may also
  assist in times of emergencies, such as fire, storms, or earthquakes.
 Single-family Rehabilitation Loan. The City is currently working with
  Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County to provide services.
  This program includes a single-family rehabilitation loan program,
  homebuyer and homeownership education, foreclosure counseling, and
  other neighborhood services formerly provided by the Pasadena NHS.
  These programs are offered citywide, although many of the activities are
  targeted for residents in the Northwest Community Plan area.
 Acquisition/Rehabilitation. Pasadena implements multi-family housing
  acquisition and rehabilitation efforts as opportunities arise. However,
  initiation of a more strategic, proactive program can help fill a needed gap,
  serve to both upgrade older apartment properties and stabilize rents, and
  enhance City efforts to improve distressed neighborhoods. While Pasadena
  provides funding on a project-by-project basis, guidelines for a
  comprehensive program should be established.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objectives:
 Implement the MASH program and focus on lead-based paint abatement
  and minor repairs. Repair 192 homes over the planning period.
 Monitor new contract to administer the single-family home rehabilitation
  program on behalf of the City.
 Establish program guidelines for a comprehensive acquisition/
  rehabilitation program by 2015, with goals and workplan—subject to the
  identification of a stable funding source.

                                PROGRAM #5: HISTORIC PRESERVATION
                                The City's historic preservation program promotes the identification,
                                evaluation, rehabilitation, adaptive use, and restoration of historic structures,
                                neighborhoods, and other landmarks. With respect to housing, key activities
                                directed at historic preservation objects are as follows.
                                 Historic Ordinance and Design Guidelines. The Historic Preservation
                                  Ordinance implements the goals, policies, and programs of the General
                                  Plan and establishes the review authority of the Historic Preservation
                                  Commission and Design Commission. City codes require that properties
                                  within historic districts and individually designated historic properties be
                                  reviewed and approved prior to alteration or development. Pasadena’s
                                  “Design Guidelines for Historic Districts” and the Secretary of the Interior’s
                                  “Standards for Rehabilitation” help guide the review of historic properties.
                                 Historic Preservation Incentives. The City offers incentives to promote
                                  the preservation of historic sites and structures. City incentives include:
                                  reduction of building permit fees and construction tax, waiver of covered
                                  parking requirements in single-family landmark districts, modified City of
                                  Gardens standards, and variances for both adaptive reuse and relocation.
                                  The City’s Mills Act program also allows owners of designated historic
                                  properties to reduce their property taxes in exchange for a contract with
                                  the City to maintain the property’s historic character.
                                 Home Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Adaptive Reuse. The City
                                  provides funding to acquire and rehabilitate historic homes and convert
                                  nonresidential uses to residential uses. Properties are targeted that
                                  contribute to neighborhood distress—abandoned, foreclosed, and
                                  dilapidated houses—which are acquired and rehabilitated using sound
                                  preservation principles and practices. Properties are sold to low and
                                  moderate income first-time homebuyers at below-market prices. This
                                  program continues to be implemented as funding is available.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                 Continue designating eligible landmark districts and structures, issuing
                                  Mills Act contracts, and completing historic design review.
                                 Beginning in 2014, advertise incentives for historic preservation and
                                  continue to support historic preservation projects as funding is available.

As an urbanized city with carefully designed neighborhoods, Pasadena
implements design review of proposed projects to ensure that new
development is of exemplary quality and is sensitively integrated into the
surrounding neighborhood context. Three key requirements are:
 Design Review. Pasadena requires excellence in architectural design that
  complements the scale and character of the City. Citywide design principles
  set the foundation, and City residential design guidelines provide clear
  examples of the quality and type of design recommended. Design
  guidelines work in tandem with development standards in the zoning code
  or appropriate specific plans. To expedite the process, developers may
  request a Consolidated Review, which combines concept and final design
  reviews into one step, thus reducing the time required.
 City of Gardens Standards. The City of Gardens Standards applies to
  multi-family projects within RM districts, certain specific plan areas, and the
  CL and CO commercial districts. Garden standards are an innovative set of
  zoning regulations aimed at creating more livable multi-family housing
  projects, encouraging designs that typify the garden character of earlier
  apartments and bungalow courts in Pasadena. These standards are also an
  integral way of encouraging the production of multi-family apartments and
  condominium projects of lasting quality.
 Historic Review. Because of the age, history, and rich fabric of Pasadena,
  many structures contain valuable and historic architectural features.
  Pasadena municipal codes require that properties within historic districts
  and individually designated historic properties must be reviewed and
  approved prior to alteration or development. Pasadena’s “Design
  Guidelines for Historic Districts” and the Secretary of the Interior’s
  “Standards for Rehabilitation” help guide historic review. City staff carefully
  reviews such structures to ensure that historic features are preserved.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objectives:
 Continue to implement design review to ensure maintenance of Pasadena’s
  architectural character and quality of the built environment.
 Implement City of Garden standards as a tool to enhance the quality and
  compatibility of multi-family residential projects.

Housing Framework
                                PROGRAM #7: HOUSING SITES
                                Historically, Pasadena’s general plan, as part of its guiding principles, has
                                explicitly directed new residential development into seven specific plan areas.
                                This strategy is intended to allow for continuation growth and development,
                                while reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, providing housing,
                                and stimulating economic development. The 1994 Land Use Element allowed
                                for the net development of 11,000 units, of which 8,711 units were directed to
                                specific plan areas (and 5,095 alone to the Central District). The 2004 update
                                to the Land Use Element affirmed the direction of the 1994 Plan. Since then,
                                the City has seen significant levels of development in the Central District.
                                In 2009, the City began an update of the general plan, working with the
                                community through an award-winning program of participative planning.
                                The general plan update focuses growth into neighborhood villages, transit
                                villages, and within the Central District and specific plans areas. In April 2013,
                                the City Council directed staff to begin preparation of the EIR. The EIR will
                                review the impact of net development of 9,955 housing units, of which 8,245
                                will be in specific plan areas (4,885 alone in the Central District). Affordable
                                housing units will continue to be exempt from the City’s development caps.
                                Key sites in the housing element include the Lincoln Properties (Parsons site),
                                which could accommodate hundreds of new housing units.
                                The City of Pasadena has a regional housing needs assessment of 1,332 units.
                                The affordability breakdown of the 2014–2021 RHNA is 340 very low units,
                                207 low income units, 224 moderate income units, and 561 above moderate
                                income units. These housing planning targets can be addressed through a
                                combination of housing production credits and available housing sites. As
                                mentioned in Appendix C, the City has adequate sites to accommodate the
                                full RHNA and its income levels. The proposed general plan and mitigation in
                                the program EIR ensures that sites are developable as envisioned in the Land
                                Use and Mobility Plan within the housing element planning period.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                  Adopt the general plan and increase the development caps, including in
                                   the Central District, and implement mitigation in the EIR.
                                  Continue to review specific plans and make needed changes to ensure
                                   adequate sites to achieve the 2014–2021 RHNA.

PROGRAM #8: MIXED USE/TOD STRATEGY
Pasadena housing growth strategy relies predominantly on mixed-use and
transit-oriented development that is focused into specific plan areas, transit
villages, and neighborhood villages. To implement land use plan, the City has
a mixed use/transit oriented development strategy described below.
  Mixed Use Development. Mixed use is an important strategy in the
   Pasadena General Plan to increase housing choices (including affordable
   housing), concentrate higher density projects in specific plan areas, support
   economic activity, and improve the walkability of an area. Mixed-use
   projects are a combination of commercial and residential uses in the same
   structure. To achieve these benefits, the City has codified zoning standards
   that facilitate and encourage mixed-use projects—such as reducing the
   project area required for open space, providing flexibility in meeting that
   requirement, and allowing a greater building envelope.
  Transit Oriented Development. Transit-oriented development is a
   concept that closely coordinates land use and mobility planning, making it
   more convenient to travel throughout the community by transit and foot.
   Pasadena has always embraced TOD planning; the City boasts a modern
   light rail and has established TOD districts throughout the City. In 2005, the
   City adopted TOD standards to encourage projects within a quarter-mile
   radius of a light rail station and the greater Central District. This has resulted
   in numerous residential and mixed use projects, including the Westgate,
   Del Mar Station, Holly Street, and Stuart Apartments.
Pasadena’s mixed use and transit oriented strategy has resulted in the
recycling of virtually every land use and the construction of thousands of new
units. It remains a cornerstone of the City housing and land use strategy.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objectives:
  Continue implementation of mixed-use incentives; monitor and assess the
   effectiveness due to the incentives on an annual basis.
  Continue land use, housing, and mobility strategy of encouraging transit-
   oriented developments around Gold Line stations.
  By mid cycle or 2017/2018, review codes and incentives to facilitate the
   development of mixed-use and TOD consistent with the general plan.

Housing Framework
                                PROGRAM #9: RESOURCE CONSERVATION
                                Pasadena continues to be an industry leadership in encouraging sustainable
                                development in a manner that reduces energy conservation, protects the
                                environment, and facilitates the production of affordable housing. The City’s
                                efforts include building codes, development incentives, and services below.
                                    Building Codes. Pasadena implements the California Green Building
                                     Standards Code (CalGreen) to promote sustainable building design and
                                     construction practices in the community. Although CalGreen’s
                                     mandatory provisions apply only to new construction and rehabilitation,
                                     the City extends these requirements to additions and alterations.
                                     Additional requirements, as permitted under state law, also apply to the
                                     residential and mixed use developments in Pasadena.
                                    Solar Incentives. Pasadena Solar Initiative (PSI) promotes the expansion
                                     of renewable solar power use in the community. Through rebates,
                                     additional incentives and education, the PSI aims to facilitate the
                                     generation of 14 megawatts of solar power by 2017. Through these
                                     incentives, the City has already facilitated the installation of 380 solar
                                     units in residential structures in Pasadena. Combined with other
                                     installations, Pasadena is 25% toward its goal by 2017.
                                    Water and Sewer Services. The housing element determined that there
                                     are adequate supplies of water supply, sewer capacity, and conveyance
                                     infrastructure in place to accommodate the 2014–2021 RHNA. However,
                                     in accordance with state law, the City is required to adopt written policies
                                     and procedures that grant priority for service allocations to proposed
                                     projects that include low income housing. This action was proposed in
                                     the 2008 housing element but needs to be completed.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                 Continue to implement CalGreen and make technical refinements to the
                                  code as required to implement its provision.
                                 Continue to implement the City’s solar initiative to help reach targets for
                                  nonrenewable energy production by 2017.
                                 Work with the City’s Department of Water and Power to finalize written
                                  policies and programs to prioritize water and sewer service allocations.

PROGRAM #10: INCLUSIONARY HOUSING
The City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (IHO) requires that residential and
mixed-use projects of 10 or more units dedicate 15% of the units as
affordable to low and moderate income households. Ownership projects can
fulfill the requirement with all moderate income units, whereas at least 10%
of the required inclusionary units in rental projects must be set aside for low
income (80% MFI) households. As an alternative to constructing the
inclusionary units, a developer may choose one of three options: 1) construct
the required units on another site, 2) donate another site for a portion or total
number of units, or 3) pay a fee in lieu of building the units.
However, the 2009 case, Palmer/Fifth Street Properties v. City of Los Angeles,
held that the Costa Hawkins Act does not permit the City to require affordable
units in new rental housing unless it has provided incentives to the developer,
and the developer has agreed by contract to provide the affordable units. In
2013, the Governor also vetoed state legislation proposed to give cities the
authority to continue inclusionary housing programs. In light of these and
other changes, the City may consider amendments to realign its program:
  Greater flexibility in the existing inclusionary option that allows the
   provision of off-site affordable units.
  A Citywide expenditure policy for IHTF that is closely tied to the City’s
   housing needs, tenure, and diversity goals.
  Incentives for the production and retention of affordable housing units for
   families, specifically three-bedroom units suitable for children.
  Consider potential amendments to the IHO to address concerns raised in
   recent court rulings (Palmer case) and other potential challenges.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objectives:
  Continue to monitor effectiveness of the inclusionary housing ordinance
   and the expenditure of Inclusionary Housing Trust Funds.
  In 2014, initiate a nexus study as a first step in the process of amending the
   IHO program; complete and present recommendations on amendments to
   the IHO to the City Council for consideration that year.
  By 2016, review current ordinance to determine if inclusionary
   requirements can and should be increased in TOD districts.

Housing Framework
                                PROGRAM #11: POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS
                                The Housing Element identifies several issues that merit greater attention
                                during the implementation of housing goals, policies, and programs. These
                                issues are related to municipal codes, development fees, and processes. The
                                following activities are proposed to address these potential constraints.
                                  Development Review. The City is considering various modifications to
                                   aspects of its development review procedures and requirements–design
                                   review, permit processing, commission reviews, and other features–to
                                   improve the land use entitlement process. The City is weighing options in
                                   light of current starting, community expectations, service demands, and
                                   funding. Appropriate recommendations will be progressively implemented.
                                  Development Fees. During the early to mid-2000s, Pasadena was
                                   successful in facilitating the construction of thousands of new housing
                                   units. The market crash halted this trend for years. During this period,
                                   concerns were raised about development fees. Although the building
                                   industry is recovering and numerous projects are in the pipeline, the City
                                   will reevaluate its fees in line with aforementioned process modifications.
                                  Ongoing Evaluation. Over time, potential constraints to the development,
                                   maintenance, and improvement of housing will arise due to changing
                                   conditions and community needs in Pasadena. These potential constraints
                                   could be related to municipal codes, environment, or city processes. The
                                   City will continue to examine these situations on a case-by-case basis,
                                   through a mid-cycle housing element review or through special studies.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objective(s):
                                  Consider the implementation of changes to the City’s development review
                                   process to improve timeliness and achieve desired outcomes.
                                  Reevaluate appropriateness of development fee schedules following
                                   implementation of development process improvements.
                                  Periodically review potential constraints to the development, maintenance,
                                   and improvement of housing as situations arise.

PROGRAM #12: REGULATORY HOUSING INCENTIVES
Because Pasadena is largely built out with a highly defined development
pattern, the City uses an effective mix of regulatory housing incentives to
facilitate the construction of affordable and market rate housing in strategic
growth areas. The primary three tools used are described below.
 Density Bonus. Pasadena implements a density bonus ordinance to
  incentivize the production of affordable housing. Eligible projects may
  receive an increase in density if any of the following conditions are met: at
  least 5% of the units are affordable to very low income households; at least
  10% are for-sale units affordable to low or moderate income households; or
  the project has at least 35 units available exclusively to persons aged 55
  years and older. Up to three additional incentives are also available
  depending on the proportion and income targeting of affordable units.
 Parking Incentives. Reductions in parking requirements are available to
  facilitate affordable, special needs, and transit-oriented housing. For
  example, tandem parking may fulfill up to 30% of the parking requirement
  in multi-family and mixed-use projects. Parking may be reduced to 0.5
  space per unit for senior housing and 0.25 space per SRO units. The City
  also requires a reduction in parking for transit-oriented development within
  ¼ mile of a light rail station and in the Central District Transit-Oriented Area.
 Minor Variances. The City has created other flexible tools to facilitate new
  housing, such as the minor variance process. Eligible projects can receive
  the following minor variances: 1) yard setback requirements, with no limit
  on percentage of deviation; 2) size of landscape areas in multi-family
  districts (including City of Gardens projects); 3) fence/wall height, with no
  limit on percentage of deviation; 4) building heights; and 5) other
  development standards set forth in the municipal code.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objective(s):
 Continue to provide flexibility through the density bonus, parking
  incentives, and minor variance programs.
 Consider changes to the zoning code to allow for a greater percentage of
  tandem parking and to allow for the uncoupling of parking costs from
  rental costs. Complete by 2016/2017.

                                PROGRAM #13: ALTERNATIVE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
                                Pasadena residential neighborhoods offer a diversity of housing types that
                                vary in type, density, and vintage. The challenge in creating new housing
                                opportunities is how to integrate new units into established and highly
                                defined neighborhoods. Two such efforts are as follows:
                                 Small Lot Ordinance. One of the more endearing forms of housing in
                                  Pasadena is small lot bungalows. The bungalow court, which features small
                                  houses arranged around a central garden, was the predominant form of
                                  multi-family housing in Southern California in the early 1900s. Adaptations
                                  of this concept have become popular in recent years in southern California.
                                  Small lot subdivisions allow for single-family homes, townhouses, or garden
                                  courts on smaller parcels than under standard zoning regulations. These
                                  housing products can have separate lots, do not require expensive
                                  subterranean parking, offer lower cost homeownership opportunities, and
                                  can be oriented in visually interesting ways.
                                 Second Units. Second units are self-contained units attached to or
                                  detached from the primary residential unit on a single lot. Second units
                                  typically rent for less than apartments of comparable size, and can offer
                                  affordable rental options for seniors, college students, single persons, and
                                  extended families. Rent from second units can help modest income and
                                  elderly homeowners remain in or continue affording their homes. The City
                                  has developed a ministerial approval process along with residential
                                  development standards. Though Pasadena has had few applications for
                                  second units in recent years, in consideration of continued input from the
                                  public, the City will reevaluate its current ordinance requirements.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                 Review zoning code and consider amendments to facilitate small-lot,
                                  single-family subdivisions as a means to providing affordable
                                  homeownership opportunities while balancing the need to protect the
                                  unique architectural and historical character of the City.
                                 Review the City’s second-unit standards, hold public meetings to solicit
                                  input, and evaluate the feasibility of changes to the ordinance to better
                                  facilitate such units within the context of maintaining the character and
                                  quality of residential neighborhoods.

PROGRAM #14: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
The City provides a wide range of financial assistance for developers of
affordable housing to encourage the production of affordable housing.
Assistance may include City financial assistance, land assemblage/write-
downs, and fee modifications or waivers, as briefly described below.
  City Assistance. The Housing Department provides funds for affordable
   housing production and preservation, including Inclusionary Housing Trust
   Funds, HOME, state and federal funds. Eligible uses include new
   construction (rental and ownership); property acquisition; rehabilitation
   (rental and ownership); homebuyer assistance; special needs housing; and
   affordable housing preservation. When funds are available, the Housing
   Department issues NOFAs and RFPs to solicit competitive proposals.
  Land Assemblage/Write-downs. The City may also provide land write-
   downs to selected developers in the acquisition and disposition of housing
   sites and/or surplus properties for the construction or rehabilitation of
   affordable housing units. Typically, developers acquire and assemble lots
   before submitting an application for development and City funding.
   Subject to the availability of funding, the City will continue to seek property
   acquisition opportunities, consider land write-downs and other creative
   land subsidies, and assemble sites for affordable housing.
  Fee Waivers. The City may waive part of the Plan Review Fee, Building
   Permit Fee, and Construction Tax in exchange for deed-restricted units
   affordable to very low, low, and/or moderate income households.
   Affordable projects receive fee reductions of up to $25,000 per unit, with a
   cap of $125,000 per project. Fee modifications and waivers are increased
   progressively for projects that provide a higher percentage of affordable
   units and deeper income targets. The fee waiver program also includes a
   reduced residential impact fee and traffic impact fee for affordable housing.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objectives:
  Contingent on availability, provide funding support for the production,
   rehabilitation, and preservation of up to 14 affordable units annually.
  Provide reduced fees in return for developers providing affordable housing
   and/or meeting IHO requirements for an estimate of 50 units annually.

                                PROGRAM #15: HOMEBUYERS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
                                Pasadena has traditionally offered several homeownership programs to
                                increase the number of affordable housing opportunities. Though the loss of
                                RDA funding has significantly curtailed these efforts, the City will be pursuing
                                additional funding to restore past program efforts.
                                 Homebuyer Education. The City contracts with the Los Angeles
                                  Neighborhood Housing Services (LANHS) to provide homebuyers’
                                  education and counseling to lower income renters to purchase housing.
                                  Program services also include credit counseling, financial prequalification,
                                  referrals, and limited financial assistance to first-time homebuyers. LANHS
                                  also employs certified foreclosure counselors who work with homeowners
                                  and lenders in the home mortgage lending process.
                                 Homeownership Assistance. This program provides down payment
                                  assistance to first-time, income-qualified home buyer applicants in the form
                                  of a low interest, second trust deed loan. To encourage long-term
                                  ownership and allow Pasadena to reuse funds, the loan provides a means
                                  to secure a portion of the appreciation if the property is resold or
                                  refinanced before the loan maturity date. The City also offers a closing cost
                                  program, with funds from the Pasadena Foothill Association of Realtors.
                                 Habitat for Humanity. The City works with Habitat for Humanity, Heritage
                                  Housing partners, and other organizations to provide homeownership
                                  opportunities. One such effort is the former Desiderio Army Reserve Center.
                                  The City is working with Habitat to establish a PD that will include a passive
                                  park and a nine-home bungalow courtyard. Efforts are underway to raise
                                  $2.9 million for this effort. Applicants for homes must contribute a
                                  minimum of 300 hours of sweat equity to help build the home.
                                Implementation:

                                  reactivate the homeownership program as funding becomes available.
                                 Assist in obtaining funds to complete the Desiderio Army base conversion
                                  and work with Habitat to build 9 affordable homes.
                                 Continue to provide homebuyer education, foreclosure counseling, and
                                  closing cost assistance to prospective homebuyers on an annual basis.

PROGRAM #16: RENTAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE
The Pasadena Housing Department is the federally designated agency for
implementing rental assistance programs for income-eligible households,
and eligible homeless families, individuals, and persons with special needs.
The City has three rental assistance efforts.
 Housing Choice Vouchers. The Housing Authority issues approximately
  1,442 vouchers to income-eligible residents of Pasadena. Of this total,
  approximately 900 vouchers are issued to families and approximately 500
  vouchers are issued to seniors. Five apartment projects also received
  project-based vouchers. The City’s priority and preference system for
  allocating vouchers adhere to the following order: residency, working,
  disability, veteran, involuntary displacement, and substandard housing.
 Special Needs. Pasadena administers vouchers for special needs groups.
  These include persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families under the
  Housing Opportunities for Persons with Aids (HOPWA) program. Vouchers
  are also issued to non-elderly disabled (NED) people under two programs:
  NED #1 must be selected from the Section 8 waiting list and meet the
  definition of non-elderly disabled households, and NED #2 provides rental
  assistance to very low income people. The City also allocates vouchers to
  assist homeless people under the Shelter Plus Care Program (S+C).
 Emergency Rental Assistance. The City of Pasadena historically offered an
  emergency rental assistance activity that offers security deposits, initial
  deposits, and back rents for very low and lower income Pasadena residents.
  The City also historically offered a similar program, called Tenant-Based
  Rental Assistance) for those temporarily displaced. Although these activities
  have been curtailed or cut back completely due to loss of funding, the City
  seeks to restore the program as funding opportunities become available.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objective(s):
 Assist 1,442 households or the number of vouchers allocated under the
  housing choice voucher program, including project-based vouchers.
 Continue to allocate available vouchers to special needs groups under the
  HOPWA, NED, and S+C programs.
 Seek available funding or new grants to restore emergency rental
  assistance programs or similar programs.

                                PROGRAM #17: AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION
                                The City of Pasadena has an expansive inventory of deed-restricted affordable
                                housing and a smaller inventory of market-rate affordable projects.
                                Preserving existing affordable housing, both market rate and government
                                deed-restricted projects, are important goals. Activities are described below.
                                 Deed-Restricted Affordable Housing. Pasadena has about 2,500 publicly
                                  assisted multi-family units that are deed restricted as affordable to lower
                                  income households. Up to 25% of the covenanted units will come up for
                                  renewal by 2024. Although the City presently monitors the status of these
                                  projects, the high cost of replacement (as opposed to preservation) merits a
                                  stronger program. To that end, the City will: 1) create an updated assisted
                                  housing database; 2) annually monitor the list, 3) explore funding sources
                                  for projects at risk of conversion; 4) present options for developers building
                                  new projects to preserve at-risk units; and 5) ensure tenants are properly
                                  notified of impending conversions as required by state law.
                                 Market Rate Affordable Housing. Pasadena helps to preserve market rate
                                  housing affordable to lower income households through acquisition and
                                  rehabilitation (Program #4), historic preservation (Program #5), and funding
                                  assistance (Program #12). Developers can fulfill their IHO obligations by
                                  acquiring, rehabilitating, and preserving existing market rate units as
                                  affordable housing. During the update process, however, comments were
                                  raised about the need to prevent the loss of affordable rental housing.
                                  Since this is a complex issue, an objective to study options for preserving
                                  non-deed-restricted affordable housing and tenant protections is included
                                  as an action for the 2014–2021 Housing Element.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objectives:
                                 Continue preservation of deed-restricted housing, focusing on housing
                                  projects at risk of conversion. As the ground lease is expiring on the
                                  Concord Senior project, explore preservation options.
                                 Continue activities to preserve market rate affordable housing through
                                  rehabilitation loans. Inform builders of the option to satisfy IHO
                                  requirements through acquisition/rehabilitation of rental properties.
                                 Study options to change the tenant protection ordinance and for options
                                  for preserving non-deed restricted affordable housing by 2016.

PROGRAM #18: ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
The City employs various tools to achieve the community’s housing vision.
These include expanding collaborative partnerships, seeking funding, and
developing unique tools to publicize housing opportunities. Although not an
exhaustive list, three tools are frequently used by the City and community.
 Collaborative Partnerships. In today’s market, creative approaches and
  partnerships are required to finance and build affordable housing. As
  mentioned in Chapter 4 and in the 2010–2015 Consolidated Plan, the City
  works with dozens of nonprofit and for-profit organizations to build
  affordable housing, rehabilitate housing, and preserve at-risk affordable
  housing from losing its affordability covenants. Additional organizations
  provide an extensive menu of supportive services to Pasadena. This
  network assists the City in effectively achieving its housing vision.
 Funding Programs. The Housing Department provides funding for the
  production, rehabilitation, and provision of assistance for housing. Many of
  these funds are not guaranteed and are allocated on a competitive basis.
  However, this funding is essential to maintaining the City’s economic and
  social diversity. From organizations dedicated to providing services to
  community building initiatives, these groups are essential. The City will
  continue to seek creative funding, including but not limited to private
  foundations, governmental grants, and other sources.
 Housing Search Website. The City subscribes to a free housing search
  website, located at http://pasadenahousingsearch.com/. As a partner, the
  City shares affordable housing listings with the L.A. County Housing
  Resource Center and other participating cities. The search engine has
  several useful features, including whether the property owner speaks
  Spanish, Section 8 is accepted, pets are accepted, or the unit is accessible
  for disabled people. The Housing Search website is highly used, with
  200,000 successful searches for affordable housing each year.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objective(s):
 Continue to expand partners and funding opportunities to leverage
  resources for housing programs.
 Continue to participate in and update affordable housing listings on the
  Department’s housing search engine.

                                PROGRAM #19: HOUSING FOR DISABLED PEOPLE
                                Pasadena implements activities to encourage the development of housing
                                suitable for people with disabilities (including developmental disabilities) as
                                well as fund supportive services to address their needs. City programs for
                                providing housing and services to people with a disability follow.
                                 Building Design. The ADA mandates certain requirements for multifamily
                                  housing units to be accessible to people with disabilities. There are also
                                  techniques for improving the accessibility of housing through the adoption
                                  of principles of “universal design,” “visitability,” or “barrier free” housing.
                                  Features typically include zero-step entrances, wide enough doorways for
                                  wheelchairs, and other key features. Pasadena will explore ways to make
                                  these types of improvements where feasible.
                                 Reasonable Accommodation. Pasadena’s housing was predominantly
                                  built before ADA requirements and may not be as accessible as new units.
                                  Therefore, the City’s municipal code establishes a process for requesting
                                  and granting reasonable modifications to zoning, development
                                  regulations, building codes, and land use to allow for the fullest access to
                                  housing. The City will continue to implement this process to improve
                                  access to housing for people with disabilities in Pasadena.
                                 Housing Opportunities. At times, expanding housing opportunities for
                                  people with disabilities (including developmental disabilities) is needed.
                                  The City supports the construction of housing and group quarters that is
                                  suitable for people with disabilities. The City allocates vouchers (Program
                                  #16) for people with disabilities to live in housing in an integrated setting
                                  with other nondisabled people. Finally, the City seeks opportunities to fund
                                  the provision of supportive services to Pasadena’s disabled residents.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objective(s):
                                 By 2018, evaluate feasibility of developing housing accessibility features
                                  consistent with ADA; implement reasonable accommodation ordinance.
                                 Seek opportunities and grants to fund the provision of housing and
                                  services for disabled people (including developmental) as funding arises.
                                 By 2015, review zoning code to ensure residential care facilities, limited, are
                                  allowed in appropriate zones consistent with state law.

PROGRAM #20: HOUSING FOR SENIORS
The City of Pasadena continues to have a sizable senior population because it
is a desirable place to retire. Moreover, many retirement communities have
chosen to locate in Pasadena. City activities dedicated to providing housing
and services for seniors are described below.
  Housing Facilities. Pasadena offers approximately 1,200 units of senior
   housing, the majority of which are deed restricted affordable to low income
   seniors through covenants. In addition, more than 500 housing choice
   vouchers are allocated to seniors to rent housing in the community. The
   production of senior housing is also encouraged in multi-family districts,
   where provisions for parking reductions, density bonus incentives, and fee
   reductions also apply. The City creatively uses its resources to increase the
   supply of senior housing, such as the rehabilitation of Hudson Oaks.
  Life Care Facilities. As the baby boomer population ages, senior housing
   providers are expanding their housing facilities and services to include “life
   care” housing opportunities, ranging from independent and semi-
   independent to assisted-living housing. The concept is to allow seniors who
   no longer reside in single-family homes to age in place without having to
   move to a completely different community or building as their health
   needs change. To that end, Pasadena works with life-care facility providers
   and developers to facilitate the construction of senior life-care facilities.
  Senior Services. Pasadena seniors benefit from supportive services that
   enable them to live at home as independently as possible. The City funds
   organizations that provide meal and nutrition, recreation, health care, and
   service programs. Many programs operate from Pasadena’s Senior Center.
   The City’s transit line offers subsidized low-cost public transit for seniors.
   The City also implements its MASH program, which provides free home
   maintenance, repairs, and property maintenance for eligible seniors.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objective(s):
  Continue to support the provision of senior housing and life care facilities
   and the preservation of affordable senior housing as funding is available.
  Continue to fund the provision of supportive services for senior residents as
   funding is available.

                                PROGRAM #21: FAMILY AND YOUTH HOUSING
                                The City of Pasadena implements three programs to assist in developing and
                                providing housing for families, including families with children, emancipated
                                youth, and college age youth.
                                 Development of Housing for Families. Recent market surveys show that
                                  developers are building primarily smaller condominiums and apartments
                                  targeted toward singles and couples without children. As part of
                                  Pasadena’s Policy on Children, Youth and Families (2006), the City Council
                                  adopted a policy to increase the supply of adequate and affordable
                                  housing for families with children. To implement this policy, the City will
                                  evaluate incorporation of incentives in the IHO and a comprehensive
                                  funding strategy, as funds are available, to promote family housing.
                                 Housing for Emancipated Youth. Emancipating youth refers to youth
                                  “aging out” of the foster care system, as well as a broader group of youth
                                  becoming independent adults before the age of 18. About 1,500 foster
                                  youth age out of the Los Angeles County child welfare system each year.
                                  Most have nowhere to turn for jobs, housing, education, or support. Studies
                                  show that this population is at higher risk of homelessness. Providing
                                  opportunities for affordable apartments and transition housing in
                                  conjunction with support services could help address these needs.
                                 Student Housing. Pasadena is home to Caltech, Fuller Theological
                                  Seminary, Art Center of Design, Pasadena Community College, and other
                                  smaller private colleges that collectively enroll more than 35,000 students.
                                  The exceptionally large number of educational institutions in Pasadena
                                  creates a high demand for apartments and affordable housing for faculty.
                                  The City will continue to work with local educational institutions to prepare
                                  and update Master Plans to provide additional housing opportunities.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objective(s):
                                 Annually review grants to determine suitability for improving housing and
                                  supportive services for youth leaving foster care and institutional living.
                                 In tandem with the review of the IHO under Program #10 in January 2014,
                                  evaluate the feasibility and/or extent to which incentives could be provided
                                  for large family units given funding and market constraints.
                                 Continue to work with colleges to update master plans.

PROGRAM #22: HOMELESS SERVICES
Pasadena employs a multi-faceted approach to addressing homelessness as
denoted in its Ten Year Strategy to End Homelessness as follows:
 Continuum of Care. Pasadena has traditionally implemented a Continuum
  of Care approach to addressing homelessness. A network of service
  agencies has emerged to address the needs of Pasadena’s homeless. The
  City continues to fund this network of shelter and service providers with
  ESG and COC funds. The City is in the process of adopting Zoning Code
  amendments to expand the area where shelters, transition housing, and
  permanent supportive housing can locate consistent with state law.
 Rapid Re-housing/Transition. Pasadena supplements the COC system
  with a Rapid Re-housing Approach. This highly successful model provides
  an option for placing homeless individuals and families immediately into
  permanent housing with supportive services. Rapid re-housing participants
  are provided with short-term interventions including deposit assistance;
  shallow, short-term rent subsidies; and stabilization services including case
  management, budgeting assistance, and assistance to increase income.
 Supportive Services. Pasadena continues to support agencies that
  provide supportive services to people who are homeless. Services are
  provided by a network of organizations (nonprofit, local government, for-
  profit, etc.) at all levels of homelessness, transition and permanent housing.
  This may include food services, job training, mental health, substance
  abuse recovery, referral services, and other services that enable people to
  transition into society and live full and productive lives.
Implementation
2014–2021 Objective(s):
 Periodically update and implement on an ongoing basis recommendations
  consistent with the City’s Ten Year Strategy to End Homelessness and
  integrate a new Rapid Re-housing approach.
 By 2015, update zoning code to allow transitional and permanent
  supportive housing in all zones allowing residential uses subject to the
  same standards as to housing of the same type in the same zone.
 By December 2013, amend zoning code to allow emergency shelters as a by
  right use in the Light Industrial SP-2 (IG), Central District (CD-6), and EPSP-D1-
  IG subject to management and operational standards permitted in state law.

                                PROGRAM #23: FAIR HOUSING
                                Pasadena’s fair housing program supports its vision of a socially and
                                economically diverse community by facilitating the provision of housing
                                opportunities for all persons, regardless of status. Pasadena’s efforts to
                                affirmatively further the spirit of fair housing law are detailed below.
                                  Fair Housing Services. Pasadena contracts with nonprofit agencies to
                                   promote the enforcement of fair and equal housing opportunity laws. The
                                   Housing Rights Center provides counseling and referrals, landlord and
                                   tenant dispute resolution, discrimination and complaint processing,
                                   education, outreach, training, technical assistance, advocacy, and
                                   relocation assistance. The City implements its Housing Mediation
                                   Ordinance, which oversees landlord-tenant disputes.
                                  Fair Housing Impediments. Fair housing concerns have varied over the
                                   past decade concurrent with case law, improved awareness, and
                                   contemporary challenges. In accordance with federal and state fair housing
                                   law, the City periodically prepares an Analysis of Impediments to Fair
                                   Housing Choice that identifies potential impediments and offers a menu of
                                   strategies to address them. The City will continue to work with its fair
                                   housing provider to affirmatively address identified impediments.
                                  Tenant Protection Ordinance. The City requires property owners to pay
                                   relocation assistance for tenants who are involuntarily displaced from
                                   housing when the tenant is not at fault. Relocation assistance is required if:
                                   1) the unit is slated for demolition; 2) the building must be vacated due to
                                   health and safety violations; or 3) the landlord seeks to remove the unit
                                   permanently from the rental market. Tenant protections are also
                                   enforceable in the case of condominium conversions.
                                Implementation:
                                2014–2021 Objective(s):
                                 Continue to provide fair housing services, tenant-landlord mediation,
                                  enforcement, and outreach and education services.
                                 Periodically prepare the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice
                                   and implement recommendations contained therein.
                                 Continue to implement the Tenant Protection Ordinance; by 2016, study
                                   appropriateness and options for strengthening provisions of the ordinance.

PROGRAM #24: HOUSING EDUCATION AND MONITORING
Education and monitoring activities are an essential process for evaluating
and refining housing programs. The City has three primary activities geared
toward monitoring progress and engaging and educating decision makers
and the community about housing policies and programs.
 Monitoring Program. The City maintains records of housing production
  for specific plans so that adequate sites remain available for development.
  Pasadena periodically prepares the annual monitoring reports—the
  Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report for federal programs
  and the Annual Housing Element Progress report for the California HCD.
  The City will continue to prepare these reports as required by law and work
  toward integrating their preparation in a more coordinated manner.
 Community/Commission Education. Housing policy, programs, state and
  federal mandates, and funding sources are intricate in detail. Moreover,
  housing programs often change in response to market cycles. In an effort to
  enhance and inform the decision-making process for housing matters, the
  City will implement a more formal education process. This process will
  include educating elected leaders, city staff, and stakeholders, both
  individually and/or collectively, about Pasadena housing issues.
 Midcycle Housing Forum. The 2014–2021 Housing Element is prepared
  during a unique period of time. Southern California cities have one of the
  shortest periods to update the housing element. The region is struggling to
  recover from the worst economic downturn in generations and the loss of
  redevelopment dollars. Finally, the City could face new market pressures
  before the end of the housing element cycle in 2021. In this context, a
  midcycle review of the housing element may be an appropriate course of
  action to ensure that housing programs remain relevant through 2021.
Implementation:
2014–2021 Objective(s):
 On annual basis, monitor the progress in meeting the objectives set forth in
  the housing element and prepare annual report as required.
 Conduct ongoing educational efforts to engage and inform the public,
  decision makers, and stakeholders about housing issues.
 At the midpoint of the 2014–2021 housing element period (2017), review
  select programs and activities to fine tune and adjust as deemed needed.

A. Housing Needs
Appendix A includes an analysis of demographic, economic, housing, and
special needs characteristics and trends in Pasadena. The analysis is intended
to identify issues that affect the City’s existing and future housing needs.
1.       DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS
POPULATION GROWTH
The City of Pasadena is the seventh-largest city in Los Angeles County, with a
population estimated at 137,122 according to the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau.
Over the past 50 years, the City’s population has increased by approximately
4% per decade. Historically, development pressures have migrated to
different areas of Pasadena based on land availability, location of
employment, and City General Plan policy. Since 1990, the majority of
residential and mixed-use projects have been focused in the Central District.
According to the Southern California Association of Governments’ forecasts,
the City of Pasadena’s population is projected to increase to 143,000 by the
year 2020 (see Figure A-1). As was the case in prior decades, the majority of
residential development is slated for the Central District, major transportation
corridors, neighborhood villages, and transit villages. Other areas of Pasadena
will continue to grow, although to a much lesser degree because these
neighborhoods have limited opportunities for new housing.

Housing Needs
                                AGE CHARACTERISTICS
                                Pasadena’s housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of
                                residents. Different age groups have different lifestyles, family types, and
                                income levels that affect their preference and ability to afford housing.
                                Typically, younger adults occupy apartments and condominiums that are
                                more affordable. Middle-aged adults tend to choose larger homes to
                                accommodate children, and seniors may begin to downsize to smaller homes
                                that are easier to maintain. Understanding changes in age characteristics
                                provides insight into present and future housing needs.
                                The state and the nation are in the midst of demographic change, with
                                significant increases in age due to the aging of the baby boom generation.
                                These trends are evident in Pasadena. Despite modest population growth
                                during the 2000s, Pasadena’s median age of residents rose to 37 years.
                                Mirroring national changes, Pasadena’s baby boom (middle-age) age adults
                                also was the fastest growing segment of Pasadena’s population. Middle-aged
                                adults (45 to 64 years) increased 25%, and seniors increased 14% since 2000.
                                In contrast, every age group under 45 years old declined in number.
                                Changes in age distribution are also due to local housing market factors.
                                Pasadena is known for relatively higher housing prices and apartment rents
                                that are more difficult for younger households to afford (as opposed to
                                middle-aged adults established in the workforce). In addition, Pasadena is an
                                attractive community for seniors and middle-aged adults who enjoy the
                                amenities offered by living in the community. These factors contribute to a
                                nationwide trend, resulting in significant increases in resident age.
                                According to demographic and building trends, several trends appear likely.
                                Continued development of apartments and condominiums in the Central
                                District will likely attract younger adults to more affordable housing
                                opportunities in Pasadena. Meanwhile, the aging baby boomer population
                                supports the contention that the senior population will continue to increase.
                                How these demographic changes will affect the demand and type of housing
                                built over the decade remains unclear. Table A-1 summarizes these changes.

                                                                                                     Housing Needs
RACE AND ETHNICITY
Pasadena, from its earliest time, was known for its diverse population. The
population boom before the 20th century included Chinese and Mexican
workers on the railroads, and African Americans who started small businesses
or worked in the large houses and hotels in Pasadena. Over time, the
Northwest area became home to Latino and African American residents—a
pattern existing today. Housing needs and preferences are sometimes
influenced by cultural preferences, but typically the issue of race and ethnicity
and housing has more to do with fair housing opportunity and incomes.
Although population totals have changed little during the prior decade,
Pasadena saw significant change in the race and ethnic composition of its
residents. As shown in Table A-2, the number of White (Caucasian) residents
increased slightly during the 2000s, after decades of declining numbers back
to the 1980s. Hispanics also increased in number, but to a lesser degree than
in prior decades. African Americans continued a long decline dating back to
the 1980s, decreasing 26% in the past ten years. Meanwhile, Asians recorded
a 46% increase—the fastest of all groups individually and combined.
Although Pasadena has gradually become more integrated, some areas have
a concentration of residents of one race/ethnicity. A commonly accepted
definition of “concentration” is when one race or ethnic group in a
neighborhood comprises a higher percentage of that neighborhood than
their overall proportion of the population countywide. Under this definition,
African Americans and Hispanics are more concentrated within Northwest
Pasadena, while White residents are the majority group in eastern Pasadena.
Asians are more concentrated in southern Pasadena and elsewhere.
According to U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 50% of Pasadena’s
households speak a language other than English at home. A household is
considered linguistically isolated if all members 14 years and older have at
least some difficulty in speaking English. In accordance with the Census
Bureau, approximately 11% of households are linguistically isolated. Of this
total, 28% are households that speak Asian and Pacific Island languages, 28%
are Spanish-speaking households, and 22% speak Indo-European languages.

Housing Needs
                                HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
                                Pasadena’s housing needs also differ depending on household characteristics.
                                This includes family size, single versus double income, and physical ability.
                                Families with young children often seek the living space and the financial
                                investment that homeownership offers. In contrast, single-person households
                                tend to desire apartments and townhomes that are easier to afford and
                                maintain and offer greater mobility. These patterns underscore the need for a
                                diversity of housing types and prices for different households in the City.
                                National trends reveal several key changes in the composition and type of
                                households since 1990. These include a declining share of families with
                                children and a continued increase in the number of single person households.
                                These changes are due to many factors, including the aging of the baby
                                boomer generation (many of whom have children who have left home),
                                single people choosing to wait longer to marry and have children, changing
                                race and ethnic mix of the population, and many other factors. Subgroups of
                                families have also changed, but to generally a lesser degree.
                                National trends are also evident in Pasadena, although to a greater degree.
                                During the 2000s, the number of households living in Pasadena increased by
                                7%, but population increased only 3%. This pattern was due to a decline in
                                married families with children (7% decline), a 14% increase in married couples
                                with no children, and an 8% increase in single persons. As a result, the
                                average household size declined to 2.4 persons. In Pasadena, single-person
                                households now comprise more than one-third of households, which is the
                                10th highest percentage of all cities in the County of Los Angeles.
                                Looking forward, whether these trends continue depends on the housing
                                market and demographic change. If development patterns in apartments and
                                condominiums continue or demographic trends continue, Pasadena may
                                then see a corresponding decline in household size for the foreseeable future.

EMPLOYMENT GROWTH AND CHANGE
Economic trends play an important role in defining housing needs. This
relationship includes: 1) the impact of job growth on the City’s share of future
housing needs; 2) the wage levels associated with employment growth; 3) the
housing demand associated with new workers desiring to live in Pasadena;
and 4) the mobility and land use decisions and environmental mitigations
that must be made to accommodate housing or employment growth. The
City of Pasadena is addressing the relationship of these complex issues
through the update of the Land Use and Mobility Element.
The City of Pasadena serves as a major employment center of the Los Angeles
Metropolitan region. Pasadena’s estimated daytime population is 192,724.
The City’s daily workforce of 112,532 is nearly double the estimated 59,030
residents in the employed labor force. By all measures, Pasadena is a jobs
center and must import labor from across the southern California region. The
high demand for labor exists at virtually all industry levels, but is particularly
strong in professional services, health care and social assistance, retail trades,
local services, and other employment sectors (see Table A-4).
Looking forward, Pasadena is projected to experience gradual employment
growth in all economic sectors through the remainder of the 2014–2021
housing element planning period. Projected employment growth is inferred
from economic studies as part of the update to the general plan land use and
mobility element. In summary, higher job growth is projected for retail trades.
Lower employment growth is projected for miscellaneous services, health
care, and social assistance. Moderate growth is projected for all other sectors.

Housing Needs
                                HOUSEHOLD INCOME
                                Household income affects the type and price of housing that can be afforded.
                                In 2010, the City’s median household income was approximately $68,400,
                                which is 50% higher than the $46,000 median household income in 2000.
                                After taking inflation into account, Pasadena’s median income rose only 10%.
                                Relative to the county, however, Pasadena residents have fared much better.
                                Between 2000 and 2010, the City’s median income significantly increased,
                                from 110% to 125% of the County median household income.
                                The State of California Department of Housing and Community Development
                                (HCD) surveys households in each county on an annual basis to determine the
                                median income. The median income is also adjusted for households of
                                different sizes. Households are then grouped into four income groups for
                                purposes of determining the need for assistance. Based on 2013 categories,
                                these income groups and thresholds are:
                                  Extremely low: households earning up to 30% of the county median family
                                   income (CMFI), or a maximum of $25,600 for a household of four.
                                  Very low: households earning 31% to 50% of CMFI, or a maximum income
                                   of $42,700 for a household of four.
                                  Other low: households earning 51% to 80% of CMFI, or a maximum of
                                   $68,300 for a four-person household.
                                  Moderate: households earning 81% to 120% of CMFI, or a maximum
                                   income of $77,750 for a household of four.
                                  Above moderate: households earning above 120% of CMFI, which is more
                                   than $77,750 for a household of four.
                                Table A-5 provides a summary of Pasadena households by income group. The
                                majority of households earn above-moderate incomes (47%), yet more than
                                one-third of all Pasadena households earn lower incomes. This is due in part
                                to the General Plan policies encouraging the construction of a significant
                                amount of affordable housing over the past several decades.

2.         HOUSING TRENDS
This section describes housing characteristics and trends to provide a basis
for assessing the match between the demand and supply of available housing
in Pasadena. These include housing growth, housing characteristics, age and
condition of housing, housing prices and rents, and homeownership rates.
HOUSING COMPOSITION
Pasadena has an exceptional range of housing opportunities reflective of its
diverse community. Approximately 51% of the housing stock is single-family
homes and 49% is multi-family units. A unique feature of Pasadena is the
more than 5,500 condominiums, townhomes, and other attached products.
Pasadena is also home to a significant number of group homes. Although not
typically counted as housing units, Pasadena has more than 125 facilities
offering special needs accommodations for more than 4,000 residents.
In the past decade, developers have concentrated on building apartments
and condominiums along transportation corridors or near employment
centers, particularly in the Central District. Developers appear to be building
housing for two groups: (1) middle-aged baby boomers without children who
desire the cultural amenities of Pasadena; and (2) single professional adults or
recently married couples who desire to be “where the action is” in Pasadena.
In either case, both groups have more disposable income for housing,
Looking forward through 2020, Pasadena anticipates continued residential
development along transportation corridors and in the Central District.
Currently, more than one thousand housing units are in the pipeline. The vast
majority are townhomes and apartment projects. According to SCAG growth
projections, the City of Pasadena will have about 61,000 units by 2020,
although current activity suggests a higher rate of housing development.

Housing Needs
                                HOUSING TENURE
                                Housing tenure refers to whether a household owns or rents a home. Ample
                                homeownership and rental opportunities allow people of all incomes and
                                household sizes to choose the type of housing and location best suited to
                                their needs and preferences. Housing vacancy rates, in combination with
                                housing tenure, also affect the prices and rents charged for housing units.
                                Tenure Rates
                                The American dream is often intertwined with homeownership, which brings
                                with it independence, wealth, housing security and safety, and quality of life.
                                Homeownership commits the owner to a long-term economic relationship
                                with the home, typically resulting in increased investment into the property,
                                which in turn increases property values within a neighborhood. Home
                                investment and the physical presence of homeowners are thought to also
                                improve the quality and stability of residential neighborhoods.
                                In the City of Pasadena, the majority of households (55% or 24,863) rent a
                                home while 45% (30,407 households) own a home (U.S. Census 2010).
                                Pasadena’s homeownership rate has remained the same compared to 2000.
                                In Los Angeles County, the homeownership rate was slightly better—48% of
                                the units are owner occupied and 52% are renters. Homeownership rates are
                                largely a function of the price of housing relative to household income,
                                although homeownership rates have clearly fluctuated in recent years due to
                                the highest foreclosure rates across the southland in generations.
                                Vacancy Rates
                                Housing vacancies are a measure of how well the supply of housing matches
                                the demand for specific types of housing. Typically, housing vacancy rates of
                                5% to 6% for apartments and 1% to 2% for homes are considered optimal.
                                This amount of housing vacancies assures that consumers have sufficient
                                choices for different types of housing products, that prices are generally
                                moderated because a balanced supply is available, and that developers have
                                a financial incentive to continue building housing. Higher vacancy rates lead
                                to price depreciation. Lower vacancy rates are also not desirable; they
                                indicate a tight market and cause housing rents and prices to increase.
                                According to the 2010 Census, the City of Pasadena’s housing vacancy rate is
                                estimated at 7.1%, which is above the countywide rate of 5.9%. Pasadena’s
                                vacancy rate is 2.3% among owner-occupied units and 6.6% among renter-
                                occupied units, versus county vacancy rates of 1.7% and 5.8%, respectively.
                                Housing vacancy rates do not generally include foreclosures, unless the unit is
                                unoccupied and for sale. According to Trulia.com, the City of Pasadena has
                                approximately 310 foreclosures (pre-foreclosure and foreclosed units)
                                currently offered for sale in the community. This statistic makes it difficult to
                                determine the actual number of vacant units at any given point in time.

HOUSING AGE AND CONDITION
Pasadena’s housing is predominantly older, with 53% built before 1960 (or
older than 50 years). Residential units generally begin to show age after 30
years and require some level of maintenance, such as roof repair, painting,
landscaping, and exterior finishes. Homes between 30 and 50 years require
more significant maintenance and renovation, and older homes may need
more substantial repairs. These rules of thumb are not always the case, since
many homes, particularly older historic homes, have been renovated.
Another concern related to the age of housing is lead-based paint hazards.
Homes built prior to 1978 typically contain lead-based paint, which can cause
a number of hazardous health conditions for children (specifically
developmental delays). Health hazards occur when the paint chips and is
inhaled by residents, particularly children. Since 1978, the federal government
has banned the use of lead-based paint. Still, older homes may need to paint
over lead-based paint or remove peeling paint. Since 1998, 211 child lead-
poisoning cases have been reported in Pasadena.
Generally, Pasadena’s housing is in excellent condition, and most residential
neighborhoods are well maintained. However, isolated structures need repair.
The Census provides a limited assessment of housing conditions. According
to the 2007–2011 CHAS, approximately 1.4% of rental housing units and 0.6%
ownership units lack complete kitchens and/or complete plumbing. This
translates to approximately 565 substandard units in Pasadena. Estimates for
substandard housing do not include units lacking heating. Many of these
conditions are concentrated in lower to moderate income areas of Pasadena.
To address housing condition issues, City staff inspects more than 6,000 units
annually through its Occupancy Inspection and Quadrennial Inspection
Program. In some cases, the City also assists in rehabilitating larger multi-
family projects or single-family homes, through providing loans or grants,
acquisition and rehabilitation activities, or support for state/ federal grants.

Housing Needs
                                HOUSING PRICES
                                The last decade has been characterized by volatility in the housing market.
                                This volatility in prices and rents, relative to household income, is a primary
                                reason for a loss of affordable housing, rising rates of overpayment, mobility
                                of residents, and other conditions affecting the community.
                                Homeownership
                                Pasadena experienced unprecedented changes in housing prices since 2000.
                                From 2000 to 2006, the median home more than doubled, from the mid
                                $300,000s to the high $700,000s. However, as the recession deepened in the
                                latter 2000s, median housing prices plummeted through 2010. Prices have
                                begun to recover with new sales averaging $600,000 in price. Condominium
                                prices have followed an identical pattern, although less in price.

                                Pasadena has a wide variety of neighborhoods with housing of different sizes.
                                Prices vary significantly not only by standard zip code or neighborhood, but
                                also by block. Table A-8 below shows this variation in price.

Rental Units
Apartment rents have not increased as dramatically as the sales prices of
single-family homes or condominiums. RealFacts tracks the rents for
apartment projects with more than 100 units. These are typically Class A and
B investments with some level of amenities. As shown below, apartment rents
have increased 50% over the past decade. However, rent levels also tended to
follow the same pattern as single-family homes, peaking during the same
time, declining during the downturn, and then picking up thereafter.

Housing rents vary by the age of the structure, surrounding neighborhood,
and property amenities. Although the Census Bureau does not provide rents
separately for different types of housing (e.g., apartments versus single-family
homes), some generalizations can be made based on existing census surveys.
For comparative purposes, Table A-9 provides housing contract rents by zip
code. Zip code areas 91105 and 91101 are the most expensive areas, while zip
code areas 91103 and 91104 (Northwest) are the most affordable in Pasadena.

Housing Needs
                                HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
                                Housing affordability refers to how much a household can afford to pay each
                                month in rent or mortgage for an apartment, townhome, or single-family
                                home. Typically, housing affordability is defined as the ratio of housing
                                expenses to income, referred to as a “cost burden.” It is assumed that
                                households should not spend more than a certain proportion of income
                                toward housing expenses; otherwise, they are deemed to be overpaying.
                                Overpaying for housing makes it difficult to afford other basic necessities.
                                The housing industry assumes the “affordable” payment for a homeowner
                                should range from 30% to 40% of gross monthly income, with the latter figure
                                from the California Association of Realtors’ first-time homebuyers’ index. A
                                mortgage payment typically includes several components—loan principal,
                                interest, taxes, and insurance. For purposes of calculating affordability, we
                                assume a conventional 30-year, FHA-insured loan at 5% interest rate. For
                                renters, the appropriate cost burden also varies from 30% to 40%, with the
                                latter being used under the federal housing choice voucher program.
                                With such a range in affordability criteria, this housing element uses a
                                midpoint estimate of 35% cost burden for ownership (since many expenses
                                are tax deductible) and 30% cost burden for rental housing as the thresholds.
                                These two benchmarks of housing affordability are consistent with thresholds
                                cited under the Health and Safety Code; however, individual cities may adopt
                                different affordability thresholds depending on the housing program. Table
                                A-10 shows the amount that households can afford for housing costs.

Housing Affordability by Income Level
The general affordability of rental and ownership housing to different income
groups can be derived by comparing household income and housing costs
from earlier section and data presented in Tables A-8, A-9, and A-10. This
analysis will be used later in this housing element to determine how the City
of Pasadena will meet its regional housing needs assessment requirement.
The affordability of housing in Pasadena is summarized below:
  Extremely Low/Very Low Income. For four-person households, extremely
   low income households can afford a home priced up to $83,000, and very
   low income households can afford up to $144,000. Condominiums and
   single-family homes sell for prices well above these thresholds. A very low
   income household could afford $850 to $1,021 in rent. Approximately 18%
   (5,045 unit )of the rental stock is estimated as affordable to very low income
   households, although the majority are assumed to be inclusionary units,
   assisted apartment projects, or housing units that accept a voucher.
  Low Income. Lower income households can afford to buy a single-family
   home priced up to $256,000. According to current home sales prices, only
   5% of condominiums and single-family homes sold within this price range.
   Low income households can afford $1,200 to $1,600 for an apartment.
   These rents are available for Pasadena’s older housing stock, but most rents
   for newer apartments are unaffordable to low income households. More
   affordable housing units are still found predominantly in the northern
   sections of Pasadena, which is approximately north of the I-210.
  Moderate Income. Moderate income households have the greatest
   housing opportunities; they can afford a single-family home or townhouse
   from $286,000 to $389,000. Over the past year, approximately 20% of all
   standard sale homes sold for less than the maximum threshold price for a
   moderate income family, but these homes are predominantly older
   condominium projects in the most affordable areas of Pasadena. With
   respect to apartments, moderate income households can afford from
   $1,815 to $2,450 per unit and would be able to afford older apartments, but
   new projects would be unaffordable to them.
  Above Moderate Income. Above moderate income households include
   households earning above 120% of the median family income. This group
   has the greatest opportunity to afford apartments, condominiums, or
   single-family homes in Pasadena. A 4-person household would need to
   make at least a minimum of 150% of the median family income in Los
   Angeles County to afford the median-priced condominium unit and at least
   210% of median family income in Los Angeles County ($136,000) to afford a
   median priced single-family home. Although above moderate income
   households have the greatest opportunity to afford housing in Pasadena,
   the household must still earn up to double the minimum income threshold.
                                                                        CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    A-13

Housing Needs
                                HOUSEHOLD PROBLEMS
                                Housing problems refer primarily to overpayment and overcrowding.
                                Housing overpayment and overcrowding most often occur when a household
                                cannot afford suitably sized and priced rental and ownership housing. In
                                other cases, life changes (retirement, children moving back home, loss of job,
                                etc.) can also cause housing problems. In these situations, a household can
                                choose to either overpay for housing or double up with others into too small
                                a unit in order to afford housing, which can result in overcrowding.
                                Table A-11 and the following text show the prevalence of housing problems
                                in Pasadena according to the 2007–2011 American Community Survey.
                                  Overcrowding. Overcrowding occurs where a household has more
                                   members than habitable rooms in a house. Moderate overcrowding refers
                                   to 1.0 to 1.5 persons per room, and severe overcrowding is anything higher.
                                   In Pasadena, 3% of homeowners and 11% of renters live in overcrowded
                                   situations, which is below county averages of 6% and 18%, respectively.
                                   The overcrowding rate has declined since the 2000 Census.
                                  Overpayment. Housing overpayment refers to paying more than 30% of
                                   income toward housing. Moderate overpayment refers to paying 30 to 49%
                                   of income toward housing, and severe overpayment is anything higher. In
                                   Pasadena, 43% of owners and 51% of renters overpay for housing, which is
                                   less than the county average. However, not unlike many communities,
                                   overpayment has increased nine percentage points since 2000.
                                  Housing Needing Repair or Replacement. According to the 2007–2011
                                   CHAS, 1.4% of all rental housing and 0.6% ownership units lack complete
                                   kitchens and/or complete plumbing–equaling 565 substandard units. City
                                   staff estimates that 1% of all single-family units and 1% of multiple units
                                   need repairs (rehabilitation work) and ¼ percent of all housing requires
                                   demolition. This translates into a total of 744 housing units.

Lower Income Households
Housing problems occur significantly more frequently among lower income
households (defined as households earning less than 80% of the median
family income adjusted for household size) and among special needs groups.
According to the 2005–2009 CHAS, of the 6,250 lower income owners, 4,350
households or 70% overpay for housing. Among the 16,730 lower income
renters, 12,960 renter households or 79% overpay for housing. The CHAS
estimates are higher than SCAG’s estimate, because SCAG did not adjust for
household size, whereas the CHAS dataset includes that adjustment.
Further, the housing problems facing extremely low income households,
defined as those earning below 30% of the median family income, are
greater. This subset earns income that is nearly equivalent to the federal
poverty line. According to the 2005–2009 CHAS, Pasadena has approximately
8,210 extremely low-income households, including 6,790 renter and 1,420
owner households. The vast majority face a high incidence and severity of
housing problems, defined as a cost burden greater than 30% of income,
and/or overcrowding, and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities.
As shown below in Table A-12, a significant percentage of renter households
overpaid for housing. Renters overpaying for housing included 63% of other
low income, 83% of very low income, and 87% of extremely low income
households. Among owner households, 61% of other low income, 69% of
very low income, and 84% of extremely low income overpaid for housing.
Table A-12 highlights the housing problems facing these income groups.
Furthermore, certain subgroups (e.g., seniors, large families, etc.) tend to have
an even higher prevalence of housing problems than other groups.

Housing Needs
                                3.         SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
                                Certain households in Pasadena have greater difficulty finding decent,
                                affordable housing due to their special circumstances. Special circumstances
                                typically relate to one's income-earning potential, family characteristics,
                                physical or mental disabilities, age-related health issues, homelessness, and
                                other factors that make it more difficult to secure and maintain housing.
                                These groups often have lower incomes and higher rates of overpayment or
                                overcrowding. As a result, these household groups are considered to have
                                special housing needs relative to the general population.
                                State housing element law defines "special needs" groups narrowly to include
                                senior households, disabled persons, large households, female-headed
                                households, farmworkers, and people who are homeless. Due to their
                                numbers in Pasadena, college students are also included. Moreover, due to
                                the large number of homeless children and youth in relation to available
                                housing, at-risk youth are also considered a special needs group. In keeping
                                with state law and the City’s priority for a socially and economically diverse
                                population, this section provides a summary of needs for each group and the
                                availability of resources to address their needs.

                                special needs groups in Pasadena from 2000 to 2010.

                                There are no active farms and no zones allowing agricultural use in Pasadena.
                                The Census does report about 100 people employed in the farming industry,
                                but these are horticulture, gardening, and jobs far removed from farm labor.
                                Therefore, this analysis does not specifically call out this group. However, to
                                the extent that agricultural workers may desire to live in Pasadena, their
                                housing needs would be similar to that of other lower income persons, and
                                affordable housing in the City could serve farmworkers as well.

SENIOR CITIZENS
Seniors are defined as persons 65 years or older, although for housing
purposes the age may be as low as 55 years. Pasadena has 18,562 residents 65
or older, representing 14% of the population. Senior citizens are considered a
special needs group, because their limited income, higher health costs, and
physical disabilities make it difficult to find suitable and affordable housing.
Concurrent with trends throughout the nation, this population is expected to
continue increasing as the baby boom generation approaches retirement.
Although often viewed as homogeneous, Pasadena’s senior population is
diverse as reflected in tenure, age, income, and housing needs. Seniors
comprise 11,851, or one in five households (U.S. Census 2010). Of that total,
61% of senior households (or 7,184) own a home, and 39% (or 4,667) rent
housing. Approximately half are older than 75 years. Each group requires a
different strategy to address health, transportation, and housing needs.
Some of the key issues are:
 Disabilities. The majority of seniors will eventually have a disability that
  may limit one or more life activities. Whereas some disabilities may limit
  mobility, others may make it difficult to take care of personal needs. This
  underscores a need for accessible housing and supportive services.
 Limited Income. Senior have limited or fixed incomes in retirement.
  Although data is not readily available, the majority of Pasadena’s senior
  renters and homeowners are on fixed incomes and earn lower incomes. As
  a result, seniors pay a larger share of income toward housing.
 Overpayment. More than 64% of senior renters and 32% of senior
  homeowners overpay for housing, leaving less income for other living
  expenses. This underscores the importance of affordable housing options,
  including programs to repair homes.
 Special Housing Needs. As seniors gradually age, there is often an
  increased demand for a broader type of senior living arrangements, from
  independent age-restricted housing for more active lifestyles to assisted
  living for those requiring more supportive services.
 Service Needs. In addition to housing, seniors rely on support services.
  Services can include transportation, health care, home maintenance
  assistance, low cost loans or grants for rehabilitating homes, referral
  services, and many other services that can improve the lives of seniors.
With its diverse senior population, Pasadena faces the challenge of how to
accommodate the needs of its residents. With a growing baby boom
population and aging of residents, a comprehensive strategy for housing
seniors is an important housing challenge for Pasadena over the next decade.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    A-17

Housing Needs
                                   Housing Accommodations
                                   The City recognizes the goal of providing services to enable seniors to “age in
                                   place,” that is, to maintain their current residences for as long as possible.
                                   Achieving that goal involves providing a range of supportive services. The
                                   City provides low cost or free transit services, grants to low income senor
                                   homeowners to maintain their homes, and other services. The City’s Senior
                                   Commission also plays an active role in defining needs and making
                                   recommendations to the Pasadena City Council to address gaps in services.
                                   Many Pasadena seniors reside in single-family homes, condominiums, or
                                   apartments. In addition to traditional housing, Pasadena provides for the
                                   following housing options for seniors shown below.
                                     Senior Apartments. Pasadena has 14 apartment projects that provide
                                      deed-restricted units affordable to lower income seniors. Several additional
   Fair Oaks Senior Housing           projects for seniors are in the planning stage. The City’s Housing Authority
                                      also provides about 500 rental housing vouchers, in a number authorized
                                      by the federal government, to very low income seniors renting apartments.
                                     Age-Restricted Condominiums. In recent years, there has been an
                                      increase in the number of age-restricted senior condominiums that are
                                      stand-alone projects or within age-restricted life care facilities. Since the
                                      majority of these uses are market rate, they are not included below.
                                     Residential Care Facility. Residential care facilities for the elderly serve
                                      persons 60 years of age and older who may have a disability but typically
                                      serve people in need of extended care services. The City’s 48 residential
                                      care facilities for the elderly serve 2,900 seniors in Pasadena.
                                     Life-Care Facilities. Pasadena has several life-care facilities that provide the
                                      full continuum of care for seniors, from independent to assisted care. These
                                      include faith-based (e.g., 88-unit Monte Vista), nonprofit-based (e.g., 200-
                                      unit Villa Gardens), and private (e.g., 128-unit Regency) projects.

FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS
The City of Pasadena’s commitment to providing a supportive environment
for families, children, and youth is codified in the City’s Policy on Children,
Youth, and Families. The policy provides six initiatives to improve the health
and well-being of children, youth, and families in Pasadena—good health,
safety and survival, economic well-being, social and emotional well-being,
education, information, and access to services. Providing housing and
services are an essential component of furthering the spirit of this policy.
Pasadena is home to an estimated 30,876 families with children, of which
9,236 are families with children (2010 Census). Pasadena has the fifth lowest
percentage of families with children of all cities in Los Angeles County. This is
due in part to national trends—an aging population, adults marrying later,
and couples having fewer children–as well as high cost of housing that makes
it difficult for families with children to afford suitable affordable housing.
Two subsets of families with children have more difficulty securing housing.
  Single-parent households. The City of Pasadena has 3,490 single-parent
   households with children—which is 6% of all households (2010 Census). Of
   those families, a female householder heads 74% of single-parent families
   with children. Poverty rates are also higher among single-parent families.
   According to the 2007–2011 ACS, 18% of single male-headed families with
   children and 28% of single female-headed families with children live in
   poverty. This is two to three times the 8% poverty rate for all families.
   Single-parent families typically have the same costs as any other families,
   but must rely on less income to cover normal life expenses. According to
   Kidsworks, the average cost can range from $7,200 for a preschooler to
   $10,500 for an infant. For single-parent families, this is a significant portion
   of annual income, leaving less income for housing, medical care, and other
   expenses. The financial burden is especially difficult to younger people,
   those who lack steady jobs, or those who are also underemployed.
  Large Families. The City of Pasadena is home to an estimated 5,500 large
   families with five or more members, or 10% of all households in the
   community. With respect to tenure, 2,677 large families own a home and
   2,823 large families rent housing. According to the CHAS, large families
   encounter unique housing conditions in that approximately 90% of lower
   income large family renters and owners have at least one housing problem,
   defined as overcrowding, overpayment, or living in substandard housing.
   The high prevalence of housing problems among lower income large
   families is due to the housing market. Pasadena, like many communities,
   has relatively fewer apartments with three or more bedrooms that can
   reasonably accommodate children. Because of this, family apartments are
   quite expensive. According to Bevin & Brock and REALFACTS surveys, a
   three-bedroom unit rents for $1,800 to $2,800 a month, which is affordable
   to only moderate or above moderate income households.
                                                                        CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    A-19

Housing Needs
                                  Housing Accommodations
                                  The City of Pasadena recognizes the importance of addressing the needs of
                                  families and has adopted a policy statement on youth, children, and families.
                                  Adopted by City Council, a key objective of this policy is to increase the
                                  supply of adequate and affordable housing for families with children.
                                  Pasadena implements numerous housing programs (e.g., inclusionary
                                  housing, homeownership program, rental housing vouchers, etc.) that
                                  collectively provide several thousand units of affordable housing.
                                  In addition to providing or funding the provision of housing opportunities,
                                  Pasadena also provides a wide range of services for families with children.
                                  These services are available to large families, female-headed families, and
                                  single parents, but are particularly targeted for lower income families. Some
                                  are related to the provision of affordable housing, while others include
                                  childcare, transportation, parks and recreation, and related support services.
   Orange Grove Apartments        With respect to affordable housing, Pasadena offers the following housing
                                  options for families, which are summarized in Table A-15.
                                    Affordable Apartments. According to City records, Pasadena has 34
                                     assisted apartment projects providing approximately 1,012 units of housing
                                     affordable to lower and moderate income families. The City’s IHO has been
                                     the primary vehicle to create new housing
                                    Townhomes/Single-Family Homes. Although fewer in numbers, the City
                                     has supported the construction and rehabilitation of townhomes for
                                     families in Pasadena, including 200 homeownership loans to families deed
                                     restricted to low and moderate income households.
                                    Housing Vouchers. Housing choice vouchers are provided to families
                                     renting housing in Pasadena. This includes 740 eligible family households
                                     (ranging in size from 1 to 5 or more residents) earning low or very low
                                     incomes and 241 vouchers for female-headed households with children.

DISABLED PEOPLE
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities are impairments that
substantially limit life activities and make it difficult to care for oneself.
Because of that, disabled persons have special needs for accessible housing.
The Census Bureau defines a disability as a long-lasting physical, mental, or
emotional condition that makes it difficult for a person to do activities such as
walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering.
Pasadena has 13,110 disabled residents, 10% of residents (ACS 2009–2011).
The major categories of disabilities are listed below. It should be noted that
many individuals have multiple disabilities; therefore, these totals should not
necessarily be added together.
  With a hearing difficulty: 3,359 (2%)
  With a vision difficulty: 2,633 (2%)
  With a cognitive difficulty: 5,293 (4%)                                               United Celebral Palsy Housing
  With an ambulatory difficulty: 7,566 (6%)
  With a self-care difficulty: 3,749 (3%)
  With an independent living difficulty: 6,105 (4%)
Physical Disability
The vast majority of Pasadena residents will at some time experience a
physical disability. Injury, illness or simply advanced age will limit an
individual’s physical ability to perform work, read, and eventually care for
themselves. For those living in single-family homes, residents can benefit
from wider doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms with grab
bars, lowered countertops, and other features common to “barrier-free”
housing. Location is also important for disabled people because they often
rely on public transit to travel to services like grocers or medical offices.
To assist physically disabled individual live in the community, the City of
Pasadena implements a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance that is
designed to offer flexibility in municipal code requirements to expand
opportunities for people to build and rent housing that is accessible to
people with disabilities. The City also offers housing rehabilitation assistance
that can be used to modify the exterior and interior of housing units to allow
greater access and mobility for residents. The MASH program also assists
disabled residents modify their homes to increase accessibility.
In 1991, shortly after the ADA become effective, Pasadena established the
Accessibility and Disability Commission to serve as an advisory body to the
City Council. Members represent a cross-section of the City's disability groups
and include persons with professional experience in the field of disability. The
commission studies issues and recommends access improvements to assist
those with disabilities in the community and advance the priority of keeping
Pasadena a barrier-free community for people with disabilities.

Housing Needs
                                Developmental Disabilities
                                According to the Lanterman Regional Center, Pasadena has 846 residents
                                with developmental disabilities. These disabilities include cerebral palsy,
                                autism, mental retardation, epilepsy, and other similar conditions that begin
                                early in life. Of this total, 378 live with a parent or guardian, 339 reside in a
                                community care facility, and the rest live in an independent, non-
                                institutionalized setting. These numbers include only those served by the
                                Regional Center, so the total affected population is likely higher.
                                Many developmentally disabled people can live and work independently
                                within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled
                                individuals may require group quarters where supervision is provided or
                                where medical needs and physical therapy are provided. However, because
                                developmental disabilities occur before adulthood, the first issue in
                                supportive housing is to transition from the person’s living situation at home
                                to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
                                Many agencies in Pasadena work in tandem to provide housing, education,
                                and services for disabled people in Pasadena. Ability First operates its Work
                                Center, through which 60 developmental disabled adults are employed. The
                                City also works with Ability First to provide an adaptive recreation programs.
                                Villa Esperanza provides education services for 65 children and youth at its
                                Pasadena campus as well as operates nine homes in Pasadena. Homes for Life
                                Foundation is also quite active, managing three homes as well.
                                Mental Health/Substance Abuse
                                According to the National Institutional of Mental Health, an estimated one in
                                four adults—suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year. Even
                                though mental disorders are widespread, the main burden of illness is
                                typically concentrated in a much smaller proportion—or 1 in 17 people—who
                                suffer from a serious mental illness. A smaller percentage of those with severe
                                mental illness have difficulty maintaining adequate and affordable housing.
                                People with mental illnesses face multiple problems when looking for decent,
                                affordable housing. People with serious and persistent mental illnesses often
                                live in poverty, have unstable employment, and are unable to afford decent
                                housing. This group may also require support services to live successfully in
                                the community. Financial and housing resources available for those
                                experiencing severe mental illness or for those caring for such individuals are
                                limited, and NIMBY concerns are also present in every community.
                                According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, one in
                                four people may also have an alcohol or drug problem sometime in their life.
                                Although many of these issues will be episodic rather than chronic, substance
                                abuse can affect the ability to secure and maintain employment, housing, and
                                productive relationships. The appropriate housing option is largely
                                dependent on the severity of condition, but can include long-term residential
                                care, short-term rehabilitation facilities, or services independent of housing.

Housing Accommodations
Pasadena’s housing vision is consistent with the ADA legislation to facilitate
the most integrated setting appropriate for people with disabilities to reside,
receive services, and participate in community life. The City's strategy for
addressing the various needs of people with disabilities is centered on three
core goals: independence, productivity, and integration.
Pasadena’s housing options for disabled people are described below.
  Residential Care Facilities. These facilities serve persons ages 18 to 59
   who may be physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or
   mentally disabled. Pasadena provides 48 facilities serving 565 adults. A
   smaller number of facilities (two) serve children with disabilities.
  Specialized Housing Facilities. The City has funded the development of
   affordable housing projects that are dedicated solely for occupancy by
   people with a disability. These include housing for people with physical,
   mental, or developmental disabilities.
  Housing Vouchers. Pasadena allocates 100 vouchers for non-elderly
   disabled people under its NED program. An additional 879 housing choice
   vouchers are used by households with a disabled member to rent
   apartments in Pasadena where a housing voucher is accepted.
  Substance Abuse/Mental Illness. These facilities are California licensed
   facilities providing residential stays for people who are recovering from

                                HOMELESS PEOPLE
                                Pasadena has a significant number of people who are homeless. Homeless
                                persons are defined as those who lack a fixed and adequate residence. People
                                who are homeless may be chronically homeless (perhaps due to substance
                                abuse) or situationally homeless resulting from job loss, family strife,
                                incarceration, or violence. Homeless people face critical housing challenges
                                due to their very low incomes and lack of appropriate housing. Thus, state law
                                requires cities to plan to help meet the needs of their homeless population.
                                Counting the homeless population is problematic due to their transient
                                nature, different definitions of homelessness, and political and funding issues.
                                According to the 2013 Pasadena Homeless survey, the City has 772 homeless
                                people at the peak season when the bad weather shelter is open. Since many
                                homeless people migrate to Pasadena during inclement weather to use the
                                shelter, the permanent resident homeless population is approximately 602
                                homeless people. For planning purposes, it is important to note the total
                                number of homeless people during peak season has declined 36% since 2011.
                                The 2013 Homeless Count also surveyed the composition of homeless people.
                                Of the total population sheltered and unsheltered population, 653 are adults
                                (more than 90% are single adults) and 119 are children. As in past counts,
                                men outnumbered women two to one. Blacks comprised the largest share
                                (36%), followed closely by Whites (33%), and Latinos (22%). The decline is
                                attributable to a number of reasons, including the efforts of the City and
                                Pasadena Housing and Homeless Network to implement its Housing First
                                approach and develop over 100 units of permanent supportive housing.
                                The 2013 Homeless Count also revealed pressing needs of people who are
                                homeless. For the unsheltered adult population, key needs include:
                                 Mental Illness. In Pasadena, approximately 17% of homeless adults
                                  reported a substance abuse problem, and 26% were diagnosed with
                                  mental or emotional health problems. In some cases, ongoing medication
                                  and treatment are necessary until the underlying condition is stabilized.
                                 Physical Illness/Disability. Prior surveys documented that about 28% of
                                  homeless adults surveyed reported a disability that impairs such activities
                                  as walking, eating, breathing, reading, etc. These conditions would also
                                  affect the ability to secure and maintain employment.
                                 Life Experiences. People who are homeless have significant negative life
                                  experiences that are associated with their homelessness. For instance,
                                  approximately 9% of homeless people surveyed were veterans, 19%
                                  experienced domestic violence, and 14% were released from jail.
                                These are just a few of the many subtleties and complexities of conditions
                                facing homeless adults and children, which require a tailored approach for
                                providing the right type of housing options and an appropriate service mix.

Housing Accommodations
Pasadena is adopting components of a “Housing First” approach to
addressing the housing and supportive needs of its homeless population.
Under this model, non-chronic and chronic homeless individuals and families
are immediately transitioned into housing and provided wrap-around
services to ensure longer-term housing stability. This is contrasted with a
“housing readiness” model that focuses on individuals successfully
addressing substance abuse or mental health issues or “graduating” through
case management in a shelter/transitional home to become “housing ready.”
Although the City’s preference is for rapid reentry into permanent housing,
Pasadena recognizes that a full continuum of housing options is needed to
meet the needs of homeless people at various stages of recovery. The
following housing options are provided in Pasadena for homeless people.
                                                                                                   Family Center Facility
    Emergency Shelter. Several year-round shelters in Pasadena provide
     housing and case management to prepare residents to obtain and
     maintain housing. The City of Pasadena also has 242 shelter beds
     available during inclement weather.
    Residential Rehabilitation. A residence that provides housing for up to
     six months and provides specialized treatment and active rehabilitation
     for alcoholism and other drug-related issues on-site.
    Rapid Re-housing. This refers to an approach of moving chronically
     homeless people immediately off the street to permanent supportive
     housing that allows an environment conducive to stabilization.                                 Euclid Villa Project
    Transition Housing. A residence that provides a stay of up to two years,
     during which residents are provided case management services that
     prepare them to obtain and maintain housing and live self-sufficiently.
    Permanent Supportive Housing. A residence that provides permanent
     housing linked with ongoing support services designed to allow
     residents to live at the place of residence on an indefinite basis.
Table A-17 summarizes the City’s housing options for homeless people.
Currently, the City’s unmet need is to house 393 people during the peak
winter months, which equates to 326 households.

                                   COLLEGE STUDENTS
                                   The City of Pasadena is home to four major colleges—Pasadena City College,
                                   Fuller Theological Seminary, Art Center College of Design, and Caltech—that
                                   collectively enroll 35,000 students. Numerous smaller private schools and
                                   colleges for children and youth are also in Pasadena. Because educational
                                   institutions play an important role in the history, economy, and community
                                   life of the City, it is important to ensure that the significant housing needs of
                                   current and future students, faculty, and employees are addressed.
                                   Pasadena City College
                                   Pasadena City College (PCC) is a two-year post-secondary educational
                                   institution for transfer to four-year colleges. PCC enrolls approximately 30,000
                                   students as of 2012. In keeping with the mission of community colleges
                                   throughout California, PCC does not provide student housing. However,
                                   because a significant number of PCC students live in Pasadena, it impacts the
                                   availability of rental housing for residents, particularly around the college.
  Fuller Seminary Housing          Faculty members, although smaller in number, may seek homeownership
                                   opportunities in Pasadena or adjacent communities near PCC.
                                   Fuller Seminary
                                   Fuller Theological Seminary is one of the largest interdenominational
                                   seminaries in the country. It has a current enrollment of 1,700 students and is
                                   anticipating increasing enrollment to a maximum of 2,014 students by 2019.
                                   Fuller Theological Seminary updated its Master Plan in 2006 to accommodate
                                   future expansion plans. According to its approved Master Development Plan,
                                   Fuller Seminary will increase its housing stock by 514 apartment units and
                                   renovate a 92-unit apartment. Since 2006, Fuller Seminary has built a 179-unit
                                   apartment project for families and anticipates 335 more units by 2019.
                                   California Institute of Technology
                                   Founded in 1889, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is one of the
                                   foremost institutes of higher education in the nation. Its 124-acre campus
                                   enrolls a total of 2,250 students. Caltech provides housing for 95% of its
                                   undergraduate students and 50% of its graduate students in either on-
                                   campus housing or university-owned off-campus housing. Caltech updated
                                   its Master Development Plan (MDP) in 2006. Funded with a $25 million
                                   donation, Caltech is considering alternative plans for constructing a new
                                   dormitory facility to house all the undergraduates attending the college.
                                   Art Center College of Design
                                   Founded in 1930, the Art Center College of Design has two campuses in
                                   Pasadena with an enrollment estimated at about 1,850 students in 2012. In
                                   2006, the Art Center updated its long-range Master Development Plan, which
                                   included plans to add student housing through 2016. The college currently
                                   does not have on-campus housing. Although student population is not
                                   anticipated to grow significantly, the Art Center College can build 175
                                   housing units / 334 beds for current and future students.

Housing Accommodations
Student housing needs vary depending on whether the student lives at
home, commutes from outside the City, or seeks rental housing in Pasadena.
Those living in Pasadena create a heightened demand for apartments and
rentals around local colleges and influence the rental market. Typically, the
need is for rental apartments affordable to lower or moderate income
households or SRO units that fit the budget and lifestyle needs of students.
The exceptionally large number of educational institutions in Pasadena also
creates a demand for affordable housing for faculty members.
Housing available for students typically falls into three categories, depending
on the household size, cost, and function. These are:
   Student Housing. Student housing includes group housing for students.
    Rooms are intended for single or dual occupancy by unrelated students.
    These types of units may also include single-room occupancy units.
   Family Housing. Includes apartments or single-family homes typically
    reserved for married students with or without children. Often these units
    are reserved for graduate-level students.
   Faculty Housing. Includes housing, often owned or leased by a college, for
    sole use by employees, faculty employed at the respective institution, or
    visiting employees.
Pasadena encourages the construction of university or privately owned
housing that serves students and faculty (e.g., single room occupancy,
dormitories, single-family homes, etc.). These types of housing are allowed by
right in the RM-32, RM-48, and CL zoning districts and allowed conditionally
in the PS zoning district. However, the City’s efforts have focused on working
with colleges to provide for onsite and offsite housing. Table A-18
summarizes the current and planned enrollment of each of the major
educational institutions in Pasadena and their respective housing stock.

                                Pasadena has a large population of youth in or aging out of the foster care
                                system (emancipated youth). Because of their difficult upbringing, foster
                                children need housing and a higher level of supportive services related to
                                education, employment, mental health, and other issues. Addressing the
                                needs of foster youth are critical, as it is well documented that up to one-third
                                of all homeless people spent some time in the foster care system.
                                The Census Bureau does not provide estimates of the number of transitional
                                youth living in Pasadena. Statewide studies of foster youth indicate that 50%
                                of California’s foster youth live in Los Angeles County. Many foster youth also
                                live in Pasadena. Studies undertaken by the Casey Foundation found that the
                                majority of foster youth do not originally come from Pasadena, but are
                                instead being served at various rehabilitation facilities.
                                Addressing the needs of at-risk youth raises several challenges to help them
                                become more housing ready and able to secure employment:
                                  Social Capital. At-risk youth, on average, have less income and personal
                                   assets than youth from stable homes. This often includes the lack of a high
                                   school diploma or GED, insufficient employment skills or experience,
                                   and/or limited independent living skills.
                                  Family Safety Net. Once youth leave the foster care system, they tend to
                                   have limited social supports, such as parental supervision or support,
                                   financial means, or other safety nets that would enable them to withstand
                                   periods of unemployment or housing instability.
                                  Financial Security. In order to secure housing, landlords will evaluate an
                                   applicant based on employment history, credit, and income, and clean
                                   juvenile record. Former foster care children often cannot meet one or more
                                   of these qualifications, making it difficult to secure housing.
                                  Personal Health. Foster children also tend to have higher prevalence of
                                   personal health needs. This may include ongoing services to address
                                   mental health concerns, physical health, or other conditions. These
                                   conditions make it challenging to adjust to an independent lifestyle.
                                The benefits of safe and secure housing for foster care youth and for those
                                who have or will emancipate from foster care are often overlooked. The
                                benefits of stable housing extend well beyond basic safety and shelter needs.
                                Stable housing has been viewed as a necessary “platform” or foundation for
                                achieving other positive outcomes across a range of necessary domains—
                                educational achievement, employment, physical health, and mental health.
                                This is particularly the case during the tenuous transition to adulthood
                                because of the relationship of housing to self-sufficiency and independence.

Housing Accommodations
Meeting the full range of housing and supportive service needs for foster
youth requires a comprehensive, multifaceted, and flexible strategy. This
strategy should focus on providing residential care facilities where needed for
younger youth and those requiring intensive on-site treatment in a group
setting, supporting independent living services or centers to support youth,
and providing realistic and attainable housing options for youth once they
become of age and will transition out of the foster care system.
The following and Table A-19 summarize several larger organizations that
provide housing and support services for children in Pasadena.
  Residential Care. A sizable number of residential care facilities for foster
   youth are located in Pasadena and Altadena. These include, but are not
   limited to the following organizations: Five Acres, Hillsides, Rosemary’s
   Children, Sycamore/Hathaways, and Hestia House.
  Transitional Housing. Hillsides operate an apartment building in Pasadena
   that offers housing accommodations for 28 emancipated foster youth.
   Several of the organizations provide group homes off-site to help facilitate
   transition to independent living. Hestia House is also in the community and
   offers 8 beds in a group home setting. These are the only housing options.
  Support Services. Pasadena is home to numerous support services for
   foster care youth. Some of the few examples include the Pasadena Alumni
   Support Center, Journey House, Youth Moving on Peer Resource Center,
   Bienvenidos, and other organizations. All Saints Church also provides
   community education, advocacy, and services to enhance the lives of
   foster, homeless, transitional, and incarcerated children and youth
Despite these services, there exists a significant gap in housing
accommodations for foster care youth once they leave the foster care system.

Housing Needs
                                HOUSING CONSTRUCTION NEEDS
                                California law requires cities to plan for the accommodation of population
                                and employment growth by implementing responsive housing programs. To
                                assist in that effort, the Southern California Association of Governments
                                (SCAG) prepares housing construction needs goals for each city as part of the
                                Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). Total housing construction
                                need comprises three primary factors, described below.
                                Population and Job Growth
                                The first component of construction need represents the number of units
                                needed to accommodate new households forming as a result of population
                                and employment growth. Pasadena’s housing need is based on SCAG’s
                                regional growth forecast adopted in the 2012 Regional Transportation Plan,
                                with slight adjustments for the RHNA. The household growth component is
                                determined by calculating the expected population and employment growth
                                that will occur in Pasadena from 2014 to 2021.
                                  Population Growth. The City’s population is expected to increase by about
                                   8,000 residents from 2014 to 2021. This growth will gradually occur as
                                   development projects are approved, completed, and occupied.
                                  Employment Growth. Employment levels are projected to continue
                                   modest growth, increasing by about 8,000 jobs from 2010 through 2021.
                                   Employment growth is centered within the greater downtown.
                                  Household Growth. As a result of population growth, the number of
                                   households is expected to increase by approximately 3,300 households
                                   from 2014 to 2021 based on average household size.
                                Housing Factors
                                The RHNA goal for new construction incorporates additional units to
                                accommodate two factors in the housing market. First, the housing market
                                requires a certain number of vacant units to allow sufficient choice for
                                consumers, maintain rents and prices at adequate levels, and encourage
                                normal housing maintenance and repair. In the southern California region,
                                SCAG assumed a regional housing vacancy factor of 3.5%, which assumes a
                                1.5% ownership vacancy and 4.5% rental vacancy.
                                The RHNA model also adjusts the construction need goal to replace housing
                                units lost from residential uses. Over time, all cities can expect that a certain
                                number of housing units will be lost due to demolition, fire, conversion to
                                nonresidential uses, recycling to other uses, or a variety of other reasons. In
                                Pasadena, the demolition rate is typically one unit for every ten new units.
                                Therefore, SCAG adjusts the City’s housing production goals by a standard
                                “replacement factor,” which is based on the historical rate of residential units
                                that are lost to demolition/other uses in the community.

Fair Share Factor
State law requires that the formula used to distribute the RHNA avoid over-
concentration of income groups in any given community. The goal is to use
the RHNA process to foster the production of an increasing supply and mix of
housing types, tenure, and affordability in an equitable manner across the
region. In practice, the idea is to require jurisdictions with a smaller
proportion of lower income units to provide a larger share of lower income
units as part of their construction need to compensate for other jurisdictions
that already accommodate more than their fair share.
SCAG adopted a regional “fair share” policy that each community move 110%
toward the respective county’s household income distribution in each
income category. So if a particular jurisdiction has a higher or lower
percentage of lower, moderate, or above moderate income households than
the County as a whole, the new construction goal is adjusted accordingly. For
communities still growing, this will tend to reduce the differences in
household income distributions among communities in the region. The
Southern California of Association of Governments provides a website with
greater detail on the calculations for the Regional Housing Needs formula.
Regional Housing Needs Share
With the above criteria in mind, the City of Pasadena has a regional housing
needs allocation (RHNA) of 1,332 units for the 2014–2021 planning period.
The RHNA also determines the number of units by household income and
level of affordability as follows: 170 housing units each affordable to
extremely low and very low income households, 207 housing units affordable
for low income households, 224 housing units affordable for moderate
income households, and 561 units affordable for above moderate income
households. These housing targets are summarized below in Table A-20.

Housing Needs
                                 4. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT
                                 RISK OF CONVERSION
                                 Publicly subsidized affordable housing provides the largest supply of
                                 affordable housing in most communities. The City of Pasadena has a
                                 significant number of affordable housing units that receive public subsidies in
                                 return for long-term affordability controls. Typically, these residential projects
                                 provide units affordable to extremely low, very low, and low income
                                 households, including persons with special needs. Over time, certain
                                 affordable housing units are eligible to change from lower income housing to
                                 market rate housing within the planning period.
                                 California law requires that all housing elements include an analysis of
                                 “assisted multi-family housing” projects as to their eligibility to change from
                                 low income housing to market rates. At-risk units are multi-family rental
                                 housing projects that receive federal, state, and/or local financial assistance
   Hudson Oaks Senior Housing    and that may change from low income to market rate rents by 2024. If units
                                 are at risk, the element must include a detailed inventory and analysis.
                                 The inventory must list:
                                   Each development by project name and address
                                   Type of governmental assistance received
                                   Earliest possible date of change from low-income use
                                   Total elderly and nonelderly units that could be converted
                                   An analysis of costs of preserving and/or replacing these units
                                   Resources that could be used to preserve the at-risk units
                                   Program for preservation of at-risk units and quantified objectives
                                 A percentage of the City’s affordable housing is due to the IHO program, and
                                 these units are guaranteed to be affordable in perpetuity. However, the
                                 majority of assisted affordable housing units are not guaranteed to remain
                                 affordable indefinitely. The reasons why publicly assisted housing might
                                 convert to market rate include expiring subsidies, mortgage prepayments,
                                 and expiration of affordability restrictions. This represents a significant
                                 concern to residents. Affordable housing is most likely to convert to market
                                 rents during inflationary times when market rents escalate and create a
                                 financial incentive. Low vacancy rates and the recent upturn in the housing
                                 market therefore will place pressure on owners to convert their properties.

                                 have received public assistance and are deed restricted as affordable.

AT-RISK STATUS
Pasadena has nine publicly assisted, family apartment projects with 160 deed
restricted affordable units that could come up for renewal by 2024. Four
senior apartment projects providing 436 deed-restricted units affordable for
very low income seniors could also be up for renewal by 2024. Taken
together, 13 projects and 596 units are at risk of converting from low income
uses, although the more realistic number would be less given that many are
managed by nonprofit entities dedicated to affordable housing.
The cost to preserve the at-risk units is derived from industry cost standards
from large jurisdictions with substantial experience in preserving affordable
housing deed restricted for very low and low income households. It also takes
into account recent projects built and rehabilitated in Pasadena. The cost of
the rental subsidy is determined by the difference of the amount of rent a
very low income household can afford and the market rent for an older
apartment multiplied by a 50-year affordability term.
The cost ranges from $89 to $132 million to preserve all the projects. Given
the high cost of traditional preservation methods, many cities have found it
more beneficial to financially assist in the transfer of the project to another
owner, who is then able to secure tax credits, or alternatively the City can
offer rental rehabilitation loans that would extend covenants. In the case of
the Kings Village Apartments, the City was able to commit $1.7 million, along
with a low income tax credit, to preserve the project at a fraction of the cost.
Table A-22 provides a summary of cost estimates for preserving Pasadena’s
596 multiple-family units at risk of conversion to market rents. Resources to
preserve these units are discussed at the end of Appendix C.

B. Constraint Analysis
Appendix B contains an analysis of potential market, governmental, and
environmental constraints to the production, maintenance, and improvement
of housing for persons of all income levels, including persons with disabilities.
INTRODUCTION
Decent, suitable, and affordable housing is an important goal in Pasadena.
Pasadena has a variety of housing needs due to changing demographics,
rising housing costs, socioeconomic conditions, and various other factors. The
City and its civic leaders recognize the challenge of providing sufficient
housing opportunities and take great care to address them. However, the
City’s success in achieving its housing goals is not unlimited.
Market factors, including land costs, increase the cost of housing
construction. Governmental regulations, although designed to maintain
quality of life, can also increase housing construction costs. Beyond normal
market and government factors, the City’s success in addressing its housing
needs are also constrained by many factors well beyond its control, such as
the economic climate, lending industry, and foreclosures.
To that end, California law requires a housing element to identify and analyze
potential and actual governmental and nongovernmental constraints to the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing (Section
65583[a][4][5]). This section analyzes three potential constraints:
  Market Factors. The demand for housing; development costs, fees, and
   taxes charged for housing projects; availability of financing; the price of
   land; and other factors that increase the cost of housing reinvestment.
  Governmental Regulations. Land use regulations, building codes, site
   improvements, fees and other exactions, local processing and permit
   procedures, and other regulations that raise the cost of development.
  Environmental Factors. The adequacy of infrastructure, water, air quality,
   and public services to support new residential developments, and other
   environmental considerations that affect housing investment.
State law requires the housing element to demonstrate efforts to remove
governmental constraints to meeting the RHNA and address the need for
housing for persons with disabilities (Section 65584[a][4]). If constraints
preclude achievement of housing goals, state law requires jurisdictions to
address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing
for persons of all incomes, including persons with disabilities.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT B-1

Constraint Analysis
                                 1.        MARKET CONSTRAINTS
                                 Pasadena, like many communities, has seen a dramatic decline in the number
                                 of new housing units built. This decline in housing construction is due to a
                                 convergence of factors—including tighter lending policies, declining home
                                 values, foreclosures, and cost of materials. This section analyzes the impact of
                                 these “market” factors on the development of housing in Pasadena.
                                 DEVELOPMENT COSTS
                                 Development costs include the whole range of costs incurred in the
                                 construction, maintenance, and improvement of housing. These include
                                 construction costs, which include labor costs, and the cost of residential land.
                                 The cost and availability of financing are also included, since they affect the
                                 construction industry and the financial feasibility of building new residential
                                 projects. The availability and cost of financing also affect the ability of
                                 homeowners to secure a loan to purchase or improve a home.
                                 Construction Costs
                                 Construction costs are largely a function of building materials and labor costs.
                                 Labor costs can significantly increase construction costs, depending on
                                 whether union or non-union labor is used. For affordable projects funded by
                                 the City, state law requires the payment of prevailing wages, increasing labor
                                 costs 20% to 30% in southern California. However, to mitigate the impact of
                                 increasing labor costs on affordable housing, state law exempts certain
                                 projects from paying prevailing wages—projects using low-income housing
                                 tax credits and tax-exempt bonds where no other subsidy is used.
                                 Construction costs also vary widely depending on the type of construction
                                 and parking requirements. For instance, wood-frame Type 5 construction
                                 over concrete parking is substantially less expensive than steel-frame
                                 construction exceeding five stories over subterranean parking. According to
                                 pro formas of several affordable residential projects reviewed by City staff,
                                 direct construction costs averaged $200 to $300 per square foot for projects.
                                 These costs are higher than some jurisdictions, but nonetheless are standard
                                 for Pasadena and have not served as a disincentive for developers.
                                 An appropriate modification in amenities and quality of building materials
                                 used in residential products can result in lower development costs. As part of
                                 Pasadena’s inclusionary housing program, the City allows off-site affordable
                                 units to be built with modified materials and different features and interior
                                 finishes than market rate units, provided all project units are comparable in
                                 construction quality and exterior design. Another factor related to
                                 construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As the project size
                                 increases, builders are able to take advantage of economies of scale and build
                                 projects at a lower per unit cost compared to smaller projects.

Land Costs
The cost and availability of land for residential development can represent a
significant market constraint to the production of new housing in Pasadena.
The lack of readily developable vacant land, combined with a strong housing
market, means that land is quite expensive to acquire for new development.
Other factors influencing land prices in the City include the costs associated
with clearing existing structures, potential costs of relocating existing uses,
the assembly of multiple parcels under different ownership, and
environmental remediation costs when developing in commercial areas.
City staff compiled a dozen land sales transactions associated with multi-
family development projects applying for plan check to assess land costs.
Shown in Table B-1, residential land in Pasadena varied 25% in price, from $59
to $79 per square foot among higher density districts. When factoring in the
number of units built, land costs declined from $80,000 per unit in the RM-32
district to $71,000 per unit in the RM-48 district to a low of $34,600 per unit in
the Central District. This supports the notion that higher allowable densities
tend to result in lower per unit land costs, all other things being equal.

Access to Financing
Changes in construction lending practices have also had a significant impact
on the financial feasibility of building new housing. In past decades, housing
developers could receive construction loans for 100% or more of a project's
estimated future value. After the boom period of the early to mid-2000s and
ensuing plummet in the housing market, financial institutions tightened
regulations for approving construction. Loan underwriting has grown more
conservative, with maximum leveraging topping out at 75%.
Lenders dramatically increased the amount of equity contribution needed to
secure a loan, up from 10% to nearly 30%. Although there is no hard
threshold for how much up-front cash equity is too much before a project
would be deemed infeasible (or at least unattractive compared to other
investment opportunities), the higher the proportion of equity required, the
more unlikely a developer will proceed with the project. Not only would it
require more up-front cash, but higher equity contribution means a project
must be able to achieve an even higher value at completion in order to
generate the cash flow needed to meet acceptable cash-on-cash returns.

                                 The economic downturn also impacted the financing for affordable housing,
                                 such as Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. LIHTCs provide affordable
                                 housing developers an allocation of tax credits, which are sold to investors to
                                 raise equity for projects. Investors that purchase tax credits are able to reduce
                                 their federal tax liability dollar for dollar, so that the purchase of $1,000 in tax
                                 credits reduces tax liability by $1,000. Because of the tax breaks, a developer
                                 can build or acquire projects with less debt, enabling them to make the
                                 housing more affordable. LIHTC projects collapsed following the market bust
                                 in 2006/2007, but have picked up considerably in the past few years.
                                 The City has a long history of providing quality affordable housing through
                                 new construction, rehabilitation, and homeowner and renter assistance.
                                 However, the financial crisis that affected the nation and California also had a
                                 dramatic impact on the City’s ability to address local housing needs.
                                 Historically, Pasadena benefitted from a robust housing boom that generated
                                 significant revenues for the production of affordable housing. On the heels of
                                 a poor economy, Governor Brown appropriated millions of redevelopment
                                 funds that had been used to eliminate blight, stimulate economic
                                 development, and finance affordable housing in Pasadena.
                                 Shown in Figure B-1, the three top sources of housing funds topped $8
                                 million in 2006. Since then, fees have plummeted 85% to just over $1 million.
                                 Although building activity is beginning to recover for the first time in years,
                                 the City may never have the revenues it once had for affordable housing.

                                                                                             Constraint Analysis
FEES, TAXES, AND EXACTIONS
Pasadena charges fees to recover the cost for processing planning reviews
and approvals, building permits, design reviews, and other services. In
addition, development impact fees are assessed to ensure that infrastructure,
public services, and facilities have adequate capacity to accommodate the
demands placed upon them by new residential development. The
Government Code allows such fees provided the fee amount approximates
the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service and has a reasonable
relationship to the infrastructure costs associated with a proposed project.
Primary fees charged for new residential development include:
 Planning and Environment Fees. The City charges standard fees for
  environmental services, planning services, design review, public works plan
  checks, and other services. For projects containing housing units affordable
  to low and moderate income households, Pasadena can grant a waiver of
  up to $125,000 of plan check and building permit fees.
 Residential Impact Fee. Adopted in 1988, this fee mitigates impacts to the
  City’s park and facilities system. The fee is based on the number of
  bedrooms, but is estimated at $19,478 for a two-bedroom unit. For projects
  containing onsite affordable housing, developers are charged only $861
  per affordable unit, and the fee is reduced 30% for all other units.
 Transportation Fees. In 2006, City Council adopted the Traffic Reduction
  and Transportation Improvement Fee to mitigate a project’s impact to the
  City’s transportation system. The impact fee is $2,729 per net housing unit,
  with units demolished as part of the project credited against the fee. The
  City offers a 100% fee waiver for affordable units built on-site.
 Construction Tax. The City charges a construction tax of approximately
  1.92% of the project valuation. This equates to an average of $3,000 per
  dwelling unit. For projects containing housing units affordable to low and
  moderate income households, Pasadena can grant a waiver of up to
  $125,000 of plan check, building permit fees, and construction tax.
 Water and Sewer. The City charges developers a fixed rate of $1,700 per
  unit for sewer connections. In 2012, the City Council approved a full-cost
  recovery policy for new water services based on the actual cost of service.
  Based on a sample of projects, the fee averaged $3,100 per unit for multi-
  family projects and up to $9,000 for a single-family unit.
 Inclusionary Fee. In accordance with the inclusionary housing program, a
  developer can build the required units or pay an in lieu fee. The in-lieu fee
  varies by four subareas of Pasadena and ranges from $1 to $32 per square
  foot for rental projects and $15 to $56 per square foot for owner units. This
  typically averages out to be approximately $20,000 to $30,000 per unit.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT      B-5

Constraint Analysis
                                 Assessment of Fees
                                 As a means of evaluating the impact that development fees contribute to the
                                 cost of building housing in Pasadena, the City calculated the average fees for
                                 six townhome projects, a mixed-income apartment project subject to
                                 inclusionary requirements, a mixed-use project with limited moderate income
                                 inclusionary units, and a 100% affordable project. Inclusionary in-lieu buy out
                                 fees were estimated based on projects in the Central District and RM-48 zone.
                                 As indicated below in Table B-2, all of the fees, collectively, can range
                                 between $60,000 to $70,000 per unit for residential and mixed use projects.
                                 Taken alone, residential development fees are much higher than in
                                 surrounding cities. Based on standard construction costs (excluding land) for
                                 projects in Pasadena, development fees comprise 21% of the cost of housing
                                 construction costs. However, the fees are reasonable when taking into
                                 account the high cost of new construction and achievable sales prices and
                                 rents, which are considerably higher than neighboring cities. City fees are
                                 only 4% of the construction cost of 100% affordable rental projects. This
                                 shows how the City incentivizes the construction of affordable housing.
                                 It also should be noted that the fees alone present an incomplete picture.
                                 Most affordable housing projects also receive density bonuses, which allow
                                 significantly higher densities that add additional revenue for a project.

2.          LAND USE CONTROLS
Pasadena implements a variety of regulations that affect land uses and the
cost and supply of housing. These include land use controls, building codes
and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and exactions, permit
procedures, and others. This section discusses these governmental factors
and whether they unduly constrain the provision of housing in Pasadena.
GENERAL PLAN LAND USE
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term
general plan to guide its future. The land use element of the general plan
establishes the basic land uses and density of development within the various
areas of the city. Under state law, the general plan elements must be
internally consistent, and the City’s zoning must be consistent with the
general plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable locations and
densities to implement the policies of the housing element.
Pasadena’s comprehensive general plan is the blueprint for the growth and
development of the community. It provides for five residential land use
designations tailored to different locations and topography in the City. High
density residential uses are allowed in several commercial designations to
support the City’s business sector and provide a mixed-use, urban living
environment in specific areas of the community. Table B-3 below describes
the primary general plan land use designations allowing housing.

Constraint Analysis
                                 SPECIFIC PLAN LAND USE
                                 In addition to the primary residential and commercial districts, the General
                                 Plan establishes seven specific plan areas. These areas are designed to
                                 accommodate higher density residential uses ranging from a density of 32 to
                                 87 units per acre, with variations based on location and adjacent commercial
                                 and residential uses. Development standards within the plans vary depending
                                 on the location of the district and proximity to transit or activity nodes.
                                 The Pasadena General Plan allows for a net addition of about 8,700 higher
                                 density market-rate units within the eight specific plan areas. However, to
                                 ensure that development limits do not discourage the production of
                                 affordable housing, the general plan exempts the following from the specific
                                 plan caps: 1) low and moderate income ownership units (except in the
                                 northwest planning area; 2) low income rental units; and 3) affordable and
                                 market rate senior housing. Table B-4 summarizes each specific plan area.

RESIDENTIAL USES BY ZONE
California housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify
adequate sites to be made available through appropriate zoning and
development standards to encourage and facilitate the development of
various types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This
includes the production of housing to meet the needs of different types of
households with incomes ranging from low to above moderate. The housing
element is the City’s plan for achieving this objective.
As described later, Pasadena’s housing vision is one of inclusiveness, and is
denoted by offering a broad range of housing types that accommodate
people of all backgrounds. This includes standard conventional housing
opportunities (e.g., single-family, multi-family, and mixed-uses, etc.) and
housing opportunities for persons with special needs (e.g., disabled, seniors,
homeless, families, college students) and other groups.
The primary land use designations allowing residential uses are in Table B-5.
Following is a description of the various residential land uses.

Constraint Analysis
                                 MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING
                                 The zoning code permits multi-family housing by right in all RM districts.
                                 Factory-built housing and mobile homes are permitted in all single-family (RS)
                                 residential districts and multi-family (RM) zones. In accordance with the
                                 Government Code, the requirements for such housing (e.g., planning,
                                 permitting, reviews) are the same as residential units in the same district.
                                 Multi-family residential uses are also allowed in two commercial districts.
                                 Described below, the zoning code also permits additional types of housing.
                                 Mixed Use
                                 Pasadena’s land use framework is designed to focus housing in areas of the
                                 community that can best accommodate residential growth and reduce
                                 transportation demands. Mixed residential-commercial uses are allowed in
                                 four commercial districts and several of the City’s seven specific plan areas.
                                 Urban housing and mixed-use standards, described later, are implemented to
                                 provide greater flexibility and higher densities in these specific plan areas.
                                 The City’s strategy has successfully facilitated thousands of mixed-use units.
                                 Transit-Oriented Development
                                 In 2006, the City adopted standards to encourage transit-oriented
      Stuart Apartments          development (TOD) within one-quarter mile of a light-rail station platform,
                                 and within the greater Central District Transit-Oriented Area. TOD is defined
                                 as a development within walking distance of a major transit stop designed for
                                 pedestrians without excluding motor vehicles. TOD can be new construction
                                 or redevelopment of structures whose design and orientation facilitate transit
                                 use. Mixed-use TOD is permitted by right in commercial districts.
                                 Student Housing
                                 The City of Pasadena is home to four major colleges: Pasadena City College,
                                 Fuller Theological Seminary, Art Center College of Design, and Caltech.
                                 Numerous smaller private schools and colleges provide educational
                                 opportunities to people of all ages. Although the student population exceeds
                                 35,000, approximately 5,000 students attend four-year colleges. The zoning
                                 code allows student housing as a by-right use in higher density residential
                                 zones and several nonresidential zones. The City also works with institutions
                                 to review their Master Development Plans to include student housing.
                                 Senior Housing
                                 Pasadena has a large senior population. To allow for adequate housing
                                 opportunities, senior housing is permitted in most residential districts. In
                                 recent years the aging of Pasadena residents has created a need for additional
                                 senior housing for different age groups and abilities. In 2004, the zoning code
                                 was amended to allow life-care facilities that provide housing
                                 accommodations and varying level of care to seniors. Life-care facilities can

Second Units
Second units are detached dwelling units that provide complete independent
living facilities for one or more persons on the same parcel as a legal single-
family residence. Second units offer several benefits. First, they typically rent
for less than apartments of comparable size and can offer affordable rental
options for seniors, college students, single persons, and extended families.
Second, the primary homeowner receives supplementary income by renting
out the unit, which can help many modest income and elderly homeowners
remain in or afford their homes. Second units are allowed by right in RM-12,
RM-16, RM-32, and RM-48 districts subject to the RM-12 standards
Assembly Bill (AB) 1866 (effective July 2003) requires local governments to
use a ministerial process for second-unit applications, subject to reasonable
development standards. In 2004, City staff held four neighborhood meetings,
presented draft recommendations, and received comments regarding the
proposed ordinance. The primary concerns voiced by the public related to
additional traffic, increased density, massing of development, privacy issues,
and potential loss of neighborhood character. In consideration of this input,
the City Council adopted Section 17.50.275 of the Zoning Code to allow by-
right provision of second units in RS districts, subject to the following:
  Minimum 15,000-square-foot lot requirement.
  Owner occupancy in either the primary or second unit.
  Requirement for second unit to meet existing standards for additions to
   single-family residences and provide two covered parking spaces.
  Limit on the size of second units to 800 square feet and 17 feet in height.
  Establishment of a minimum 500-square-foot distance requirement
   between second units to avoid overconcentration.
  Limitation on the maximum number of new second units to be allowed per
   year to 20, with no more than 200 allowed within a 10-year period.
  Flexibility from development standards for the relocation of a historic home
   onto a property with an existing single-family residence.
While second units can contribute to affordable housing, it is important to
also ensure the integrity of Pasadena’s residential neighborhoods. Concerns
have been voiced about issues related to parking and traffic, affordability of
the units, and the suitability of such units in different neighborhoods.
Pasadena’s second unit ordinance is intended to allow for the development of
second dwelling units where appropriate, while maintaining and protecting
the essential character and integrity of its single-family residential districts.
While second units represent a relatively small component of Pasadena’s
overall affordable housing strategy, the City has included an implementation
program in the housing element to reevaluate the parameters of the current
ordinance to better facilitate the provision of second units within the context
of maintaining neighborhood character.

Constraint Analysis
                                 HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
                                 As described in Appendix A, the City has a sizable population of persons with
                                 disabilities that require different housing arrangements. The City permits a
                                 broad range of housing for people with disabilities and has provided financial
                                 supports for individual projects. The following describes generally how such
                                 facilities are permitted by the municipal code within the community.
                                 Residential Care Facilities
                                 The Pasadena Zoning Code designates two types of community care
                                 facilities—Residential Care Limited (serving six or fewer people) and
                                 Residential Care General (serving seven or more people). These are state-
                                 licensed facility providing 24-hour nonmedical care for persons in need of
                                 personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance essential for
                                 sustaining the activities of daily living. The zoning code permits Residential
                                 Care Limited homes by right in all residential districts and conditionally
                                 permits Residential Care General in six residential and commercial districts.
                                 Pasadena has more than 100 residential care facilities. The zoning code does
                                 not subject Residential Care Limited facilities to a use permit, building
                                 standard, or regulation not otherwise required of other residential uses in the
                                 same district, and imposes no spacing requirements between such facilities
                                 beyond those required by state law. However, due to a high concentration of
                                 uses in Northwest Pasadena, the General Plan Land Use Policy 14.5 prohibits
                                 establishing Residential Care General facilities in Northwest Pasadena. The
                                 Housing Plan proposes to amend the zoning code to allow Residential Care
                                 Limited Facilities in the CD and IG zones where residential uses are allowed.
                                 Boarding House/Group Homes
                                 The City’s Municipal Code distinguishes between licensed and unlicensed
                                 group home facilities and regulates unlicensed facilities as boarding houses.
                                 Consistent with the State Attorney General’s opinion (86 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen.
                                 30 [2003]), boarding houses are prohibited in single-family residential districts
                                 and allowed by right in all multi-family residential districts subject to the
                                 City’s operational standards. However, Title 8.19 of the Pasadena Municipal
                                 Code, “Group homes for the disabled which are not licensed by the State,”
                                 provides reasonable accommodation procedures for boarding houses for the
                                 disabled, including allowances for location in all residential districts.
                                 Group home for the disabled means any home, residence, facility, or premises
                                 that provides temporary, interim, or permanent housing to persons who are
                                 disabled in a group setting not licensed by the state of California. The City has
                                 enacted distance requirements for group homes for the disabled when it
                                 meets the definition of a boarding house and is allowed to locate in any RS,
                                 RM-12, or RM-16 district pursuant to a reasonable accommodation. The use
                                 shall not be located within 500 feet of any other boarding house or group
                                 home facility. State-licensed facilities that do not have separation
                                 requirements are not to be used in calculating the distance requirement.

HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS
Pasadena has had a proactive policy of accommodating the housing need of
people who are homeless. The following describes how the municipal code
permits such facilities in the city. Given changes in state law and HCD
guidance, the City is reviewing these provisions for consistency with state law.
Emergency Shelter
The City defines emergency shelters as those that provide short-term lodging
on a first-come, first-served basis for people who must vacate the facility each
morning and have no guaranteed lodging for the next night. Emergency
shelters may operate with a minor conditional use permit in the CG and IG
districts, the Central District, and the CG and IG districts of the East Colorado,
East Pasadena, and South Fair Oaks Specific Plans. Religious facilities may also
operate a homeless shelter for temporary stays as a by-right use in the CL and
CG districts and in portions of Central District. They may also operate a shelter
in all residential districts, CO district, and parts of the Central District.
Transition Housing
Pasadena’s zoning code defines transition housing as a facility that provides
housing for individuals in immediate need of housing in which residents stay
longer than overnight. Such housing may include support services (e.g.,                   Union Station Emergency Shelter
emergency medical care, employment, housing counseling,etc.) provided the
total area for supportive services does not exceed 250 square feet. Transition
housing is currently treated as a residential use and permitted by right in
multi-family districts, the CO and CL commercial districts, and specific plan
areas (e.g., Central District, East Colorado and East Pasadena Specific Plans).
Permanent Supportive Housing
Supportive housing refers to permanent, affordable housing linked to on-site
or off-site services. Services typically include assistance to help residents
transition into stable, more productive lives and may include case
management, mental health treatment, and life skills counseling. Pasadena
allows permanent supportive housing as a residential use, provided                         Euclid Villa Transitional Housing
supportive services are ancillary to the primary use and comprise no greater
than 250 square feet. Supportive housing, including housing suitable for
individuals living with HIV/AIDS, is also available to homeless people.
Single-Room Occupancy
The municipal code defines a Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) as a facility
where each unit has a floor area ranging from 150 to 220 square feet. SRO
units may have kitchen or bathroom facilities and are offered on a monthly
basis or longer. SROs are permitted by right in the CG zoning district. In
addition, existing nonconforming SROs in the CL zoning district are permitted
to be altered to comply with the City’s SRO development standards without
obtaining a conditional use permit. Perhaps the most notable example is the
                                                                                            Casa Maria Supportive Housing

Constraint Analysis
                                 3.         DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                                 Land use policies in the general plan are implemented primarily through the
                                 zoning code. The zoning code is designed to protect and promote the health,
                                 safety, and general welfare of residents, which includes preserving the
                                 character and integrity of established residential neighborhoods. To that end,
                                 the City has established specific development standards that apply to
                                 residential construction in various districts. These include lot coverage,
                                 density, parking standards, and other applicable requirements.
                                 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                                 Pasadena’s zoning code allows for a range of housing types and densities.
                                 Within RS districts, single-family homes with private open space are allowed
                                 from 1 to 6 lots per acre. The RM-12 and RM-16 districts allow multi-family
                                 housing at up to 16 units per acre. In Pasadena’s urban core, specific plans
                                 permit multi-family housing densities of 60 units per acre, with up to 87 units
                                 per acre permitted in portions of the Central District Specific Plan. Table B-6
                                 summarizes the most pertinent development standards in Pasadena.

PARKING STANDARDS
City parking standards are intended to progressively alleviate or prevent
traffic congestion and shortages of curbside parking spaces, ensure that
adequate off‑street parking and loading facilities are provided in proportion
to the need for the facilities created by each use, and ensure that off-street
parking and loading facilities are designed in a manner that will ensure
efficiency, protect the public safety, and, where appropriate, insulate
surrounding land uses from adverse impacts. Shown in Table B-7 are the
parking requirements for residential and mixed-use developments.

  * The City is reviewing parking requirements in light of HCD guidance. Program #22 proposes to
      change this provision so that transitional and permanent supportive housing is subject to the
      same parking requirements as similar housing is parked in the same zone.
Pasadena’s parking space requirements are generally two spaces per unit and
match the vehicle ownership patterns and parking needs of residents. The
guest parking requirement of one space per ten multi-family units is low.
Parking space reductions are allowed for senior housing, special needs
housing, and multi-family uses near light rail. In accordance with state density
bonus law, the City will also permit an alternative parking ratio (inclusive of
handicapped and guest parking) and other parking incentives.

Constraint Analysis
                                 BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
                                 The City of Pasadena has adopted Title 24 of the most current California Code
                                 of Regulations, which is substantially based on the new International Building
                                 Code (IBC). State law requires that all local jurisdictions adopt the new Code;
                                 however, local governments are permitted to make local amendments to the
                                 Code that are necessary to address unique local climatic, geologic, and/or
                                 topographical conditions in their respective community.
                                 Building Codes
                                 To address issues of local concern, the City has adopted the following local
                                 amendments to the California Code of Regulations to protect the public
                                 health and safety from hazards indigenous to the community.
                                  Fire Hazards. Pasadena’s location in the San Gabriel foothills creates
                                   additional concerns regarding fire hazards. To address these concerns, the
                                   code has restrictions on the use of wood as exterior wall and roof material
                                   in fire hazard areas, requirements for Class A assembly for other materials,
                                   and requirements for fire sprinklers in all new construction.
                                  Seismic Hazards. Pasadena’s location in a seismically active area
                                   necessitates greater structural modifications to protect from earthquake.
                                   More restrictive building standards for roof sheathing, diaphragms,
                                   footings and foundations, shear walls, and building separation reduce risk
                                   of injury and property damage in the event of an earthquake.
                                  California Green Standards (CalGreen). Mixed-use and multi-family
                                   projects of four stories or more are required to comply with the CalGreen’s
                                   Tier I requirements. This requires applicable structures to submit a checklist
                                   as part of building plan check documenting attainment of at least the
                                   minimum points to achieve Tier I standards.
                                 Code Enforcement
                                 The City of Pasadena has adopted Title 14 of the Pasadena Municipal Code
                                 (PMC) addressing buildings and construction. Within that chapter, the PMC
                                 has several codes regulating the maintenance of properties and structures
                                 and remediation of blighted conditions. These include Chapter 14.12
                                 (Housing Codes), Chapter 14.6 (Abatement of Buildings Exhibiting Slumlike
                                 Conditions), and Chapter 14.7 (Vacant Building and Vacant Lot Maintenance).
                                 These local codes are enforced by building and code enforcement staff.
                                 Pasadena also implements a three-tiered code enforcement function to
                                 ensure that property and residential structures are well maintained. This
                                 includes an occupancy inspection program for ownership units when
                                 properties are sold. For rental properties, the City operates a quadrennial
                                 inspection program where all housing projects are inspected every four years.
                                 An interdepartmental team (called CRASH) also addresses situations involving
                                 the worst habitability and code violations where immediate action is needed.
                                 These programs are implemented uniformly throughout the community.

Subdivision and Site Improvements
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’
property tax revenues, cities have faced increased difficulty in providing and
financing appropriate public services and facilities to serve residents. In order
to ensure public health and safety, Pasadena requires developers to provide
on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve proposed residential
projects for projects that require a discretionary entitlement.
The City requires developers to fulfill obligations specified in the Subdivision
Map Act. Such improvements may include water, sewer, and other utility lines
and extensions; street construction to City standards; and traffic control
reasonably related to the project. Pasadena regulates the design, installation,
and maintenance of improvements needed for new housing. On/off-site
improvements include street right-of-way dedication, sidewalks, street
lighting, curbs and gutters, water and sewer mains, and others.
Typical standards requirements include:
         Local streets must have 60’ of right of way (ROW) with 36’ of
          roadway. Collector streets must have a 64’ ROW and 40’ of roadway.
          Secondary highways must have 90’ of ROW and 66’ of roadway,
          Major highways must have 108’ of ROW and 80’ of roadway.
         Street improvements–including street trees on both sides of the
          street in accordance with the City’s Tree Master Plan, curbs and
          gutters, street lights, signage, and other similar appurtenances.
       Utility lines–including but not limited to electric, communications,
          street lighting and cable television to serve the subdivision shall be
          required to be placed underground.
         Water infrastructure–including water mains, submains and services
          needed for the distribution of water to each lot or parcel. or parcel of
          land. Construction of all new water and drainage distribution
          systems related to projects are completed by the developer.
         Parks and recreation–including open space, park and recreational
          facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is
          required in accordance with the General Plan and fee schedule.
In the vast majority of cases, infrastructure is already in place and in
surrounding projects. Sufficient capacity exists within the existing street
network. In these cases, most of the City’s on-and off-site improvements are
provided simply through the payment of a pro-rate share of fees, which have
been accounted for under residential development fees mentioned earlier.
These subdivision requirements are similar to jurisdictions across southern
California and are not deemed to place a unique cost or actual constraints
upon the development, improvement, and maintenance of housing.
                                                                      CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    B-17

Constraint Analysis
                                    Energy Conservation
                                    Pasadena has taken a leadership role in developing and implementing
                                    resource conservation programs addressing water resources, renewable
                                    energy sources, solid waste management, urban forestry, and other efforts
                                    toward becoming a green and sustainable city. The City adopted a Green City
                                    Action Plan, established an Environmental Advisory Commission, and
                                    adopted a Green Building Ordinance. These efforts help to conserve energy
                                    usage and reduce adverse impacts on the environment.
                                    California's Energy Efficiency Standards require all new housing to meet
                                    minimum energy conservation standards. This requirement can be met in two
                                    ways, either with a prescriptive approach or a performance approach. With
                                    either option, mandatory components would be installed, such as minimum
                                    insulation, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and efficient
                                    heating equipment. In addition, all residential projects are subject to meeting
                                    the state building codes, which also include energy conservation standards.
     Hudson Oaks Solar Panels       Originally, the City of Pasadena adopted a Green Building Code to achieve the

                                    Building ordinance applied to new multi-family, mixed-use projects and
                                    commercial buildings of four stories or more and alterations or construction
                                    over 25,000 square feet and municipal building of 5,000 square feet or more.
                                    Buildings meeting this threshold were required to meet LEED standards.
                                    In 2010, Pasadena adopted the new California Green Building Standards Code
                                    (CalGreen), replacing many provisions of the existing Green Building Code.
                                    CalGreen offers statewide uniformity to many established and emerging local
                                    green building ordinances. Pasadena’s new code is designed to promote
                                    sustainable building design and construction that has a low impact on the
                                    environment, uses resources efficiently, is healthy for the occupants, and
                                    brings economic and social benefits to the community.
                                    The CalGreen Code applies to all projects, residential and non-residential. The
                                    City exceeds CalGreen Standards by including additions and alterations of all
                                    projects except where exempted in City codes. The City also adopted
                                    additional requirements, including: 1) all new and re-roofs of low-slope roofs
                                    be "Cool Roof" certified; 2) water-resistant flushing must comply with industry
                                    standards or manufacturer's instructions; and 3) pre-installation of conduits in
                                    all new buildings for future photovoltaic systems. Moreover, mixed-use
                                    projects and multi-family buildings four or more stories in height must
                                    comply with Tier I standards, which are comparable to LEED certification.
                                    The Planning & Community Development Department conducts outreach
                                    and education with developers, contractors, architect, and business owners to
                                    provide information on how to incorporate sustainability in project design.

City of Gardens Standards
The City of Gardens Standards refers to zoning regulations that encourage
designs that typify the garden character of earlier apartments and bungalow
courts in Pasadena. The garden standards are designed to ensure that high-
density apartments and condominiums incorporate landscaped common
open space rather than concrete interiors and bulky mass designs. These
regulations apply to all multi-family residential district projects in portions of
certain specific plan areas and in the CL and CO districts. The City of Gardens
standards do not apply to the RM-12 district or mixed-use projects.
The Garden Standards are structured to emphasize multi-family projects with
a landscaped open space feature as the central focus. This open space may
take the form of a main garden, private garden, or landscaped court. It shall
be a well-defined, coherent area that is an essential component of the project
design, not merely space left over after the building mass is placed. Within the
open space requirement for multi-family residential projects, the primary
garden occupies between 17% and 37% of total site area. Table B-8 lists some
of the primary requirements of the City of Garden standards.
Another key feature of the program is density and height incentives. For small
lots, the densities range from 2 to 6 units in the RM districts. In the RM-16
district and on lots less than 60 feet in width in the RM-32 district, the
maximum height of structures is two stories. However, for lots of 10,000
square feet or more, the minimum allowable units is 10 units, which                                    City of Gardens Project
automatically triggers the City’s IHO, and new apartments can be built at up
to three stories in height. For historic structures, the City can modify virtually
any development standard in the code and other applicable standards.

In 2006, the City modified the Gardens Standards to provide greater flexibility
in project design and allow projects to achieve maximum densities. An
analysis of 14 multi-family residential projects submitted for City of Gardens
plan check shows that the majority of projects submitted nearly achieved
maximum density in the RM-16, RM-32, and RM-48 zones. In fact, none of
these projects required a variance to comply with City of Gardens standards.
Therefore, the City of Gardens requirements are not considered an actual
constraint to the production of affordable or market rate housing.

Constraint Analysis
                                  Historic Preservation
                                  Pasadena has a rich collection of historic properties and neighborhoods. The
                                  presence of architecturally distinguished buildings throughout the
                                  community imparts an attractive character to neighborhoods and business
                                  districts. The City’s historic resources also serve as tangible reminders of the
                                  eventful history of the community. They are a source of civic pride and of
                                  economic productivity, drawing residents, tourists, shoppers, and businesses.
                                  The City formally recognizes the benefits of preserving its historic sites and
                                  structures. It has a cultural heritage ordinance, two commissions entrusted
                                  with protecting historic resources, and a program to support historic
                                  preservation. Pasadena contains eight districts listed on the National Register
                                  of Historic Places, including a historic overlay district covering much of the
                                  Central District. Pasadena now has 17 local landmark districts; the largest ones
                                  are Bungalow Heaven, Historic Highlands, North Pasadena Heights, Garfield
                                  Heights, and Washington Square.
                                  Key efforts include:
   Heritage Partners Restoration
                                    Tax Incentive. The City offers incentives to promote the preservation of
                                     historic sites and structures. These include the Mills Act Historic Contract
                                     Property Program, State Historical Building Code (SHBC), rehabilitation tax
                                     credit, facade easements, and technical assistance. A common tax incentive
                                     is the Mills Act Contract, whereby property owners of designated historic
                                     properties make improvements that maintain the historic character of their
                                     property in return for tax credits.
                                    Design Review. The Municipal Code provides for protection of locally
                                     designated landmarks and landmark districts through design review.
                                     Designated landmarks and properties within a landmark district must
                                     obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) prior to a building permit for
                                     alterations, additions, relocations, demolitions, or new construction.
                                     Depending on the scope of the project, the COA may be granted by staff or
                                     require review by the Historic Preservation Commission.
                                    Zoning Incentives. The Municipal Code offers zoning incentives to
                                     encourage the preservation of historic resources. Rehabilitation or the
                                     addition of new units subject to the City of Gardens standards may qualify
                                     for a waiver of development standards such as main garden’s size, required
                                     parking, and building modulation.
                                    Financial Incentives. In other cases, the City has supported organizations
                                     dedicated to purchasing, renovating, and deed restricting historic
                                     structures for affordable housing purposes. Pasadena Heritage Partners has
                                     completed a number of restorations that now provide low and moderate
                                     homeownership opportunities for Pasadena residents. The City has also
                                     supported the rehabilitation of multi-family structures and older hotels
                                     (e.g., Green Hotel) for affordable housing as well.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVES
To facilitate and encourage the development of housing that is affordable
and accessible to special needs groups and lower income individuals and
families, Pasadena offers a density bonus program, inclusionary housing
ordinance, modified development standards to facilitate affordable housing,
and a reasonable modification program. These incentives, described below,
facilitate production of affordable and accessible housing.
Density Bonus
Pasadena adopted a density bonus ordinance as required by state law.
Residential and mixed-use projects are entitled to a density bonus (increase in
the number of units allowed above the maximum in a zone) if any of the
following are met: at least 5% of the units are set aside as affordable to very
low income households; at least 10% are for-sale units affordable to low or
moderate income households; or the project has at least 35 units available
exclusively to persons aged 55 years and older and those residing with them.
The density bonus generally ranges from 5 to 35% according to the amount
by which the percentage of affordable housing units provided. The City
provides for further density bonuses of up to 50% in the Central District for
increased percentages of affordable units. Density bonus requests do not
require discretionary approval by the City, with the exception of bonuses
exceeding 35% in the Central District, which require a conditional use permit.
Eligible residential and mixed-use projects may also receive one to three
concessions, development standard modifications, or financial incentives
based on the proportion of and income targeting of affordable units.
The City of Pasadena requires that applicants seeking concessions or
incentives under density bonus law complete an application for an Affordable
Housing Concession that includes sufficient economic information on the
project to demonstrate the concession or incentive is required for the
designated units to be affordable. The Affordable Housing Concession Permit
is processed the same as a minor variance, and is placed on the consent
calendar for the Hearing Officer, unless a hearing is specifically requested. The
Affordable Housing Concession Permit uses the “findings” given in the state
density bonus/concession statute, not the minor variance findings.
During the past ten years, more than a dozen residential projects have
received density bonuses, helping to facilitate at least 40 density bonus units
since 2000. Along with the density bonus, developers have also received
affordable housing concessions, fee waivers, or modifications in return for
affordable housing units. These density bonus units have also been eligible to
satisfy the inclusionary housing requirements. As such, the density bonus
program and affordable housing concessions have been successful tools in
making it more feasible to build affordable housing.
                                                                      CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    B-21

Constraint Analysis
                                 Inclusionary Housing
                                 Pasadena Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (IHO) requires that residential,
                                 mixed-use, and work/live projects of 10 or more units dedicate 15% of the
                                 units as affordable to low and moderate income households. Rental units
                                 must have at least 10% of the units affordable for lower income households,
                                 while ownership projects can fulfill the IHO with moderate income units. As
                                 an alternative to constructing inclusionary units, a developer may choose one
                                 of three options: 1) construct units on another site; 2) donate another site for
                                 a portion of the housing units, or 3) pay a fee in lieu of building the units.
                                 Developers have significant flexibility in meeting their IHO requirements.
                                 Important provisions are as follows:
                                  Flexibility by Substitution of Units: Developers receive greater credit for
                                   providing a higher level of affordability: a very low income unit can be
                                   substituted for 1.5 low income units or 2 moderate income units. Each low
                                   income unit can be substituted for 1.5 moderate income units.
                                  Reduced Residential Impact Fees: For on-site units, park impact fees on
                                   affordable units are reduced to only $861 per unit, adjusted for the CPI,
                                   compared to $14,500–$27,000 per market rate unit, with the impact fee on
                                   all other units in the development reduced by 30%.
                                  Modified Standards for Affordable Units: The ordinance provides
                                   flexibility in alternative materials and finished quality of habitable spaces
                                   for all the affordable units, allowing significant cost savings that make it
                                   more feasible to provide affordable units.
                                  Provision of Financial or Regulatory Incentives: For projects subject to
                                   the inclusionary ordinance, the developer may request one or more of the
                                   following incentives: 1) density bonus; 2) fee waivers; 3) financial assistance;
                                   or 4) additional incentives on a case-by-case basis.
                                  Inclusion of Density Bonus Units: For projects subject to the inclusionary
                                   ordinance, the developer may apply all of the density bonus units provided
                                   directly to the project, which creates a significant incentive and ability to
                                   satisfy the inclusionary housing requirements.
                                 Since the inception of the IHO, Pasadena has facilitated the construction of 19
                                 residential and mixed-use projects that have provided 450 very low, low, and
                                 moderate income units. An additional 35 projects have paid in-lieu fees
                                 totaling $16.6 million, which have been leveraged with other funding sources
                                 to support the production, rehabilitation, or preservation of housing.
                                 The 2009 case, Palmer/Fifth Street Properties v. City of Los Angeles, held that
                                 the Costa Hawkins Act does not permit the City to require affordable units in
                                 new rental housing unless it has provided incentives to the developer, and
                                 the developer has agreed by contract to provide the affordable units. In 2012,
                                 Assembly Bill 1229 was proposed to allow cities in California to continue
                                 inclusionary housing programs. The Governor vetoed this bill. The Housing
                                 Plan proposes a program to address concerns raised by both developments.

Standards for Urban Housing and Mixed-Use Projects
Pasadena’s land use framework focuses housing in areas of the community
that can best accommodate residential growth and reduce transportation
demands. Urban housing and mixed use are a key strategy in Pasadena to
further its housing, economic, mobility, air quality, and neighborhood
stabilization goals in the community. To achieve these ends, the City has
adopted development standards for Urban Housing and Mixed-Use projects.
These standards have facilitated the construction of more than 1,000 mixed-
use housing units in the Central District and other specific plan areas.
The City’s Urban Housing and Mixed Use Standards are intended to provide
greater flexibility appropriate for downtown and commercial districts, such as
the Central District and North Lake Avenue Specific Plan. The regulatory
framework contains incentives that encourage the production of housing,
including affordable housing. Key provisions are noted below:
  Regulatory Concessions. The Urban Housing standards allow densities of
   48 to 87 units per acre due to flexibility in height limits, setbacks, and floor
   area ratios. These standards allow flexibility in open space by balconies,
   rooftop gardens, private patios, and setbacks. Because open space can be
   provided by nontraditional means, projects can achieve higher densities
   and more affordable units.
  Density/Intensity Incentives. Typically, new mixed use and urban projects
   in the Central District have ground-floor commercial space and three or
   four stories of above-grade housing. Residential and mixed-use
   developments have floor area ratios that vary from 1/1 to 3/1 but often
   achieve at least a ratio of 2/1. The floor area ratios have helped to
   accommodate new housing at densities from 48 to 87 units.
  Affordable Housing Incentives. Mixed-use projects greater than 10 units
   are subject to the City’s IHO. Given that developers often seek to maximize
   density in specific plan areas and that the inclusionary requirement can
   satisfy state density bonus law, mixed-use projects often achieve very high
   densities and, as a result, offer more affordable units. The high level of
   affordability often results in fee waivers as well.
  Permit Process. A conditional use approval is required for nonresidential
   projects (or the nonresidential portion of a mixed-use project) that exceed
   an established gross floor area. A CUP requires a public hearing and review
   by the Hearing Officer, upon which the review authority may approve,
   conditionally approve, or disapprove an application for a CUP. Of the 22
   mixed-use projects credited toward the 2006–2014 RHNA, only two
   projects triggered the CUP requirement, and both were approved.
Taken together, the Urban Housing and Mixed Use development standards,
coupled with other incentives, have been instrumental in facilitating and
encouraging a significant level of housing production in the Central District
and therefore serve as a primary tool for achieving the City’s RHNA goals.
                                                                       CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    B-23

                                 Pasadena has the responsibility to ensure that residential developments are
                                 of lasting quality, that housing opportunities are available, and that the public
                                 health and welfare are maintained. To that end, the Municipal Code
                                 establishes the following standard procedures for processing applications for
                                 the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing.
                                 DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                                 The City of Pasadena has established the Planning and Permit Center directly
                                 across the street from City Hall. The Permit Center on the first floor is
                                 organized to help developers secure all the necessary permits for residential
                                 projects in a one-stop environment. At the Permit Center, developers can
                                 obtain nearly all of the needed permits for their project. The City’s
                                 development review process can be summarized in the following steps:
                                 Normal Development Review
                                 Proposed residential projects are subject to an initial determination of
                                 whether a project requires 1) preapplication conference; 2) discretionary
   Pasadena Permit Center
                                 permit, 3) legislative approval; or 4) other special review. Most single-family
                                 homes and multi-family projects under nine units do not require any of the
                                 aforementioned reviews, although multi-family projects of three to nine units
                                 are subject to staff-level design review. Using application packets available on
                                 the City’s website, applicants can readily assess the appropriate
                                 documentation that needs to be submitted for project reviews.
                                 Predevelopment Plan Review (PPR)
                                 The PPR applies to multi-family projects larger than nine housing units,
                                 projects with more than 25,000 square feet of nonresidential floor area,
                                 projects of community-wide significance, and projects within a specific plan
                                 area, if needed. PPR is a preliminary evaluation conducted by City staff to
                                 provide input on requirements for a project before submittal of a
                                 development application to the City. A case manager is assigned to guide the
                                 development project through PPR and plan approval. PPR takes
                                 approximately four to eight weeks from inception to completion.
                                 Preliminary Plan Check
                                 Multi-family housing projects following the City of Gardens standards are
                                 reviewed in Preliminary Plan Check, an early determination of any changes
                                 that must be made to comply with the standards. City staff reviews the plans
                                 and discusses all necessary changes with the applicant, who then revises the
                                 drawings for a second review prior to submittal of a development application.
                                 The initial review, corrections, and second review typically take eight weeks.
                                 This review step is essential to developers wishing to build in the City’s RM

Discretionary Permit
Certain development projects may require a conditional use permit and/or a
variance. Typically, multi-family residences are allowed as a by-right use.
However, a mixed-use project that includes more than 25,000 square feet of
nonresidential development requires a conditional use permit to ensure
compatibility. However, deviations not exceeding 25% of the development
standard may be processed as a minor variance and approved by a hearing
officer without public hearing unless it is requested. Larger deviations require
a major variance, public hearing, and approval by a hearing officer.
Commission Review
Residential projects may require approvals by commissions, depending on
the age, location, scale, and use proposed. The Design Commission or City
staff may review development applications for compliance with City design
guidelines. Design review can take six months to complete, including
Concept Design Review and Final Review. Discussed later, Consolidated
Design Review reduces the time for project review. The Historic Preservation
Commission reviews development applications in historic neighborhoods.
Finally, the Community Development Committee has authority to review and
approve concept plans for affordable housing subsidized by the City.
Plan Check/Permit Issuance
Once the residential or mixed-use project is approved by the necessary
Commission and review bodies, the project is moved through the plan check
stage and permit issuance. This involves verification that the project complies
with building, zoning, fire, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and health codes.
The time frame required to complete plan check varies with the size,
complexity, and location of the project. Generally, plan check requires one to
two months to complete, but corrections and second submittals are common
and can increase the time required to complete plan check.
For a single-family residence on a legal lot, the process typically requires only
plan check, without discretionary review and design review. Plan check
review requires about four weeks for City departments to either approve the
drawings as submitted or to indicate what corrections are required. After
changes are made by the applicant, the City’s recheck is usually accomplished
in two to three weeks. The cumulative time frame is generally no more than
eight weeks from application submittal to permit issuance, unless the project
is built in a historic district and subject to review.
Multi-family project approval depends on the environmental review process
and mandated time frames, and the applicant’s qualifications. Typically, multi-
family projects can take eight weeks for PPR and plan project review, up to
twelve weeks for design review, eight weeks for changes following design
review, and six weeks to finalize the application prior to issuance of building
permits, for a total time commitment of eight months. Residential projects
larger than 25 units require a greater level of design review that adds two
months to the process. If environmental review is required, an additional two
months is needed to comply with state law.
                                                                      CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    B-25

Constraint Analysis
                                 DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS
                                 Pasadena has limited vacant land; new residential development often
                                 includes the demolition of existing structures and the construction of higher
                                 intensity uses, often in established multi-family residential neighborhoods or
                                 mixed-use commercial districts. In this context, it is critical to ensure new
                                 development is compatible with existing land use patterns. Pasadena has
                                 thus established a design review process to encourage excellence in
                                 architectural design, enhance the visual environment, and ensure that
                                 development is compatible with surrounding land uses.
                                 The Citywide Design Principles in the Land Use Element are the foundation of
                                 all design reviews. To provide clear guidance to developers and reviewing
                                 authorities, the City has adopted design guidelines that fall into one of four
                                 categories: Citywide, specific areas, specific uses, and historic properties. The
                                 design guidelines work in concert with the development standards in the
                                 Zoning Code or Specific Plan. However, unlike development standards, which
                                 are mandatory, design guidelines are applied with flexibility to foster
                                 creativity, and strict adherence is not required for project approval.
                                 Design review consists of the following three stages:
                                   Preliminary Consultation. This step is an informal discussion between the
                                    City staff and the applicant to explain the design guidelines and procedures
                                    that will apply to the project and to discuss compliance of the project with
                                    the guidelines. This step is designed to expedite the design review process
                                    by communicating clear expectations at the onset.
                                   Concept Design Review. This stage involves an application submittal that
                                    addresses basic project design, including compatibility with surroundings,
                                    massing, proportion, siting, and compliance with design guidelines.
                                    Depending on scope and location, concept review may occur at the staff
                                    level or as a public hearing before the Design Commission.
                                   Final Design Review. Final design review focuses on construction details,
                                    finishes, materials, landscaping, and consistency of the project with the
                                    design approved during concept design review. The Director maintains
                                    authority for final design review, unless the Design Commission, acting as
                                    review authority, is required at this stage.
                                 City staff or the Design Commission may conduct design review, depending
                                 on the scale, location, and sensitivity of the project. City staff generally
                                 reviews projects of three to nine units, and the Design Commission reviews
                                 larger projects or those in the Central District and certain zoning districts in
                                 Pasadena. However, projects within a designated landmark or historic district
                                 (outside of the Central District) are reviewed by the Historic Preservation
                                 Commission. As an alternative to a separate Concept and Final Design review,
                                 an applicant may select single consolidated review. The design review
                                 process can take one to six months depending on complexity, responsiveness
                                 of the applicant, and whether it is subject to City of Gardens Standards.

VARIANCE
A variance is a request for a deviation from the zoning code for a particular
development standard because of unusual circumstances associated with a
particular site, such as topography, shape, or other characteristic. Some
examples of the types of variances requested are for building height and
parking. No variances to the land use classifications of the zoning code are
allowed. Variances require noticed public hearings with a review by the
zoning hearing officer. A decision to approve or disapprove an application is
based on the findings of fact in the zoning code.
A minor variance is intended for adjustments that are determined to have
lesser (minor) potential impacts. The following examples may be processed as
a minor variance: 1) yard setback requirements, with no limit on percentage
of deviation; 2) size of landscape areas in multi-family districts (including City
of Gardens projects); 3) fence/wall height, with no limit on percentage of
deviation; 4) building heights (not to exceed 10 feet above requirement or 5
feet in an HD overlay district); and 5) other specified development standards.
The difference between a minor variance and a variance is in the process. A
variance requires a noticed public hearing with a review by the hearing
officer. A minor variance can be reviewed by staff and approved by the
hearing officer without a public hearing unless a hearing is requested by an
interested party or the applicant. Public notices are mailed to property
owners within a designated radius. If a hearing is held, the hearing officer
conducts the hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.76.
Following a public hearing, if required, the review authority may approve a
variance application, with or without conditions, only after first finding that:
  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
   applicable to the subject site that do not apply generally to sites in the
   same zoning district.
  Granting the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
   a substantial property right of the applicant and to prevent unreasonable
   property loss or unnecessary hardship.
  Granting the application would not be detrimental or injurious to property
   or improvements in the vicinity of the subject site, or to the public health,
   safety, or general welfare.
  Granting the application is in conformance with the goals, policies, and
   objectives of the general plan, and the purpose and intent of any
   applicable specific plan and the purposes of the zoning code, and would
   not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations.
  Cost to the applicant of strict compliance with a regulation shall not be the
   primary reason for granting the variance.

Constraint Analysis
                                 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
                                 Conditional use permits are required for uses typically having unusual site
                                 development features or operating characteristics requiring special
                                 consideration so that they may be designed, located, and operated to be
                                 compatible with neighboring properties. The municipal code provides for the
                                 review of the configuration, design, location, and potential impacts of the
                                 proposed use in order to evaluate the compatibility of the proposed use with
                                 surrounding uses and the suitability of the use to the site. Conditional uses
                                 are divided into two types—major and minor.
                                 The difference between a minor or major conditional use permit is process. A
                                 CUP requires a public hearing and is reviewed by the hearing officer. A minor
                                 CUP is reviewed by planning staff, and a letter is written informing the
                                 applicant of the draft findings and any recommended conditions of approval.
                                 Public noticing of the hearing or review is the same for both processes. If an
                                 interested party requests a hearing, it is held before the hearing officer.
                                 Following a hearing, the review authority may approve, conditionally
                                 approve, or disapprove an application for a CUP. The review authority may
                                 approve a conditional use permit (major or minor) only after first finding that:
                                  The proposed use is allowed with a conditional use permit in the applicable
                                   zoning district and complies with zoning code provisions.
                                  The location of the proposed use complies with the special purposes of the
                                   zoning code and the purposes of the applicable zoning district.
                                  The proposed use conforms with the goals, policies, and objectives of the
                                   general plan and the purpose and intent of any applicable specific plan.
                                  The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would not, under
                                   the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health,
                                   safety, or general welfare of persons residing/working in the neighborhood
                                   of the proposed use.
                                  The use, as described and conditionally approved, would not be
                                   detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the
                                   neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.
                                  The design, location, operating characteristics, and size of the proposed use
                                   would be compatible with the existing and future land uses in the vicinity
                                   in terms of aesthetic values, character, scale, and view protection.
                                 The CUP process has not constrained the production of mixed-use projects in
                                 Pasadena. Of the 22 mixed-use projects credited toward the 2006–2014
                                 RHNA, only two projects triggered the established threshold of square feet of
                                 nonresidential use, and both projects were approved with affordable units.
                                 Developers are generally proposing mixed-use developments as a means to
                                 secure more flexible development standards. Given the volume of projects
                                 approved and built in the community, the permitting process has not
                                 constrained the production of housing, including affordable housing.

HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
In accordance with Section 65008 of the Government Code, this section
analyzes potential and actual constraints to the development, improvement,
and maintenance of housing serving people with disabilities in Pasadena.
Where actual constraints are found, this section describes specific programs
that will be implemented as part of the 2014–2021 Housing Element to
remove government constraints to housing people with disabilities.
Municipal Code Definitions
Municipal codes can create fair housing concerns if the definitions could be
used to limit housing opportunities or fair housing choice. Although cities
rarely discriminate in this manner, the code definition in itself could
discourage proposing a use that would otherwise be allowed. By example, fair
housing law prohibits defining a family (and by extension living quarters) in
terms of the relationship of members (e.g., marital status), number of
occupants (e.g., family size), or other characteristics. Other definitions should
also be consistent with fair housing law. The Pasadena Municipal Code
defines a family as two or more persons living together as a single
housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, The term does include boarding house.
Permitted Land Use
The Pasadena Zoning Code designates two types of community care
facilities—Residential Care Limited (serving six or fewer people) and
Residential Care General (serving seven or more people), as defined earlier.
Residential Care Limited homes are permitted by right in all residential
districts, and Residential Care General facilities are conditionally permitted in
six residential and commercial districts. The zoning code does not subject
Residential Care Limited facilities to a use permit, building standard, or
regulation not otherwise required of homes in the same district, and imposes
no spacing requirements between such facilities beyond state law allowance.
Due to a high concentration of uses in Northwest Pasadena, the general plan
prohibits establishing these uses, except residential care facilities (limited).
Building Codes, Development Standards, and Permitting Processes
Pasadena has adopted the latest edition of the California Building Code,
including all provisions related to facilitating disabled access. Accessibility is
required to all covered multi-family dwellings. "Covered multi-family
dwellings" are all dwelling units in buildings consisting of three or more
privately funded units if such buildings have one or more elevators; and all
ground floor dwelling units in other buildings consisting of three or more
dwelling units. In covered multi-family dwellings in buildings with elevators,
all units are required to be located on an accessible route. For such units, the
units must be adaptable, so that the public and common use areas are readily
accessible to and usable by a person with a disability, and all doors are
designed sufficiently wide to allow passage into and within all premises by
persons who use wheelchairs, as required by the building code. The City’s
building official enforces compliance with these requirements, among others.
                                                                        CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT    B-29

Constraint Analysis
                                 Reasonable Accommodation
                                 Reasonable accommodation means the process by which an operator may
                                 seek from the City an accommodation in rules, policies, practices, or services
                                 when such accommodation may be necessary to afford the disabled equal
                                 opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. Summarized below in Table B-9, the
                                 City has three procedures to implement state and federal fair housing law and
                                 to ensure housing opportunities for people with disabilities.
                                   Building Codes. Pasadena complies with the standards and processes
                                    contained and described in the current California Building Code with
                                    respect to housing for people with disabilities. Every three years, the
                                    California Building Codes are updated (including processes and codes
                                    affecting housing for people with disabilities), and the City adopts these
                                    codes to comply with state and federal disability requirements.
                                   Land Use Classification. The Pasadena Municipal Code has been amended
                                    over time to eliminate differentiation between housing units for people
                                    with disabilities and housing for people without disabilities. For example,
                                    two projects for people with disabilities were approved and built in recent
                                    years (e.g., the 21-unit Ashtabula and 13-unit Rio Grande apartments).
                                   Zoning Standards. Modifications to zoning standards are granted in a
                                    manner identical to the application, notice, and hearing requirements for a
                                    minor variance. The review authority may approve a modification with
                                    consideration for only findings specific to a reasonable accommodation: 1)
                                    the individual requesting the modification is disabled; 2) the request is
                                    necessary by state or federal laws to avoid discrimination; and 3) the
                                    modification is not detrimental to public health and safety.

C. Housing Resources
Appendix C contains an analysis and description of the land, financial, and
administrative resources available to Pasadena to address its existing and
future housing needs, including its regional housing needs allocation (RHNA).
INTRODUCTION
State housing element law requires that all local governments facilitate and
encourage the production of housing commensurate with their share of the
RHNA. The City of Pasadena’s RHNA is 1,332 units for the 2014–2021 planning
period. Pasadena, like other communities, is tasked with the challenge of
guiding residential development in a manner that benefits the community,
respects its unique character, and addresses the requirements of state law.
The general plan land use framework places a great priority on preserving the
quality and character of its residential neighborhoods by attention to
harmonizing growth. Harmonizing change and preserving the environment
are of tremendous importance to Pasadena residents, and both are directly
linked to the integrity of neighborhood fabric. Harmonizing change requires
that development respect the existing character and scale of neighborhoods.
Change that does occur must enhance and blend with Pasadena’s social
fabric, natural features, and built environment.
With this backdrop, this chapter focuses on the wide variety of resources
available to achieve the City’s housing production and supportive service
goals. To that end, this appendix addresses the following three issues:
  Housing Production. This section documents housing production credits
   toward the 2014–2021 RHNA for units built and occupied during the
   planning period. This refers to residential projects that are built after
   January 2014, the beginning of the planning period.
  Land Inventory. This section identifies and describes the sites that have
   adequate zoning in Pasadena that can accommodate the development of a
   wide range of housing opportunities commensurate with the RHNA. A
   general assessment of infrastructure must also accompany the analysis.
  Financial Resources. This section identifies the financial and
   administrative resources available to the City to assist in implementing the
   housing programs in the housing element. This includes the major funding
   sources and organizational entities that implement programs.
This following describes Pasadena’s approach to addressing its 2014–2021
RHNA as determined by the Southern California Association of Governments.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT C-1

Housing Resources
                                1.       HOUSING PRODUCTION
                                State law allows two ways of counting housing construction credits toward
                                the RHNA: preservation of affordable units and new construction. The City is
                                not proposing to count the preservation of publicly assisted affordable units
                                at risk of conversion to market rates toward the 2014–2021 RHNA. This is
                                because preservation agreements would likely occur after the first two years
                                of the planning period, and therefore would be ineligible for credit toward
                                the RHNA per the alternative sites provision of the Government Code.
                                The City of Pasadena continues to facilitate a wide range of housing products
                                at an equal range of affordability levels. In fact, nearly every conceivable type
                                of housing product continues to be developed. This includes townhomes,
                                apartments, senior housing, mixed use, work/live, student housing, senior life
                                care facilities, housing for people with disabilities, and other housing types.
                                The City is crediting the following projects to the 2014–2021 RHNA.
                                 700 units of apartments
                                 500 units of condominiums
                                 150 units of student housing
                                 70 units of senior housing
                                Table C-1 is a summary of projects in Pasadena that are in the planning stage
                                but are anticipated to be approved for construction after October 2013.
                                Projects in the “pipeline” include those in preliminary stages: predevelopment
                                plan review, preliminary consultation, concept design review, preliminary
                                plan check for City of Garden projects, and other similar reviews. Not until
                                these steps are completed and modifications made will a concept result in a
                                bona fide project and move forward to more formal entitlement phases.
                                Determining the affordability of proposed residential projects is based on
                                several criteria. These include:
                                 inclusionary housing plans or agreements
                                 density bonus or other controlling affordability mechanisms
                                 developer agreements or specific plan guidance
                                 tenure and size of proposed project and size
                                 market rents or sales prices of new housing
                                Where developers propose to pay in-lieu fees to satisfy the requirements of
                                the inclusionary housing ordinance, no affordable units are counted even
                                though the fees paid will be leveraged for affordable housing in the future.

                                2.        INVENTORY OF SITES
                                The Pasadena General Plan provides the overarching framework for guiding
                                the growth, improvement, and preservation of the community. The land use
                                element targets growth to eight specific plan areas: Central District, West
                                Gateway, South Fair Oaks, East Colorado Boulevard, East Pasadena, North
                                Lake, Fair Oaks/Orange Grove, and Lincoln. These specific plan areas are
                                intended to accommodate future residential development, and other areas of
                                the community are intended to experience modest levels of growth.
                                In January 2010 and again in August 2013, the City conducted extensive field
                                surveys of RM-zoned and CD-zoned sites to identify the most feasible sites for
                                recycling into residential and mixed-use developments. The potential for
                                development was also informed by an extensive history and analysis of more
                                than a hundred projects and several thousand units built within Pasadena
                                and the specific plan areas (most notably the Central District) since 2000.
                                As Pasadena is essentially built out, there is no vacant or unimproved land
                                available for development. Should developers propose to build new housing,
                                an existing building would need to be demolished. City staff lent expertise to
                                identify the most suitable sites for recycling. Potential housing sites were
                                screened using several criteria: 1) condition and viability of the existing use; 2)
                                the ability to achieve at least triple the existing density of development; 3)
                                developer interest in a parcel or group of parcels; 4) common ownership; and
                                5) lot size among other factors. The survey ranked sites into three categories:
                                  High Feasibility. Denotes a vacant site or parking lot that has the highest
                                   likelihood of immediate development during the planning period without
                                   rezoning or consolidation. These sites comprise 1,468 units.
                                  Mid-Term Feasibility. Indicates that the current use is marginal (e.g., a
                                   business is operating but the structure shows significant wear or the use
                                   has limited business activity). These sites comprise a total of 368 units.
                                  Longer-Term Feasibility. Denotes an active use of an aging structure.
                                   Structures are not considered ripe for development in the short term, but
                                   may recycle by the end of the planning period. These sites total 653 units.
                                Table C-2 lists each site, and Figure 4-1 maps the location of each site.

Lincoln Property (Parsons)
Parsons Engineering, a fixture in Pasadena since the 1970s, recently sold its
23-acre headquarters site on the north side of the Central District adjacent to
the I-110 and I-210. The new owners are in preliminary discussions with the
City to utilize the 400 acres of vacant parking lot around the existing 12-story
headquarters facility into a residential and mixed-use project consisting of 1
million square feet gross floor area. Phase 1 of the project includes 475 units
of residential uses, 210,000 square feet of office, and limited restaurant uses
slated for buildout in the 2016/2017 timeframe. The remaining 400,000
square feet of office will be built later in the planning period.
Former Parsons Engineering Site
This project is in the earliest stages and will be reviewed through the Planned
Development process. Like all residential projects of ten units or more in
Pasadena, this project will be subject to the City’s Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance and therefore offers significant potential for affordable housing.

                                SITES FOR HOUSING HOMELESS PEOPLE
                                State law requires communities to more proactively address the unmet
                                housing needs of their resident homeless people. This has presented unique
                                challenges, as many surrounding jurisdictions in the San Gabriel Valley do not
                                adequately house their resident homeless population. This has resulted in a
                                continued influx of homeless people into Pasadena who benefit from the
                                comprehensive services provided. Moreover, Pasadena incurs a concurrent
                                financial burden to house the San Gabriel Valley’s homeless population
                                because of the lack of diligent efforts in other cities.
                                In providing for homeless needs, there are two primary ways to count the
                                need for emergency shelter space in communities as described below.
                                  Housing Element law. Pasadena has 393 unsheltered homeless people
                                   during peak season. This number represents the number of people who are
                                   not residing in an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or permanent
                                   supportive housing. However, at any given time, some homeless people
                                   may choose not to reside in the emergency shelter. Indeed, of the 242 beds
                                   available in the City’s emergency shelter, only 69% is utilized in peak
                                   season, leaving 75 beds available for use.
                                   Under state law, the City has an unmet housing need for 318 beds for
                                   people who are homeless and not living in a shelter of any kind. The unmet
                                   need would be addressed by identifying and zoning sites to accommodate
                                   the construction of additional emergency shelters. However, it should be
                                   noted that this determination does not reflect best practices nor is it
                                   consistent with the City’s Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness. Indeed,
                                   recent years have seen a paradigm shift to a Housing First Approach, which
                                   suggests a different solution to housing homeless people.
                                  Housing First Approach. Best practices research has shown that the
                                   Housing First Model can be more effective in addressing the needs of
                                   certain subgroups of homeless people. Under the Housing First Model,
                                   homeless people (particularly the chronically hard-to-serve homeless
                                   people) are moved directly into permanent supportive housing, where
                                   services can be immediately provided that stabilize their living situation. In
                                   response, the City of Pasadena recently transitioned its Centennial Place
                                   SRO into permanent supportive housing for people who are homeless.
                                   Following this model, Pasadena estimates that 205 chronically homeless
                                   individuals and 99 adults and children in families with a chronically
                                   homeless member live in the city. If chronically homeless people were
                                   placed in transitional or permanent supportive housing, the unmet need is
                                   only 89 additional emergency shelter beds. This estimate should not be
                                   interpreted as a decline in the unmet housing need–the total need for
                                   housing remains the same. Rather, under the Housing First Model, the
                                   unmet need for shelter would be addressed through transitional or
                                   permanent supportive housing rather than emergency shelter beds.

Emergency Shelter Sites
State law requires that cities with an unmet need (defined largely by housing
element law) are required to identify a zone where emergency shelters are
allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit or other
discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the shelter need, and provide capacity for at least one year-
round emergency shelter. Permit processing and development and
management standards must be objective, must be the same as other
allowable uses within the zone where the emergency shelter is permitted,
and facilitate the development and conversion of uses to emergency shelters.
The City has identified two zones—Light Industrial SP-2 (IG) and Central
District (CD-6)—within two broader areas that provide appropriate and
adequate locations for accommodating emergency shelters. The identified
zones can accommodate several opportunities for smaller emergency shelters
that are dispersed throughout an area. These are described below.
  West Pasadena. The west Pasadena district has a homeless shelter and an
   intake and counseling center in the area. Health care providers are located
   within close proximity, including Huntington Hospital. The area is well
   served with transit and bus lines, with the Fillmore Station of the Gold Line
   in this area. The area has a mixture of retail, office, and light industrial uses
   and does not have major manufacturing uses that are incompatible with an
   emergency shelter. The west Pasadena overlay area has 114 acres and 260
   lots. Of this total, 82 lots (31%) are 10,001 to 25,000 square feet in size, 19%
   (50 lots) are greater than 25,000 square feet, and the rest are smaller.
  East Pasadena. The east Pasadena district is located north of Colorado,
   south of Foothill, east of Sierra Madre, and west of I-210. This area excludes
   Eloise Avenue. This area is near medical facilities that can serve homeless
   people, including Pasadena Community Urgent Care, Prototypes, and
   Pacific Clinics. Three MTA bus lines (two lines that transport riders to the
   light rail station) serve the area. The area contains predominantly light
   industrial uses and 1- and 2-story commercial uses. The east Pasadena
   overlay area has 61 acres and 135 lots. Of this total, 38 lots (28%) are 10,001
   to 25,000 square feet, and 20 lots (15%) are larger.
The City is presenting preparing an ordinance to address the unmet need.
City staff is proposing a limit of 12 clients per emergency shelter and a
minimum distance of 150 feet between facilities. With these parameters, the
two identified areas could accommodate 35 facilities and 420 beds for clients.
This exceeds the need for 318 emergency shelter beds calculated under
housing element law and the need for 89 beds under the Housing First
Approach. As the City progressively implement its Housing First approach, the
unmet emergency shelter need will continue to decline further.
The City of Pasadena will be amending the zoning code within one year of
adoption of the 2014–2021 Housing Element.

                                3.        ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
                                Environmental and infrastructure constraints cover a broad range of issues
                                affecting the feasibility of residential development. Environmental issues
                                range from the suitability of land for development to the provision of
                                adequate infrastructure, services, and facilities to facilitate housing
                                development commensurate with the 2014–2021 RHNA. This section
                                discusses environmental factors in Pasadena.
                                Environmental Factors
                                Certain portions of Pasadena are not suitable for development due to
                                flooding, geologic conditions, or biological resources. The following
                                information is derived from the initial study prepared for the general plan
                                land use and mobility element update, which is slated for adoption in 2014.
                                  Flooding. There are no 100-year flood zones designated by the Federal
                                   Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Pasadena. The dam inundation
                                   area for Devil’s Gate Reservoir extends south from the reservoir along the
                                   Arroyo Seco in the west part of the City. The dam inundation area for Eaton
                                   Wash Reservoir extends south and southeast from the reservoir to the I-210.
                                   As shown on FEMA map Community Number 065050, the entire City is in
                                   Zone D, for which no floodplain management regulations are required.
                                  Geology. Two active faults and one possible active fault cross the city. An
                                   active strand of the Sierra Madre Fault passes through the northwest part of
                                   the City north of Devil’s Gate Reservoir and an active strand of the Raymond
                                   Fault passes through the southernmost part of the City. A possibly active
                                   strand of the Sierra Madre Fault passes through the north-central and
                                   northwestern parts of the City near and north of Washington Boulevard.
                                   Although the City does have land within seismic hazard zones in the San
                                   Rafael Hills Arroyo Seco, and other locations throughout the City.
                                  Biology. Pasadena is primarily developed with urban and suburban uses.
                                   Open space and other vacant land is present in the northern end of the City
                                   on the lower slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Arroyo Seco, and the
                                   San Rafael Hills. Most of these areas would be designated Open Space in
                                   the proposed General Plan Update. The only substantial area of vacant land
                                   not designated for Open Space is within the San Rafael Hills. All three of
                                   these areas may contain biological resources that could be affected.
                                Future housing sites identified to address the City’s regional housing needs
                                allocation are identified in the urban core, particularly the Central District, and
                                surrounding areas around the urban core. These areas are not subject to
                                flooding concerns (e.g., 100-year flood plain), seismic hazards (e.g., Alquist
                                Priolo-Zones), or areas of the City which may contain biological resources.
                                Therefore, the sites in the housing element identified to address the RHNA are
                                feasible for development during the 2014–2021 planning period.

Sewer Capacity
The City encompasses approximately 23 square miles and owns and operates
a wastewater collection system that serves the local residential and
commercial community. The City’s wastewater system includes 350 miles of
sewer pipelines ranging from 6 inches to 42 inches in diameter; two sewer
pump stations; and approximately 7,430 manholes. It should be noted that no
sewer treatment takes place within the City of Pasadena sewer service area.
All sewer flow generated within the service area is conveyed to treatment
facilities of the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (LACSD).
Several factors are relevant to the housing element. Pasadena is one of the
oldest cities in its region, and its sewer system contains older lines than those
in most neighboring service areas. Approximately 35% of the City’s system is
over 80 years old, and over 60% of the system is over 70 years old. Though
many of the lines are in good working condition and still have useful life (the
pipes are designed to last 90 to 110 years), other improvements are needed.
The City prepares a capital improvement and financing plan to upgrade or
replace any sewer lines, pump stations, or appurtenances.
In 2007, the City of Pasadena updated its Sewer System Master Plan as the
basis for the development of a plan for accommodating anticipated growth
through 2020. Within updated Sewer System Master Plan and the population
estimate for 2020 used to assess facility needs exceeds the growth forecast to
accommodate the RHNA. The 2007 Sewer System Master Plan accepts the
allowed growth under the 1994 General Plan of 11,021 proposed residential
units, and determined that this level of residential growth could be
accommodated with the adoption of a Sewer Facility Charge.
In 2007, the City of Pasadena adopted the Sewer Facility Charge to pay for the
construction and upgrade of sewer infrastructure to meet the City’s needs.
Revenue generated by the Sewer Facility Charge can only be used for sewer
capacity upgrades. This fee is set at about $1,700 per unit. Since 2007, only
1,388 residential units have been constructed citywide, thus leaving adequate
remaining capacity within the original cap. Therefore, the sewer system has
sufficient capacity to accommodate the entire 1,322 housing units assigned
to the City of Pasadena in Cycle 5 (2014–2021) of the RHNA allocation.
The City of Pasadena is not responsible for the management, planning,
construction, or operation of sewer treatment facilities; these responsibilities
are within the jurisdiction of LACSD. Pasadena is in District 16 of the LACSD.
Based on the City’s location and its associated sewerage conveyance and
treatment needs, the District has developed fees to pay for the infrastructure
needed to accommodate the City’s long-term growth. Developers proposing
projects in Pasadena are required to pay a connection fee of $2,532 to $4,220
per unit (as of July 1, 2013) on each residential project to LACSD.
Water Capacity
Unlike many communities, the City of Pasadena has its own water purveyor.
The Pasadena Water and Power Department (PWP) is the designated provider
                                                                      CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT   C-13

                                of water supplies to residents, businesses, and other water users. Pasadena’s
                                water supply is drawn from a combination of groundwater, local surface
                                water, imported water, and short-term water exchanges with neighboring
                                jurisdictions and water agencies. Pasadena obtains approximately 40% of its
                                annual water supply from groundwater and the remaining 60% of its water
                                supply from the Metropolitan Water District (MWD).
                                In recent years, PWP’s local groundwater rights have been gradually curtailed
                                to help mitigate groundwater depletion occurring over the last half century.
                                With respect to imported supplies, a decade-long drought has reduced the
                                ability to replenish regional groundwater supplies, resulting in reduced
                                deliveries of water from the Colorado River and from the State Water Project.
                                The City accounted for these conditions in its Water Integrated Resources
                                Plan (adopted 2011) and Urban Water Management Plan (adopted 2011). As
                                of April 2011, the MWD has lifted allocation restrictions as a result of
                                improvements in Southern California’s water reserves.
                                The Water Integrated Resources Plan (the Plan) provides an achievable, long-
                                term strategy to meet current and future water needs. The goals of the Plan
                                are to sustainably and cost-effectively address local and regional water supply
                                and demand issues and adapt to changing conditions. The Plan relies on a
                                strategy of increased conservation, improving storage for groundwater
                                recharge, recycled water for non-potable reuse, groundwater storage of
                                imported water, and improving stormwater capture for landscaping and
                                groundwater recharge. Residential projects are required to demonstrate that
                                they will be able to reduce water consumption by a minimum of 10%.
                                As of 2013, the City has met the goals outlined in the Plan. The Plan looked at
                                the projected growth of residential units out to 2035. From the time period
                                2014 to 2021, the plan reviewed the construction of approximately 3,153
                                residential units. The five-year Cycle 5 RHNA allocation is only 1,322 units.
                                Moreover, the City recently increased its water infrastructure fee to achieve
                                full cost recovery, ensuring that adequate infrastructure can be financed to
                                supply water to residential and commercial uses. Therefore, the City can
                                supply water and provide infrastructure needed to accommodate its RHNA.
                                In 2006, the state legislature passed a requirement that local governments
                                that provide water and sewer service must develop and adopt written policies
                                and procedures that grant priority allocations for water service to proposed
                                projects that include housing units affordable to lower income households.
                                The 2014–2021 Housing Element’s Housing Plan contains a program to work
                                with the City’s water and sewer providers to ensure that appropriate policies
                                and programs are in place to address this law. Staff reviewed the Water
                                Integrated Resource Plan and the Sewer Master Plan and determined there is
                                a context for a written policy that will comply with this state requirement.

4.        FEASIBILITY OF SITES
The proposed housing sites identified in the housing inventory were carefully
selected as the most feasible for recycling to residential uses. As many of the
sites are underutilized, the following analysis is intended to further
demonstrate the feasibility of recycling in Pasadena.
MARKET ACTIVITY
Since 2000, Pasadena has seen extensive construction of new housing. The
significant level of construction is due to the achievable densities and market
value of apartments. Several sites showed that the value of new apartments
can be 25 times the value of the land, indicating that virtually every land use
has been converted to housing in recent years. Recent projects include:
  Trio Apartments (304 units)
  Terrace Apartments (391 units)
  Acapella Apartments (143 units)
  Arpeggio Apartments (135 units)
  Archstone Apartments (120 units)
  City Place Apartments (214 units)
  Paseo Colorado Apartments (391 units)                                                  Gateway Villa Apartments
Pasadena has also experienced significant development around its Gold Line
Stations, including the 347-unit Del Mar Apartments, the 375-unit Holly Street
Apartments, the 188-unit Stuart Apartments, and additional units above.
ADEQUACY OF ZONING
The adequacy of zoning for affordable housing is determined by the
allowable density of residential development. Housing element law provides
guidance on how to establish the number of units that can accommodate the
local government’s share of the regional housing need for lower income
households. Section 65583.2(c) of the Government Code states that if a local
government has adopted density standards consistent with default densities,
HCD is obligated to accept sites with those density standards as appropriate
for accommodating a city’s share of regional housing need for lower income
households. The default density for cities in Los Angeles County is 30 units.
All the proposed sites designated for high density residential and mixed uses
in the land inventory are located in the RM-32, RM-48, and CD zones. These
districts allow multi-family residential and/or mixed uses at a density of more
than 32 units per acre. Moreover, as discussed later, the City’s development
history shows that the projects built in these zones more often achieve
maximum densities. Furthermore, many of the residential projects built in
these zones contain an affordability component ranging from 15% to 100% of
affordable units. Because Pasadena’s zoning districts and realistic densities
exceed the state “default threshold,” both the RM zone and the CD zone are
adequate to support the development of affordable housing.
                                                                     CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT       C-15

                                DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY AND RECYCLING
                                The development capacity of sites identified as potential candidates to
                                address the RHNA is determined by multiplying site acreage by the density
                                normally achieved on similar sites. A survey of six projects built in and around
                                the Central District since 2006 found that all projects built achieved maximum
                                density allowed under the General Plan. Moreover, 14 multi-family projects
                                proposed for plan check under the Garden Standards Ordinance were
                                analyzed, and all achieved at least 90% of maximum density. Because of this
                                history, the maximum density of a given zoning district is a used as a realistic
                                method of calculating the capacity for development on a particular site.
                                Concern is often expressed that small sites cannot necessarily yield affordable
                                housing without incentives for lot consolidation or financial subsidy. While
                                this rule of thumb is true for many communities, a survey of Pasadena
                                projects demonstrates otherwise. Many residential projects in specific plan
                                areas have been built on very small sites. Moreover, some projects offer all
                                affordable units on sites as small as one-half acre with 10 to 20 housing units.
                                For residential uses outside of specific plans, the land inventory only
                                identified RM-zoned sites that are sufficiently large enough to accommodate
                                at least 10 units per site, triggering local inclusionary housing requirements.
                                Shown in Table C-3, residential projects built since 2006 show several
                                commonalities. First, affordable housing can be built on parcels as small as
                                0.34 acres, with certain projects achieving 100% affordable units capable of
                                being built on sites as small as 0.6 acre. These projects demonstrate the
                                feasibility of recycling of nonresidential and residential land uses to new
                                affordable and market rate housing in Pasadena. Developers convert nearly
                                every conceivable land use (parking, nursery, apartments, hotels, mixed uses,
                                etc.) to housing, further demonstrating the feasibility of recycling.

                                                                                              Housing Resources
RECYCLING INCENTIVES
As in any housing market throughout the state, developing affordable
housing is a challenge. Land costs, size of the site, construction costs, market
demand, financing, permit processing, and other aspects affect the financial
feasibility of affordable housing. Pasadena’s success in facilitating and
encouraging the production of mixed-use projects, market rate projects with
an affordability component, or other publicly subsidized affordable projects is
due to the unique blend of incentives offered by the City.
Developers have access to various incentives that target potential constraints,
such as development regulations, financing, land assemblage, or other
feature of the project. The following incentives are available for developers.
 Density/Intensity Incentives. The sites identified in the inventory already
  allow for high densities, ranging from 32 to 87 units per acre. However, if
  affordable housing is proposed (which is usually the case with rental
  projects in the specific plan areas), the state density bonuses are applicable.
  Within parts of Central District, further density bonuses of up to 50% for
  increased percentages of affordable units are allowed.
 Flexible Development Standards. Developers have the ability to use
  flexible development standards to make projects more feasible. As
  discussed earlier in Chapter 3, these incentives include parking reductions
  for certain affordable and/or transit oriented projects, flexible means to
  address open space (for Urban Housing and Mixed Use), and affordable
  housing concessions among others.
 Land Assemblage/Write Downs. The City has an active history in
  providing land write-downs in the acquisition and disposition of housing
  sites and/or surplus properties for the construction or rehabilitation of
  affordable housing units. This is the case with the Heritage Square
  Development and numerous other affordable housing projects in the City.
  The City may also assist in the acquisition and assemblage of sites.
 Fee Waivers. Under the fee waiver program, developers can receive
  waivers of modifications of the City’s Plan Review Fee, Building Permit Fee,
  Construction Tax, and Residential Park Impact fees in exchange for 30-year
  affordability controls. As demonstrated in Chapter 3, affordable projects
  receive fee reductions of up to $25,000 per unit, with a cap of $125,000 fee
  reductions per affordable project. Many affordable housing projects have
  been funded since its inception in 1991.
 City Assistance. The City of Pasadena has established a Housing
  Opportunity Fund to support affordable housing activities. These include
  Inclusionary Housing Trust Funds, HOME, and a variety of other federal,
  state, and local funds. The Housing Division announces the availability of
  Housing Opportunity Funds on an annual basis, solicits competitive
  proposals for projects, and funds projects advancing City housing goals.

                                SUMMARY OF CREDITS
                                As shown below in Table C-4, the City will accommodate its 2014–2021 RHNA
                                through a combination of housing production and its land inventory.
                                Residential projects are credited to different income levels based on the
                                methodology and Table C-1 detailed earlier in this chapter. Sites are credited
                                toward different affordability levels based on the default density thresholds
                                set forth in housing element law, the City’s experience with recent housing
                                projects built in different zones, and expected density of development.
                                The City of Pasadena has more than sufficient housing projects in the pipeline
                                and housing sites available for residential development to exceed its 2014–
                                2021 RHNA for the housing element. Only 20% of the 2,630 housing units that
                                could be accommodated by housing sites in the land inventory would need
                                to be affordable to very low, low, and moderate income households in order
                                to fully meet the housing planning goals for the 2014–2021 RHNA.

5.        IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES
The City of Pasadena relies on a combination of financial resources and
nonprofit/for-profit organizations to assist in funding, building, preserving,
and managing affordable housing and support programs. The following
financial and administrative resources are being utilized. Program #16 of the
housing element includes provisions to seek expansion of these resources.
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
With the demise of redevelopment and cutback of many federal and state
housing programs, securing permanent sources of financing for the
production, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing is critical.
Financial resources used by the City to fund its programs are as follows.
  Inclusionary Fees. Pasadena collects inclusionary in-lieu fees from
   developers who wish to build, but pay a fee instead of building affordable
   units required under the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. These funds are
   used for the production, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing. Due to
   the recession, only $50,000 of in-lieu fees are generated annually, although
   with the recent resurgence in the housing market, in-lieu fee receipts could
   see a significant increase.
  HOME Funds. Pasadena is an entitlement jurisdiction and receives HOME
   Partnership Program funds directly from HUD. HOME funds can be used for
   activities that promote affordable rental housing and lower income
   homeownership, including but not limited to building acquisition, new
   construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-
   time homebuyer assistance, and tenant-based assistance. Since FY 2009,
   HOME funds have declined from $1.3 million to about $550,000 annually.
   The City has actively used these financial resources for preservation.
  Housing Vouchers. This federal housing program provides rent subsidies
   to very low income households with a housing cost burden or who are at
   risk of becoming homeless or displaced. The federal government provides
   approximately $11.6 million annually to the Pasadena Housing Authority to
   administer its housing voucher program. The City of Pasadena recently
   increased the allocation of vouchers to accommodate the needs of non-
   elderly people with disabilities (NED 1 & 2 program) as well as veterans
   (VASH program).
  Community Development Block Grants. The federal government
   provides CDBG funds for community development and housing activities
   that benefit low and moderate income persons, aid in the prevention or
   elimination of slums or blight, or meet other urgent needs. Eligible
   activities include property acquisition, rehabilitation, affordable housing
   preservation, economic development, code enforcement, public facilities,
   and services. Pasadena’s allocation is about $1.5 million annually. The funds
   are typically used for rehabilitation and preservation.
                                                                      CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT   C-19

Housing Resources
                                 Homeless Services. The City receives funds from the federal government
                                  for many of its activities to reduce and ameliorate homelessness in the
                                  community. The City receives $160,000 annually to support emergency
                                  shelter programs, $885,000 annually for rental subsidies and supportive
                                  services for homeless people (Shelter Plus Care), and $1 million for
                                  transitional and permanent supportive housing with services.
                                 Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Low Income Housing Tax Credits
                                  (LIHTC) are an important source of funding for the production of affordable
                                  housing. Additionally, the State of California sets aside a dedicated pool of
                                  tax credit funds for self-designated “at-risk” projects. Pasadena developers
                                  have used LIHTCs to build a wide range of affordable housing projects.
                                  LIHTCs have also been used to preserve at-risk affordable rental housing
                                  units, most notably the 313-unit Kings Villages Apartments.
                                ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
                                Pasadena collaborates and partners with a large array of nonprofit and for-
                                profit organizations to provide affordable housing and supportive services for
                                residents with special needs. Recent examples are:
                                 Rehabilitation Partners. Over the past decade, the City of Pasadena has
                                  worked with many nonprofit and for-profit partners to rehabilitate market
                                  rate and affordable housing and deed restrict the units as affordable to
                                  lower income households. Recent partners include Heritage Housing
                                  Partners, Union Station, Abode Communities, and others.
                                 New Construction. Pasadena works with a broad range of nonprofit and
                                  for-profit partners to finance and develop market rate and affordable
                                  housing, including Heritage Housing Partners (Herkimer Gardens), Los
                                  Angeles CDC (Hudson Oaks), Abode Communities (e.g., Orange Grove
                                  Gardens), Southern California Presbyterian Homes, and many others.
                                 Preservation Partners. Partners include Community Bible Community
                                  Development Corporation (e.g., Kings Village and Community Arms),
                                  Goldrich-Kest Industries (e.g., Green Hotel), Heritage Housing Partners
                                  (Herkimer Gardens), and Union Station (Centennial Place). The City is also
                                  exploring options for additional partners to assist in the preservation of
                                  publicly assisted multi-family projects at risk of conversion.
                                 Qualified Entities. Qualified entities are nonprofits approved by the
                                  California Department of Housing and Community Development. To
                                  qualify, an entity must be able to manage the project, maintain affordability
                                  for at least 30 years or the remaining term of assistance, preserve the
                                  existing occupancy profile, maintain rents at predetermined affordability
                                  levels, and agree to renew rent subsidies if available.
                                As part of the Housing Plan, the City will continue to work with and expand its
                                network of nonprofit and for-profit organizations to build affordable housing,
                                rehabilitate housing, preserve housing, and provide supportive services to
                                Pasadena residents, families, and persons with special needs.

D. Program Evaluation
Appendix D contains an analysis of the effectiveness of the existing housing
element; the appropriateness of goals, objectives, and policies; and the
progress in implementing programs for the previous planning period.
1.        ACCOMPLISHMENTS
The 2008–2014 Housing Element goals were drafted to implement the
required statutes in California housing element law and follow priorities
expressed by the Pasadena community, including input received from the
City Council, Planning Commission, and City staff. To that end, the housing
element contained four primary goals, along with 30 supporting policies and
several dozen implementation programs.
The four housing goals were:
  Goal 1. Housing and Neighborhood Quality. Promote and maintain
   sustainable neighborhoods of quality housing, parks and community
   services, infrastructure, and other services that maintain and enhance
   neighborhood character and the health of residents.
  Goal 2. Housing Supply and Diversity. Promote an adequate supply and
   diversity of quality rental and ownership housing opportunities suited to
   residents of varying lifestyle needs and income levels.
  Goal 3. Housing Assistance. Expand and protect opportunities for
   households to find housing in Pasadena and afford a greater choice of
   rental and homeownership opportunities.
  Goal 4. Special Housing Needs. Provide adequate housing opportunities
   and support services for Pasadena seniors, people with disabilities, families
   with children, college students, and people in need of emergency,
   transitional, or supportive housing.
Following the adoption of the housing element in 2009, Pasadena was tasked
with following through on its implementation programs. This task has been
curtailed by the most severe recession since the Great Depression and
significant loss in tax revenues. Meanwhile, in an effort to bail out California’s
budget deficit, the Legislature and Governor appropriated billions of dollars
in local redevelopment dollars, eventually leading to the dissolution of
redevelopment altogether. In 2013, the Governor then vetoed AB 1229, which
would have allowed cities to continue inclusionary housing under state law.
Although a recovering economy will eventually produce a California budget
surplus in the foreseeable future, local governments are left with a permanent
and structural deficit in long-term funding for housing.

Program Evaluation
                                GOAL 1: HOUSING REHABILITATION AND PRESERVATION
                                The City’s 2008–2014 Housing Element had a comprehensive program to
                                encourage the repair, maintenance, and improvement of housing. This was
                                accomplished through several housing inspection programs (Quadrennial
                                and Occupancy programs) and the Code Compliance program. In addition,
                                the City has several housing rehabilitation programs to repair homes and
                                housing preservation activities directed at preserving at-risk housing projects.
                                The following lists a few of the many program highlights.
                                Code Enforcement
                                The City’s 2008–2014 Housing Element also set forth several major inspection
                                and code enforcement programs. Approximately 4,000 code compliance
                                inspections, 1,600 occupancy inspections, and 5,300 inspections under the
                                Quadrennial Inspection Program are completed each year. The Building
                                Department also conducted numerous property and structural building
                                inspections as part of their work program. These activities are essential for
                                monitoring and ensuring that homes are maintained in a safe condition.
                                In addition, the City of Pasadena’s City Resources Against Substandard
                                Housing (CRASH) program focuses on more serious health and safety issues.
                                These have included addressing violations at boarding homes, illegally
                                operating apartment projects, squatter homes, and other situations where
                                fire hazards have resulted in a loss of property and life. The City’s CRASH Team
                                continues to enforce local and state housing and property maintenance
                                codes to protect the health, safety, and welfare of residents.
                                Historic Preservation
                                The City’s historic rehabilitation programs continue substantial activity. The
                                historic preservation ordinance continues to be implemented. In 2012, City
                                staff continued to review cases for alterations, additions, and rehabilitation
                                and processed designation of 21 new landmark properties. Moreover, Mills
                                Act contracts were signed with 26 property owners. Signature properties
                                were also rehabilitated, as discussed later. In addition, the City has been active
                                in establishing historic or landmark districts. Since 2006, these include:
                                  2013–Weston-Bungalowcraft Landmark District.
                                  2011–Raymond-Esther Landmark Overlay District
                                  2009–Marengo Pico Landmark Overlay District
                                  2007–Highlands Landmark Overlay District
                                  2006–North Pasadena Heights Landmark Overlay District
                                  2006–South Madison Avenue Landmark Overlay District
                                  2006–Bellefontaine Landmark Overlay District
                                  2006–Tournament Fields Landmark Overlay District
                                  2006–South Hudson Landmark Overlay District

Housing Rehabilitation
As a well-established community with an older housing stock, Pasadena has
always maintained a number of housing rehabilitation programs. However,
due to significant funding restrictions in recent years, many of these
programs have changed or become inactive. The PHNS filed for bankruptcy,
and the Repair and Neighborhood Revitalization program was discontinued.
The MASH program was retooled to focus more on lead-based paint hazards.
The Multi-family Housing Rehabilitation Program was also put on hold
pending a revisiting of its guidelines and funding availability.
Despite these major obstacles, the City was successful in completing several
projects involving housing rehabilitation and preservation.
  Herkimer Gardens. The Herkimer Gardens Apartments is the only
   Pasadena apartment building designed by Charles and Henry Greene. The
   development consists of 3 buildings: the Herkimer Apartments, Hammond
   House, and a separate mixed-use building. Extensive rehabilitation restored
   this historic structure and made it available to qualified homebuyers. The
   Herkimer Arms Project, funded by the City of Pasadena and restored by                   Herkimer Gardens Before
   Heritage Housing Partners, received an award for excellence from the Los
   Angeles Conservancy.
  Euclid Villa. In 2010, Union Station received a $1.18 million grant from the
   HACoLA, City of Industry Program to renovate Euclid Villa, a 14-bed
   transition housing facility. The grant covered green building and energy
   efficiency improvements that extended the life of the project. The two
   buildings—the 8,800-square-foot mansion and a 10,400-square-foot 1940s
   residential building—provide apartments for 14 families, plus staff offices, a
   common kitchen, computer lab, community rooms, and children’s area.
   This Colonial Revival home built in 1900 as a school for girls is listed on the
   National Register of Historic Places.
                                                                                           Herkimer Gardens After
  Livingstone Hotel. The Livingston Hotel was built in 1926 and served as a
   hotel for 80 years. During the planning period, a private developer initiated
   a conversion to condominiums and the construction of 1,700 new square
   feet of retail space and 34 new condominiums. The project also provided
   five new inclusionary off-site housing units affordable to moderate income
   households. Pasadena assisted in this historic conversion project by
   providing a density bonus, affordable housing concession, development
   standard waivers, and floor-area-ratio bonus.
Taken together, the City of Pasadena continues to make substantial progress
in addressing housing rehabilitation and property maintenance needs.
However, recent funding cutbacks have severely impacted current programs.
As part of the 2014–2021 Housing Element, the City anticipates reexamining
its existing mix of rehabilitation programs, continuing to seek new financial             Euclid Villa Rehabilitation
and administrative partners, and restoring programs to the extent feasible.
                                                                       CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT             D-3

Program Evaluation
                                GOAL 2: HOUSING DIVERSITY AND SUPPLY
                                State housing element law requires all cities in California to update their
                                housing element, one chapter of the general plan. The housing element is
                                designed with the express purpose of facilitating the production,
                                improvement, and conservation of housing for people of all income levels
                                and household types. The Southern California Association of Governments
                                (SCAG) established a housing construction goal for the planning period of
                                2006–2014 totaling 2,869 housing units.
                                The City of Pasadena’s progress toward meeting its goals was determined by
                                counting all building permits issued or projects approved during that period.
                                In some cases, projects approved may carry across housing element cycles.
                                No affordable housing projects were preserved that could count toward the
                                alternative sites option and the RHNA. These figures slightly undercount
                                actual progress because vouchers for homeless services are not included, nor
                                is the construction of group housing (e.g., emergency shelters).
                                The City facilitated the construction of an estimated 3,175 condominiums,
                                senior housing, accessible housing, apartments, and family housing. The
                                City’s IHO, density bonus ordinance, and other regulatory incentives were the
                                tools to require and make feasible the provision of affordable housing units in
                                Pasadena. The following IHO projects provided affordable units on site and
                                were built during the 2006–2014 RHNA housing element planning period.

Project Successes
Pasadena facilitated a significant amount of new housing construction
through the application of density bonuses, inclusionary housing, affordable
housing concessions, and other regulatory incentives and financial assistance.
Examples of projects are described below.
  Stuart Apartments. At the eastern terminus of the Gold Line, the Sierra
   Madre Transit Station, the City approved the construction of the Stuart
   Apartments. This 188-unit project sits adjacent to the transit station along
   Foothill Boulevard. The Stuart Apartments is an example of adaptive reuse
   of a portion of the historic Stuart Pharmaceutical building. These
   apartments are transit accessible (sharing Gold Line parking) and are
   designed to support and strengthen adjacent commercial uses.
  Del Mar Station. Pasadena continues to encourage the production of
   transit-oriented uses along the Gold Line Rail. In 2006, the City adopted
   mixed-use standards to encourage the construction of transit-oriented
   development (TOD) projects within one-quarter mile of a light-rail station
   platform and within the greater Central District Transit-Oriented Area.                   Stuart Apartments
   Using development standards and incentives for TOD projects, the 347-unit
   Del Mar Apartment project was built. This project incorporated the historic
   depot and train station and provides 21 affordable units.
  Westgate Classics. Pasadena continues to encourage the production of
   TOD projects along the Gold Line Rail. In 2005, the City adopted mixed-use
   standards and TOD standards to encourage projects within a quarter-mile
   radius of a light rail station and the greater Central District Transit-Oriented
   Area. Using TOD incentives, Pasadena approved the 820-unit Westgate
   project. This $100 million project incorporates apartments, townhomes,
   flats, and lofts. The first phase of the project, now complete, includes 96
   very low income rental units on site.
Shown in Table D-2, Pasadena has been successful in addressing much of its
RHNA goals, including 32% of its very low income goal, 28% of its low income
goal, and 68% of the moderate income goal. This progress is substantial given
the worst recession in generations, the governor’s take of redevelopment                    Del Mar Transit Station
funds and dissolution of redevelopment agencies, the foreclosure and
lending crisis, and drastic reductions in affordable housing funds.

                                 GOAL 3: HOUSING ASSISTANCE
                                 The City of Pasadena implemented programs to assist in the attainment of
                                 affordable housing for residents of all income levels. These included the rental
                                 housing voucher program, activities targeted at preserving publicly assisted
                                 rental projects at risk of losing affordability covenants, and the
                                 homeownership program. Notable successes are described below.
                                 Rental Assistance
                                 The Pasadena Housing Department, through its contract with HUD, provides
                                 four rental assistance programs. This includes the Section 8 Housing Choice
                                 Vouchers (HCV), Shelter Plus Care, HOME Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, and
                                 Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS. These programs provide
                                 affordable rental housing to approximately 1,567 very low and low income
                                 households, or about 3% of all households residing in the City of Pasadena.
                                 The City’s Public Housing Agency Plan and Rental Assistance Plan detail the
                                 Agency’s rental assistance priorities, programs, and various services.
                                 The Pasadena Housing Authority has continued to expand the HCV program.
                                 In 2010/11, the Pasadena Housing Authority was awarded funding for 100
                                 new Section 8 HCVs for non-Elderly Disabled (NED) persons on the waiting list
                                 and those who are living in institutional or other health care settings until
  Hudson Oaks Senior Housing     they can afford mainstream rental housing units. In 2012, the City also
                                 secured an additional 25 vouchers under the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive
                                 Housing (HUD-VASH) program that combines HCV rental assistance for
                                 homeless veterans with case management and clinical services. Finally, 44
                                 additional vouchers were secured for the Hudson Oaks project.
                                 Meanwhile, continued cutbacks in federal government programs have
                                 resulted in the discontinuation or winding down of certain traditional rental
                                 housing assistance programs offered by the City of Pasadena. For instance,
                                 the HOME Tenant-Based Rental Assistance program will no longer accept new
                                 applicants, although the current recipients will continue to receive assistance
                                 through their contracted two-year term. The City of Pasadena was also
                                 required to phase out the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (funds can
                                 be used for security deposit and back rent). Because of dramatic cutbacks in
                                 funding, these programs are being phased out.
                                 Housing Preservation
                                 Pasadena’s 2008–2014 Housing Element included the goal of preserving the
                                 more than 2,500 publicly assisted affordable housing units in the community.
                                 According to the at-risk analysis included in Appendix A, potentially more
                                 than 800 units are at risk of conversion to market rents. Pasadena has been
                                 successful in preserving the Kings Village and the Green Hotel in the early
                                 2000s, as funding became available. In 2010, the City also secured 116
                                 housing vouchers and $2 million in City of Industry funds to rehabilitate and
                                 preserve the long-term affordability of the Centennial Place project. The City
                                 also negotiated to allow the Meredian Apartments to be converted to
                                 condominiums provided that 20 units were set aside as affordable units.

Homeownership
Pasadena has long supported expansion of homeownership opportunities.
The City’s Homeownership Opportunities Program (HOP) provides loan
assistance to eligible low and moderate income first-time home buyers. In
recent years, program activities have been significantly curtailed due to
cutbacks in the same funding sources. Nonetheless, significant progress has
been made during the planning period. Several projects are described below
and all are listed in Table D-3.
  Fair Oaks Court. Heritage Housing Partners developed this project in
   Northwest Pasadena. This provides affordable condominiums to 33 low and
   moderate-income households, 3 workforce income households, and 4
   above moderate income households. The project won local awards from
   Affordable Housing Finance and the Southern California Association of
   Nonprofit Housing. The project also won Gold Nugget awards of merit for
   Outstanding Attached Project and one for Residential Community.
                                                                                         Fair Oaks Court
  Haskett Court. Haskett Court is deemed one of the finest remaining
   examples of a 1920s bungalow court in Pasadena. The Haskett family
   continued to own and live in the bungalow court until the early 1980s, at
   which time it was converted to commercial/retail use. In late 2007, HHP
   acquired, rehabilitated, and converted Haskett Court to homeownership.
   Completed in 2009, the one- and two-bedroom units were sold to first-time
   low- and moderate-income homebuyers.
  Washington Classics. Pasadena worked with Trademark Development to
   build the Washington Park Classics, an 8-unit single-family townhome
   project at the northeast corner of Washington Boulevard and El Molino
   Avenue. The project used IHO funds and City efforts to help acquire the site
   and close a liquor store that had become a public nuisance. The
   townhomes are a mix of two- and three-bedroom units ranging in size from
   1,300 to 1,600 square feet. At least four of the homes will be sold as                 Haskett Court
   affordable housing for low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers.

                                 GOAL 4: SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
                                 Because Pasadena has a large number of residents who have greater difficulty
                                 in securing and maintaining affordable housing, Goal 4 of the housing
                                 element was directed at addressing those with special needs in the
                                 community. Specifically, the goal was to provide adequate housing
                                 opportunities and services for seniors, people with disabilities, families with
                                 children, college students, and people needing emergency, transitional, or
                                 supportive housing.
                                 These goals were met by specific policies designed to provide services and
                                 housing for each group as feasible. Specific successes are described below:
                                  Senior Housing. In 2009, Abode Communities acquired and rehabilitated
                                   the building at 1267 N. Hudson. Built in 1971, the property sustained
                                   serious fire damage in 2005 and was closed for years. The City purchased
                                   the site and granted a 99-year lease to Abode Communities, who rebuilt
                                   the building and deed restricted 44 units as affordable to extremely low
    Orange Grove Apartments        income seniors earning less than 30% of median family income. The project
                                   is funded with up to $4.5 million in City housing funds, tax credits, and City
                                   of Industry funds. The City Council also approved allocation of 44 project-
                                   based vouchers. The project cost a total of $17 million.
                                  Family Housing. Orange Grove Gardens is a 38-unit apartment project
                                   offering family-sized units affordable to very low income households. In
                                   addition to housing, the apartment project features landscaped courtyards,
                                   underground parking, and a community room. The services program links
                                   residents with services such as computer literacy, adult education, family
                                   health screening, financial literacy, ESL classes, and after-school programs.
                                   The project cost $13.9 million and was funded through federal HOME
                                   funds, Fannie Mae American Communities Fund, tax increment, LIHTC, City
                                   of Industry funds, and Section 8 rent subsidies.
                                  Student Housing. Fuller Theological Seminary updated its Master Plan in
                                   2006 to increase its affordable student housing to accommodate up to
                                   2,014 students by 2019. The City worked with Fuller Seminary to approve
                                   and condition its 179-unit apartment project. City staff also worked with
                                   Caltech to update its Master Development Plan in 2006 and will be working
                                   with Caltech to revise its current master development plan. City staff also
                                   worked with the Art Center College of Design to add 200 to 300 new
                                   housing units as part of the Master Plan. Plans for the Art Center did not
                                   materialize into new units due to the downturn in the market.
                                  Union Station. Union Station Foundation, the San Gabriel Valley’s largest
    Fuller Seminary Housing
                                   private agency serving poor and homeless people, completed a new
                                   women’s dormitory at their facility at 412 S. Raymond. More than seven
                                   years in the making, the project now provides 20 beds exclusively for
                                   women recovering from homelessness. Building renovations and
                                   expansion also included offices, a multi-purpose room for classes, and
                                   additional parking for staff and volunteers.

Permanent Supportive Housing
The Centennial Place was formerly a historic YMCA facility designed in the
Mediterranean Revival Style and listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. Over its long history, the facility fell into disrepair and was eventually
closed. In 1989, the former Pasadena Community Development Commission
approved $4.5 million in loans assistance to acquire and rehabilitate the
historic and iconic building. In return, affordability covenants were recorded
that required 144 units to be set aside as affordable to very low income
households. The Centennial Place project was completed in 1991 and has
been operated and managed by Abode Communities for the past 20 years.
In 2009, the City, Abode Communities, and Union Station Homeless Services
collaborated to convert the project into permanent supportive housing. The
City allocated 116 new Section 8 Project-based Vouchers, $1 million dollar
grant from HACoLA, and City of Industry funds to improve the sustainability
of the project. Moreover, in 2010, the City’s Public Works Department
committed capital grant funds of $300,000 to incorporate green and
sustainable measures in the project. These efforts extended the affordability
covenants nearly 50 years, from 2019 to 2067. The City will also receive 50% of
the owner’s share of project residual receipts, which will be deposited into the
City’s General Fund. Finally, these collaborative efforts resulted in the long-
term preservation of an iconic and landmark structure in Pasadena.

                                                                                           Program Evaluation
2.        PUBLIC OUTREACH
California law requires that local governments include public participation as
part of the housing element. Specifically, Government Code section
65583(c)(7) states “that the local government shall make a diligent effort to
achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in
the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe this
effort.” State law does not specify the means and methods for participation;
however, it is generally recognized that the participation must be inclusive.
The City of Pasadena continues to engage the community in defining City
housing needs and discussing creative ways to address them within the
unique constraints facing the City. During the preparation for this housing
element, the City’s outreach program included the following venues:
 Land Use Workshop. During the preparation of the land use and mobility
  element, the City of Pasadena held at least six workshops that dealt with
  housing and the land use plan. Held during 2011 and 2012, these
  workshops focused on where the City should direct residential growth and
  the types of housing products desired. These strategies underpin the City’s
  growth strategy articulated in the housing element. A summary of the
  general plan outreach effort, which includes housing, can be found at
  http://www.cityofpasadena.net/GeneralPlan/Outreach_Summary_Report/.
 Stakeholder Interviews: The City interviewed stakeholders in Pasadena
  about their perception of housing needs, constraints to meeting housing
  needs, and potential programs. Stakeholders represented a wide diversity
  of groups that included homeless and mental health service providers,
  community organizations, affordable housing organizations, developers,
  faith-based organizations, residents, real estate industry, and many others.
 Community Workshops. A community-wide workshop was held on June
  8, 2013, to solicit input from the public about the housing needs and issues
  facing the community. These workshops were extensively advertised
  through the Neighborhood Connections office, which notifies 90
  organizations in the City with more than 1,200 members. The public was
  invited to attend and share thoughts and comments. Comments from the
  workshop were made available on the City’s website.
 Commission Hearings. Pasadena has an active commission structure that
  is designed to obtain input from a broad segment of stakeholders with
  regard to housing and other civic affairs. The City therefore solicited input
  on the housing element from four commissions: 1) the Human Services
  Commission on July 10, 2013; 2) the Senior Commission on July 31, 2013; 3)
  the Northwest Commission on August 8, 2013; and 4) the Planning
  Commission on September 11 and October 9, 2013.
City staff also carefully considered comments made over the past three years
on housing issues during the General Plan Land Use and Mobility Element.

Program Evaluation
                                PUBLIC COMMENTS: HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
                                Pasadena is known for its exceptional quality of life, and residents cherish that
                                aspect. Participants raised questions about the continued need to maintain
                                the quality and character of residential neighborhoods. Development
                                pressures, the need to preserve historic character, older apartments in need
                                of repair, and ongoing code enforcement continue to be important themes.
                                Key ongoing themes heard include:
                                 Community Character. Although the focus of the outreach effort was
                                  housing, residents were passionate about what made Pasadena a special
                                  place. Focus always wove around preserving and recognizing Pasadena’s
                                  key attributes—small-town feel; great neighborhoods; historic architecture
                                  and preservation; trees and the beautiful natural setting; diversity of
                                  people, businesses and neighborhoods; and other attributes to preserve.
                                 Neighborhood Quality. Some participants believed that neighborhood
                                  quality does not adequately cover resident concerns. Housing policies
                                  should protect not only the quality of single-family neighborhoods, but
                                  also character. Chapter 7 of the 2010 Housing Element, where it reads
                                  “maintaining neighborhood quality” add the phrase, “and character.”
                                 Historic Preservation. Use caution in establishing Historic Landmark
                                  Districts as homes lived in by affordable, low-income people who may not
                                  be able to maintain or pay for restoration or maintenance of their property.
                                  Moreover, establishing such districts also, as currently written, preclude
                                  more and more areas from consideration of second unit developments.
                                 Preservation of Housing. Often, the focus of housing policy seems to be
                                  about new housing for new residents. Preservation of housing for existing
                                  residents is more important. Preservation should be about preserving
                                  mixed-income neighborhoods, preserving existing market rate affordable
                                  housing, not just about preserving historic architecture.
                                 Housing Conditions. Although housing conditions are relatively good
                                  throughout the majority of Pasadena, certain areas need improvement.
                                  Lack of inspections, including interior inspections, has a negative impact on
                                  neighborhoods. More code enforcement is needed in these areas. Landlord
                                  licensing may result in improved maintenance and accountability.
                                 Second Units. Second units raised considerable concern among
                                  participants. For some, second units should be precluded in hillside areas
                                  because of steep topography, roadway access, and incompatibility area. For
                                  others, the second unit ordinance should be customized, allowing units
                                  depending upon location and/or compatibility in historic districts.
                                 Resident Diversity. Participants valued the significant diversity of
                                  Pasadena’s residents—its race/ethnicity, income, age, and household types.
                                  However, concern was expressed that continued increases in housing
                                  prices and rents were driving out African Americans, causing properties to
                                  be demolished, displacing lower income residents and seniors.

PUBLIC COMMENTS: HOUSING SUPPLY AND DIVERSITY
Participants raised questions about providing the appropriate mix and
affordability of units. This includes not only traditional forms of housing, but
also alternative models that might provide more opportunities for affordable
housing for lower income and special needs households.
Key ongoing themes heard include:
  Second Units. The current second unit ordinance has a large (15,000
   square feet) lot size requirement that constrains second unit development.
   Instead of focusing on lot size to determine neighborhood compatibility,
   the City should consider the context in which a site/lot is located. Moreover,
   if the goal is to increase the inventory of affordable housing, an
   affordability covenant should be considered as an effective tool.
  Parking Options. Parking allowances were also discussed. In certain parts
   of Pasadena, more flexible parking requirements could be beneficial. This
   includes bike parking spaces in lieu of auto parking spaces. The Central
   District might also benefit from provisions that allow for the unbundling of
   parking with apartment rent so that renters with no cars pay less rent.
  Developer Fees. The question of developer impact fees came up. One
   participant noted that developer fees are two to three times the rate of
   other communities. This made it extremely difficult for smaller residential
   projects to be built. The cumulative cost of the land, removal of structure,
   and IHO made it financially infeasible to build small residential projects.
  Affordable Housing. Production of affordable housing adequate to meet
   the City’s needs was a continued theme. This included making sure the
   right mix, tenure, and type of housing was built (e.g., small versus family
   housing). Some participants advocated a set percentage as a goal for
   affordable housing as an important strategy for the housing element
  Inclusionary Options. As the IHO is the primary affordable housing tool,
   participants expressed concern about the Palmer Case. The City might
   explore increasing the percentage of inclusionary units, modifying or
   eliminating the in-lieu fee to encourage the production of on-site units, or
   making other changes to encourage the appropriate mix and type of units.
  Funding Constraints. When the market improves, the IHO in-lieu fees will
   likely increase some. However, other state and federal funds are being cut.
   Critical funding losses led to discussion about opportunities for improving
   financing options. Ideas included establishing dedicated level of funding
   for affordable housing, using the documentary transfer tax on all properties
   sold, establishing a community land trust, or securing new grants.
  Small Lot Ordinance. Participants also discussed the option of evaluating
   the appropriateness of a small lot ordinance. These types of ordinances are
   being implemented in Glendale, Los Angeles, and other local communities.
   Small lot homes have been beneficial in that such homes are more
   affordable, easier to park, more easily financed than condominiums, and
   allow for the improvement of built out areas in a community.
                                                                       CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT   D-19

                                PUBLIC COMMENTS: HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND
                                SPECIAL NEEDS
                                The City has an impressive inventory of affordable housing that has been
                                developed over the past decade. Given past trends in the housing market and
                                the desire to maintain a socially and economically diverse population,
                                participants offered many ideas on how to increase assistance to existing
                                residents, particularly those with lower and moderate incomes.
                                Common themes heard during the outreach are below.
                                 Preservation of Existing Affordable Units. Pasadena has a significant
                                  number of market-rate rental units affordable to lower income households.
                                  These projects are gradually being replaced by higher end developments.
                                  Rather than focus solely on new housing production, the City should
                                  protect affordable rental housing units for existing renters in Pasadena.
                                  Some residents desired a policy of either “no net loss of affordable units” or
                                  “one-to-one replacement” for the loss of low and very low income units.”
                                 Tenant Protections. City needs to have an ordinance to protect tenants,
                                  particularly when tenants are displaced from housing due to excessive rent
                                  increases, demolition of existing affordable housing, or conversion to other
                                  use. A stronger tenant protection ordinance could include: 1) protections
                                  from numerous rapid rental increases; 2) stronger relocation requirements
                                  where needed, and 3) prevention of unjust evictions without cause.
                                 Special Needs Housing. Participants seemed to unanimously agree with
                                  the City’s menu of programs and efforts to address special needs housing.
                                  However, several mentioned that all residential units should be wheelchair
                                  accessible for people with disabilities and that there should also be a policy
                                  for mandatory retention of all affordable senior housing.
                                 New Affordable Housing Models. Given the change in the economy and
                                  funding sources, participants continued to mention a need to explore and
                                  adopt new models for creating and maintaining affordable housing. These
                                  include faith-based models, a community land trust model, program to
                                  preserve single-family homes, and small lot ordinances, among others. The
                                  City should look for best practices throughout the country.
                                 Public Education and Dialog. This housing element update period is one
                                  of the shortest in California. Participants felt that more education and
                                  engagement is necessary. The City could benefit from a stronger learning
                                  environment, and decision making on housing needs to be more inclusive.
                                  All income levels needs to be encouraged to contribute to housing issues.
                                  This may include creating a Housing Commission to stimulate affordable
                                  housing and to provide information on housing issues to the community.

E. Community Initiatives
Appendix E is a summary of community initiatives highlighted during forums
held for the Housing Agenda for Action, Housing Affordability Task Force, and
other community forums that addressed contemporary housing issues.
INTRODUCTION
Pasadena is an excellent model of a successful urban community, and citizen
participation is critical to that vision. The City’s vision affirms that people who
live and work in Pasadena are the greatest asset. Pasadena welcomes the
involvement and commitment that produces a greater quality of life, with
citizens and city government working in partnership. This vision is reflected in
the general plan as a guiding principle in that informed community
participation is a permanent part of achieving a greater City. Such a process is
also important for the housing element update.
Since the general plan is a snapshot of community values at a given point in
time, it is essential that there is a process for continuously involving the public
in planning, monitoring, implementation, and updating the general plan.
Informed discourse occurs when there is an exchange of clear and
understandable information, and opportunities for citizen input are available.
The need for public discussion is critical in the subject of housing, where
Pasadena has wrestled with an increasingly uncertain context.
The City held numerous forums to explore timely issues affecting housing
policy and programs. Some of the larger efforts undertaken include:
  Housing Affordability Task Force (2004)
  Tenant Protections Task Force (2005)
  City of Gardens Committee (2005)
  PUSD 711 Commission (2005)
  Housing Summit (2006)
  Housing Agenda for Action (2006)
  Workforce Housing Task Force (2007)
  Condominium Conversion Task Force (2008)
  Second Unit Community Meetings (2009)
Through these forums, initiatives were raised by the community, and the
merits and drawbacks were debated. Although many initiatives are no longer
applicable due to changes in the economy or they have been implemented,
the original effort has been included here as a record of those proceedings. As
the economy improves and housing market changes, relevant issues may be
revisited during the period covered by the 2014–2021 Housing Element.
                                                                          CITY OF PASADENA | HOUSING ELEMENT E-1

                              1.        HOUSING PRODUCTION
                              Pasadena’s need for affordable housing has been the result of many factors.
                              The demand for housing has been fueled by historical underproduction of
                              housing in the San Gabriel Valley, demographic change locally and regionally,
                              and the emergence of Pasadena as the major city center for employment,
                              history/culture, and education. As the San Gabriel Valley continues to
                              experience population and employment growth, these factors will increase
                              the demand for and price of housing.
                              The Housing Affordability Task Force (HATF) identified key issues that
                              contribute to the housing shortage today.
                               Greater Need for Affordable Units. Preliminary regional housing need
                                figures indicate an unmet future need for 2,982 housing units from 2005–
                                2014. Of these new units, an estimated 54% of the new housing need will
                                be needed for very low, low, and moderate income households. Production
                                goals will likely be similar for future planning periods as well.
                               City Buildout. The City is approaching residential buildout in downtown—
                                many of the specific areas that have historically accommodated housing
                                are reaching their cap. Yet the City wants to preserve lower density
                                character in existing neighborhoods. These factors underscore the
                                importance of targeting growth to selected areas and transportation
                                corridors best suited to accommodate housing.
                               Development Standards. The HATF contended that development
                                standards, such as open space requirements and City of Gardens
                                requirements, could be constraining the production of housing and, by
                                inference, the production of affordable housing subject to the inclusionary
                                housing ordinance. Mention was also made of potentially revisiting the
                                second-unit ordinance as well.
                               Lack of Regional Coordination. Lack of regional coordination and inter-
                                jurisdictional equity in the development and dispersion of affordable
                                housing among the San Gabriel Valley and Arroyo/Verdugo cities. Although
                                each jurisdiction within the area is responsible for meeting its own housing
                                obligations, Pasadena is the only city that meets its needs.
                               Rising Housing Prices. Although not originally identified by the HATF, the
                                increase in housing prices has resulted from historically low interest rates,
                                lax lending practices allowed, overvalued land prices, and sheer speculation
                                in the housing market. These market forces came to fruition in 2007 and led
                                to one of the deepest downturns in recent memory.
                              The remainder of this appendix lists each major housing program discussed,
                              assesses the applicability and appropriateness of the housing program for the
                              City of Pasadena, and indicates progress and/or accomplishments to date.

                                                  With densities this high, maintaining sufficient
                                                  open space in private development is key to
                                                  ensuring livability.
                                                  Even if maximum residential densities
                                                  increased by the reduction of open space, the
                                                  number of affordable units created would be
                                                  limited to only 15% of new units. The trade-off
                                                  between the loss of valuable open space that

                                                  accommodate 2,300 additional units by 2015,

                                                  accommodate 1,500 units by 2015. Targeting
                                                  growth to other areas is more consistent with

2.          HOUSING DIVERSITY
State housing law requires each community to facilitate and encourage a
diverse range in types and prices of housing, affordable to all economic and
social segments. The Housing Forums proposed the need for a broad range of
housing types and prices to meet the diverse needs of Pasadena residents.
Proposed types included mixed use, work/live units, workforce housing,
cooperative housing, housing for families with children, special needs
housing, and second units. Table E-2 lists programs recommended, assesses
the applicability, and indicates progress made to date in implementing them.

3.       ENTITLEMENT PROCESS
The City of Pasadena is known for its high quality residential development
that contributes to neighborhood character. While the entitlement process
has been successful in facilitating quality residential development, the
Housing Forums raised the same common theme—that the length of the
entitlement process is a substantial impediment to the City achieving its
housing production goals. Comments from the forum specifically mentioned:
 Entitlement Process. The City’s complex entitlement process for
  residential development adds significantly to project costs and
  development risk. This includes multiple reviews for discretionary permits
  from different City commissions, including environmental reviews, and
  significant delays in obtaining funding for affordable housing projects.
 Development Fees. The City’s development fees are high, particularly
  residential impact fees, although park fees have been historically one of the
  lowest in the San Gabriel Valley. Pasadena’s building permit, plan check,
  and development impact fees rank higher than comparable cities, and now
  comprise up to 15% of construction costs.
 Review of Projects. The City Council may become too involved at times in
  individual projects by calling up residential projects for review. Rather, City
  staff should be delegated more authority in reviewing and approving
  residential projects, particularly those consistent with City goals. Projects
  are receiving duplicative review by other Commissions.
 Processing Time. A key factor affecting the feasibility of housing
  production and in particular affordable housing financing is time. Reducing
  unnecessary delay in the entitlement process while providing greater
  predictability and certainty to developers would help ensure that market
  rate and affordable housing projects are built.
Housing developers face significant challenges in constructing new housing.
For the private sector, for-profit developers must be creative and spot
opportunities that provide an acceptable rate of return on investment. The
nonprofit developer has a mission to provide housing and must combine
market savvy with a hunt for subsidies to produce homes at below-market
rates. At the same time, developers must navigate an uncertain housing
market and secure and leverage multiple financing sources.
Summarized in Table E-3 are recommendations offered by the HATF and
other groups for consideration by the City Council.

Recommendation
Although the best method of expediting project review and approval review
is undecided, it is clear that the option must meet several City objectives.
Such an expedited process must: (1) respect the current purview of existing
advisory bodies; (2) preserve neighborhood involvement and public review,
(3) ensure housing of lasting quality and design, and (4) appropriately
mitigate environment impacts. The City Planning and Development and the
Housing Division could consider an expedited review process within the City,
enhanced funding for City staff to review and expedite projects, and
improved capacity through the development of a relationship with a
Nonprofit Housing Development Corporation.

                               4.         SOCIAL DIVERSITY
                               The City of Pasadena is committed to maintaining a socially and economically
                               diverse population and affirming the contributions that each resident makes.
                               As such, the City’s commitment to diversity is reflected in the City’s mission,
                               its General Plan, Housing Vision, and the Policy on Children, Youth, and
                               Families. This statement identifies six key areas to be pursued to improve the
                               health and well-being of children, youth, and families in Pasadena—good
                               health, safety and survival, economic well-being, social and emotional well-
                               being, education, and information and access to services.
                               As discussed in earlier chapters, Pasadena has made considerable progress in
                               facilitating the production of a range of housing—senior, housing for people
                               with disabilities, student housing, mixed-use products, and many more.
                               However, because of the price and supply of suitable housing, many lower
                               and moderate income family households may locate in communities with
                               lower housing prices. Some of the challenges to providing affordable housing
                               opportunities are as follows:
                                 Changing Demographics. Pasadena has seen significant escalation of
                                  home prices and rents, to the point that only upper income households can
                                  afford housing. This is causing displacement of lower income and some
                                  minority groups. This trend is evidenced in declining enrollment in PUSD,
                                  particularly in northwest Pasadena, home to the majority of lower income,
                                  African-American, and Hispanic households.
                                 Condominium Conversions. In addition to increasing apartment rents,
                                  many older and modestly priced apartments are being converted to
                                  condominiums. Approximately 800 units have converted since 2001, with
                                  an increase in applications in recent years. While providing more affordable
                                  ownership opportunities, residents are still being displaced. This
                                  phenomenon has slowed in the past year with changes in the market.
                                 Publicly Assisted Housing. The City of Pasadena may have approximately
                                  1,000 affordable units at risk of conversion from affordable to non-
                                  affordable rents. The loss of these affordable housing units would
                                  disproportionately impact low income persons, African Americans, Latinos,
                                  and individuals and families with special needs.
                                 Housing Prices. Although not originally identified by the HATF, the
                                  increase in housing prices has also made it increasingly difficult to afford
                                  housing in Pasadena. The causes are numerous, but essentially resulted
                                  from historically low interest rates, lax lending practices, overvalued land
                                  prices, and speculation in the housing market.
                               The following Table E-4 summarizes the major initiatives proposed by the
                               community, the City’s response, and the Consultant’s assessment.

                               most cost-effective approaches to stemming displacement of residents while
                               contributing to affordable housing goals are to: (1) preserve existing
                               affordable housing at risk of conversion; (2) focus on providing financial
                               assistance to help owners of market-rate apartments improve their properties
                               in return for affordability covenants; and (3) direct efforts at extending
                               affordability covenants onto condominium conversions.

5.           HOUSING RESOURCES
All communities face the challenges of securing financial resources to
produce affordable housing, whether through intergovernmental transfer of
funds, private sources, or through the philanthropic community. Given the
high prices of land in Pasadena’s hot real estate market, it is equally important
to have available land at reasonable prices for new housing opportunities.
The Housing Forums identified key challenges in securing resources:
   High Land Costs. Given the high demand for housing and the shortage of
    vacant land, most new opportunities for affordable housing are infill. Such
    development involves the purchase of land, demolition of an existing use,
    and in some cases relocation of the use. The difficulty of acquiring sites,
    particularly those that have commercial value, has resulted in unusually
    high land costs.
   Financing Limitations. Financing affordable housing is an expensive
    proposition, usually requiring multiple private, public, and nonprofit
    partners. Pasadena has been particularly aggressive in securing funding,
    but must continue to be creative in seeking, securing, and leveraging
    funding resources. At the same time, changes in the housing market and
    financing industry have made certain funding sources no longer feasible.
   Need for Expanded Partnerships. Public-private partnerships are key to
    addressing the need for affordable housing, including the provision of
    supporting community services. Partnerships need to be cultivated to not
    only leverage and maximize limited financial resources, but also to provide
    additional administrative resources to implement housing programs.

consideration by the City Council and the City’s actions taken to date.

Recommendation
As mentioned above, the City of Pasadena has been creative and successful in
securing a wide range of funds and land for production of affordable housing.
The City has also been active in redesignating land to provide a range of
housing opportunities for persons of all income levels and abilities. However,
given the limited opportunities remaining, the City could also consider a new
land banking program and creation of a new funding source for affordable
housing through the San Gabriel Valley Trust Fund.

Recommendation
The challenge to building administrative capacity is local and subregional.
Clearly, action is needed at the local level to deal with Pasadena-based issues,
which the formation of a local nonprofit housing corporation may address.
However, given that affordable housing is an issued shared by all San Gabriel
Valley cities and that no one city can do it alone, the City could consider
formation of a subregional entity to address housing on a subregional scale.

Section 1: Introduction
Pasadena envisions a more livable and economically strong City for the 21st Century. That vision speaks
to transportation policy and sets forth a Guiding Principle that views Pasadena as “a community where
people can circulate without cars.” The vision relies upon an integrated and multimodal transportation
system that provides choices and accessibility for everyone living and working in the City. Key strategies
to achieve this vision promote non-auto travel including public transit services, parking strategies,
bicycle facilities, car-sharing programs and pedestrian components that are well coordinated and
connected with a larger regional transportation system. Such a safe and convenient transportation
system for all modes of travel is necessary to support planned land uses in the community and also to
manage mobility for residents, employees, and visitors.
The City conducted a two-year community outreach program in preparation of the 2009 Mobility
Element. The workshops, community meetings, commission meetings, public hearings and City Council
meetings provided considerable review and comments. This outreach resulted in development of a
framework for the Mobility Element that focuses on the following three major objectives:
         Enhance Livability
         Encourage walking, biking, transit and other alternatives to motor vehicles
         Create a supportive climate for economic viability
These objectives are outlined in this report which is organized into the following major chapters:
Purpose of the Mobility Element; Issues, Objectives & Policies; Mobility Plan and Implementation
Programs. Technical appendices provide more detailed information on the travel demand model, as well
as full-size images and maps that are included in the main chapters.
Eight Guiding Principles of the Pasadena General Plan:
Principle 1:       Growth will be targeted to serve community needs and enhance the quality of life.
Principle 2:       Change will be harmonized to preserve Pasadena's historic character and environment.
Principle 3:       Economic vitality will be promoted to provide jobs, services, revenues and
                   opportunities.
Principle 4:       Pasadena will be promoted as healthy family community.
Principle 5:       Pasadena will be a city where people can circulate without cars.
Principle 6:       Pasadena will be promoted as a cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment and
                   educational center for the region.
Principle 7:       Community participation will be a permanent part of achieving a greater city.

Section 2: Purpose of the Mobility Element
The ability of a community to balance and facilitate the different components of its transportation
system is important to the creation and preservation of a quality living and business environment. The
function of a community’s transportation system is to provide for the movement of people and goods
including pedestrians, bicycles, transit and other vehicle traffic flows within and through the community.
Pasadena’s General Plan Mobility Element (commonly known as the Circulation Element in other cities)
guides the continuing development of the transportation system to support planned growth. The
anticipated development pattern, as identified in the Land Use Element, will increase the use of the
City’s transportation systems, including demand for local and regional roadways. Regional growth,
particularly in north Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County, will continue to have effects on the
City since Pasadena is a regional economic activity center.
The purpose of the Mobility Element is twofold. First, and most important, it contains measures for the
implementation of the City’s Guiding Principle related to mobility – Pasadena will be a city where people
can circulate without cars. Second, the Mobility Element addresses the requirements of California state
law designed to evaluate the transportation needs of the community within the context of the region
and to present a comprehensive plan to meet those needs.
2.1 Land Use and Mobility
The Mobility Element of the General Plan demonstrates the relationship between the Land Use Plan and
the Mobility Plan for the City as required by Government Code Section 65302(b). The reason for this
linkage is that the Mobility Element is more than a transportation plan; it also concerns itself with the
mobility of people and goods, and provisions for energy, water, sewage, storm drainage and
communications. The provisions of the Mobility Element support the goals, objectives, policies and
provisions of the General Plan Land Use Element. In turn, the Land Use Element is supported by the
community's transportation system and the plans, projects, and proposals for improvement of that
system.
The Mobility Element of the General Plan is also internally consistent and complements other elements
of Pasadena's Comprehensive General Plan in conformance with Government Code Section 65300.5.
This consistency is necessary because the goals, policies, and objectives of the Mobility Element have a
direct impact on the physical, social, and economic fabric of the City.
2.2 Scope and Content of the Mobility Element
The Mobility Element sets forth goals and policies to improve overall transportation in Pasadena. The
Mobility Element’s underlying objective – promote a livable community where people can circulate
without cars – establishes its policy direction. Non-auto travel modes are emphasized in this Element in
order to recognize their role in improving the City’s environment and quality of life.

The Mobility Element is based on approaches that address the needs of multimodal corridors and
streets as well as community neighborhoods that are affected by traffic. Because Pasadena is a vibrant
economic community, local transportation is inextricably linked with the regional transportation
demand. Therefore, the Element also promotes active participation in the development and
implementation of regional policies and programs to manage and alleviate area wide traffic congestion.
The goal of the Mobility Element is to articulate objectives, policies and actions that will provide a safe,
efficient, balanced and serviceable framework. Its implementation will facilitate the movement of
people and goods within the City and provide access to the regional transportation network.
2.3 Relationships to other General Plan Elements
The 1994 General Plan established a unified vision for the future of the City that was shaped and driven
by community values reflecting the input of residents. The 1994 General Plan set a goal of reducing
dependence on single-occupancy vehicles. Since 1994, the City has aggressively pursued and
implemented many transportation-related programs to achieve the vision that “Pasadena will be a city
where people can circulate without cars.” This Mobility Element Update is consistent with that vision.

2.5 Related Transportation Plans and Programs
The Government Code recognizes the need for transportation and mobility planners to consider regional
transportation issues and improvement programs. The City of Pasadena is a vibrant, regional economic-
activity center served by regional transportation. The City is located at the critical junction of the I-210
Freeway, State Route 134 and at the entrance to the I-110 Freeway. The interface of these regional and
local systems and management of traffic transitions to and from these networks is a necessary
consideration in development of the Mobility Plan. Consequently, various provisions address efforts to
coordinate City transportation improvements with the regional transportation network. In addition, the
Mobility Element discusses the need for coordination between regional transportation agencies
including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (MTA), Foothill Transit, South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD),
the County of Los Angeles and adjoining municipal jurisdictions, and special districts such as the
Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD).
2.6 State Requirements
All components of the Mobility Element conform to the State of California's General Plan Guidelines
[Government Code Section 65302(b)]. These requirements include the following:
         Identification and analysis of mobility needs and issues
         A statement of goals, objectives and policies based on the total transportation needs of the
          community
         Diagrams, maps, and other graphic representations showing the proposed circulatory system
         A description of the proposed transportation system and the interrelated system parts including
          preparation of a computer model
         Standards and criteria for the location, design, operation and levels of service of transportation
          facilities
         A guide to the implementation of the mobility element
         Balance a multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads,
          and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban,
          or urban context for the general plan.
2.7 Public Outreach
During the entire General Plan Update process, City Staff facilitated community outreach programs at
every milestone or benchmark to gather community input or general consensus.

Section 3: Issues, Objectives and Policies
The Mobility Element contains multimodal components that will enhance the performance of
Pasadena’s transportation system. It is structured to effectively implement the objectives and policies
that reflect both citizens’ and decision-makers’ desires to provide mobility and quality access to existing
and future residential, recreational and employment uses.
The following key issues, objectives and policies were identified through extensive community and
intergovernmental outreach efforts, transportation analysis, and consideration of objectives identified in
the General Plan’s Guiding Principles.
3.1 Issues
The preliminary Outreach Program in 2009 brought forward community issues and concerns. These
comments were published in the Draft Outreach Summary Report dated 2009. The Dominant Themes
that were consistently heard pertaining to Mobility were Traffic and Transit.
Traffic congestion was identified as one of the most challenging issues facing the city. Although some
pointed out that local traffic was not nearly as bad as other areas in the region and that traffic can be a
sign of economic success, many participants expressed frustration with increase in traffic congestion.
Higher density residential and office developments in the City’s Central District were repeatedly cited as
a main cause for the increased traffic congestion experienced throughout town. Pass-through trips
travelers whose trips do not begin or end in Pasadena, were also identified as a significant cause of
traffic congestion.
Participants recognized that the need for public transportation will intensify in the future and the
challenges to meet those needs will deepen. There was a consensus that transit needs to be improved,
expanded, better coordinated, and made more accessible and affordable. Comments on transportation
included focus on local efforts such as Pasadena Transit services and Dial-A-Ride, as well as support for
regional efforts such as the Gold Line Foothill Extension.
Through this General Plan Mobility Element Update, the city is using this opportunity to redefine critical
aspects of its transportation policy. In addition to the added aspect of sustainability, the city’s
transportation system is also expected to support the goals of livability, neighborhood protection and
mobility. As a city whose street network developed in the first quarter of the 20th Century and which
has been fully urbanized for many years, Pasadena is not in a position to add new streets or to widen
existing ones. As a result, the city is electing to redefine its transportation policies to embrace a system
management concept that emphasizes improved operations strategies, expanded transit, bicycle and
pedestrian systems coupled with transportation demand management and supported by traffic calming
at the neighborhood level.
The General Plan embodies eight Guiding Principles that are used to shape development and
implementation of the City’s policies, plans and programs.
Guiding Principles
          Growth will be targeted to serve community needs and enhance the quality of life.

          Change will be harmonized to preserve Pasadena’s historic character and environment.
          Economic vitality will be promoted to provide jobs, services, revenues, and opportunities.
          Pasadena will be promoted as a healthy family community.
          Pasadena will be a city where people can circulate without cars.
          Pasadena will be promoted as a cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment, and educational
          center for the region.
          Community participation will be fostered as a permanent part of achieving a greater city.
          Pasadena is committed to public education and a diverse educational system responsive to the
          broad needs of the community.
Effective and efficient transportation services are critical components of achieving the quality of life for
residents and the economic vitality for commercial activities envisioned in the General Plan.
3.2 Objectives and Policies
Last updated in 2004, the Mobility Element is based on one of the seven guiding principles of the
General Plan: to promote a city where people can circulate without cars. Its policies and objectives are
meant to support neighborhoods, improve connectivity, promote safety, incorporate quality in design
and delivery of services, and address the needs of Pasadena’s residents, businesses, and civic

Section 4: Mobility Element Plan
The City of Pasadena benefits from a diverse transportation system that includes transit, bicycle, and
pedestrian links as well as vehicular links. The City’s local system connects with the larger regional
system, and the operation of the two systems is interdependent. The Mobility Plan establishes how the
City manages the local system to provide for the safe and convenient movement of people and goods. It
also addresses how the City influences and manages connections with the regional transportation
system.
The Plan identifies the City’s current transportation system and potential enhancements. It draws upon
objectives and policies identified in Section 3.
4.1 Local Transportation System
The vision of the Mobility Element is to promote a livable community where people can circulate
without cars. Consistent with this principle, the Mobility Plan has four primary objectives that guide
how the City’s transportation system is managed: Promote a livable and economically strong
community, encourage non-auto travel, protect neighborhoods by discouraging traffic from passing
through neighborhoods, and manage multimodal corridors to improve citywide transportation services.
Each objective is discussed below.
4.2 Fixed Route Services
The City of Pasadena benefits from an extensive network of local and regional transit routes that
provide good citywide coverage. Pasadena Transit provides a network of routes that are focused on the
major business districts; the six Gold Line Stations in Pasadena; and connections to the regional transit
service network. The system is also intended to connect residential neighborhoods to the business
districts and major trip generators. The list below includes all transit agencies that service the City
these routes consist of Local Lines and Feeder Lines:
         Six local routes provided by the City (Pasadena Transit Routes 10, 20, 31/32, 40, 51/52, 60)
         13 regional routes provided by the MTA (east-west lines: 177, 180 and 181; north-south lines:
          256, 260, 264, 267, 266 and 268; Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles: 485, 487, 489, 762 and
          780)
         One regional route provided by Foothill Transit (east-west: Route 187)
         Two regional express routes provided by Foothill Transit (Route 690) and LADOT (Route 549)

Information regarding the transit services is available in printed form and can also be found at a number
of Internet web sites. Each agency has an individual web page that provides route-specific information.
Additionally, MTA makes available travel/schedule software services that can be used to plan trips
including trips that require transfer from one transit system to another.
The City’s local transit service, Pasadena Transit, has undergone significant development since its
inception in 1994. Current plans include continued support to the Gold Line Foothill extension,
increased service levels, and increase the existing fleet with the acquisition additional of new clean-fuel
vehicles. The Short Range Transit Plan outlines future headway increases in existing routes and
potential expansion of services.
4.3 Pasadena Transit Programs
TAP
To enhance transit connectivity and accessibility, TAP cards, a universal fare transit pass program has
been adopted by several transit agencies in Los Angeles County which enhances seamless travel for
transit users. Transit users can board any participating transit system by simply “tapping” a card reader
as the customer boards a bus or enters in a rail system. Pasadena Transit recently collaborated with
MTA to install TAP card readers in all buses which are now being accepted.

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
Transit Vehicle Arrival Information System
Transit Vehicle Arrival Information System (TVAIS) enables Pasadena Transit buses to be tracked by a
system to provide customers with “real-time” arrival information. Transit customers are now able to
obtain real-time bus arrival information via an interactive voice response (IVR) component (i.e.,
information via phone), installation of real-time information signs at a number of key bus stops, the
internet, as well as automated voice announcements on the buses as buses approach bus stops.
In addition, the implementation of this project has allowed the City to track on-time performance, route
adherence, and aid dispatchers and operations personnel in quickly identifying the location of vehicles
and facilitate the resolution of incidents. This information will also be available to the City Traffic
Management Center (TMC).
The TVAIS is designed to be an efficient, effective, reliable, flexible, and expandable bus CAD/AVL system
that meets the needs of the ARTS ridership, and the City’s management, dispatchers, bus operators, and
road supervisors. Key objectives of this project include:
•         Provide improved delivery of transit information to the public
•         Improve operational efficiency
•         Improve service quality
4.4 Paratransit Service
All fixed-route, public transit buses are accessible to persons with disabilities. However, transit
operators recognize that some individuals may need a greater level of assistance. Access Services, a
regional agency, administers and manages the delivery of paratransit service within Los Angeles County.
Access Paratransit is the service name of the ADA complementary paratransit service operated by
Access Services for functionally disabled individuals. In addition, the City of Pasadena provides
supplemental, curb-to-curb, dial-a-ride service (Pasadena Dial-A-Ride) to further assist the regional
program for seniors and persons with disabilities who are unable to access local bus service.
4.5 Bicycle and Pedestrian Accessibility
Bicycle Transportation Action Plan
The City of Pasadena's Bicycle Transportation Action Plan provides specific goals, objectives, actions, and
timelines for creating an environment (1) where people circulate without a car, (2) that significantly
increases the number of people who commute by bike, (3) that increases the number of people who use
a bike for utilitarian trips, fitness and recreation, and (4) that provides business and economic benefits
for the City. The plan provides details for a network of bikeways so that every neighborhood is within
1/4 mile of an effective bicycling route in the north-south and east-west directions. The plan outlines
educational, engagement, enforcement, and evaluation strategies designed to increase bicyclist safety
by educating both bicyclists and motorists. Finally, the plan outlines strategies for funding the program.
In addition, the Bicycle Transportation Action Plan establishes goals to set the context for planning
objectives and actions to carry out the Bicycle Transportation Action Plan. They provide long-term
vision and serve as the foundation of the plan. Goals are broad statements of purpose. Objectives are
more specific statements of purpose. Actions describe actions the City can take to meet the goals and
objectives.

Existing Conditions
As of early 2014, the City of Pasadena has approximately 82 miles of bike facilities. These include:
      21 miles of bike lanes (Class II facilities).
      61 miles of bike routes, including 34 miles of bike enhanced bike lanes. The enhanced routes
          include a 4" white edge line, bike route and "Share the Road" signage.
Bicycle Facility Types
The Plan establishes four classes or categories of bikeways referred to as Class I, II, III and IV. Until
recently the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) used three categories for bikeways.
However, a fourth category, separated bikeways or cycle tracks, has recently been added to the
classification. Refer to the California Streets and Highways Code (SHC) Section 890.4 for definitions of
the four bikeway classifications defined in California.

Bicycle Parking
An important element of a bike program is available bike parking. Bike parking falls into two categories:
short-term (usually less than two hours) and long-term, which can be hours or days. The City has over
1,000 racks for short-term bike parking along with bike lockers at a number of the Metro Gold Line
stations. As part of the Bike Action Plan, the City will look at additional short-term parking as well as
meet the needs for long-term parking at areas beyond the Gold Line locations. These will include new
residential and commercial developments as well as bus stops, schools, libraries, and other civic
buildings.
Bike Safety Education and Enforcement
Safety Education
Pasadena is undertaking a bicycle outreach program, targeting commuter bicyclists and service
employees who ride bicycles as their primary mode of transportation. The safety campaign will be
developed and implemented in 2015. To complement the safety campaign, the City has procured,
distributed, and installed over 450 bicycle headlights and tail lights to bicyclists riding their bikes at night
without lights. In addition, the City will distribute bicycle helmets and additional lights throughout the
year. Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS),
through the National Highway Safety Administration. The City of Pasadena has an active campaign each
May that includes not only a bike-to-work day, but a number of events held throughout the month. The
intent of the month-long campaign is to increase awareness of bicycling, its benefits and impact, as well
Page | 19
Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
as encourage bicycling across all segments of the population. The City will also focus efforts educating
both bicycles and motorists an important aspect of being bike friendly. Bicyclists need to understand
safe bicycling behavior and the basics of bicycle maintenance. They need to understand how to deal
with traffic as well as pedestrians and other bicyclists. Motorists need to understand that bicyclists have
the same rights that vehicle drivers have. Today, they need to understand safety rules, such as the 3-
foot law.
Safe Routes to School Program
The Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Program (www.saferoutesinfo.org) focuses on both education and
infrastructure development with the goal of increasing the number of children who walk and bike to
school on a regular basis.
Open Streets Events
Open streets events have many names: Sunday Parkways, Ciclavias, Summer Streets, and Sunday
Streets. These events have become increasingly popular across the County. In Southern California, these
events have been hosted from Los Angeles to Santa Ana, Garden Grove, and San Diego. Los Angeles's
events routinely attract over 100,000 participants and have encouraged large numbers of people who
do not regularly ride a bike to come out and enjoy car-free city streets.
The City of Pasadena received an Open Streets Metro grant in 2014 and hosted the event on May 31,
2015.
4.6 Pedestrian Facilities
Pasadena has taken great strides in creating a walkable environment. In recent years, the following
pedestrian enhancements have been implemented: pedestrian signals on automatic recall rather than
requiring a button to actuate the signal; “scramble” or diagonal crossings; and crosswalks enhanced with
art designs, stamped R brick patterns, or ladder striping; pedestrian wayfinding signs.
The Pedestrian realm will be addressed through the following initiatives: Complete Streets, Specific
Plans and the Pedestrian Plan. As the Department of Transportation prioritizes the implementation of
Complete Streets, every street will be considered to create a better environment for walking. Several
pedestrian design tools will be employed through the Form Based Street Design Guidelines to make city
streets safe, attractive and accommodate pedestrians. Special attention will be given to crossings points
and traffic calming.
4.7 Complete Streets
In accordance with the California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358), the City of Pasadena City Council
adopted the Street Types Plan in March 2013. The Street Types Plan supports the implementation of the
following policy topic areas:
Streets should reflect neighborhood character and accommodate all users
      Complete Streets: Streets should accommodate all users such as pedestrians, bicyclist, public
          transit, skateboarders and scooters.
      Streets should reflect individual neighborhood character and needs, and support healthy
          activities such as walking and bicycling.

Mobility Element 2015

Department of Transportation
The 1994 General Plan Mobility Element sought to addresses some of the classification/function
inconsistencies by introducing two new types of streets – multi-modal (mobility) corridors and de-
emphasized streets. These designations carried through into the 2004 Mobility Element and are in place
today guiding city policy for what types of actions are permissible on these streets. The de-emphasized
streets begin to introduce the concept of matching the function of the street to its context and in all
cases focused on minimizing traffic on streets that while classified as arterials were essentially
neighborhood streets. The multi-modal corridors formed a loose grid network of thoroughfares.
Many of Pasadena’s traffic calming policies use the functional classification of a street as one of the
criteria for deciding whether a particular device is appropriate. Similarly the acceptable methods for
enforcing speed limits are influenced by the functional classification of the street. As more traffic
calming devices have been deployed in Pasadena, the inconsistencies between the form and designated
function of many streets have become more evident. An example of this is that the functional
classification criteria have impeded the installation of speed humps on several streets that would
otherwise be eligible for the devices under city policy.
In light of the recently mandated Complete Streets policy at the state level, Pasadena is putting more
emphasis on understanding the design responses necessary to achieve such a policy. As the emphasis
shifts from a curb-to-curb focus to one of a building-to-building (or complete right of way) focus, the
variable character (context) of the land use and urban form adjacent to the roadway becomes more
important, particularly as one attempts to balance the competing space demands for multiple modes of
travel within a constrained space.
While the multi-modal corridor/de-emphasized street designations were a step in the direction
necessary to meet the current demands, their response is limited in light of the multi-modal, multi-
functionality that is present on Pasadena’s streets today. To address the expanded needs, the city
elected to pursue a more robust context-based street classification system that draws from the
approach described in Context Sensitive Solutions in Designing Major Urban Thoroughfares for Walkable
Communities (ITE Proposed Recommended Practice 36). As noted in the initial materials prepared by
the city’s consultant team:
The City’s primary goal in developing a new street type system is that it reflect both land use context and
multi-modal function of streets as a means to prioritize decision-making about intensity and kind of
investment appropriate to each. With regard to context, the City desires a system that is reflective of the
type or types, character and intensity of land uses along a street to ensure that future investments and
efforts on those streets are appropriate to the primary users of the street – those that live, work or shop
there. With regard to the streets themselves, the City seeks a system that differentiates streets by their
function, rather than by volume, and treats all modes equally where appropriate and prioritizes modes
where appropriate.
The classification system under consideration for Pasadena has three components:
•         Context – the character of each street in terms of urban form and land use mix, particularly in
          ways that relate to the sidewalk
•         Function – the multi-modal and primary trip-type function of each street.
•         Overlays – unique factors that merit special consideration that affect design of a street, but do
          not define the predominate nature of the street.
Page | 21

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
Context and Function jointly define the street type, while Overlays may indicate special design or
management of the street. The context of a street, which is the condition of the land that fronts onto
the street right of way, and the function of the street have been organized into the following categories:
         Context                                        Function
              Freeway Frontage                             Connector City
              Downtown                                     Connector Neighborhood
              Main Street                                  Access Street
              City Mix                                     Access Yield
              Commercial and Industrial                    Access Alley
              City Multifamily Residential                 Access Shared
              Garden Multifamily Residential

4.7 Conventional Street Classification
Page | 22

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
The City of Pasadena utilizes the roadway categories recognized by regional, state, and federal
transportation agencies for grant applications to secure funding for ongoing street maintenance and
rehabilitation programs.
There are four categories in the roadway hierarchy, ranging from freeways with the highest capacity to
two-lane undivided roadways with the lowest capacity. As mentioned before, the City has jurisdiction
over roadways designated as arterial, collector, or local streets. The State of California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans) maintains and has jurisdiction over all freeways and state routes. The street
classification system is used for the purpose of indicating streets which can use federal funding for
reconstruction and resurfacing programs.
FREEWAYS: Freeways are limited-access and high-speed travel ways included in the state and federal
highway systems. Their purpose is to carry regional through-traffic. Access is provided by interchanges
with typical spacing of one mile or greater. No local access is provided to adjacent land uses. The City of
Pasadena has access to several freeways: SR-110, SR-134, I-210 and I-710.
ARTERIALS: Arterial roadways are major streets that primarily serve through-traffic and provide access
to abutting properties as a secondary function. Arterials are generally designed with two to six travel
lanes and their major intersections are signalized. There are two categories: Principal and minor
arterials. Principal arterials are typically four-or-more-lane roadways and serve both local and through-
traffic. Minor arterials are typically two-to-four-lane streets that serve local and commute traffic. These
streets provide movement within the City and are primarily for trips that originate from or are destined
to the City. Through-trips are directed to stay on arterial streets and away from residential
neighborhoods.
COLLECTORS: Collectors are streets that provide access and traffic circulation within residential and
nonresidential (e.g., commercial and industrial) areas. They connect local streets to arterials and are
typically designed with two travel lanes that may accommodate on-street parking. In some cases, they
will provide access to abutting properties.
LOCAL: Local streets distribute traffic within a neighborhood, or similar adjacent neighborhoods, and
are not intended for use as a short-cut for through-traffic between higher capacity facilities such as
collector or arterial roadways. Local streets are fronted by residential uses and do not typically serve
commercial uses.
4.8 Performance Measures
A key challenge facing the City is the current set of Performance Measure and Metrics, used in the 2004
General Plan and the Transportation Impact Review Current Practice and Guidelines, place a
considerable emphasis on the automobile operations. If these measures continue to be used in their
current form, it would present a conflict with the Mobility Element objectives.
Pasadena is currently using a conventional set of performance measures for evaluating system
performance and in reviewing the impacts of new development. Intersection volume to capacity ratios
and Level of Service (LOS) are the primary measures. The city also uses a volume-based analysis of
change in traffic on street segments to assess impact. The 1994 General Plan update went as far as to
include a measure of the environmental capacity of residential streets, essentially an estimate of the
level of traffic volume that would be acceptable on residential streets as opposed to the operational
Page | 23
Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
capacity. This measure was replaced in the 2004 update by the street segment analysis. A discussion of
staff’s proposed modifications to the Street Segment Analysis measure is included later in this report.
When looked at in the above context, the current measures are silent with regard to system
performance of non-auto modes and tend to generate mitigation solutions that encourage widening of
intersections and streets, which may compromise the performance of non-auto modes and are
increasingly contrary to community values. Consequently, a more robust set of transportation
performance measures has been developed that adds depth and balance to the existing measures of
vehicle capacity and delay while adding measures to evaluate impact on the non-motorized modes as
well as transit. The new measures also align with the sustainability goals of the General Plan by
evaluating the “efficiency” of projects by analyzing the per capita length and number of trips associated
with changes in land use.
The five adopted transportation measures with CEQA thresholds are:
1.        Vehicle Miles Traveled Per Capita
2.        Vehicle Trips Per Capita
3.        Proximity and Quality of the Bicycle Network
4.        Proximity and Quality of the Transit Network
5.        Pedestrian Accessibility
The thresholds guide system-wide bike and local transit improvements and guide pedestrian
improvements in Specific Plan Updates. The bike and transit improvements identified will be included in
a nexus study to the update of the Traffic Reduction and Transportation Improvement Fee (TRTIF)
following the adoption of the Land Use and Mobility Element updates. An analysis at the project level
impacts to the various citywide network is not necessary because projects would address their
proportionate impacts in these areas by paying their fees.
4.9 Neighborhood Protection
Pasadena has approximately 90 neighborhood organizations/associations that vary in size from a few
blocks to entire ZIP Codes. The process through which the city’s Neighborhood Traffic Management
Program has been implemented has relied heavily on a concurrence between these neighborhood
organizations and their respective City Council Districts to identify the boundaries of each NTMP. This
approach has been used to ensure that each study area has consensus on the traffic issues that are to be
addressed, which has effectively
underpinned the education elements
that the areas included in each
NTMP. This approach has also
reinforced the city’s commitment to
neighborhood protection.
However, the NTMP has been
sufficiently long-running that by the
end of this year, essentially all
neighborhood areas of the city will
have been studied as part of an
Page | 24
                                                                                          Pasadena’s NTMP

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
NTMP. Requests received from Council Offices and neighbor-hoods in the last year are for new NTMPs
to be conducted in areas where some of the original studies were conducted 10-15 years ago. One of
the outcomes of the success of the NTMP is that the small scale of each study, while effective for much
of the program’s span, is now resulting in a set of conditions where changes in one neighbor-hood area
are pushing traffic to adjacent neighborhoods that have been previously traffic-calmed in earlier NTMPs.
In recognition of this trend, the tenets of the NTMP have been revisited, particularly the exclusion of
non-local streets from the studies and the scale of problem identification (i.e., the boundaries of each
study). This assessment indicated that the city needs to be taking more of a multi-neighborhood (or
district) approach to traffic management and that the major streets that link between and through
neighborhoods need to be incorporated into the studies, not necessarily for the application of traffic-
calming to these streets, but to be better able to address the interface between major streets and
neighborhood streets.
Accordingly, the city has embarked on developing the next generation of the program, dubbed NTMP
2.0. The context-based street classification system and its resultant design guidelines are being used as
the framework for incorporating non-local streets into the NTMP process. The expanded nature of
NTMP 2.0 has necessitated a review of the city’s traffic calming policies and is allowing us to revisit
decisions made years ago about which traffic calming devices are applicable/acceptable in Pasadena.
Installation criteria and guidelines are being developed for traffic calming devices not currently in wide
use in Pasadena that include traffic circles, curb extensions, partial closures and raised crossings/speed
tables.
Rather than just expanding the reach of the NTMP to larger areas and more streets, the city is taking
advantage of this effort to achieve a better vertical integration of day to day traffic engineering actions
(traffic investigations) with the longer-term NTMP studies. This approach has resulted in a three-tiered
system that organizes activities into the following categories:
         Tier 1 – Readily Solvable Issues
              o Traffic investigations initiated by requests from residents and Council offices and
                   through day to day observations by staff of system performance
              o Typically low-cost, spot fixes that do not involve warrant analyses or other more
                   complex engineering studies nor require public involvement
         Tier 2 – More Complex Transportation Issues
              o Initiated by carry forward from Tier 1 for issues that require engineering studies but are
                   still essentially one-dimensional
              o Low to moderate cost solutions that are developed by staff with a limited degree of
                   public involvement
              o Examples include Stop Signs, Parking Timed-Restrictions, Loading Zones, Crosswalks and
                   other elements for which more detailed analytical work is necessary before a
                   recommendation can be made
         Tier 3 – System-level issues
Page | 25

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
              o   Systemic problems that involve larger areas and/or multiple neighborhoods or corridors
              o   Moderate to high cost solutions that are developed through a systematic approach that
                  includes a high degree of public involvement
              o   Initiated by carry forward from Tiers 1 and 2
              o   Examples include traffic calming devices, preferential parking districts, medians, traffic
                  diversion, neighborhood protection
4.9 Managing Demand
Achieving the City’s transportation objectives and policies necessitate a transportation system capable
of serving both existing and future demand. One way to meet this need is to implement programs
designed to manage demand. These programs are often referred to as transportation demand
management (TDM) strategies. The City of Pasadena, in order to reduce the number of vehicular trips in
general, and specifically the use of autos for drive-alone trips, has adopted a Trip Reduction Ordinance
that is applied citywide. Such trip reduction measures have been incorporated into the City’s project
review process.
Trip Reduction Ordinance
The City of Pasadena recognizes that new development and sizable additions to existing development
generate travel and parking demands that can create adverse impacts on traffic flow and parking in
surrounding areas. To address such situations, the City developed a policy, through its Trip Reduction
Ordinance, to accomplish the following:
         Encourage non-auto modes such as public transit, vanpools, carpools, and bicycles rather than
          single-occupant vehicles.
         Encourage alternative work hours that serve to reduce the typical peak demand upon the street
          network, parking facilities, and transit systems.
The Trip Reduction Ordinance applies to Nonresidential development projects, and the nonresidential
portion of mixed‑use development projects, which exceed 25,000 square feet of gross floor area, as a
result of new construction or an expansion of an existing use. These development projects are required
to reserve and designate preferential parking spaces for carpool vehicles, provide employees with
commuter-matching services and trip reduction information, and provide bicycle parking facilities
and/or other non-auto enhancements.
In addition, nonresidential development projects, and the nonresidential portion of mixed‑use
development projects, which exceed 75,000 square feet of gross floor area, as a result of new
construction or an expansion of an existing use shall comply with the conditions already mentioned.
These major development projects must also satisfy the requirements to reduce trips, such as providing
employees with discounted transit passes, parking pricing measures, etc. The trip reduction measures
must be included in a plan that must be submitted to and approved by the City. Transportation Systems
Management (TSM) Programs involve a commitment by the owner to an ongoing program. The City will
continue to explore additional trip reduction measures and update the Trip Reduction Ordinance as
needed to reduce congestion. Designated pedestrian sidewalks or paths will be provided on the
development site between the external pedestrian system and each structure in the development.
Page | 26

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
Bus stop improvements, including bus pads, bus pullouts, and right‑of‑way for bus shelters may be
required as mitigation measures if a proposed development would have substantial traffic impacts.
Lastly, multi-family projects with 100 units or more, or mixed use projects with 50 units or more, will
submit a TDM Program Plan as required.
In order to encourage non-auto travel, the Trip Reduction Ordinance also includes incentives that allow
a project to reduce the number of required employee parking spaces. Reductions can be claimed by
having an on-site Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC) and by having an approved TSM Program.
The City participates in the trip reduction initiative by providing a program for city employees. The City’s
“PRIDE SHARE” program consists of incentives for employees to rideshare or use public transit, bicycle,
or walk to work.
Transportation Management Association (TMA)
The City of Pasadena supports the Pasadena Transportation Management Association (TMA). The
organization was established in 1989 in response to the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s
(AQMD) Regulation XV. This regulation required employers with more than 100 employees to reduce
vehicle emissions through carpooling, transit use, or other modes of travel that do not rely upon single-
occupancy vehicles. The TMA is a voluntary organization which serves as a networking and information
organization that has three primary objectives: Reducing single-occupancy vehicle commuter trips,
improving air quality, and reducing congestion in the City. There are approximately 40 employers in
Pasadena who participate in the TMA.
4.10 Parking
Parking is included in the Mobility Element because the presence of off-street and on-street parking has
a direct effect on the use of the roadway. On-site parking provisions are developed in zoning regulations
consistent with the objectives of specific plans. However, Mobility Element policies discourage provision
of excess auto parking in new development, support the use of shared parking and encourage a
balanced approach that fosters non-auto travel.
The availability and pricing of on-street parking also affects the choices that travelers make, as well as
the mode of transportation they use. Many American cities continue to devote much of their land space
to the movement and storage of the automobile. Pasadena actively seeks ways to successfully develop
and maintain a transit-, pedestrian-, and bicycle-friendly environment while addressing the space needs
of the automobile consistent with adopted development plans and projects. On multimodal corridors,
transportation programs are balanced to address peak-hour parking needs, commuter travel needs, and
delivery needs of commercial areas.
An additional challenge in development of parking solutions is recognition of the unique character of
many areas of the City, which means that no one parking solution will fit all situations. The City engages
in collaborative efforts with the residential areas, the businesses and the retail community to develop
and operate auto parking programs to meet their particular needs consistent with the General Plan. In
addition, the City’s public parking facilities are planned and in some instances operated in partnership
with the business community.
The various auto parking facilities and program areas within the City. Components include:
Page | 27

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
         On-street parking in commercial areas
         Off-street parking facilities
         Preferential parking
         Light-rail station parking enforcement areas
Public Parking Facilities
The City of Pasadena owns and operates thirteen auto/parking facilities that offer low rates and user
conveniences. These parking facilities are in close proximity to retail, restaurant, entertainment, and
office buildings. In addition, bicycle racks and/or lockers have been installed in some facilities pursuant
to the City’s project review process. Additional efforts to expand bicycle parking are underway
throughout the City as part of the Bicycle Transportation Action Plan. While this document identifies the
auto parking spaces available in the City, it should be noted that privately operated parking facilities are
also available throughout the City, providing numerous parking options for the traveling public.
In Old Pasadena, there are three public parking structures that provide approximately 1,600 auto
parking spaces. In the Civic Center area there are six parking structures, providing approximately 4,500
auto parking spaces. The Playhouse District has two parking lots, providing approximately 200 auto
parking spaces. The South Lake Avenue Business District also has two parking lots available to
customers and visitors with close to 700 auto parking spaces. Many of these facilities are close to bus
routes, allowing people to park once and travel conveniently within Pasadena’s downtown areas.
Parking Meter Districts
The City has five parking meter districts with more than 2,267 parking meters: West Gateway, Old
Pasadena, Civic Center, Playhouse and South Lake. The installation of parking meters creates more
Page | 28

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
short-term parking opportunities (resulting in a higher turnover of users). Meters encourage long-term
users to park in garages or surface lots. The parking meter revenue funds collected within each parking
meter district are reinvested to improve the streetscapes and alley walkways to create a more attractive
pedestrian experience.
Overnight Parking
With growth, new development, and concern for preserving the unique quality of life in Pasadena, there
is a need for parking regulations. A City ordinance prohibiting overnight parking on City streets from 2
a.m. to 6 a.m. was implemented in 1950. It was imposed to allow street cleaning during these early
hours and to easily identify vehicles that were abandoned. Residents, for whom temporary or
permanent parking is unavailable, may apply for a Daytime or Overnight On-Street parking permit to
park during these hours.
Preferential Parking Permit
In January 1996, the City Council adopted a Preferential Parking Ordinance to control regional parking
intrusion in residential areas by way of a permit-parking program. In accordance with this Ordinance,
formal “Procedures for Establishing Preferential Permit Zones” were developed to process and evaluate
the eligibility of each request.
The established procedures include meeting with property owners, conducting traffic engineering and
parking impact studies, and reviewing petitions from the affected homeowners. The traffic engineering
and parking impact studies typically include evaluations of whether the parking intrusion is generated by
nonresidential regional traffic generators; an analysis of the available on-street parking; the hours and
days the parking intrusion occurs; and the evaluation of reasonable alternatives to eliminate the
problem. Once a proposed program has been developed, it is reviewed by the Transportation Advisory
Commission before action is taken by the City Council.
Since the program started, the following areas have been designated as preferential permit parking
districts:
                                       Neighborhood                         Approval Year

4.11 Regional Transportation Services
Pasadena is a vibrant regional economic center that benefits from good access to the regional freeway
network and greatly improved regional transit services. The challenge is to manage this resource, in
particular the transitions from the regional system to the local system, in a way that is convenient to the
user and minimizes impacts on the local community. This necessitates seeking opportunities to partner
with state and regional agencies to jointly review and implement service enhancements that address the
needs of the Pasadena community.
The following sections describe significant components of the regional transportation system.
4.12 Public Transit
There are three significant developments in the area of regional public transit that will have lasting
beneficial impacts on the City of Pasadena. First is the completion the Gold Line Foothill Extension from
Pasadena to Montclair. Second, Metro Regional Connector Project extends from the Metro Gold Line
Little Tokyo/Arts District Station to the 7th Street/Metro Center Station in downtown Los Angeles.
Metro Gold Line Light Rail System
The Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension is extending the existing Gold Line east from Pasadena. The first
phase will travel more than 11 miles from Sierra Madre Villa Station to Azusa.
Phase 1 includes new stations at:
         Arcadia
         Monrovia
         Duarte/City of Hope
         Irwindale
         Azusa Downtown
         APU/Citrus College
The Foothill Extension Construction Authority expects to complete construction between Pasadena and
Azusa in September 2015. Metro is scheduled to begin safety testing in late 2015 with a projected
opening in 2016.
The second phase will continue the line for 12 miles east from Azusa to Montclair. Funding is currently
being sought for this segment. The Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement
for the Azusa to Montclair section was certified in March 2013 and preliminary engineering began in
summer 2014.
Phase 2 includes new stations at:
         Glendora

         San Dimas
         La Verne
         Pomona
         Claremont
         Montclair
Metro Regional Connector
The Regional Connector will improve access to both local and regional destinations which extends from
the Metro Gold Line Little Tokyo/Arts District Station to the 7th Street/Metro Center Station in
downtown Los Angeles, allowing passengers to transfer to Blue, Expo, Red and Purple Lines, bypassing
Union Station. The 1.9-mile alignment will provide a one-seat ride for travel across Los Angeles County.
From the Metro Gold Line, passengers will be able to travel from Azusa to Long Beach and from East Los
Angeles to Santa Monica without transferring lines.

5. Implementation Programs
The Implementation Programs section provides a guide to actions that carry out adopted Mobility
Element policies and plans. It also provides program implementation information that enables oversight
by City elected officials, Commissions, staff, and the public. The purpose of the Implementation
Programs section is to ensure that the overall direction provided in the Mobility Element for
transportation management is translated from general terms to specific actions.
Each implementation program is a procedure or technique. Action may either occur on a citywide basis
or in specific areas within the City. The City Council recognizes the importance of long-range planning
considerations in day-to-day decision making and budgeting. Implementation of the specific programs is
subject to funding constraints.
Status reports on the Implementation Programs will be provided to the City Council on a regular basis as
part of reports on the Capital Improvement Program and in response to funding and implementation
opportunities as they arise.
The Implementation Section includes a description of the responsible agency and/or department for
each program, sources of funding, and time frame. Additional information on implementation programs
is provided in Appendix D of this document.
5.1 Implementation Opportunities: Programs and Strategies
The City seeks funding to implement transportation policies through a number of ongoing programs.
These programs, which are developed with the oversight of the City Council and responsible
Commissions, are addressed in the following sections:
Interagency Opportunities for Program Implementation
Pasadena recognizes the importance of partnering with other agencies and local jurisdictions on plans,
legislative initiatives, capital grant funding opportunities, and studies to improve and enhance
coordinated regional and local transportation services. Most funding opportunities to implement City
policies and programs occur at the federal, state and regional level through competitive grant processes.
Following is a summary of significant programs funded through such efforts.
The MTA Call for Projects
The City competes for regional funding to implement transportation projects through the “Call for
Projects” competitive grant process managed by the MTA on a two-year cycle. In recent years, the City
has been successful in securing funds to implement bicycle programs and facilities, pedestrian
enhancements, traffic management improvements, and restoration of pedestrian, bicycle, hiking and
equestrian facilities. Detailed cost and scheduling information is reported annually in the City’s Capital
Improvement Program.

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
Civic Center/Mid-Town area was awarded funding by the MTA to enhance the pedestrian environment
and other transportation components. Detailed design for the project is underway.
I-210 Integrated Management Plan
The City of Pasadena and Caltrans are currently cooperating on the development of the I-210 Connected
Corridors project to address congestion relief due to incidents on either freeway or city arterial streets.
The goal of the future phases of the project is to also address recurring traffic congestion on freeway
and adjacent arterial streets.
5.2 Federal and State Grants
Periodically, opportunities arise to secure federal and state funding for needed transportation
improvements of regional significance. In the past, federal legislation provided funding for
transportation improvements that will mitigate, on an interim basis, the traffic impact of the 710
Freeway gap on City streets.
5.3 City of Pasadena Capital Improvement Program
The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a funding program for capital projects approved annually by
the City Council. This program, which is prepared annually by the Department of Public Works, builds
upon programs that are consistent with, and implements, the City’s General Plan. Community requests
for projects are also considered in developing a recommended program. Staff’s recommendations are
reviewed by the various commissions with oversight responsibility for the projects. After that review,
the program is submitted to the Planning Commission for a finding of consistency with the City’s
adopted plans. Thereafter, the document is submitted to the City Council for approval.
In developing the CIP budget, the first priority is to focus on safety issues within the City’s infrastructure.
Safe streets and roadways are addressed in this document.
5.4 Other implementation Program and Strategies
The City aggressively pursues implementation of transportation programs through a wide range of
programs, grant opportunities, partnership initiatives, etc. Programs and strategic initiatives are
undertaken to secure funding and/or achieve program enhancements that implement the policies
outlined in this Mobility Element.

6.        OTHER CIRCULATION FACILITIES
6.1 Airport
The City of Pasadena is served by the nearby Burbank-Bob Hope Airport. The airport, which was built in
1930, is served by most of the major commercial passenger carriers. During 2013, approximately 3.8
million passengers arrived or departed at the airport.
Although the airport is in operation 24 hours a day, there is a voluntary curfew on all commercial
passenger flights between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. each day. Most of the commercial
carriers that operate out of the airport generally comply with this restriction.
Previous plans of providing expanded and updated facilities at a new site located farther from the
runways are currently on hold due to numerous issues raised by the community. A Part 161 Study, as
required by the FAA, is currently underway to make the voluntary curfew mandatory. Phase I of the Part
161 Study was completed in the early summer of 2002, and the Phase II of the study is expected to be
completed in two years.
However, as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), plans for expanding the current
Terminal A wing by adding approximately 40,000 square feet to implement new security measures at
the airport have recently been approved. The TSA Security Improvement Project at the Airport consists
of providing additional space for ticket lobby and baggage screening/handling, relocating and enlarging
security checkpoints, creating space for screening in holdrooms and relocating holdroom space into the
hallway, installing complete fire/life safety systems, relocating and widening the existing hallway,
creating additional space for TSA personnel, creating additional space for the relocation of airline
personnel, providing blast-resistant walls, relocating restrooms, relocating concessions, and creating
new space to accommodate additional airport police.
Pasadena is also served by Los Angeles International Airport, 30 miles to the southwest, and Ontario
International Airport, approximately 25 miles east of the City. With these facilities, Pasadena enjoys
convenient and abundant air transport service.
6.2 Sewer
Although an older system than most due to the City’s age, Pasadena’s sewer system is in general good
condition. Ongoing reviews of the sewer system are conducted. Problems disclosed by maintenance
reviews or complaints are systematically corrected. Waste water considerations of new development
are addressed based on site-specific information. However, as City policy is to require that localized
system impacts caused by major developments be corrected at the sole expense of said development.
No significant impact on the current system is expected. A new Master Sewer Plan (MSP) Update will be
prepared.
6.3 Waste Water Treatment
Pasadena, along with Alhambra, San Marino, and South Pasadena, is part of County Sanitation District
No. 16 and, thereby, part of the waste water collection, treatment, and disposal system operated by the
County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County. The Sanitation Districts, in conformance with Federal
and State standards, must plan and construct waste water treatment facilities which are consistent with
regional land use and population goals and forecasts. The Sanitation Districts' facilities are currently
planned and constructed in conformance with the 1989 Growth Management Plan adopted by the
Page | 34

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the South Coast Air Quality Management
District (AQMD) or with regional or subregional population projects approved by SCAG from time to
time. The Sanitation Districts presently have sufficient existing and planned waste water treatment
capacity to accommodate the year 2010 population forecasts for the Glendale/Pasadena subregional
encompassing Sanitation District No. 16.
In addition, a small portion of the southwest hillside area of Pasadena comprised exclusively of single-
family homes is tributary to the waste water collection, treatment, and disposal system owned and
operated by the City of Los Angeles. This service is provided under a contractual arrangement under the
auspices of County Sanitation District No. 16. As this small area is virtually fully built-out, potential
incremental additions to the sewer system are insignificant.
6.4 Drainage
The City's drainage system, which consists of open channels, underground conduits, and streets, in
general provides a reasonable degree of protection against flooding. Localized problems that may occur
from time to time, especially in hillside areas subject to periodic fire and flood cycles, are treated on a
case-by-case basis.
The standard for the level of protection to be provided against flooding in Los Angeles County requires
that during the "urban design storm" - one with a probability of occurring once in 25 years, based on
rainfall records - the surface capacity of a street may be used up to a water surface level not extending
above or beyond the street's right-of-way lines.
As the City is almost fully built out and proposed land use changes will primarily involve the re-use of
developed areas, no significant impact is anticipated on the drainage system. However, drainage system
elements, particularly older facilities, are subject to ongoing repair, replacement, or modification efforts
based on maintenance records, complaints, and field observations. Major developments that impact the
capacities of downstream lines are required to upgrade adjacent system components to mitigate these
impacts at their sole expense.
6.5 Waterway
The nearest port facilities are located at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, approximately 35
miles south of downtown Pasadena. There are no inland waterways which directly link the City to these
ports.
6.6 Water System
An adequate supply of water for Pasadena is dependent on weather, statewide growth, development of
new sources and other factors. Since it is not possible to predict climatic changes and other outside
influences, it is difficult to give an accurate picture of water supply ten to twenty years from now.
Since 60 percent of Pasadena's water is dependent on outside purchases through Metropolitan Water
District, reasonable steps must be taken to avoid water shortfalls. To address these critical water supply
challenges, Pasadena Water and Power (PWP) have taken a proactive step to lead as a model water
agency by developing a Water Integrated Resources Plan (WIRP).
Page | 35
Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) imports their water from the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta via the State Water Project (SWP), and from the Colorado River. An eight-
year drought in the Colorado Basin—more severe than any other measured.
In the 20th century—resulted in record lows in Colorado River water levels. Water supplies from the
SWP have also been significantly reduced due to recent court restrictions to protect fisheries in the
Delta and a prolonged drought. These strains on MWD’s supply sources have caused it to dip into
emergency storage, and impose water allocation limits to its member agencies for the first time since
1991. In addition, MWD’s imported water costs have increased an average of 12 percent per year from
2006 to 2010. In response to water supply limitations from MWD and reduced local groundwater,
Pasadena recently enforced city-wide Level 1 shortage and water restrictions to its residential and
commercial/institutional customers.
To address these critical water supply challenges, PWP has taken a proactive step to lead as a model
water agency by developing WIRP. In addition to providing an overall water resources strategy, the
WIRP is a source document for Pasadena’s 2010 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP). California law
requires that all water agencies prepare an UWMP every five years. Furthermore, both the WIRP and
2010 UWMP have to indicate how Pasadena will meet the new Water Conservation Act of 2009, also
known as California’s “20x2020” plan.
In 2009, Senate Bill 7 (SB7) was passed as part of a comprehensive legislative package to improve the
state’s water supply reliability and restoration of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. SB7 requires that
per capita water use be reduced by 20 percent by the year 2020.
As of 2013, PWP had a service area population of 164,729 and covering 26 square miles. Pasadena’s
water distribution system consists of 508 miles of water mains, ranging from 2 to 36 inches in diameter;
19 booster stations; and 14 distribution reservoirs (PWP 2014). The City also has five service connections
with MWD. Water from MWD is stored in reservoirs with a total capacity of 110 million gallons before it
is put into the water distribution system. PWP owns and operates 16 wells that draw water from the
Raymond Groundwater Basin and has developed 11 interconnections with neighboring water agencies
to enhance the reliability of the City’s system and to use as emergency back-up. The Raymond
Groundwater Basin covers about 40 square miles. Groundwater is recharged from direct percolation of
precipitation and stream flow in the natural creek beds of Arroyo Seco, Eaton Wash, and Santa Anita
Wash. The basin is intentionally recharged in spreading basins north of Devil’s Gate Dam and along the
south side of Eaton Wash. The long-term yield of the Raymond Groundwater Basin is about 30,000 afy
(RBMB 2013). Pumping rights in the basin are adjudicated and managed by the Raymond Basin
Management Board. The City also has a Recycled Water Management Plan that identifies potential
demands and projects that could be developed.
The network of pipes and other appurtenances that comprise the existing water distribution network is
such that no major transmission pipeline changes are anticipated to meet growth projections. Specific
development projects generally do not have a major impact on overall water supply or storage, but
rather have an effect on the water mains in the immediate area surrounding the development. Fiscal
responsibility for any water distribution requirements in the immediate vicinity of the development are
the sole responsibility of the developer.
6.7       Power System
Page | 36

Mobility Element 2015
City of Pasadena
Department of Transportation
The Pasadena Water and Power (“PWP”) published an Integrated Resource Plan for power resources
(the "2012 IRP"), which among other objectives affirmed the commitment of the City of Pasadena
("City") to a goal of obtaining 40% of its energy from renewable resources by 2020, procuring specific
amounts of local solar power, reducing its greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 40% from 2008 levels,
also by 2020, and replacing the Broadway power plant with a comparably sized new combined cycle
plant. The 2015 IRP Update considers the 20-year planning horizon from 2015 through 2034.
6.7.1 Distribution Facilities
The Power Division of the Water and Power Department provides electrical energy to meet the needs of
the consumers of the City. Present facilities are adequate to serve the current electrical requirements of
the City.
To the extent that the City grows, it has invested $81 million in capital improvements. New facilities to
support the demand for electric service in the City of Pasadena would be constructed by PWP in
accordance with the demand for new service. Because developments that would be considered for
approval under the proposed General Plan have not yet been designed or proposed, the specific
electricity facilities that would need to be installed to serve those developments are unknown, as are
the environmental impacts of such installations. Such impacts would be evaluated on a project-by-
project basis. It is not likely that major new facilities would be necessary to serve the City with adequate
electricity service at project buildout. Consistent with the City’s adopted Integrated Resource Plan, the
PWP is already replacing inefficient local generating units at its Glenarm Power Plant.
6.7.2 Transmission Facilities
Energy is moved from sources to substations over the City's transmission system. At present, that
system operates at 34 Kilovolts and is approximately 95% underground. Future transmission facilities,
which may be of a higher voltage, will all be underground.
As such, with the exception of construction periods, the facilities will have no impact on the General
Plan.
6.7.3 Resource Facilities
Energy is delivered to the City at two locations: the Water and Power Department generating plants at
the end of the Pasadena Freeway in the South-Central portion of the City, and at the T. M. Goodrich
Receiving Station in the eastern side of the City, where energy is imported from sources outside the City.
The T. M. Goodrich Receiving Station presently has 300 Mva transformer capacity of import power into
the City. This facility may be enlarged in the future to provide additional economical and reliable
importation of electrical energy from sources outside the City. Alternatively, a planning study is
presently underway to evaluate the cost and feasibility of building a new receiving station on the west
side of Pasadena to increase reliability and import capacity. Facilities at the generating plants will be
maintained and upgraded to ensure sufficient capacity for reliable electric service, improve operating
efficiency, and meet the requirements of air quality standards as they evolve.

Framing the
Challenge
From the Tongva to the Spanish Californios, to folks from
Indiana and Iowa, Pasadena has long attracted people
because of its beauty and abundance. The ease with which
crops could be grown in combination with a temperate
climate drew all of these groups to this area. People
moved here in droves in search of better health, better
climate, and the California dream. Here in Pasadena, that
dream was special-with the mountains to the north, and
the Arroyo Seco on the west and Eaton Canyon on the
east, residents were embraced by the natural world. Those
who lived here delighted in their proximity to nature, while
still appreciating the comforts of civilization. They hiked in
the mountains and in the arroyos, and soaked up the
winter sun. In recognition of these qualities, people came
here for their physical, psychological and spiritual health.
However, as the population grew, it began to encroach on
the natural world, and there was a growing awareness of
the negative human impact on our environment and quality
of life. In response to increased citizen awareness of the
need to protect our natural environment, conserve our
resources and adopt sustainable practices, in 2006 the City
Council declared Pasadena a Green City and signed on to
the United Nations Urban Environmental Accords of 2005.
The City committed to developing sustainable practices
regarding energy, waste, environmental health, water, urban
nature, transportation and urban design.

Elements of the General Plan memorializes the principles
and goals expressed in the Green City Declaration and          Pasadena has always been a special place, and to preserve

Summary
The Open Space & Conservation Element provides a
blueprint for natural open space and conservation. In
order to establish this blueprint, the Element includes
an inventory of existing open space areas, a summary of
existing open space and conservation plans, and agencies
that the City partners with to protect and enhance
natural open space. The Element also reviews the existing
documents related to conservation, including the plans of
the City’s Green City Program, the Water and Power
Integrated Resource Plans (IRP), and the California Green
Building Code.
The Element establishes goals and objectives in the areas
of Open Space, Wildlife & Native Plants, and Environmental
Quality, Conservation & Sustainable Use Practices.
The Element also includes a series of implementation
measures to achieve these goals and objectives. Some
of the implementation measures, particularly in the area
of conservation, are restated from existing plans, such as
the Water and Power IRPs which serve as implementation
documents in these areas.
The Element summarizes the community participation
process that involved hundreds of participants in events
that included an open house, community meeting, and in
coordination with the General Plan Land Use & Mobility
Element Update, Moveabout tours and a citywide open
house and neighborhood workshops.

Introduction
General Plan Guiding Principles
In 1994, the Comprehensive General Plan Revision
Program was a directed response to growth management
issues that came to the forefront during much of the 1980s.
The revision program was designed to provide a unified
vision for the future of the City. It is a vision that was
shaped and driven by community values and reflects the
input of Pasadena residents.
The extensive community outreach conducted during the
1994 Revision Program led to the creation of seven guiding
principles that serve as the overall framework for each
General Plan Element. The seven guiding principles of the
City’s General Plan are as follows:
• Growth Will Be Targeted to Serve Community Needs
  and Enhance the Quality of Life.
• Change Will Be Harmonized to Preserve Pasadena’s
  Historic Character and Environment.
• Economic Vitality Will Be Promoted to Provide Jobs,
  Services, Revenues And Opportunities.
• Pasadena Will Be Promoted as a Healthy Family
  Community.
• Pasadena Will Be a City Where People Can Circulate
  Without Cars.
• Pasadena Will Be Promoted as a Cultural, Scientific,
  Corporate, Entertainment and Educational Center for
  the Region.
• Community Participation Will Be a Permanent Part of
  Achieving a Greater City.

Purpose
The Open Space and Conservation Element establishes
policies that focus on the protection and enhancement of
open space and natural resources to ensure a high quality
living environment in Pasadena. With this in mind, the Open
Space and Conservation Element is developed to:
• Recognize and identify the various open space and natural
   resources that Pasadena possesses.
• Acknowledge the value and importance of the ecological
   systems and the natural environment that support native
   plants and wildlife by protecting, maintaining, restoring
   and increasing open space and natural resources.
• Develop policies that promote the conservation of
   energy, air, water, and natural resources, and in doing so,
   enhance the overall quality of life in Pasadena.
                                                                                                       • Recognize and highlight the interconnectedness and

Themes
Through public outreach, the community expressed the
following themes as important to this plan.
Here are the things we value
• We love and appreciate Pasadena’s natural open spaces
  and conservation efforts.
• Residents agree that parks and open spaces are a major
  contributor to quality of life citywide.
• Our unique natural areas and the easy access to wilder
  areas in the foothills and mountains are very important
  to our community.
• Residents support Pasadena’s environmental sustainability
  efforts.
Here are the issues that need to be addressed
• Establish more open space in Pasadena.
• Create more parks in the Central District.
• Protect open space from loss to new development.
• Establish a citywide network of open spaces with
  equitable access to all residents and neighborhoods.
• Improve water and energy conservation efforts and
  reduce solid waste.
• Pasadena should play a leadership role in sustainability
  and become a “model sustainable city.”
Throughout the drafting of the Open Space and Conservation
Element, the Planning Department encouraged the public’s
participation and feedback through attendance at public
meetings and submission of comments and questions to staff.
The vision, themes, and implementation measures contained
herein reflect residents’ desire to protect the very qualities
that make Pasadena a desirable and unique community.

Wildlife, Native Plants
and the Urban Forest
The Wildlife, Native Plants, and Urban Forest section of the
Open Space and Conservation Element is intended to pro-
tect and enhance Pasadena’s urban forest, native vegetation
and native wildlife. The section establishes current condi-
tions, as well as existing policies and future actions.
There are approximately 62,000 street and park trees in
the City of Pasadena, and the City has attained “Tree City
USA” recognition for the past twenty years. Trees in urban
areas provide many economic and aesthetic benefits to
the city. As such, the City has taken extensive measures to
ensure the protection of our city’s trees. With the passage
of the Tree Protection Ordinance in 2002, staff and advisory
commissions now reconfigure site plans for many projects
in order to save trees that would otherwise be removed,
and require replacement trees on new developments.
Pasadena’s Mediterranean climate contributes to a diverse
variety of habitats. Some of Pasadena’s rich plant and animal
species have been identified as threatened. In order to
preserve these populations and encourage breeding and
maintaining genetic diversity, the section recommends the
protection of movement corridors in key areas of the City.
Pasadenans can take simple measures to encourage ben-
eficial wildlife in their yards and other open spaces. Simple
actions include providing water (birdbaths, rain gardens),       The following goals and objectives have been developed

Recycled Water
Recycled, or reclaimed, water is treated wastewater
used for landscape irrigation, industrial cooling processes,
toilet flushing and many other uses. Because it is never
used for drinking, it cannot be distributed through regular
water lines that provide tap water. Instead, recycled water
requires a separate distribution system to get from the
original source to residential and commercial customers
who have installed the appropriate piping necessary to have
the recycled water delivered to their properties. There are
a number of important benefits to recycled water, including
conservation of millions of gallons of potable (drinkable)
water from underground and from surface sources such
as lakes and rivers; and it provides a reliable supply for
landscape irrigation and other uses during droughts.
In 2010, Pasadena Water and Power (PWP) began the process
of developing recycled water facilities, which will allow the
delivery of up 6,000 acre-feet per year of recycled water
produced at the Los Angeles/Glendale Water Reclamation
Plant to Pasadena. PWP’s ultimate goal is to maximize the
use of recycled water and to reduce the use of imported
and local potable water supplies for non-potable applications.

On December 6, 2007, CARB released the calculated 1990
GHG emissions of 427 million metric tons of CO2e. In
2004, the emissions were estimated at 480 million metric
tons of CO2e. A reduction of 13 percent was needed to
reduce 2004 levels to 1990 levels. A series of early actions,
tailpipe regulations, and the development of fuels with less
carbon in them are estimated to provide reductions totaling
66 million tons of CO2e. CARB prepared a Scoping Plan to
develop programs and measures to address the remaining
107 million tons of CO2e in order to reach the total of 173
million tons by the year 2020.The Scoping Plan was submitted

Community Vision
Since Fall 2008, the City has engaged hundreds of residents
who have shared their ideas about how to shape our open
spaces and conservation efforts at community fairs, open
houses and workshops. Throughout the process, a nine-
member Open Space and Conservation Element Committee
has met continuously, studying the latest trends in open
space preservation and conservation practices.
A web page (www.cityofpasadena.net/openspace) was
established to provide information to the public about the
process, as well as to elicit feedback about open space and
conservation.
Early on, a traveling kiosk provided information at meetings,

Community Context
History
Since the City’s founding in 1874 as the Indiana Colony,
individuals from around the United States have come to
Pasadena to settle or to vacation, drawn particularly by
the area’s abundant natural resources and scenic beauty,
most notably provided by the backdrop of the San Gabriel
Mountains.
Pasadena grew as a residential locale thoroughly distinct
from Los Angeles, its neighbor to the south. Residents in
the late 1800s perceived Pasadena as a natural, garden-like
setting that did not require formal park planning. By the
turn of the 20th century, however, changing development
patterns led residents to rethink that stance. Consequently,
city government acquired its first green space for Central
and Memorial Parks in 1902. In 1903, the City’s first park
regulating ordinance (#539) was passed. Later, in the 1920s,      Demographics

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
1.0       Introduction
Pasadena is considered one of the best places to live in the West – it has
a vibrant downtown with shops, theatres and restaurants; it is home to
the corporate offices of many national and international businesses; and
it has established residential neighborhoods with a strong sense of
community valued deeply by their residents. The City also has a low
crime rate and good schools, important indicators of a community’s
quality of life. However, this idyllic setting can be impacted by natural
hazards that have the potential to cause death, injuries, property damage,
and substantial economic and social dislocation. The Safety Element
addresses these safety issues, with emphasis on the naturally occurring
conditions that pose a hazard to Pasadena, and provides goals, policies,
and programs aimed at reducing the City’s risk from these hazards.
[Risk is defined as the outcome of the interaction between a hazard
and the elements of the community, such as population, buildings, and
infrastructure that are vulnerable to such an impact.]
Specific hazards of concern to Pasadena include earthquakes, landslides
and mudflows, dam or reservoir failure, wildland and structural fire, and
contamination of soil and groundwater resources by hazardous materials
associated with some of the research, commercial, and industrial
facilities present in the City. These hazards can impact the City’s
residents, workers, and visitors, and can cause the disruption of critical
(hospital, schools, fire stations) and essential (water, gas, sewage,
electricity, communications) facilities. Each of these hazards is
described further in the following pages; for a more detailed description
of each of these conditions, refer to the accompanying Technical
Background Report.
The ultimate objective of the Safety Element is to improve the
safety of the community, and in the process make it more
sustainable and prosperous. To that end, the Safety Element
describes the natural conditions that pose a hazard, but most
importantly, it presents goals, policies, and programs that if
implemented can substantially reduce the risk these hazards pose to the
City of Pasadena and its residents. Goals are statements that describe
the City’s purpose and direction in reducing its natural hazards.
Policies are guidelines that can be implemented to reduce the City’s risk
and maximize the community’s emergency preparedness. Programs are
the specific actions that the City has committed to implement over a
given number of years to reduce its hazards. Where appropriate, the
agency or City department responsible for implementation and
monitoring of each of these programs is identified.
Safety Elements are by scope and definition, provisional. Although the
ultimate goal of these types of documents does not change much over
time, the information, tools and techniques available to assess the
Safety Element

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
community’s risk to various types of hazards are continuously evolving.
Policies and programs are established within a framework that identifies
timelines and priorities. As the more critical goals are achieved,
emphasis is shifted to new priorities. Most of the data, relationships and
processes that affect a community are spatial in nature, and multi-
variant. As a result, manipulation of the data and assessment of the risk
can be quite complex. Thankfully, geographic information systems
(GIS) are increasingly being used for this purpose, and Pasadena has
already embraced the use of GIS-based mapping. The hardware and
software available to manage the City’s risk using GIS will only get
better with time.
For effective emergency preparedness and response, communities need
to know in advance what are the potentially hazardous conditions
specific to their area. A major part of this effort requires mapping of
the vulnerable areas in the community. This is covered in the Technical
Background Report to the Safety Element. For example, the Technical
Report identifies the fault zones that cross the City, areas of potential
landslides and unstable slopes, areas susceptible to fire and flooding
hazards, and locations of the facilities that use or generate hazardous
materials. Computer simulations that estimate loss of life and damage to
buildings and infrastructure (such as HAZUS, the software used for this
study) are still in their infancy, but already have proven to be of value in
designing and prioritizing appropriate mitigation plans.
Once this information is known, appropriate land use practices and
management can be identified and implemented to reduce the hazards
identified. These are the topics covered in this Policy Document.
2.0      Important Terms and Concepts
The following technical terms and concepts are used in the Safety
Element to describe and discuss earthquakes, landslides, flood, fire and
hazardous materials conditions. For a more thorough list of terms, refer
to the Glossary in the Technical Background Report.
2.1      Earthquakes and other Seismic Hazards
A break or fracture between blocks of rock is called a fault. Sudden,
differential movement on a fault causes an earthquake. The strain
energy released during an earthquake makes the earth vibrate and shake.
Scientists typically use moment magnitude to measure the size of an
earthquake, which is based on the amount of energy released and is
directly proportional to the area of the fault that ruptured. A magnitude
6.0 earthquake releases 32 times the energy of a magnitude 5.0, and a
magnitude 7.0 earthquake releases about 1,000 (32 x 32) more energy
than a magnitude 5.0 earthquake. Earthquake damage is typically
                                                            Safety Element
                                                                     Page 3

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
measured relative to an intensity scale. The Modified Mercalli Intensity
Scale describes the observable effects that an earthquake has on
structures and people. An earthquake has one magnitude, but several
intensities, because intensity effects vary with the location. Typically
(although not always), intensities decrease with increasing distance from
the epicenter of the earthquake.
In California, faults that have moved at least once in the last about
11,000 years are considered active and capable of generating
earthquakes in the future. Some faults generate earthquakes every few
tens to hundreds of years, while others only break every few thousand
years. Faults with shorter recurrence intervals (time between
earthquakes) have higher slip rates, and are generally considered to
pose a greater seismic hazard. In southern California, the San Andreas
and San Jacinto faults have the highest recurrence intervals, and are
therefore considered to have a higher probability of causing an
earthquake in the future. The seismic risk posed by a fault is also
dependent on when a fault broke last – a fault with a recurrence interval
of five thousand years that has not caused an earthquake in as many
years may be near the end of its strain accumulation cycle, and may
therefore have a higher probability of rupturing than a fault that just
caused an earthquake. If a fault breaks to the ground surface, primary
ground rupture occurs. This typically results in a relatively small
percentage of the total damage in an earthquake, but structures sitting
directly on top of the ruptured fault can be damaged extensively.
Earthquake-induced strong ground shaking causes most of the
earthquake damage. Damage to structures is usually caused by strong
horizontal ground acceleration, which is measured as a percentage of
g, the acceleration of gravity. The degree of shaking depends on several
factors, including earthquake size, location, depth of the focus,
orientation and movement of the seismic waves (source effects); the
type of sediments or rocks that the seismic waves travel through (path
effects); and the interaction between the structures and the sediments or
rocks at a specific site (site effects). Strong ground shaking can also
trigger the destructive secondary effects of liquefaction and slope failure
(landslides). Liquefaction occurs in soft, saturated sediments – when
the ground shakes, the water that fills the pores increases in pressure,
causing the soil to lose strength and behave as a liquid.

             SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
2.2      Geologic Hazards
Slope failure does not need to be triggered by an earthquake. Intense
precipitation events, or long periods of sustained rainfall can saturate the
soils even on a gentle slope, with the potential for the soils, and the
underlying slope, to become unstable. If, in response to gravity, the
saturated soils move down slope, they can form mudflows or debris
flows. Mudflows can cause extensive damage to structures in their path.
Man-made modifications to a slope, and stream erosion and down-
cutting can also cause a slope to become unstable and fail. Some of the
most significant factors that contribute to slope failure include slope
height and steepness, shear strength and orientation of weak layers in
the underlying geologic units, and pore water pressures. Damaging
debris flows also can and often occur on slopes that were burnt earlier
that year or in recent past years because there are few roots holding
down the soil, and the surface is covered with ash and other debris.
Although not sudden and catastrophic, there are other potential
geological hazards that if not recognized and mitigated properly, can
cause extensive damage to structures. These hazards are specific to the
soils that act as a foundation to buildings and infrastructure, and include
collapsible and expansive soils.             Collapsible soils undergo a
rearrangement of their grains, and a loss of cementation, resulting in
substantial and rapid settlement under relatively low loads. Expansive
soils are fine-grained soils with variable amounts of clay minerals that
can undergo significant volumetric changes as a result of changes in
moisture content. The upward pressures induced by the swelling can
have significant harmful effects upon structures and other surface
improvements.
2.3      Flood Hazards
Rain in southern California is generally a welcomed event – it cleans and
makes the air we breathe smell good, makes our hills and mountains
green, and provides water for our recharge basins and reservoirs.
Intense rainfall, however, when more than 1 inch of rainwater falls
during the course of a few hours, or prolonged rainfall, when it rains
continuously for days, can be a less than pleasant experience. Flood-
prone communities can experience swollen river channels, flooded
streets and basements, mudflows and debris flows at the mouths of
canyons, and other similar conditions that can cause extensive damage
to property, injuries, and, in some cases, loss of life.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines the
“base flood” or “100-year flood” as a flood that has a 1-percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year. A
base flood has a 26-percent chance of occurring during a 30-year period,
                                                            Safety Element
                                                                     Page 5

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
generally the length of most home mortgages. However, the recurrence
interval represents the long-term average period between floods of a
specific magnitude; rare floods could occur at short intervals or even
within the same year.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) National
Flood Insurance Program offers federally subsidized flood insurance
to property owners in those communities that adopt and enforce
floodplain management ordinances that meet minimum criteria
established by FEMA.
2.4     Fire Hazards
The Fire Hazard Severity of an area is determined based on the type and
amount of vegetation, termed fuel loading; slope gradient; and weather
(fire hazard increases in the summer and fall, when the weather is hot
and dry – and especially when there are Santa Ana wind conditions).
The Bates Bill Process also considers dwelling density, past fire hazard
history and local building and fire codes in determining Very High Fire
Hazard Severity Zones. When a wildland fire encroaches onto the built
environment, multiple ignitions can develop as a result of “branding”,
the term for wind transport of burning cinders over long distances. If
ignited structures sustain and transmit the fire from one building to the
next, a catastrophic fire can ensue. Insurance carriers consider a fire a
catastrophe if it triggers at least $25 million in claims or more than 1,000
individual claims. Firestorms, especially in areas of wildland-urban
interfaces can be particularly dangerous and complex, posing a severe
threat to public and firefighter safety, and causing devastating losses of
both life and property.
Non-federal areas identified as having a fire hazard are referred to as
State Responsibility Areas (SRAs) because the State has the primary
financial responsibility of preventing and suppressing fires. The agency
responsible for suppressing fires in SRAs is the California Department
of Forestry. Local fire agencies are responsible for suppressing fires in
private property within City limits.
Earthquakes have the potential to generate fires that have the potential
to severely tax the local fire suppression agencies.
2.5     Hazardous Materials
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a
hazardous waste as a substance that 1) may cause or significantly
contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious,
irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness; and 2) that poses a
substantial present or potential future hazard to human health or the
Safety Element

             SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
environment when it is improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed
of or otherwise managed. Hazardous waste is also ignitable, corrosive,
or reactive (explosive) (U.S. EPA 40 CFR 260.10). A material may also
be classified as a hazardous material if it contains defined amounts of
toxic chemicals. The EPA has developed a list of specific hazardous
wastes that are in the forms of solids, semi-solids, liquids, and gases.
The State of California defines hazardous materials as substances that
are toxic, ignitable or flammable, reactive, and corrosive. The State also
defines an extremely hazardous material as a substance that shows high
acute or chronic toxicity, carcinogenity (causes cancer),
bioaccumulative properties (accumulates in the body’s tissues),
persistence in the environment, or is water reactive.
Hazardous materials are extensively regulated by Federal, State and City
laws, and new regulations are constantly being developed as we learn
more about the impact these substances have on human health and the
environment. It is not the intent of the Safety Element to discuss or
even list all of the regulations currently in effect to reduce the impacts of
hazardous materials, as these will change or will be added to with time.
The three main sources of information on hazardous materials
management as they pertain to the City of Pasadena are: 1) the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2) the California Department
of Health Services (DHS), and 3) the City of Pasadena Fire Department.
The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air
Quality Standards for pollutants considered harmful to public health
and the environment. To that end, the EPA requires that the levels of
five major air pollutants be measured on a daily basis. These Air Quality
Indexes are reported daily in the local news media serving metropolitan
areas with populations exceeding 200,000. Air Quality Indexes are
reported using a numerical value between 0 and 500 that corresponds to
a health descriptor like “good” or “unhealthful.” The local agency
responsible for monitoring and enforcing air quality is the South Coast
Air Quality Management District.
The EPA’s National Primary Drinking Water Standard protects drinking
water quality by limiting the levels of specific contaminants that are
known to occur or have the potential to occur in water and can
adversely affect public health. The EPA and the California Department
of Health Services (DHS) set the Maximum Contaminant Levels
(MCLs) for specific contaminants in ground water. These contaminants
include organic and inorganic chemicals (minerals), substances that are
known to cause cancer (carcinogens), radionuclides (such as uranium
and radon), and microbial contaminants. Water purveyors are required
to test their water for these contaminants on a fixed schedule, and
report their results to the DHS.

                                                                      Page 7

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
Leaking underground storage tanks (UST’s) have been recognized
since the early 1980s as the primary cause of groundwater contamination
by gasoline compounds and solvents. In California, regulations aimed at
protecting against UST leaks have been in place since 1983. California’s
program is more stringent than the Federal program, requiring that all
tanks be double walled, and prohibiting gasoline delivery to non-
compliant tanks. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)
has been designated the lead regulatory agency in the development of
UST regulations and policy. The SWRCB maintains an inventory of
leaking underground storage tanks in a statewide database.

3.0      Regulatory Environment
There are several Federal and State programs and regulations pertaining
to public safety that provide the legal framework to Safety Elements of
the General Plan. These programs provide the minimum guidelines and
criteria that must be complied with – individual jurisdictions can choose
to go beyond the Federal or State requirements and implement more
stringent regulations. Some of the specific plans and programs that
apply to the City of Pasadena are discussed briefly below. This is not
intended to be an all-inclusive list. For a more detailed description of the
programs described below, refer to the Technical Background Report.
For information regarding additional Federal, State and City regulations,
refer to the Federal and State Codes of Regulations, and the City of
Pasadena Municipal Codes (all of these can be found on the world wide
web, using various search engines).
3.1      California Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
         The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was signed
         into law in 1972 with its primary purpose being to mitigate the
         hazard of fault rupture by prohibiting the location of structures
         for human occupancy across the trace of an active fault. The
         Act requires the State Geologist to delineate "Earthquake Fault
         Zones" along faults that are "sufficiently active" and "well
         defined." The Act dictates that cities and counties withhold
         development permits for projects within an Earthquake Fault
         Zone within their jurisdiction until geologic investigations
         demonstrate that the projects are not threatened by surface
         displacements from future faulting. Projects include all land
         divisions and most structures for human occupancy. State law
         exempts single-family wood-frame and steel-frame dwellings
         which are less than three stories and are not part of a
         development of four units or more. However, local agencies can
         be more restrictive than State law requires.
3.2      California Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
         The goal of the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 is to
         minimize loss of life and property by identifying and mitigating
         seismic hazards. The act addresses non-surface fault rupture
         earthquake hazards, including strong ground shaking,
         liquefaction and seismically induced landslides. The State agency
         charged with implementation of the Act is the California
         Geological Survey (CGS). The CGS prepares and provides local
         governments with seismic hazard zone maps that identify areas
         susceptible to amplified shaking, liquefaction, earthquake-
         induced landslides, and other ground failures. The seismic
         hazard zones delineated by the CGS are referred to as “zones of
                                                            Safety Element
                                                                     Page 9

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
        required investigation,” because site-specific geological hazard
        investigations are required for construction projects located
        within these areas.
3.3     Real Estate Disclosure Requirements
        Pursuant to the Natural Hazards Disclosure Act, since June
        1, 1998, sellers of real property and their agents are required to
        provide prospective buyers with a "Natural Hazard Disclosure
        Statement" when the property being sold lies within one or more
        State-mapped hazard areas, such as within an Alquist-Priolo
        Earthquake Fault Zone or a Seismic Hazard Zone.
3.4     California Environmental Quality Act
        The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was passed
        in 1970 to insure that local governmental agencies consider and
        review the environmental impacts of development projects
        within their jurisdictions. CEQA requires that an Environmental
        Impact Report (EIR) be prepared for projects that may have
        significant effects on the environment. EIRs are required to
        identify geologic and seismic hazards, and to recommend
        potential mitigation measures, giving the local agency the
        authority to regulate private development projects in the early
        stages of planning.
3.5     California Building Code
        The California Building Code (CBC), which is included in
        Title 24 of the California Administrative Code, provides
        “minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property
        and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design,
        construction, quality of materials, use and occupancy, location
        and maintenance of all buildings and structures” within the City
        of Pasadena. These documents are historically updated every
        three years. The most current CBC adopted by the City of
        Pasadena is the 1998 edition, based on the 1997 edition of the
        Uniform Building Code. A new CBC was issued in 2001. The
        City of Pasadena is expected to adopt this version in the Fall of
        2002.
3.6     Unreinforced Masonry Law
        The Unreinforced Masonry Law of 1986 requires all cities and
        counties in Seismic Zone 4 (CBC, 1998) to identify hazardous
        unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in their jurisdictions.
        Owners of such buildings must be notified of the potential
        earthquake hazard, and mitigation must be performed. The
Safety Element

        SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
    mitigation method, which may include retrofitting or demolition,
    is left to the local jurisdiction. URMs in Pasadena have been
    identified and catalogued, in accordance with the 1994 Uniform
    Code for Conservation of Buildings (Chapter 14.06 of the City
    Code – also referred to as the City’s URM Ordinance). Many of
    the URMs on the original list compiled by the City have since
    been retrofitted or demolished; the rest are all at various stages
    of the mitigation process.
3.7 National Flood Insurance Act and Flood Disaster
    Protection Act
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is
    mandated by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the
    Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to evaluate flood hazards
    and provide Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM's) for local and
    regional planners to promote sound land use and floodplain
    development. Further, the Flood Disaster Protection Act
    requires owners of all structures in identified Special Flood
    Hazard Areas to purchase and maintain flood insurance as a
    condition of receiving Federal or federally related financial
    assistance, such as mortgage loans from federally insured lending
    institutions. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994
    further strengthened the National Flood Insurance Program by
    providing a grant program for State and community flood
    mitigation projects.      The act also established a system
    (Community Rating System - CRS) for crediting communities
    that implement measures to protect the natural and beneficial
    functions of their floodplains, as well as managing the erosion
    hazard. The City of Pasadena has participated in the NFIP since
    1984 (City ID No. – 065050); however, there are no FIRM maps
    for the City, and Pasadena is not currently listed in FEMA’s CRS
    of cities.
3.8 Fire Regulations
    Assembly Bill 337 (the Bates Bill, adopted September 29, 1992)
    was a direct result of the great loss of lives and homes in the
    Oakland Hills “Tunnel Fire” of 1991. The Bates Bill Process is
    used to identify Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in Local
    Responsibility Areas. Government Code Section 51178
    specifies that the Director of the California Department of
    Forestry (CDF), in cooperation with local fire authorities, shall
    identify areas that are Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones
    (VHFHSZs) in Local Responsibility areas (LRAs), based on
    consistent statewide criteria and the expected severity of fire
    hazard. State Responsibility Areas (SRAs) include all lands
    regardless of ownership, except for cities and federal lands.
                                                        Safety Element
                                                               Page 11

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
        Although the State has financial responsibility for SRAs, it is not
        the State’s responsibility to provide fire protection services to
        any building or structure located within a wildland area, unless
        the CDF has entered into a cooperative agreement with a local
        agency for those purposes pursuant to Public Resources Code
        Section 4142. Under Assembly Bill 3819, passed in 1994 (AB
        3819 – Willie Brown), “Class A” roofing, minimum clearances
        of 30 feet around structures, and other fire defense
        improvements are required in VHFHSZs.
        Government Code Section 51178 states that a local agency
        may, at its discretion, exclude from the requirements of Section
        51182 an area identified as a VHFHSZ by the CDF. This
        requires a finding, supported by substantial evidence, that the
        requirements of Section 51182 are not necessary for effective
        fire protection within the area. Conversely, local agencies may
        include areas not identified as a VHFHSZ by the CDF,
        following a finding that the requirements of Section 51182 are
        necessary for effective fire protection. According to Section
        51182, such changes made by a local agency shall be final and
        cannot be rebutted by the CDF.
        Wildland areas require disclosure for real-estate transactions.
        Specifically, Assembly Bill 6 (AB6) requires that both types of
        fire hazard areas (SRAs and VHFHSZs) be disclosed in real
        estate transactions. Civil Code Section 1103(c)(6) also requires
        real estate sellers to inform prospective buyers whether or not a
        property is located within a wildland area that could contain
        substantial fire risks and hazards.
Safety Element

    SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
Public Resources Code Section 4290 requires minimum
statewide fire safety standards pertaining to:
•   Road standards for fire equipment access;
•   Standards for signs identifying streets, roads, and buildings;
•   Minimum private water supply reserves for emergency fire
    use; and
•   Fuel breaks and greenbelts.
Wildland fire areas are also subject to Public Resources Code
Sections 4291 through 4299, which require property owners in
such areas to conduct maintenance in order to reduce the fire
danger.
The City of Pasadena’s Hazardous Vegetation Ordinance
(Pasadena Municipal Code sections 14.29.030 and 14.29.040) is a
fire prevention partnership between property owners and the
City in order to prevent disastrous fires. The ordinance is
designed to minimize fire danger by controlling density and
placement of flammable vegetation.             The Pasadena Fire
Department is responsible for fire suppression on all private
lands within the City of Pasadena. The Pasadena Fire
Department constantly monitors the fire hazard in the City, and
has ongoing programs for investigation and alleviation of
hazardous situations.
The California Emergency Services Act, section 8568, states
that “the State Emergency Plan shall be in effect in each political
subdivision of the State, and the governing body of each political
subdivision shall take such action as may be necessary to carry
out the provision thereof.” The act provides the basic authorities
for conducting emergency operations following the
proclamations of emergencies by the Governor or appropriate
local authority, such as a City Manager.
The SEMS law refers to the Standardized Emergency
Management System described by the Petris Bill (SB 1841). It
requires all jurisdictions within the State of California to
participate in the establishment of a standardized statewide
emergency management system.
The City uses the California Fire Code with amendments and
several other fire ordinances to further reduce the City’s
vulnerability to structural and widland fires.

3.9     National      Pollutant     Discharge     Elimination      System
(NPDES)
        The Clean Water Act of 1995 and its subsequent amendments
        give the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the
        authority to regulate industrial and municipal discharges into
        public storm drains, sewer systems and surface water bodies.
        The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
        (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution by
        regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of
        the United States. Point sources are defined by the EPA as
        discrete conveyances such as pipes or man-made ditches.
        The City of Pasadena is a member of the Los Angeles County
        Stormwater Program. This program regulates and controls
        storm water and urban runoff into the Los Angeles River, San
        Gabriel River, Santa Clara River, tributaries to these rivers, and
        ultimately, the Pacific Ocean. The Los Angeles County
        Stormwater Program is the local enforcer of the NPDES
        program. In the Pasadena Area, NPDES permits are filed with
        the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los
        Angeles Region.
3.10 Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act
(EPCRA)
        The primary purpose of the Federal Emergency Planning and
        Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) is to inform
        communities and citizens of chemical hazards in their areas.
        Sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA require businesses to report to
        state and local agencies the locations and quantities of chemicals
        stored on-site. Section 313 of EPCRA requires manufacturers to
        report the release to the environment of any of more than 600
        designated toxic chemicals. These reports help communities
        prepare to respond to chemical spills and similar emergencies. In
        the City of Pasadena, businesses that use, store or generate any
        amount of hazardous materials are required to provide the Fire
        department with an inventory of the hazardous materials that
        they use. This helps the Fire Department identify the
        appropriate actions to take in the event of a significant or
        threatened significant release of a hazardous material.
        EPCRA mandates that Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reports be
        made public. The TRI is a database that contains information on
        toxic chemical releases and other waste management activities
        reported annually by certain industry groups as well as federal
        facilities. This inventory was established in 1986 under the

3.11 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act
       The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
       and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 is a regulatory or statute
       law developed to protect the water, air, and land resources from
       the risks created by past chemical disposal practices. This act is
       also referred to as the Superfund Act, and the sites listed under it
       are referred to as Superfund sites.
3.12   Resources Conservation and Recovery Act
       The Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the
       principal Federal law that regulates the generation, management,
       and transportation of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes.
       Hazardous waste management includes the treatment, storage,
       or disposal of hazardous waste.
3.13   Hazardous Materials Disclosure Program
       As indicated previously, hazardous materials are extensively
       legislated by the Federal, State and City governments. In
       exceedance of Federal and State requirements, the City of
       Pasadena requires all businesses that handle any amount of
       hazardous materials to submit an inventory of the hazardous
       materials that they manage to the Pasadena Fire Department.
       In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments and
       Reauthorization Act (SARA). Title III of this legislation
       requires that each community establish a Local Emergency
       Planning Committee (LEPC). This committee is responsible for
       developing an emergency plan that outlines steps to prepare for
       and respond to chemical emergencies in that community.
       Several California statutes require the emergency notification of
       a hazardous chemical release. These include: Health and Safety
       Codes §25270.7, §25270.8 and §25507; Vehicle Code §23112.5;
       Public Utilities Code §7673; Government Codes §51018,
       §8670.25.5(a); Water Codes §13271 and §13272; and California
       Labor Code §6409.1(b)10. The Safe Drinking Water and
       Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition
       65, and §9030 of the California Labor Code also has specific
       reporting requirements.

4.0      Environmental Setting and Summary of Natural Hazards
         Specific to the City of Pasadena
The City of Pasadena is located at the boundary between two of
southern California’s geomorphic provinces, in an area that is being
compressed by geological forces associated with movement on the
Pacific and North American tectonic plates. Growth of the San Gabriel
Mountains in response to earthquakes on the Sierra Madre fault is the
most obvious result of this compression. Other manifestations of this
plate boundary include a broad zone of faulting that extends from
offshore southern California inland to the Mojave Desert, and the
regular occurrence of earthquakes. Movement of these plates is also
causing this portion of Los Angeles basin to rotate clockwise. To
accommodate this rotation, several of the faults in the area move
laterally, typically with one block moving to the left relative to the other
(left-lateral strike-slip).
In the Pasadena area, the main faults include the Sierra Madre fault, a
reverse fault that extends across the City’s northern boundary, and the
left-lateral strike-slip Raymond fault that locally extends into Pasadena’s
southern and eastern boundaries. A worst-case scenario earthquake
(maximum magnitude) for Pasadena would involve rupture of the
segment of the Sierra Madre fault that extends through the northern
portion of the City. A maximum magnitude earthquake on the Raymond
fault is a close second in terms of damage potential to the City. In
addition to the two faults above, the Verdugo, Hollywood, Whittier and
Elysian Park fault zones are likely sources of earthquakes that may
impact the City. The San Andreas fault has the highest probability of
causing an earthquake, and although farther away from Pasadena, it also
has the potential to cause some damage in the City. Most of the loss of
life and injuries that have occurred and will occur during an earthquake
are related to the collapse of hazardous buildings and structures, or from
non-structural components (contents) of those buildings. Given that
the City of Pasadena is almost completely built out, the reduction of
earthquake losses depends primarily on the prudent retrofitting of
existing structures.
The eastern and central sections of the Raymond fault are zoned under
the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, so geological
evaluations to locate the fault are mandated by State law if developments
or re-developments amounting to more than 50 percent of the value of
the structure are proposed within this zone. The traces of the Sierra
Madre fault that have been mapped or inferred through the City of
Pasadena, at and south of the break in slope at the mountain front are
not currently mapped by the State. The northernmost trace that extends
through the Loma Alta Park in Altadena has recently been shown to be
active. The inferred fault traces farther to the south are based only on
breaks in slope; as a result some traces or sections of traces are better

            SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
defined in the topography than others (see Plate P-1). None of these
inferred traces have been investigated by trenching or other direct
geologic methods. Nevertheless, given the density of development in the
areas where these traces have been mapped, it is proposed that
geological studies to evaluate the potential for surface fault rupture
should be required in these zones before certain types of development,
such as critical facilities, are approved.         Similarly, geological
investigations of the Eagle Rock fault should also be required. For
specific information about these requirements, refer to the
Implementation Section of this Report (Section 5.0).

             SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The San Gabriel Mountains form the backdrop to Pasadena, but most
of the City is largely situated on the surface of uplifted older alluvial fans
(outspread, gently sloping surfaces consisting of stream-lain deposits)
below the San Gabriel Mountains. Only the edges of the City encroach
onto or near mountainous areas on the west, the northwest and
northeast. Geologic units within the City consist of poorly or crudely
stratified sand, silt, and gravel in the valley, with dense crystalline rock
forming most of the hillsides. Hills in the southeast corner of the City,
generally south of Colorado Boulevard, are composed of stratified
sedimentary rocks, typically sandstone, conglomerate and shale.
The City’s hillsides are vulnerable to slope instability due primarily to the
fractured, crushed and weathered condition of the bedrock, and the
steep terrain (see Plate P-1). Oversteepened slopes along the large
drainage channels are also locally susceptible. The probability of large
bedrock landslides occurring is relatively low, therefore the source of
potential losses due to slope instability arises primarily from the
occurrence of smaller slope failures in the form of small slides, slumps,
soil slips, debris flows and rockfalls. The initiation of such failures is
generally tied to a preceding event, such as wildfire, heavy winter storms,
seismic activity, or man’s activities.
Some of the geologic units in the Pasadena area have fine-grained
components that are moderately to highly expansive. These units are
generally present in the southern San Rafael Hills (south of Colorado
Boulevard) and in the southern part of the City, where fine-grained
sequences within the alluvial fans are more likely to be present. These
fine-grained units may not be present at the surface but may be exposed
during grading.
Two major stream channels transect the City: Arroyo Seco on the west,
and Eaton Wash on the east. Arroyo Seco has a deeply entrenched
channel that originates in the San Gabriel Mountains and flows
southward along the eastern side of the San Rafael Hills, eventually
flowing into the Los Angeles River. Eaton Wash also emanates from
the mountains to the north, is joined by the channels from Pasadena
Glen and Hastings Canyons, and eventually flows into the Rio Hondo
River. Both drainages have been modified by flood control dams near
the base of the mountains, and both have been confined to man-made
channels or storm drains along their lower reaches, in the valley.
In most years, both channels carry little water, with peak discharges
typically of less than 1,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) for Arroyo Seco,
and less than 500 cfs for Eaton Wash. Records indicate that the two
most severe storms in the 20th Century, during 1938 and 1969, caused
the highest historical peak discharges measured in these channels, with
approximately 8,800 cfs for Arroyo Seco. Historical records also show
that historical peak discharges in these watersheds have occurred most

                                                                     Page 19

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
often between November and March, indicating that future flooding in
the area is most likely to occur in the winter months. The City of
Pasadena is currently not vulnerable to flooding associated with the
Arroyo Seco and Eaton Canyon Creek and its tributaries. However,
future development in the upstream areas could change this.
Debris flooding has occurred previously in many of the canyons near
the Pasadena area, in the upper reaches of the watersheds. Zachau,
Rubio and Shields Canyons have flooded in the past, and are likely to
flood again. Debris floods are more likely to occur in wet years
following wildland fires. The inundation pathways resulting from the
catastrophic failure for each of the dams on these drainages have been
mapped (see Plate P-2). If Devil’s Gate Reservoir fails catastrophically,
most of the water will be confined to the Arroyo Seco channel, but it
would impact the Rose Bowl and other developed areas both north and
south of the 210 Freeway. If Eaton Wash Dam failed, the inundation
would impact residential and commercial areas located downstream of
the dam, but north of the 210 Freeway.
Currently, shallow ground water levels (< 50 feet from the ground
surface) are known to have occurred historically only in some portions
of the City, generally along the mayor drainages and canyons. Shallow
ground water has also been reported in the southwestern portion of the
City, at the base of the San Rafael Hills, and along the Raymond fault,
where water ponds against the fault, rising to within 50 feet of the
surface. Seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels, and the
introduction of residential irrigation requires that site-specific
investigations be completed to support these generalizations in areas
mapped as potentially susceptible to liquefaction (see Plate P-1). Some
areas of the City may also be susceptible to seismically induced
settlement. Sites near the base of the San Rafael Hills, at the valley
margins, may be particularly vulnerable as a result of differential
settlement at the bedrock-alluvial contact.
The portions of the San Rafael Hills and the San Gabriel Mountains
within City limits are mapped as having a fire hazard due to the steep
topography of the area and the presence of flammable vegetation (see
Plate P-2). Some of these areas are under Federal jurisdiction (Very
High Fire Hazard Severity Zones), and some are under State jurisdiction
(State Responsibility Areas). Other areas, such as developments at the
margins of the Hahamongna Watershed Park, near Eaton Canyon, and
at the base and the flanks of the San Rafael Hills, at the wildland-urban
interface, are the City’s responsibility. Residents in all of these areas need
to recognize that they live in a hazardous area, and that they are
responsible for maintaining their properties. This includes but is not
limited to establishing a fire-resistant landscape, and building with fire-
resistant materials. Earthquake-induced fires pose a risk in the
developed, downtown areas of the City, the result of downed electric

lines, broken gas mains, and tipped-over appliances. Multiple ignitions
over a broad area of the City can tax the local Fire Department,
especially if the water reservoirs or water mains have also been damaged
during the earthquake.
There are two large-quantity and more than two hundred small-quantity
generators of hazardous materials in the City. Given these numbers, it is
impressive that the actual number of unauthorized releases of hazardous
materials into the environment is fairly small, as documented in the
Federal and State databases reviewed. There are four sites at or near the
City that have released hazardous materials of concern into the air – the
EPA monitors these facilities closely to reduce the potential of future
emissions at concentrations above the acceptable limits. Of these, the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) site, just outside the City boundaries, is
located within the recommended fault hazard management zone for the
Sierra Madre, and within a fire hazard area. Since JPL is also the largest
user of hazardous materials in the area, there is a real potential for this
site to negatively impact the surrounding area should an earthquake on
the Sierra Madre fault or a wildfire cause hazardous materials to be
released.

            SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
None of the significant hazardous sites are located within or adjacent to
a liquefaction susceptible area, or an unstable slope area. Furthermore,
none of the sites are located within or adjacent to a dam inundation
area. Therefore, with the exception of JPL, most significant hazardous
sites are well situated. The one concern that applies to all sites is that the
Pasadena area is susceptible to high to very high ground motions as a
result of an earthquake on either the Sierra Madre or Raymond fault.
Therefore, all sites should provide for, at a minimum, secondary
containment of hazardous substances, including segregation of reactive
chemicals, in accordance with the most recent California Fire Code and
City of Pasadena Fire Code amendments.

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
5.0     IMPLEMENTATION
In conformance with State law, the City of Pasadena has updated the
Safety Element of the General Plan. As required by section 65302(g) of
the California Code of Regulations, each local government is required to
maintain a comprehensive Safety Element that addresses a variety of
natural and man-made hazards and that provides goals and policies
aimed at reducing the risk associated with these hazards. The Safety
Element serves the following functions:
    •   Provides an assessment of the natural and man-made hazards in
        the City, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides,
        fire, flood, dam inundation, and hazardous materials incidents;
    •   Provides a framework by which safety considerations are
        introduced into the land use planning process and the
        redevelopment process;
    •   Strengthens the City’s existing municipal codes, and provides
        guidelines that the City can use during the project review and
        permitting process to identify and mitigate hazards for new
        development and redevelopment;
    •   Provides policies directed at identifying and reducing hazards in
        existing development; and
    •   Strengthens earthquake flood, fire, and hazardous materials
        preparedness planning and post-disaster reconstruction policies
        particular to the City of Pasadena.
Whether related to earthquakes, other natural or man-made hazards, or
disaster preparedness, Safety Element goals are guided by the City’s
responsibility to:
    •   Minimize fatalities and injuries;
    •   Minimize the burden on public and emergency response
        resources (police, fire, medical, etc.);
    •   Minimize public and private costs for cleanup, repair and
        recovery; and
    •   Minimize long-term impacts caused by displaced households,
        business disruption, and reduced fiscal resources (with a
        consequent tax burden).
Policy statements address specific concerns believed to be of long-term
planning importance to the community. Program statements, on the
other hard, are specific implementation measures selected to maintain or

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The following are recommendations for the Safety Element policy
framework for the City of Pasadena based on findings presented in the
Technical Background Report.
SEISMIC HAZARDS:
Goal S-1:        Minimize injury and loss of life, property damage, and
other impacts caused by seismic shaking, fault rupture, ground failure,
earthquake-induced landslides, and other earthquake-induced ground
deformation.
    Policy S-1: The City will monitor development or re-development
    within the Fault Hazard Management Zones identified for both the
    Sierra Madre and Raymond faults.
        Program S1-1: The City will cooperate with State and Federal
        agencies in conducting geological investigations of the Sierra
        Madre and Raymond faults. The City will investigate the
        possibility of partnering with the Earthquake Hazards Program
        of the U.S. Geological Survey to better identify the active traces
        of the Sierra Madre fault.
        Program S1-2: The City shall require geological studies, such as
        fault-trenching, of the defined traces of the Sierra Madre and
        the Raymond fault traces shown on Plate P-1. The studies shall
        be conducted by State-certified engineering geologists following
        the guidelines established in the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
        Studies Act. This should apply to the development and
        redevelopment of residential, commercial or industrial parcels or
        tracts that amount to 5,000 square feet or more. The City
        Geologist shall review the fault studies to ensure that the
        excavations were conducted with an acceptable level of effort to
        determine whether or not there are active faults through the
        proposed development, and that suitable fault setbacks are
        defined.
        Program S1-3: The City will require geological studies of the
        less well-defined traces of the Sierra Madre fault shown on
        Plate P-1 for critical facilities proposed within this zone. The
        studies shall be conducted by State-certified engineering
        geologists.
    Policy S-2: The City will ensure that current geologic knowledge
    and State-certified professional review are incorporated into the
    design, planning and construction stages of a project, and that site-
    specific data are applied to each project.
Safety Element
Page 26
        SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
    Program S2-1: The City shall retain on staff, or on a contract
    basis, a State-certified engineering geologist and a geotechnical
    engineer to review all geotechnical studies for proposed
    development or redevelopment, including fault studies
    (Programs S1-1 through S1-3), and to review grading operations
    (Programs S2-3 and S2-4). These individuals, whether on staff
    or under contract to the City, are referred to herein as the City
    Geologist and City Geotechnical Engineer, respectively.
    Program S2-2:         The City will modify the fault hazard
    management zones for the Raymond and Sierra Madre faults as
    data obtained from the implementation of Programs S1-1
    through S1-3 become available. Modification of the map will be
    conducted by or under the direction of the City Geologist.
    Program S2-3: The City shall require geological and geotechnical
    investigations in areas of potential seismic or geologic hazards as
    part of the environmental and development review process. The
    City shall not approve proposals and projects for development
    or redevelopment which do not provide for mitigation of
    seismic or geologic hazards to the satisfaction of the responsible
    agencies.
    Program S2-4: The City shall continue to require preliminary
    geological investigations of tract sites by State-registered
    geotechnical engineers and certified engineering geologists (in
    accordance with the California Building Code).
    Program S2-5: The City shall continue to require liquefaction
    assessment studies in areas identified as susceptible to
    liquefaction in accordance with the California Geological Survey
    Special Publication 117 Guidelines, and the Southern California
    Earthquake Center’s procedures to implement Special
    Publication 117.
Policy S-3: The City will strive to ensure that the design of new, and
the performance of existing structures address the appropriate
earthquake hazards.
    Program S3-1: The City shall continue to enforce the seismic
    design provisions for Seismic Zone 4 of the California Building
    Code, including near-source seismic conditions.
    Program S3-2: The City will identify un-retrofitted buildings,
    including tilt-up construction, non-ductile reinforced concrete,
    and tuck-under parking and other soft-story construction. A
    catalog of these buildings in the City will be completed.

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
         Program S3-3: The City shall prepare a plan for structural
         retrofit of such buildings identified under Program S3-2.
         Program S3-4: The City will disclose to the buyer through City
         occupancy programs the potential problems with unbolted
         foundations in pre-1935 residences.
         Program S3-5: The City will require prior to the reconstruction
         of damaged / destroyed buildings in hazard management zones,
         especially fault zones, to prove that the site can be safely
         restored using earthquake-resistant building techniques and land
         development policies as identified under Program S-1.2.
    Policy S-4: The City will ensure to the fullest extent possible that, in
    the event of a major disaster, essential structures and facilities
    remain safe and functional, as required by current law. Essential
    facilities include hospitals, police stations, fire stations, emergency
    operation centers, communication centers, generators and
    substations, and reservoirs.
         Program S-4.1: The City will continue to encourage the
         participation of the Planning and Development Departments
         during the early, conceptual stages of a critical facility project to
         assess its feasibility, with emphasis on issues such as surface fault
         rupture potential, liquefaction susceptibility, and inundation
         potential.
         Program S-4.2: The City will encourage compliance with the
         1974 Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act, the 1986 California
         Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act and SB 1953. The City will
         continue to work with the Huntington Memorial Hospital and
         state agencies to ensure that the hospital buildings will remain
         occupiable and operational following a maximum magnitude
         earthquake on the Raymond or Sierra Madre faults.
         Program S-4.3: The City will seek cooperative agreements with
         regional hospitals outside City limits that can provide medical
         assistance in the event that the Huntington Hospital does not
         have sufficient beds to accommodate all of the casualties
         resulting from an earthquake or other disaster. Open areas, such
         as parks and school fields, from which victims could be airlifted
         to regional hospitals if necessary will be identified as part of this
         program.
Safety Element

         SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
Policy S-5: The City will continue earthquake strengthening and
provisions for alternate or back-up essential services, such as water,
sewer, electricity, and natural gas pipelines and connections
throughout the City. First priority for this program should be for
the essential services within the identified fault hazard management
zones.
     Program S-5.1: The City shall conduct seismic analysis of
     essential infrastructure such as water, sewer, electricity, and
     natural gas lines and make any structural changes necessary to
     withstand seismic activities. This may include additional
     strengthening, shoring and/or flexible pipelines in areas that
     cross fault hazard zones.
Policy S-6: The City will ensure to the fullest extent possible that, in
the event of a major disaster, dependent care and high-occupancy
facilities will remain safe.
     Program S-6.1: The City’s Building Department shall continue
     to review existing and proposed projects to ensure that stairways
     and elevators in high-occupancy buildings are adequately
     strengthened.
     Program S-6.2: The City’s Fire Department, as part of their
     annual review of businesses and dependent care facilities, shall
     encourage and educate the owners or operators of these facilities
     about emergency generators, and the value of securely anchoring
     computers, shelving, and other non-structural elements.
Policy S-7: The City will educate the public on the hazards that can
pose a risk to the City and its residents, and will describe loss
reduction strategies that can be used to mitigate the specific hazards
identified.
     Program S-7.1: The City will regularly review the technical data
     on public safety and seismic safety for use in the planning
     process and undertake a technical update to the Safety Element
     as needed. This includes the periodic update of the maps that
     support the Technical Background Report with newly developed
     data obtained in response to geological studies undertaken for
     fault, liquefaction or landslide studies. Where sufficient data are
     developed to indicate that an area currently identified as
     susceptible to liquefaction is NOT liquefiable, modify the map
     to eliminate the need for future studies in that area. Results of
     these findings will be submitted to the California Geological
     Survey.
                                                        Safety Element
                                                                Page 29

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
        Program S-7.2: The City will continue to develop an effective
        system for communicating information about risk and loss
        reduction strategies to City staff in all departments responsible
        for implementing the programs defined in the Safety Element.
        Program S-7.3: The City will develop a web-based system to
        communicate to the City’s residents, workers and visitors the
        hazards specific to the City, and, most importantly, to describe
        the loss reduction strategies that homeowners and workers can
        implement at home and the work place to reduce their risk.
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Grading and construction operations are necessary to correct for
unstable soils, soil erosion, landsliding and flooding (debris and/or
mudflows) in hillside areas. This is sometimes in conflict with the desire
to preserve the aesthetic or natural conditions of the existing
topography. There must be a balance of the two objectives.
Goal G-1:        Minimize the risk to life or limb, and property damage
resulting from soil and slope instability.
    Policy G-1: Whenever possible, mitigation of geologic hazards will
    be conducted without violating the property owners’ rights to
    modify or improve their investment, along with preserving the
    aesthetic or natural conditions of the area through minimal grading.
    When these goals are in conflict, protection of life and property will
    take precedence.
        Program G1-1: In the areas of Pasadena susceptible to slope
        instability, the City will require geotechnical investigations that
        include engineering analyses of slope stability, provide surface
        and subsurface drainage specifications, and provide detailed
        design for fill placement and excavation.
        Program G1-2: The City will discourage any grading beyond
        that which is necessary to create adequate and safe building
        pads. The City Geologist and Geotechnical Engineer shall
        conduct regular inspection of grading operations to maximize
        site safety and compatibility with community character.
        Program G1-3: In the hillside or mountainous areas of Pasadena,
        the City will discourage excessive grading of slopes greater than
        3:1 (horizontal:vertical), and will encourage varied slope ratios
        on design slopes to reduce the visual impact of grading.
Safety Element
Page 30

            SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
       Program G-1.4: The City shall prohibit cut or fill slopes steeper
       than 2:1.
       Program G-1.5: The City will not permit the reconstruction of
       structures meant for human habitation that were damaged or
       destroyed by failed slopes unless the applicant can prove that the
       remedial measures proposed will improve the unstable slope
       conditions making the site suitable for redevelopment.
   Policy G-2: The City will continue to participate in regional
   programs designed to protect the groundwater resources of the
   Raymond Basin while protecting the area from the hazard of
   regional ground subsidence.
       Program G-2.1: The City will continue to encourage water
       conservation through public education.
       Program G-2.2: The City will participate in a technical group
       consisting of representatives from various cities in the Raymond
       Basin brought together to evaluate the feasibility of
       implementing artificial recharge programs, protecting
       groundwater quality, monitoring the ground water, and
       publishing annual reports on basin conditions.
FLOOD HAZARDS:
Goal F-1: Minimize injury, loss of life, property damage, and economic
and social disruption caused by flood and inundation hazards.
   Policy F1-1: The City will discourage development in flood hazard
   areas and will strengthen the City’s maintenance program for storm
   water detention basins, culverts and storm drains to minimize future
   flooding events.
       Program F-1.1: The City will continue to participate in the
       National Flood Insurance Program.
       Program F-1.2: The City shall, in cooperation with the Los
       Angeles County Flood Control Department, conduct studies of
       drainage and dam improvements in selected areas at the base of
       the San Gabriel Mountains and the San Rafael Hills, to identify
       where improvements may be necessary.
       Program F-1.3: The City shall encourage the development of
       parks and recreational facilities in the Arroyo Seco area,
                                                          Safety Element
                                                                 Page 31

SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
        consistent with the natural environment of the Arroyo Seco and
        in an effort to retain the area as open space.
        Program F-1.4: The City shall discourage the redevelopment of
        critical structures in the dam inundation pathway of the Eaton
        Canyon dam, unless it can demonstrate that the proposed
        project will be safe from flooding.
        Program F-1.5: The City will develop evacuation plans and
        routes for those areas within the dam inundation pathway of the
        Arroyo Seco and Eaton Canyon (i.e., the Rose Bowl and parks
        within the Arroyo Seco drainage). These emergency response
        plans may include an alarm system, such as sirens and
        loudspeakers linked remotely to the Fire Department and the
        upstream dams, to be used to report on eminent inundation
        associated with the catastrophic release of water from upstream
        reservoirs.
        Program F-1.6: In the San Gabriel Mountains and the San
        Rafael Hills, the City will assess the potential environmental
        impacts that new construction in upstream areas will have on
        already developed areas downgradient. Hydrological studies to
        assess the impacts shall be required for all new construction in
        the hillsides to determine the necessity and impact that new
        development will have on the County drains and privately
        owned debris basins downstream from new development. If the
        analyses indicate a potential hazard, storm improvements shall
        be required. Fees to pay for the improvements may be assessed
        to the developers, as appropriate.
        Program F-1.7: The City will continue to maintain the culverts
        and storm drain system to prevent the accumulation of debris or
        other obstructions that would hamper the effectiveness of the
        system during rainy days.
FIRE HAZARDS
Goal R-1: It is the City’s desire to reduce threats to public and private
property from wildland and urban fire hazards.
    Policy R-1: The City will ensure to the extent possible that fire
    services, such as fire equipment, infrastructure, and response times
    are adequate for all sections of the City.
Safety Element
Page 32

            SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
        Program R-1.1: The City will conduct, in association with the
        local water providers, annual fire flow tests, especially in areas of
        high fire hazard. Deficiencies in the system shall be addressed as
        soon as possible.
        Program R-1.2: The City will continue to require that new
        private access roads are a minimum of 24 feet wide and have an
        adequate turning radius as required by the Fire Department.
        Program R-1.3: The City will continue to enforce a Class A
        Roofing ordinance or better for residential and commercial
        develoments. Residents with existing wood-shingle or unrated
        roofing materials will be encouraged to upgrade to fire resistive
        construction, including fire resistive eves and awnings.
    Policy R-2: The City will require all new development in areas with
    a high fire hazard to provide fire retardant landscaping and project
    design to reduce their fire hazard.
        Program R-2.1: The City will encourage residents to plant and
        maintain drought-resistant, fire-retardant landscape species on
        slopes to reduce the risk of brush fire and soil erosion in areas
        adjacent to canyons; and develop stringent site design and
        maintenance standards for areas with high fire hazard or soil
        erosion potential.
        Program R-2.2: The City will continue to enforce the Weed
        Abatement Program in high fire risk areas.
        Program R-2.3: Fire management plans shall be required for all
        new development in areas subject to wildfire.
        Program R-2.4: The City will continue to enforce the Uniform
        Fire Code and Municipal Fire Code Amendments for new
        construction in fire hazard areas, including the use of sprinklers
        in residential structures.
    Policy R-3: The City will study the secondary water supplies for
    emergency fire flow needs in an emergency.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The unhealthful effects of certain chemicals and substances has led to
extensive regulation of hazardous materials. The City shall cooperate
with adjacent jurisdictions, continue to coordinate with regional
                                                            Safety Element
                                                                    Page 33
SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
providers of emergency services, and make every effort to ensure that all
residents, workers, and visitors to Pasadena are protected from exposure
to hazardous materials and wastes.
Goal H-1:         Reduce the potential for hazardous contamination in the
City.
        Program H-1.1: The City will continue the enforcement of
        disclosure laws that require all users, producers, and transporters
        of hazardous materials and wastes to clearly identify the
        materials
        that they store, use or transport, and to notify the appropriate
        City, County, State and Federal agencies in the event of a
        violation.
        Program H-1.2: The City will identify City roadways along
        which hazardous materials are routinely transported. If critical
        facilities, such as schools, hospitals, child care centers or other
        facilities with special evacuation needs are located along these
        routes, identify emergency response plans that these facilities can
        implement in the event of an unauthorized release of hazardous
        materials.
        Policy H-1.3: New proposed facilities involved in the
        production, use, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous
        materials will be located a safe distance from land uses that may
        be adversely impacted by such activities. Conversely, new
        sensitive facilities shall not be allowed to be located near existing
        sites that use, store or generate hazardous materials.
        Policy H-1.4: The City shall assure the continued response to
        and capability of handling hazardous materials incidents in the
        City and along the sections of freeways that extend across the
        City.
        Policy H-1.5: The City will continue to encourage residents
        and businesses to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous
        materials. This includes encouraging residents to buy toxic
        substances in only the amount needed to do the job, or better
        yet, to use safer non-toxic alternate products that do not pose a
        threat to the environment.
        Program H-1.6: The City will continue to support the operation
        of recycling centers that take hazardous substances, such as
        paint, paint thinner, used waste oil, etc.

            SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
DISASTER RESPONSE PLANNING
Planning issues pertaining to emergency response, disaster preparedness,
and disaster recovery require an assessment of the hazards, identification
of functions and resources to handle short-term response, and
development of recovery procedures. Earthquakes pose the greatest
challenge because they occur with little or no warning, and can set into
motion a number of linked events.
Goal D-1:       Plan for emergency response and recovery from natural
and urban disasters, especially from earthquake and terrorist threats.
        Program D-1.1: The City will continue to maintain and update
        the City’s Multi-Hazard Functional Plan as necessary.
        Program D-1.2 The City will continue to maintain and update
        the City’s emergency response organization consisting of
        representatives from all City departments, local quasi-
        governmental agencies, private businesses, citizens, and other
        community partners involved in critical and/or community-wide
        services.
        Program D-1.3: The City will maintain mutual aid agreements
        with neighboring cities and the County of Los Angeles; and
        develop partnerships with other emergency relief organizations.
        Program D-1.4: The City will designate emergency shelters and
        centers with disaster assistance organizations (if necessary), to
        include identifying potential outdoor shelter locations.
        Program D-1.5: Establish traffic control contingency plans for
        disaster routes with the use of the City’s traffic control center.
        Program D-1.6: The City will coordinate the identification of
        casualty collection points and police/fire staging areas with local
        public safety agencies.
        Program D-1.7: The City will enhance public awareness and
        preparedness by encouraging residents to store supplies for self-
        reliance in the event of isolation.
        Program D-1.8: The City will offer education programs for
        residents and businesses regarding disaster mitigation measures
        to taker prior to, during, and after emergencies.

        Program D-1.10: The City will compile and maintain inventories
        of facilities with special risks, hazards and needs, that may crate
        special response situations during disasters.
        Program D-1.11: The City will continue to participate in regional
        emergency exercises.
        Program D-1.12: The City will support the development of
        local preparedness plans and multi-jurisdictional cooperation
        and
        communication for emergency situations consistent with

City of Pasadena General Plan
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
August 18, 2015
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Pasadena’s General Plan Land Use Element is grounded by the following Guiding Principles that cumulatively represent the
community’s vision for the future. The Guiding Principles were developed through an extensive program of community
outreach and input conducted over a six year period.
     1.  Growth will be targeted to serve community needs and enhance the quality of life. Higher density development will
         be directed away from residential neighborhoods and into the Central District, Transit Villages, and Neighborhood
         Villages. These areas will have a diverse housing stock, job opportunities, exciting districts with commercial and
         recreational uses, and transit opportunities. New development will build upon Pasadena’s tradition of strong sense of
         place, great neighborhoods, gardens, plazas, parks, and trees.
     2.  Pasadena’s historic resources will be preserved. Citywide, new development will be in harmony with and enhance
         Pasadena’s unique character and sense of place. New construction that could affect the integrity of historic resources
         will be compatible with, and differentiated from, the existing resource.
     3.  Pasadena will be an economically vital city by providing jobs, services, revenues, and opportunities. A diverse
         economic base with jobs for Pasadena residents will be fostered; existing businesses will be encouraged to stay or
         expand; affordable housing will be provided for the labor pool; the continued fiscal health of the city will be ensured.
     4.  Pasadena will be a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable community. Safe, well designed, accessible
         and human-scale residential and commercial areas will be provided where people of all ages can live, work and play.
         These areas will include neighborhood parks, urban open spaces and the equitable distribution of public and private
         recreational facilities; new public spaces will be acquired. Human services will be coordinated and made accessible to
         those who need them.
     5.  Pasadena will be a city where people can circulate without cars. Specific plans in targeted development areas will
         emphasize a mix of uses, pedestrian activity, and transit; public and private transit will be made more available;
         neighborhood villages and transit villages will reduce the need for auto use.
     6.  Pasadena will be a cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment and education center for the region. Long-term
         growth opportunities will be provided for existing institutions; a healthy economy will be fostered to attract new
         cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment and educational institutions.
     7.  Community Participation will be a permanent part of achieving a greater city. Citizens will be provided with timely and
         understandable information on planning issues and projects; citizens will directly participate in shaping plans and
         policies for Pasadena’s future.
     8.  Pasadena is committed to public education and a diverse educational system responsive to the broad needs of the
         community.
                                                                                  SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 1

LAND USE DIAGRAM
The Land Use Diagram (Figure 1) functions as a guide to the general public, planners, and decision-makers, depicting the
ultimate pattern of development for Pasadena in 2035, consistent with the requirements of State planning law (Government
Code §65302(a)). It depicts the distribution of various uses and intensity of development that shall be permitted as the physical
representation of this element’s goals and policies. These are implemented through the Zoning Code, Zoning Map, and Specific
Plan. These tools more precisely delineate permitted uses and which may be more restrictive in the range of permitted uses
and densities. This section describes the Land Use Diagram, categories depicted on the Diagram, and their permitted
densities/intensities.
Figure 1
Development Density/Intensity Standards
Standards for the density and intensity of development are defined for each land use category depicted on the Land Use
Diagram. These establish a range of minimum and maximum densities or intensities. The City of Pasadena Zoning Map and
adopted Specific Plans designate uses for all parcels at a greater level of specificity with densities falling within the range shown
on the Land Use Diagram. Densities defined for parcels by the Zoning Map and Specific Plans may be less than, but not exceed
those shown on the Land Use Diagram without an amendment of the General Plan.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 2

Residential Land Use Designations
The standard for residential designations is expressed as the maximum number of dwelling units per net acre. Population
density can be derived by multiplying the maximum number of dwelling units per net acre by the estimated average number of
persons per unit, for the applicable residential designation, as specified below. The following illustrates various residential
densities on a common-size parcel.
                                                       This illustration shows different densities for residential development on
                                                       a similarly sized lot. This graphic is intended only to show the relative
                                                       differences between residential developments at various densities and
                                                       does not represent a density standard for this General Plan. The
                                                       diagrams are placeholders, to be replaced by those illustrating densities
                                                       shown on the Land Use Diagram.
Non-Residential Land Use Designations
Standards for building intensity for commercial uses and R&D flex space are expressed as floor-area ratios (FARs), defined as
the ratio of building to land area. The square footage of a building permitted on a property is calculated by multiplying the site
area by the FAR. For example, on a 20,000 square foot parcel, a FAR of 0.5 would permit a building of 10,000 square feet; a FAR
of 1.0 would permit a building of 20,000 square feet, and so on. The following illustrates the building configuration for various
FARs on a common-size parcel. While FAR prescribes the maximum allowable area for a new building relative to the size of its
site, it does not determine the mass or form of the new building. Title 17 of the City’s Municipal Code and design guidelines
specify other regulations that will affect a building's form and style within the permitted FAR (e.g., building height limits,
setbacks, and open space requirements).
                                          This illustration shows how various building configurations represent different FARs
                                          of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 on a similar sized parcel. This graphic is intended only to show
                                          the relative differences in FAR and does not represent an intensity standard for
                                          this General Plan.
Mixed-Use Designations
Properties designated as Mixed-Use (MU) by the Land Use Diagram may be developed for a singular use (i.e., commercial or
housing) or a mix of uses on the same site. Where a single use is developed, the standard for a commercial use shall be FAR and
the standard for a residential use shall be units per net acre, where the size of the dwelling units shall not be calculated as FAR,
in conformance with the appropriate MU classification. Where both commercial and residential uses are developed, the
standard shall be both FAR and units per net acre, where the cumulative building area (commercial and residential) shall not
exceed the maximum FAR specified for the land use category.
Land Use Classifications
The following describes and characterizes the general range of land uses and densities/intensities envisioned for each category
of use depicted on the Land Use Diagram. A detailed list of uses allowed in each zone is specifically defined by Title 17 of the
City’s Municipal Code.
                                                                                     SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 3

Housing
The housing land use categories are intended to provide a diversity of living environments and choices, both ownership and
rental, for Pasadena’s residents. These categories are correlated with the goals and policies for affordability defined by the
Housing Element. A minimum and maximum density is defined for each land use category. Affordable housing density bonuses
defined by State law and the Housing Element may exceed the maximum densities.
Low Density Residential. 0-6 dwelling units per acre. Characterized by single-family residential development with lot sizes
ranging from 7,200 square feet to 40,000 square feet and one to two story buildings. These lots are characterized by a variety
of single-family dwellings, ample open space, extensive landscaping, and separations between single-family dwellings and/or
accessory buildings. Single-family dwellings are typically some distance from the street, with large front, side, and rear yard
setbacks.
Low-Medium Density Residential. 0-12 dwelling units per acre. Characterized by a mixture of duplexes and single-family
residential developments in neighborhoods with lot sizes ranging from 7,200 square feet to 40,000 square feet and one to two
story buildings. These lots are characterized by open space, extensive landscaping, and separations between dwellings and/or
permitted accessory buildings. Dwellings are typically some distance to the street, with front, side and rear yard setbacks.
Medium Density Residential. 0-16 dwelling units per acre. Characterized by lower density multi-family complexes in
neighborhoods with densities of up to 16 dwelling units per acre and one to three story buildings. Though not exclusively, many
of these buildings are characterized as “City of Gardens” projects. Their main feature is a centrally located and usable courtyard
or garden court. Units are encouraged to have an entrance toward the street. Parking is not visible from the street and
driveways are minimized. There are minimal setbacks at the rear of the property.
Medium-High Density Residential. 0-32 dwelling units per acre. Characterized by medium-high density multi-family complexes
in neighborhoods with densities of up to 32 dwelling units per acre and one to three story buildings. Though not exclusively,
many of these buildings are characterized as “City of Gardens” projects. Their main feature is a centrally located courtyard or
garden court that is visible from the street. They may have front yards, and if so, they are landscaped and should be similar in
size to the rest of properties in the area. Units are encouraged to have an entrance toward the street. Parking is not visible
from the street and driveways are minimized. There are minimal setbacks at the rear of the property.
High Density Residential. 0-48 dwelling units per acre. Characterized by higher density multi-family complexes in
neighborhoods with densities of up to 48 dwelling units per acre and two to three story buildings. Though not exclusively, many
of these buildings are characterized as “City of Gardens” projects. Their main feature is a centrally located courtyard or garden
court that is visible from the street. Units are encouraged to have an entrance toward the street. Parking is not visible from
the street and driveways are minimized. There are minimal setbacks at the rear of the property.
Urban Housing. 0-87 dwelling units per acre. Characterized by a variety of development types including high-density multi-
family complexes in neighborhoods with densities of up to 87 dwelling units per acre and four to seven story buildings. These
lots are characterized by landscaped courtyards and minimal separations between buildings. Parking is not visible from the
street and driveways are minimized. Units adjacent to the street have direct entries to the street. These buildings are typically
closer to the street, with small sized or no front, side, and rear yard setbacks.
Mixed-Use
The mixed-use land use classifications are intended to afford the intermixing of housing with non-residential uses. This may
consist of a mix of housing types horizontally distributed within a district, block, or parcel, or with housing built above non-
residential uses. Mixed-use development is an important strategy enabling residents to live close to where they work, shop, and
recreate. This can result in less vehicle trips, energy consumption, pollution, noise and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
increases in walking, bicycling, and transit use. It also expands the customer base supporting nearby businesses, enhancing
their economic viability and vitality. Finally, a mix of housing and non-residential uses enhances social interactions and, through
walking and bicycling, human health.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 4

Low Mixed Use. 0.0-1.0 FAR, 0-32 dwelling units per acre. Intended to support the development of properties and/or buildings

exclusively commercial or exclusively residential, or with buildings vertically integrating housing with non-residential uses.
Mixed-use development projects containing housing shall incorporate amenities contributing to a quality living environment for
residents including courtyards, recreation facilities, and similar elements. Where buildings face the street frontage, they shall
be designed to enhance pedestrian activity with transparent facades for retail uses and distinctive entries for housing. Parking
shall be located below or to the rear of the street. Projects constructed at Medium Mixed Use densities may be required to
develop pedestrian-oriented streetscape amenities along their primary street frontages, consistent with the improvement
concepts and plans defined by the City.
High Mixed Use. 0.0-3.0 FAR, 0-87 dwelling units per acre. Intended to support the development of multi-story mixed use
buildings with a variety of compatible commercial (retail and office) and residential uses. Development is characterized by

Open Space. Characterized by a variety of public and private natural and developed open spaces including City-owned open
space facilities, private golf courses, natural open spaces and areas which have been designated as environmentally and
ecologically significant, and land which is publicly owned though in some instances public access may be restricted.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 6

LAND USE GOALS AND POLICIES
The following text presents the goals and policies for land use in the City of Pasadena. They are divided into three sections
including those applicable: (a) globally to all uses and locations in the City, (b) to each principal land use category depicted on
the Land Use Diagram, and (c) to sub-areas of the City including adopted specific plan areas.
Goals are defined as general direction-setters, as an ideal future related to expressions of community values and may be
abstract in nature. Policies are specific statements guiding decision-making indicating commitments to a particular course of
action that carry-out one or more goals.
Citywide Goals and Policies
Goals and policies in this section globally apply to all land uses and geographic locations in the City.
Growth
Goals and policies provide for community conservation and strategic growth, preserving existing neighborhoods and targeting
new development to infill areas that are vacant or underutilized, and are scaled and designed to complement existing uses.
Changes are grounded by the eight Guiding Principles and emphasize maintaining the quality of life of Pasadena’s residents
with decreased automobile trips, increased walkability, improve connectivity, and create cohesive and vigorous districts and
places.
GOAL 1. Sustainable Growth. Sustainable growth and change in orderly and well-planned developments within targeted areas
that allow for higher density development in an urban core setting and in close proximity to transit that provides for the needs
of existing and future residents and businesses, ensures the effective provision of public services, and makes efficient use of
land, energy, and infrastructure.
Policies
1.1     Basic Growth Policy. Accommodate growth that is consistent with community values and that complements the scale
        and character of Pasadena’s unique residential neighborhoods, business districts, and open spaces.
1.2     Targeted Growth. Target growth and new construction in infill areas and away from Pasadena’s residential
        neighborhoods and open spaces by redeveloping underutilized commercial and industrial properties, especially within
        the Central District, Transit Villages, Neighborhood Villages, and along selected corridors.
                                                                                     SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 7

1.4     Conversion of Development Capacities. Allow for the conversion of residential units to commercial square feet, or vice
        versa, in the specific plan areas provided that: (a) such conversions are not precluded by the specific plans; (b) the
        modified land use mix maintains the desired vision and character for the area defined by the Land Use Elements’ goals
        and policies and the adopted specific plans; (c) the conversion results in community benefits that may have not
        otherwise been achieved; and (d) the total square footage of residential or non-residential development under the
        adopted caps per specific plan is not exceeded. Any conversion shall be subject to the appropriate review under the
        California Environmental Quality Act.
1.5     Growth and Change Evaluation. Review the General Plan’s residential and commercial capacities every five years.
        Modify, as necessary, to reflect development that has occurred, its impacts, evolving market and economic conditions,
        and consistency with community values.
1.6     General Plan Amendments. Limit amendments to the General Plan that would increase development capacities to the
        five-year review of the General Plan Land Use Element.
1.7     Coordination of Capital Facilities, Infrastructure, Land Use, and Economic Development. Development of capital
        facilities and infrastructure shall be closely coordinated with growth to ensure high levels of service to existing and new
        development. Targeted growth areas shall have highest priority for capital improvements that induce and support
        development.
1.8     Unimproved Streets. No developments on unimproved streets will be approved until adequate infrastructure
        improvements are in place or will be made.
1.9     Development Costs. Require new development to provide public services and facilities through equitable fees and
        exactions.
Land Use Mix
The following goals and policies provide for the maintenance of existing and development of new land uses that cumulatively
provide for the needs of Pasadena’s residents, contribute to the quality of life, are economically prosperous and sustainable,
respect the City’s environmental setting, and are consistent with the City’s history, cultural, and community aspirations.
GOAL 2. Land Use Diversity. A mix of land uses meeting the diverse needs of Pasadena’s residents and businesses, fostering
improved housing conditions, offering a variety of employment and recreation opportunities, and supporting a healthy
population while protecting the environment.

2.3     Commercial Businesses. Designate sufficient land to enable a broad range of viable commercial uses in Pasadena’s
        Central District, Transit and Neighborhood Villages, and commercial corridors. These uses will serve both local and
        regional needs, reducing the need for residents to travel to adjoining communities, capturing a greater share of local
        spending, and offering a diversity of employment opportunities.
2.4     Job Choices. Provide opportunities for the development of a broad range of land uses that offer job opportunities for
        Pasadena’s residents, including professional and creative office, institutional and research and development (R&D) flex
        space.
2.5     Mixed Use. Create opportunities for development projects that mix housing with commercial uses to enable Pasadena’s
        residents to live close to businesses and employment, increasing non-auto travel, and interact socially.
2.6     Transit-Related Land Uses. Promote the development of uses that support and capture the economic value induced by
        the presence of transit corridors and stations.
2.7     Civic and Community Services. Provide diverse uses and services supporting Pasadena’s residents such as facilities for
        civic governance and administration, public safety (police and fire), seniors and youth, community gatherings, and
        comparable activities.
2.8     Equitable Distribution of Community Devices and Amenities. Ensure that parks and recreation facilities, community
        services, and amenities are equitably distributed and accessible throughout the City.
2.9     Institutional Uses. Accommodate the development of educational, religious, cultural, and similar facilities that enrich
        the lives of Pasadena’s residents.
2.10    Healthy Foods. Promote the development of uses providing healthy and locally-grown food choices for Pasadena’s
        residents (i.e., brick and mortar facilities, community gardens, and farmers markets).
2.11    Health Facilities. Accommodate a wide range of healthcare and mental health facilities that are transit-accessible and
        pedestrian-friendly.
2.12    Health and Wellness. Adopt a framework of policies that characterize and encourage the connections between access
        to locally grown foods, nutritional education, the encouragement of physical activity, and an overall commitment to
        health and wellness of Pasadena’s youth, adults, and seniors.
2.13    Parks. Maintain existing and develop new parks and recreational facilities within walking distance of residents,
        supporting healthy lifestyles.
2.14    Natural Areas. Maintain existing and acquire additional natural areas to protect watersheds, natural resources, and
        afford recreational opportunities for Pasadena’s residents.
                                                                                   SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 9

Compatible Land Uses
All communities contain uses and functions necessary for the support and welfare of the population that have characteristics
that could negatively impact their setting. The following goals and policies are intended to manage the distribution and
operations of such uses to assure compatibility with Pasadena’s neighborhoods and districts.
GOAL 3. Compatible Land Uses. A mix and distribution of land uses characterized by their compatibility.
Policies
3.1         High-Impact Uses. Avoid the concentration of uses and facilities in any neighborhood or district where their

Urban Form and Placemaking
"Urban form" is often defined as (a) the "general pattern of building height and development intensity" and (b) the "structural
elements" that define the City physically, such as natural features, transportation corridors, open space, public facilities, as well
as activity centers and focal elements. It envisions the community in three dimensions; 1) how buildings are located on parcels,
2) how buildings relate to one another and 3) how buildings relate to the street – including sidewalks and open spaces. The
following goals and policies guide these elements contributing to distinct and quality places for living, working, shopping,
entertainment, and recreation that contribute to Pasadena’s quality of life, economic vitality, and character.
GOAL 4. Elements Contributing to Urban Form. A safe, well-designed, accessible City with a diversity of uses and forms. These
diverse forms include distinct, walkable districts, corridors, and transit and neighborhood villages and cohesive, unique single
and multi-family residential neighborhoods and open spaces where people of all ages can live, work, shop and recreate.
[Definition of Context: Context refers to external elements that influence an object. These elements can be physical (existing
structures, streetscapes, and natural forms) and non-physical (climactic, cultural identity, or economic imperatives).]
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 10

Policies

4.7     Strengthen Major Corridors. Encourage the economic improvement of underused parcels along Pasadena’s corridors by
        clustering more intense uses at major intersections and lower intensity mixed-use or commercial development between
        major intersections.
4.8     Complete and Livable Neighborhoods. Maintain the pattern of distinct residential neighborhoods oriented around
        parks, schools, and community meeting facilities that are connected to and walkable from neighborhood-serving
        businesses and public transit.
4.9     Gateways. Define prominent points of entry to the city with high quality, distinctive architecture or engineering
        (consider entry points like the intersection of South Orange Grove Boulevard and West Colorado Boulevard, the
        Colorado Street Bridge, or North Fair Oaks at Woodbury). Other elements, including art installations, landscaping, and
        light elements are also encouraged.
4.10    Architecture that Enhances. Locate and design buildings to relate to and frame major public streets, open spaces, and
        cityscape. New development at intersections should consider any number of corner treatments, and should balance
        safety and accessibility concerns with the vision of the area and the need for buildings to engage the street and create a
        distinct urban edge.
4.11    Development that is Compatible. Require that development demonstrates a contextual relationship with neighboring
        structures and sites addressing such elements as building scale, massing, orientation, setbacks, buffering, the

15.2    Education. Develop a well-educated work force that will fuel a healthy economy by expanding collaborative efforts
        between the City of Pasadena and Pasadena Unified School District (e.g., joint-use agreements, grant funding, and
        planning efforts).
Community Services
In the broadest sense, the City of Pasadena is committed to implementing policies supporting human development and the
quality of life for infants, children, youth, families and senior citizens, and recognizes that the well-being of its residents is linked
to the City’s own health and well-being. The City of Pasadena has a Policy on Children, Youth and Family developed in 1989 that
ensures a family focus on quality of life, an Early Child Development Policy adopted in 2015 that emphasizes access to quality
early education, a 2013-16 School/City/Community Work Plan that ensures the Human Development and Educational needs are
met of students so they graduate college and career ready, and a Senior Strategic Plan approved in 1995 that ensures successful

        participation in the planning, resource allocation, and evaluation of all programs.
16.7    Shared Facilities. Encourage the sharing of facilities between various public service providers, as well as those offered
        by private entities, such as the joint use of school play areas for recreation, school facilities for child and after school day
        care, and libraries for civic and cultural events.
16.8    Coordination of Human Services. Prioritize coordination of facilities and programs between public and private agencies
        and between various levels of government involved in the human service field. Aim to eliminate overlapping efforts in
        the human service field.
Education
Pasadena’s commitment to public education and a diverse educational system responsive to the needs of the community is a
fundamental principle framing the General Plan and Land Use Element. The following goals and policies express a variety of
strategies supporting a quality education for all residents and life-long learning opportunities.
GOAL 17. Educational System. A strong and diverse educational system that is responsive to the life-long needs of the
community and related to maintaining a high quality of life and a strong economy.
Policies

        and artistic endeavors, to scientific and mathematic fields. Support vocational training and school-to-career programs
        that help students gain early exposure to careers and mentors.
                                                                                    SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 19

17.3    Long-Range Planning for Public Schools. Encourage the Pasadena Unified School District to continue to participate in
        the City’s planning process and collaborate with the City on site selection, site design, traffic control, circulation and site
        acquisition to ensure compatibility with the neighborhoods or districts in which they are located.
17.4    Long-Range Planning for Private Schools. Require private schools to collaborate with the City on site selection, site
        design, traffic control, circulation and site acquisition to ensure compatibility with the neighborhoods or districts in
        which they are located.
17.5    Funding. Collaborate with the Pasadena Unified School District and other public institutions to pursue funding, such as
        grants, to improve both public schools and community facilities, to gather information, and to leverage existing

17.6    Supporting Uses. Encourage uses that support educational institutions, such as afterschool day care, tutoring centers,
        bookstores, dance schools, art classes, and karate studios, to cluster around schools located in commercial areas.
Correlation of Land Use with Mobility
By statute, the types and intensities of development permitted by the Land Use Plan must be correlated with the ability to
provide adequate mobility to residents and visitors consistent with community values for acceptable levels of congestion. A
primary principle defined by General Plan and Land Use Element is that Pasadena will be a city where people can circulate
without a car. Implementation of the mix and densities of uses depicted on the Land Use Diagram and urban form policies will
promote walking, bicycling, and transit use achieving this objective. The following goals and policies express the relationship
between land use development and mobility.
GOAL 18. Land Use/Transportation Relationship. Pasadena will be a City where there are effective and convenient alternatives
to using cars and the relationship of land use and transportation is acknowledged through transit-oriented development, multi-
modal design features, and pedestrian and bicycle amenities in coordination with and accordance with the Mobility Element.
Policies
18.1    Development Mix and Densities. Accommodate the mix and density of land uses and urban form that induce walking,
        bicycling, and transit use as an alternative to the automobile, as specified by the Land Use Diagram.
18.2    Mobility. Correlate land use development intensities with adequate infrastructure improvements and transportation
        strategies to ensure mobility in all areas of Pasadena.
18.3    Modal Choices. Promote the development of infrastructure supporting walking, bicycling, and transit use and complete
        streets as specified by the Mobility Element.
18.4    Transit-Pedestrian Coordination. Implement physical improvements facilitating pedestrian access from development
        projects to the street, bus stops, and/or transit stations.
18.5    Land Use-Mobility Compatibility. Manage vehicle traffic volumes and speeds to improve their compatibility with the
        character of the adjacent land uses, the function of the street(s), and bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
18.6    Relationship of Buildings to Transit Stops. Require that building entrances or accessways be oriented toward transit
        stops when located adjacent to these facilities.
Parking
Parking standards for Pasadena’s residential neighborhoods and commercial districts and corridors vary according to land use
type, density, and proximity to transit stations. Areas with higher density, mixed-use development projects in proximity to
transit stations require fewer parking spaces than other areas in recognition of the increased potential for transit ridership and
local walkability. These standards are established and periodically reviewed and adjusted through the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 20

The following goals and policies define a strategy to provide sufficient parking consistent with the vision, land use mix,
densities, and access to alternative transportation modes.
GOAL 19. Parking Availability. The supply of parking will reflect Pasadena’s objective to protect residential neighborhoods;
create a vital, healthy, and sustainable economy; establish Pasadena as a leader in environmental stewardship; encourage
physical activity and a commitment to health and wellness; and encourage walking, biking, and transit. The supply of parking in
an area will also reflect the type, mix, and density of uses; the availability of shared facilities; and the proximity to transit.
Policies
19.1       Parking Standards. Establish, periodically review, and adjust as necessary parking standards to ensure an adequate
           supply of parking commensurate with the vision, uses, densities, availability of alternative modes, and proximity to
           transit stations in the area.
19.2       Parking Limits. Establish limits on the amount of parking that may be developed for projects in the Central District
           and Transit Villages to promote walking, bicycling, and use of transit as an alternative to the automobile.
19.3       Parking Management. Manage parking to reduce the amount of land devoted to frequently vacant parking lots
           through parking management tools.
19.4       Park Once. Provide the opportunity for residents, patrons and visitors to park once and visit many destinations in the
           Central District, Transit Villages, and Neighborhood Villages through centrally located shared parking while providing
           additional flexibility for businesses to provide parking off-site or participate in other alternative parking funding
           mechanisms.
19.5       Bicycle Parking. Accommodate the development of bicycle parking centers in the Central District, Transit Villages, and
           Neighborhood Villages and require larger development projects to incorporate secured and convenient bicycle
           parking facilities.
19.6       Unbundled Parking. Encourage practices that separate the cost of parking from commercial lease rates, the costs of
           housing, and – where feasible – the price of goods and services to ensure that non-car owners do not pay for parking
           they do not need and help people weigh the true cost of driving in lieu of transit.
19.7       Reduced Demand for Parking. Reduce the demand for parking by encouraging businesses and residential
           development to incentivize walking, biking, and use of transit through practices such as subsidized Metro passes,
           exchanging parking for Metro passes, and other creative incentives.
Public Involvement and Participation
Pasadena’s residents are actively engaged in the discussion and deliberations for community policies and land use decision-
making. The following goals and policies build on this history and provide for continued opportunities as projects and
improvements are considered implementing the goals and policies of this element.
GOAL 20. Information and Participation. All Pasadena communities will be uniformly aware and participate in land use
planning, entitlement processes, and decision-making processes through the communication of clear and understandable
information and engagement opportunities.
Policies
20.1    Neighborhood Meetings. Encourage broad representation and community participation at all steps of the planning
        process.
20.2    Brochures and Notices. Provide notices and information regarding the review and entitlement process for proposed
        development projects enabling the public to provide input in decision-making. Ensure supporting documents, such as
                                                                                     SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 21

        staff reports dealing with land use matters, are easily accessible on the City website and are provided in a timely
        manner.
20.3    Public Involvement and Proposed Projects. Improve neighborhood participation in current planning and land use
        decisions by affording adequate opportunity to review and comment on plans, programs, activities and reports covering
        the City’s land use projects.
20.4    Neighborhood Connections. Utilize the Neighborhood Connections office to send notices of neighborhood meetings
        and public hearings to neighborhood associations within a reasonable radius of a proposed project and to the Pasadena
        Neighborhood Coalition.
20.5    Public Discussion. Increase public discussion through the use of new technology, providing multiple locations, times,
        communication avenues for public involvement and discussion of long range planning initiatives.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 22

LAND USE CATEGORIES
The following presents the goals and policies for each principal category of permitted land uses depicted on the Land Use
Diagram and described earlier in this element.
Residential Neighborhoods
Pasadena’s residential neighborhoods are principal contributors to the City’s history, identity, character, and quality of life. The
goals and policies in this section provide for their conservation and maintenance regardless of density and assurance that
changes and new development complement their distinguishing qualities.
GOAL 21. Desirable Neighborhoods. A City composed of neighborhoods with a variety of housing types that are desirable
places to live, contribute to the quality of life, and are well maintained.
Policies

        open spaces that are connected by trails, pathways, and bikeways and are within easy walking distance of residents.
21.11 Neighborhood-Oriented Schools. Encourage a mutually beneficial relationship between public schools and their
        surrounding neighborhoods so that schools contribute to neighborhood identity by allowing facilities to be used by
        community groups, making open space available, and creating community volunteer work days.
                                                                                 SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 23

GOAL 22.0. Single-Family Neighborhoods. Distinct and quality single-family residential neighborhoods distinguished by their
identity, scale, and character.
Policies

        with existing development in single-family residential neighborhoods.
22.2    Garages and Accessory Structures. Locate and design garages and accessory structures so that they do not dominate
        the appearance of the dwelling from the street.
GOAL 23. Multi-Family Neighborhoods. Multi-family residential neighborhoods that provide ownership and rental
opportunities, exhibit a high quality of architectural design, and incorporate amenities for their residents.
Policies
23.1    Character and Design. Design and modulate buildings to avoid the sense of “blocky” and undifferentiated building mass,
        incorporate well-defined entries, and use building materials, colors, and architectural details complementing the
        neighborhood, while allowing flexibility for distinguished design solutions.
23.2    Parking Areas and Garages. Minimize the visibility of parking areas and garages.
23.3    Landscaped Setbacks and Walkways. Provide appropriate setbacks, consistent with the surrounding neighborhood,
        along the street frontage and, where there are setbacks, ensure adequate landscaping is provided.
23.4    Development Transitions. Ensure sensitive transitions in building scale between buildings in multi-family residential
        areas and lower-scale buildings in adjoining residential areas.
23.5    Streetscapes. Provide ample public spaces and tree-lined sidewalks furnished with pedestrian amenities that contribute
        to comfortable and attractive settings for pedestrian activity.
23.6    Open Space Amenities. Require that open space is provided on-site, is accessible, and of sufficient size to be usable by
        residents, in common areas and/or with individual units pursuant to the Zoning Code.
GOAL 24. Supporting Uses in Residential Neighborhoods. Supporting uses that meet the needs of residents located and
designed to be subordinate to, and compatible with, the function and quality of the residential environment.
Policies

       bicycle access to nearby commercial centers, community facilities, parks, open space, transit facilities, bikeways, trails
       and other amenities, as applicable.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 24

Commercial Corridors and Districts
Pasadena contains a diversity of commercial corridors and districts providing opportunities for shopping, working, dining,
entertainment, services, and similar activities. These constitute places for commerce and gathering where residents and visitors
come together in their daily lives. Many of the corridors and centers at arterial intersections exhibit characteristics supportive
of automobile access and parking, with buildings setback from the street and unrelated to their neighbors. In contrast,
development in the Central District concentrates buildings along the street frontages with parking located to the rear or in
shared facilities, fostering active pedestrian use of the street front. The goals and policies in this section accommodate
additional development implementing goals and policies defined for a sustainable economy (Goals 11 through 15).
GOAL 25. Vital Districts and Corridors. Diverse, active, prosperous, and well-designed commercial corridors and districts that
provide a diversity of goods, services, and entertainment and contribute to a positive experience for residents and visitors.
25.1   Diversity of Uses. Encourage the development of a broad range of commercial uses that reduce the need to travel to
       adjoining communities, while capturing a greater share of local spending.
25.2   Compact Infill Development. Encourage commercial uses along major corridors, in Neighborhood Villages, and as infill
       development adjacent to existing commercial uses and on surface parking lots to improve commercial services,
       maximize revenue generation, and leverage concentrating commercial uses.
25.3   Cohesive Development. Encourage the cohesive development and/or master planning of large commercial sites and
       corridors.
25.4   Architecture and Site Design. Require that new development protect community character by providing architecture,
       landscaping, and urban design of equal or greater quality than existing and by respecting the architectural character and
       scale of adjacent buildings.
25.5   Connectivity to Neighborhoods. Link commercial areas to adjoining residential neighborhoods and other districts by
       well-designed and attractive streetscapes with pedestrian sidewalks and street amenities.
25.6   Multi-Use of Public Alleys. Consider alleys as multi-use public spaces that buffer commercial uses from residential areas
       and serve circulation, parking, utilities, loading areas and trash receptacles. They may also provide access to paseos, rear
       commercial entries, multiple storefronts and public use areas.
25.7   Buffering Adjoining Residential Areas. Ensure commercial uses adjoining residential neighborhoods or mixed residential
       and commercial uses are designed to be compatible with each other.
25.8   Pedestrian, Bicycle and Transit Access. Require commercial projects to be designed to promote convenient pedestrian
       and bicycle access to and from nearby neighborhoods, transit facilities, bikeways, and other amenities.
25.9   Maintenance. Require proper maintenance of commercial areas to ensure they reflect community expectations for a
       quality environment and remain competitive with commercial facilities located outside of the City.
25.10 Retail. Designate land and develop guidelines for the development of pedestrian friendly commercial areas, each with
       their own unique identity.
25.11 Retail Streetscapes. Maintain and, where deficient, increase street trees, plantings, furniture, signage, public art and
       other amenities that encourage pedestrian activity in retail districts and corridors.
25.12 Retail Parking. Develop alternative parking management strategies for businesses in areas with limited parking (such as
       East Washington Boulevard) while protecting nearby residential neighborhoods implementing such techniques as park
       once and shared lots and structures.
                                                                                  SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 25
GOAL 26. Offices. A diversity of professional, creative, medical, research, and other offices offering attractive job opportunities
for residents, and serving as a centerpiece of Pasadena’s economy.
Policies
26.1    Office. Encourage the orderly development and expansion of office uses based upon current conditions and future
        projects to improve the relationship of jobs and housing in certain areas of the City.
26.2    Creative Office. Allow additional flexibility for creative office spaces to locate and grow in non-traditional areas and
        areas with desirable amenities for employees.
GOAL 27. R&D Flex Space. A wide range of moderate to low-intensity industrial uses such as light manufacturing, research and
development, creative office and incubator industries encouraging the development of new industries induced by the presence
of Pasadena’s educational institutions and medical facilities.
Policies
27.1    Diversity of Uses. Provide for a variety of industrial and commercial-industrial uses that offer job opportunities for
        Pasadena’s residents and revenues to the City without compromising environmental quality.
27.2    Business Attraction. Allow sufficient densities that enable development of technology, digital, research and
        development, and creative industries offering new job opportunities for residence.
27.3    Supporting Uses. Maintain a predominant industrial character, while allowing the integration of compatible uses in
        industrial areas that serve the needs of employees and reduce the need to travel off-site during the workday, including
        such uses as financial services, business services, restaurants, and health and recreational facilities.
27.4    Buffering from Adjacent Properties. Ensure that industrial developments incorporate adequate landscape buffers to
        minimize any negative impacts to surrounding neighborhoods and development, and controlling on-site lighting, noise,
        odors, vibrations, toxic materials, truck access, and other elements that may impact adjoining uses.
27.5    Impact Mitigation. Cooperate with those agencies concerned with monitoring and controlling the emissions of smoke,
        particulate matter, noise, and odor associated with industrial uses.
27.6    Adaptive Reuse. Encourage the adaptive reuse of buildings (especially mid-century structures) for research and
        development and flex space by providing additional flexibility in parking standards.
Mixed-Use Corridors and Villages
Mixed-use corridors and villages provide for the intermixing of housing with commercial uses, enabling residents to live close to
where they shop, work, recreate, enjoy entertainment and culture, and participate in civic events. Research indicates that
Pasadena’s Central District enjoys a lower per capita trip generation and increased pedestrian activity due to the mix and
density of these uses, as well as proximity to Metro Gold Line stations. The Land Use Diagram provides opportunities for new
mixed-use development in the Central District, adjoining transit stations in a series of “Transit Villages,” as central gathering
places for surrounding residential neighborhoods in “Neighborhood Villages,” and in designated areas along the City’s arterial
streets. These may occur in the form of buildings with housing above lower level retail or office uses, or horizontally distributed
on a property or larger area. The goals and policies in this section implement these opportunities.
GOAL 28. Places to Live, Work, Shop, and Recreate. A diversity of well-designed corridors and villages containing an integrated
mix of commercial uses and/or housing that enable Pasadena’s residents to live close to businesses, services, and employment,
reduce automobile use, and actively engage and enhance pedestrian activity.
SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 26

Policies
28.1    Land Use Mix. Allow for the development of properties and buildings in areas designated as “Mixed Use” for a mix of
        compatible commercial and residential uses.
28.2    Development Scale. Establish standards to assure that an adequate scale and footprint of any single use is achieved in
        mixed-use areas to establish a cohesive environment that minimizes impacts attributable to the adjacency of different
        uses. This may define minimum parcel and building size, number of housing units, and/or nonresidential square
        footage, as well as relationships and setbacks.
28.3    On-site Amenities. Require that residential/nonresidential mixed-use projects provide on-site amenities that contribute
        to the living environment of residents such as courtyards, outdoor barbecues, and recreation facilities.
28.4    Design Integration. Require residential and nonresidential portions of mixed-use buildings and sites to be integrated
        through architectural design, development of pedestrian walkways and landscaping.
GOAL 29. Transit Villages. Moderate to high density mixed-use clusters of residential and commercial uses developed in an
integrated “village-like” environment with buildings clustered on common plazas and open spaces in proximity to Metro Gold
Line stations capitalizing on their induced market demands and land values, facilitating ridership, and reducing automobile use
while increasing walkability.
Policies
29.1    Mix of Uses. Accommodate mixed-use development permitted by the applicable land use classification on the Land Use
        Diagram, whether it is horizontally or vertically integrated, as an essential component to the creation and
        implementation of the Transit Village vision.
29.2    Neighborhood Identity. Design Transit Villages to be distinct, cohesive, and pedestrian-oriented places that are linked
        with and walkable from adjoining neighborhoods.
29.3    Pedestrian Orientation. Require the inclusion of improvements and amenities to create a safe and comfortable
        environment for sitting, meeting neighbors and friends, walking and providing easy access to Metro Gold Line station
        areas and a mix of uses in close proximity to the station.

        Transit Villages.
GOAL 30. Neighborhood Villages. Lower density mixed-use clusters of residential and commercial uses developed in an
integrated “village-like” environment with buildings clustered on common plazas and open spaces designed as communal
places that are walkable from surrounding neighborhoods.
Policies
30.1    Mix of Uses. Accommodate mixed-use development permitted by the applicable land use classification shown on the
        Land Use Diagram, whether it is horizontally or vertically integrated, as an essential component to the creation and
        implementation of the Neighborhood Village vision.
30.2    Development at Key Nodes. Encourage development at key intersections and on surface parking lots within
        neighborhood villages that result in additional neighborhood-serving amenities and intensified economic vitality.
30.3    Neighborhood Identity. Design neighborhood villages to be distinct, cohesive, and pedestrian-oriented places that are
        linked with and walkable from nearby residential neighborhoods.
                                                                                 SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 27

30.4    Community Activity. Foster neighborhood villages to be the center of community activity by assisting uses and services
        desired by the community to locate in these areas (restaurants; coffee shops; community theaters; yoga, dance, or
        karate studios; etc.)
30.5    Connectivity to Neighborhoods. Link neighborhood villages to adjoining residential neighborhoods through safe,
        convenient, well-designed pedestrian sidewalks and bicycle facilities.

COMMUNITY PLACES
A total of ten community places are highlighted in this section. These include the Central District, East Colorado, East Pasadena,
Fair Oaks & Orange Grove, Lincoln Avenue, North Lake, South Fair Oaks, Washington & Allen, West Gateway and Northwest (as
shown on Figure 2). The goals and policies supplement those described in the preceding section of this element and are unique
to each sub-area addressing specific objectives for use, character, design, and functionality. Note that the boundaries for the
East Colorado and East Pasadena planning areas have been modified, moving the industrial area of Lamanda Park into the East
Colorado area, and the easternmost section of East Colorado Boulevard into the East Pasadena area.
 Figure 2. Map of Community Places
Central District
The Central District is the urban core of Pasadena and is the primary business, financial, retail and government center of the
City (Figure 3). The vision for the Central District is to build upon the existing strengths as a vibrant downtown with a mix of
uses, walkable areas with shopping, entertainment, restaurants, offices and housing connected by multiple modes of transit.
Within the Central District there are a number of distinct neighborhoods (or sub-districts) with unique identities including Old
Pasadena, the Civic Center, Pasadena Playhouse, and South Lake. Old Pasadena is the historic core of the City that has
developed into a vibrant retail and entertainment destination. The Civic Center is the governmental center of the City,
distinguished by the landmark City Hall, Public Library and Civic Auditorium in accordance with the historic, award-winning,
Civic Center Plan, which provides for visual and pedestrian linkages among Pasadena’s key civic buildings. The Playhouse District
                                                                                  SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 29

is an arts- and culture-oriented area, with
theaters, universities, museums, book
stores, restaurants, and mixed commercial
and housing projects. South Lake is the
city’s primary office corridor and is a
popular shopping and dining destination.
Within the Central District there are four
designated historic districts; Old Pasadena,
Pasadena Civic Center, Civic Center
Financial, and Pasadena Playhouse.
Preservation of the historic core is valued
by the City and is closely tied to Pasadena’s
identity. The Central District is served by
three Metro Gold Line stations (Del Mar,
Memorial Park and Lake) creating a myriad
of opportunities for higher-density, transit-
oriented development, served by multi-
modal linkages, and pedestrian and open
space amenities.                                        Figure 3. Central District
GOAL 31. Central District. The primary civic, business, financial, retail, entertainment, and cultural center of Pasadena with
supporting housing enabling residents to live close and walk to these uses and access regional transit.
Policies
31.1    Focus Growth. Focus growth in the Central District into key sub-areas including the Pasadena Playhouse, Civic
        Center/Midtown, Lake, Northwest Gateway, and Walnut Districts, and in proximity to the three Metro Gold Line
        stations, to support economic vitality while preserving and complementing the historic core.
31.2    Sub-District Identity. Enhance the distinctive, yet complementary nature of the Central District’s sub-areas by
        recognizing and building on their unique attributes and features through signage, streetscape designs, design guidelines
        and encouraging new uses and infill development that fits with the vision of each sub-area.
31.3    Del Mar, Memorial Park and Lake Transit Villages. Concentrate higher intensity development with a mix of retail, office,
        and multi-family housing uses that are compatible with one another expanding the customer base for local retail uses
        and supporting Metro Gold Line ridership.
31.4    Contextual Development in Historic Districts. Require new development within and adjacent to the historic districts to
        be compatible with the scale, density, and urban design features of existing historic buildings and districts.
31.5    Transit Options. Increase the network of transit, walking, and bicycling opportunities between sub-areas within the
        Central District through expanded services, additional rights of way/pathways with corresponding signage.
31.6    Connections to Other Community Places. Establish and maintain pedestrian walkways that provide access to the other
        Community Places and encourage people to move freely between each sub-area within the Central District through a
        unifying/connected network of public areas.
31.7    Expanded Economic Opportunities. Strengthen the Central District’s economic vitality by supporting existing businesses
        and providing opportunities for new commercial development in underutilized areas with higher development capacity.
31.8    Street Vitality During Evenings and On Weekends. Sustain a vibrant pedestrian atmosphere in traditionally civic and
        office dominant sub-areas on evenings and weekends by encouraging additional residential and mixed-use
        development.

31.9    Housing Choice. Provide a wide variety of housing options in the Central District in terms of the type, location, size and
        price.
31.10 Building Orientation. Require businesses to be oriented primarily to pedestrian streets and urban spaces and
        secondarily to parking lots and to provide visibility and accessibility to customers arriving on foot, by bicycle, and by
        automobile.
31.11 Public Art Overlay Zone. Create a Public Art Overlay Zone to preserve and enhance existing art in the Civic Center area.
East Colorado
The East Colorado sub-area extends easterly
from the Central District (Catalina Avenue to
Kinneloa Avenue). It is an irregularly shaped
area incorporating properties fronting
Colorado Boulevard and Allen Avenue
between Colorado and the Metro Gold Line
station, and larger districts extending south
to Green Street in the west and northeast
towards the 210 freeway (Lamanda Park,
formerly part of the East Pasadena Specific
Plan area) (Figure 4). The vision for this area
is its transformation from largely auto-
oriented strip uses into a series of
pedestrian-oriented villages and districts
with unique identities, bolstered by their
vibrant mix of uses, amenities and
streetscapes improving their walkability and
appearance.
                                                    Figure 4. East Colorado
The overall objective for the planning area is
to break up long stretches of strip commercial with residential uses and cluster commercial uses in nodes. Potential residential
development may be converted to non-residential floor area, but nonresidential area may not be converted to allow additional
residential units. Neighborhood Villages would be established along Colorado Boulevard in the vicinity of Hill Street and Sierra
Madre Boulevard containing a mix of commercial and residential uses with pedestrian-oriented amenities and plazas. Their mix
of uses and design would serve as a gathering place and be walkable from adjoining neighborhoods. The Village near Pasadena
City College would offer unique opportunities to serve and provide new housing opportunities for students and faculty. The
Allen Transit Village capitalizes on its proximity to the Metro Gold Line station by accommodating medium-density commercial
and residential development, served by multi-modal linkages, and pedestrian and open space amenities. Mechanisms would be
employed to protect the single-family residential area north of the freeway on Allen from the impacts of the light rail station.
The Lamanda Park sub-area offers the opportunity to serve as an incubator for creative technology, and medical start-up
industries, capitalizing on their proximity to Pasadena’s esteemed academic institutions. Directly connected to the Colorado
Boulevard commercial corridor, this district will provide new jobs for Pasadena’s residents and customers to invigorate existing
retail businesses.
GOAL 32. East Colorado. A series of pedestrian-oriented villages and districts with unique identities, bolstered by their vibrant
mix of uses, amenities and streetscapes improving their walkability and appearance.
                                                                                  SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 31

Policies
32.1    Places and Urban Form. Provide for the evolution of strip corridor uses along Colorado Boulevard by clustering
        development into distinct pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use centers serving as places for people to live, shop, dine, and
        congregate with their friends, while maintaining intervening areas for less intensive commercial uses.
32.2    Activity Centers. Cluster the highest intensities of use in the Allen Transit Village (Figure 4), and at Neighborhood
        Villages located adjacent to Pasadena City College and at South Sierra Madre Avenue with a mix of commercial and
        residential development designed and scaled to transition with adjoining neighborhoods.
32.3    Allen Transit Village. Support a mix of retail, office, and multi-family housing uses adjoining the Allen Metro Gold Line
        station providing opportunities for people to live or work close to and use transit, contributing to reductions in vehicle
        trips, energy consumption, and GHG emissions.

        and technology to foster the attraction of emerging and creative new businesses.
32.7    Neighborhood Protection. Protect the single-family residential area north of the 210 Freeway near Allen Avenue from
        impacts of new buildings near the Metro Gold Line station by encouraging compatible uses, scale, heights with
        appropriate transitions and buffering, while maintaining access to the station for residents.
32.8    Infrastructure Improvements. Prioritize infrastructure improvements along the Boulevard to support redevelopment
        and more efficient use of underutilized properties.
East Pasadena
East Pasadena is the second most intensive
center for employment (Figure 5) and a
regional retail area of the City, providing
jobs, goods and services to the City. The
vision for this area is to provide additional
employment opportunities by facilitating
expansion of existing businesses and
development of new businesses, while
adding new housing opportunities to enable
residents to live close to jobs and transit.
Most of the area could be infilled by a mix of
commercial, offices, and housing. Large
parcels would be encouraged to be
redeveloped as a cohesive and walkable
district with development concentrated in
proximity to the Sierra Madre Villa Metro
Gold Line station, and establishment of a
more traditional street grid. The Sierra
                                                        Figure 5. East Pasadena

and housing uses to provide increase opportunities encourage transit use and walking.
Policies
33.1    Places and Urban Form. Concentrate development adjoining the Sierra Madre Villa Metro Gold Line station, reducing
        densities outward as transitions for the protection of adjoining residential neighborhoods.
33.2    Sierra Madre Villa Transit Village. Provide for the clustering of pedestrian-oriented retail, office, and multi-family
        housing uses adjoining the transit station. Provide places where nearby residents can eat, shop, and meet friends.
        Improve access to local and regional transit by providing convenient options to reduce driving, contributing to
        reductions in vehicle trips, energy consumption, and GHG emissions.
33.3    R&D Flex Space Jobs Center. Encourage the development of research and development and office uses to expand job
        opportunities for Pasadena’s residents with appropriate supporting uses in mixed-use and commercial areas, especially
        along Halstead Street.
33.4    Retail Centers. Promote the more efficient use and economic vitality of existing retail centers by the development of
        new uses on surface parking lots, sharing parking facilities, creating public spaces, increasing landscaping and providing
        pedestrian amenities thereby creating an enjoyable environment for people to shop at multiple businesses, meet
        friends, and linger.
33.5    Street Grid and Blocks. Require future developers to modify large commercially-developed parcels with a network of
        internal pedestrian ways and sidewalks along which buildings will be clustered, establishing a smaller, walkable block
        grid comparable to the Central District.
33.6    Major Corridors. Redevelop Foothill Boulevard and East Colorado Boulevard as multi-modal corridors that enhance
        opportunities for walking, bicycling, and transit use.
33.7    Public Streetscapes and Places. Redevelop street frontages with streetscape amenities (such as trees, plantings,
        furniture, and wayfinding signs) that enhance connectivity and walkability. Develop new public places providing
        opportunities for residents to gather, such as parklets and plazas.
33.8    Open Space and Urban Form. Use public open spaces and sidewalks as the organizing elements around which buildings
        are located and clustered.
                                                                                  SECTION 1: LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES |PAGE 33

Fair Oaks and Orange Grove
Fair Oaks Avenue is a major north-south corridor traversing Pasadena,
extending from the Central District to the northern City boundary
(Figure 6). The vision for the plan area is to visually and physically
unify the north and south ends of the plan area, remove planning and
zoning barriers to new businesses, and to protect the residential
neighborhoods. The process of revitalization and development along
this corridor will be anchored by a Neighborhood Village at the
primary intersection of East Orange Grove Boulevard and North Fair
Oaks Avenue. Moving away from the existing undifferentiated strip
character of the area, the Neighborhood Village would contain a mix
of uses, pedestrian amenities and signage with a unified streetscape
that improves the appearance of the corridor. The existing cluster of
commercial uses in the North Fair Oaks and Orange Grove area would
accommodate additional local serving shops with housing and
pedestrian-oriented amenities to serve nearby residential and
institutional uses. Its character would evolve into an active
pedestrian-oriented village environment where people could shop,
dine, live, and meet friends and serve as a destination walkable from
adjoining neighborhoods. The adaptive reuse of existing residential
and commercial buildings would be promoted to emphasize the
historic uniqueness of Fair Oaks/Orange Grove and foster a greater
sense of community.
GOAL 34. Fair Oaks and Orange Grove. Distinct pedestrian-oriented
villages containing a mix of commercial and housing.                           Figure 6. Fair Oaks and Orange Grove

34.1        Economic Vitality. Transform North Fair Oaks Avenue from a low-density strip commercial corridor to a series of
            distinctive low- to medium-density, pedestrian oriented, mixed use villages where residents and visitors can live,
            shop, work and be entertained.
34.2        Pedestrian-Orientation. Promote the inclusion of pedestrian-oriented plazas and amenities establishing a “village-
            like” environment where people shop, dine, meet friends, and actively use public places.
34.3        Development Scale and Transitions. Require that the types of uses, densities, building massing and heights, and
            design development along Fair Oaks Avenue and Orange Grove Boulevard assure compatibility and accessibility with
            adjoining residential neighborhoods.
34.4        Business Expansion and Growth. Preserve existing and create a variety of new job opportunities through catalytic
            projects that create interest, identity and a focal point and neighborhood serving businesses located within larger
            Neighborhood Villages.
34.5        Special Study Area. Conduct a planning process involving local residents for the reuse of the Matthew “Mack”
            Robinson postal facility should the facility be vacated to consider potential uses, amenities, and design standards that
            assure compatibility with adjoining residential neighborhoods.
34.6        Linkages to the Central District. Establish and maintain pedestrian walkways that provide access between the Central
            District and the Fair Oak and Orange Grove area to encourage people to move freely between the two areas.

Lincoln Avenue
Lincoln Avenue is a commercial corridor near the 210 Freeway in Northwest
Pasadena (Figure 7). For decades, it has been the location of small‐scale industrial
businesses, many with outdoor operations. While Pasadena certainly supports a
vibrant local industrial sector, districts in the City other than the Lincoln Avenue
corridor are better suited and have been designated for such purposes. Lincoln
Avenue is a western gateway that serves many distinctive residential
neighborhoods and brings visitors to the Rose Bowl and Brookside Park. The
corridor merits a new life based on the important local and citywide functions it is
well‐positioned to serve. The vision for Lincoln Avenue is to repurpose the Lincoln
Avenue corridor from an industrial and limited commercial area into a vibrant
neighborhood‐oriented district, with new housing options and a complement of
local‐serving retail and service businesses, office spaces, and community uses, all
tied together with public improvements that create a vibrant and enjoyable
pedestrian environment.
GOAL 35. Lincoln Avenue. A vibrant neighborhood‐oriented district, with new

North Lake
North Lake Avenue is a major north-south commercial corridor traversing Pasadena
extending from the Central District to Elizabeth Street (Figure 8). The vision for
North Lake is to transform its automobile-oriented character with pockets of
commercial and residential uses into a well-designed and attractive corridor
supporting multiple travel modes including transit, bicycling, and walking with
clusters of distinctive places for shopping, dining, and living. These will serve and be
accessible to residents of adjoining neighborhoods, with the types of uses limited
and buildings located and designed to transition to and assure compatibility. Areas
around the Lake Metro Gold Line station will accommodate a mix of higher density
office, commercial, and residential uses fostering transit ridership and access to and
from the region. Existing commercial properties at the intersection with
Washington Boulevard would accommodate additional commercial and residential
uses with public open spaces and amenities in a “village-like” environment as a
destination for neighborhood shopping, dining, and gathering for local residents.
GOAL 36. North Lake. A well-designed and attractive corridor supporting multiple
travel modes including transit, bicycling, and walking with clusters of distinctive
places for shopping, dining, and living.
Policies
36.1.       Economic Vitality of the Avenue. Transform North Lake Avenue from a
            low-density strip commercial corridor to series of distinctive low- to
            medium-density, pedestrian oriented, mixed use villages designed and
            scaled to transition with adjoining residential neighborhoods where             Figure 8. North Lake

            uses in proximity to the Metro Gold Line station that expand the customer base for local businesses and support
            Metro Gold Line ridership contributing to the reduction of vehicle trips, energy consumption, and GHG emissions.
36.3        Lake-Washington Neighborhood Village. Promote the development of additional commercial uses with housing and
            pedestrian-oriented plazas and amenities to establish a “village-like” environment where people shop, dine, meet
            friends, linger, and actively use public places.
36.4        Neighborhood Compatibility. Require that the types of use and location, scale, and design of development buffer
            commercial and mixed-use development on Lake Avenue from adjoining lower density residential neighborhoods.
36.5        Transitional Heights and Setbacks. Protect adjacent Low Density Residential and Low-Medium Density Residential
            areas north of Orange Grove Boulevard, which contain a number of locally and nationally recognized historic
            properties and districts, from the development of mixed use or residential projects by requiring appropriate
            transitional heights. Mixed use or residential projects proposed in these locations shall be limited to no more than
            three stories in height for those portions of the project abutting commercial streets, stepping down to no more than
            two stories in height abutting the Low and Low-Medium residential areas. Appropriate setbacks shall also be
            established in order to provide further protection.

South Fair Oaks
South Fair Oaks is the entrance to the City from the south at the termination of the Historic Arroyo Parkway, 110 Freeway
extending north to the Central District (Figure 9). It is home to Huntington Memorial Hospital, Art Center College of Design
(south campus), and the Fillmore Metro Gold Line station and is one of the major employment opportunity areas in the City.
The vision for South Fair Oaks capitalizes on the presence of these uses, focusing development adjoining the Fillmore Metro
Gold Line station; introducing housing for seniors, students, or employees of the major institutions; and converting
underutilized industrial areas for new businesses and job-generating uses
leveraged by the medical and creative office uses. Areas adjoining the
transit station will accommodate higher-density mixed-use developments
incorporating retail, office and housing uses to encourage transit use and
walkability. Properties north of California Avenue would be redeveloped to
accommodate new industrial, research and development, and incubator
uses as a secondary jobs center offering flex spaces for emerging,
innovative, and creative industries. New development should be located
and designed to address the presence of non-conforming uses, which may
discontinue over time requiring appropriate site remediation and clean up.
Amenities would be added to improve safety and the quality of life as a
desirable neighborhood. Throughout the area, streets will be extensively
landscaped to improve pedestrian activity and connectivity and new urban
parks developed to provide recreational opportunities for local businesses.
GOAL 37. South Fair Oaks Avenue. Concentration of mixed-use

            residential neighborhoods.
Washington and Allen
The Washington and Allen area is located near the northeast
border of the City, where East Washington Boulevard intersects
with North Allen Avenue (Figure 10). The vision for this area is
to revitalize its limited commercial automobile-oriented uses
into a distinctive pedestrian “village-like” environment that
fosters neighborhood identity and activity, is a place for
gathering with walkable streets connected to adjacent single-
family neighborhoods, and improves the area’s appearance.
Existing local-serving retail and service businesses, office, and
community uses will be supplemented with new business to
enhance the area’s economic vitality; all tied together with
public streetscape improvements. A parking management plan
will assure that adaptively re-used older buildings would not
                                                                       Figure 10. Washington and Allen

activity, is a place for gathering with walkable streets connected to adjacent single-family neighborhoods, and improves the
area’s appearance.
Policies
38.1        Pedestrian-Serving Uses. Provide for the development of a diverse mix of pedestrian-serving commercial uses that
            encourage walking from adjacent neighborhoods for goods and services.
38.2        Public Spaces and Places. Develop additional public spaces and unique places through parklets, green alleys, and
            plazas with outdoor dining along the East Washington Boulevard corridor.
38.3        Accessibility. Design East Washington Boulevard and North Allen Avenue to accommodate bicycle and pedestrian
            amenities, including wider sidewalks with sidewalk dining, public plazas, parklets, bike lanes, and ample bicycle
            parking.
38.4        Parking. Develop a parking management and improvement plan and amend the Zoning Code to assure that
            adaptively re-used older buildings do not adversely impact parking in adjoining neighborhoods.
 West Gateway
The West Gateway is the western entrance to the City from the
intersection of the 134 and 710 Freeways (Figure 11), and is
home to important institutions, such as the Norton Simon
Museum and the Ambassador Auditorium. The vision for the
West Gateway is to support these and other institutional uses
through improved streetscapes with lush landscaping that
provide pedestrian linkages to the Central District.

          Orange Grove Boulevard.
39.2      Linkages to Old Pasadena. Establish and maintain pedestrian walkways that provide access to Old Pasadena that
          encourage people to move freely between the two areas.
Northwest
The Northwest is the gateway to the City from the north,
located east of the Rose Bowl Drive and extending to Lake
Avenue, from the City’s northern boundary to the 210
freeway (Figure 12) and includes Robinson Park, Jackie
Robinson Community Center, and historic neighborhoods. It
overlaps and encompasses the North Lincoln and North Lake
areas previously discussed. The vision for this area is
primarily for low– and low-medium residential land uses,
including small lot single family developments, and duplexes
supported by adequate parks and institutional uses. The
following policies are specific to this sub-area (excluding and
complementing the North Fair Oaks-Orange Grove, Lincoln
Avenue, and North Lake areas).
GOAL 40. Northwest. Economically vigorous and well-
maintained development.

City of Pasadena General Plan
SECTION 2: LAND USE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
Introduction
If the City’s General Plan is to serve its purpose effectively, it must be reviewed, maintained, and implemented in a systematic
and consistent manner. The Implementation Plan outlines the process for reviewing and updating the 2014 General Plan Land
Use Element and for monitoring its implementation. The Implementation program provides an overview of the type of actions
or tools the City will use to implement the General Plan Land Use Element policies. At a minimum, a comprehensive update of
the General Plan should occur every 10 years to reflect prevailing and long term fiscal resources, community needs, and
priorities. Revisions to this Implementation Plan shall not constitute an amendment to the General Plan provided that they are
consistent with and carryout out its goals and policies and therefore, would not necessitate environmental review to conform
to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements.
In terms of timing, the implementation program classifies these actions or tools into three categories: 1) based on the horizon
for their completion (near term or mid-long term) 2) those that are implemented continuously and 3) those that require
periodic update. High priority programs that are most effective in achieving Pasadena’s vision are anticipated to be completed
within three years of adoption (near term). Other timeframes include mid- term to long-term programs that are anticipated to
be implemented three to ten years from adoption, continuous updates and periodic updates (annually unless otherwise noted).
As the City implements programs on this priority list, the list will be adjusted to address new challenges facing Pasadena. The
timeline for the initiation or completion of a program is only an estimate and is ultimately dependent on the availability of
funding resources.

City of Pasadena General Plan
SECTION 3: LAND USE ELEMENT GLOSSARY
Accessibility: The degree to which a site, location, or activity is connected to another site and the ability to move between the
sites. [Policy 4.10]
Adaptive Reuse: Changing obsolete or historic buildings from their original or most recent use to a new use. For example,
changing a former hospital or school building to housing, or changing an historic single-family house to an office. [Policy 10.6]
Affordable Housing: Affordable Housing shall be defined by the Zoning Code’s definition of affordable housing. [Land Use
Classifications, Housing]
Alternative Energy: Any energy source that is an alternative to fossil fuels (fossil fuels include coal, petroleum, and natural gas).
[Policy 10.2]
Alternative Transportation Modes: Commuting in any way other than driving alone. Examples include biking, walking,
carpooling, and taking transit. [Goal 19]
Brick and Mortar Facilities: Businesses that have a physical presence and offer face-to-face customer experiences. [Policy 2.10]
Capital Facilities: The basic services that the public sector provides to support the community as it currently exists, such as
roadways, parking facilities, utilities, landscaping, bridges, athletic and recreational facilities, etc. [Policy 1.7]
City of Gardens: The City of Gardens Standards are an innovative set of zoning regulations aimed at creating more livable multi-
family housing projects, encouraging designs that typify the garden character of earlier apartments and bungalow courts in
Pasadena. These standards are also an integral way of encouraging the production of multi-family apartments and
condominium projects of lasting quality. [Land Use Classifications, Housing]
Community Garden: A kind of urban open space that can contain passive features such as paths, benches and landscaping or
could include plots for residents to grow fruits and vegetables. A pocket park (also known as a vest pocket or mini-park) is
typically much the same as a community garden, except the emphasis would tend to be less on horticulture and more on site
amenities such as picnic facilities and small playgrounds. [Policy 2.10]
Community Places: A group of defined geographic areas where the City has specific development goals and policies.
Density: The number of dwelling units on a lot divided by the size of the lot (i.e., units per acre). [Development
Density/Intensity Standards]
Development Capacity: The maximum number of new housing units or new non-residential square footage that is permitted
within a planning area. The 1994 General Plan set a cap on development in the City’s planning areas. [Policy 31.7]
Design Review: The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its impact on neighboring properties and the community
as a whole, from the standpoint of site and landscape design, architecture, materials, colors, lighting, and signs, in accordance
with a set of adopted criteria and standards. Design Review usually refers to a system set up outside of the zoning ordinance,
whereby projects are reviewed against certain standards and criteria by a specially established design review board or
committee. [Policy 7.4]
Entitlement: In land development, approvals for the right to develop property for a desired purpose or use. [Goal 20]
Flex Space: A multi-tenant space allowing both commercial (i.e., office, showroom, warehouse space) and industrial uses to
coexist in the same building or on the same property. [Land Use Classifications, Commercial]
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the site, expressed in decimals
to one or two places. For example, on a site with 10,000 net sq. ft. of land area, a Floor Area Ratio of 1.0 will allow a maximum
of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building floor area to be built. On the same site, an FAR of 1.5 would allow 15,000 sq. ft. of floor area;
an FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 sq. ft.; and an FAR of 0.5 would allow only 5,000 sq. ft. [Development Density/Intensity
Standards]
SECTION 3: LAND USE ELEMENT GLOSSARY |PAGE 66

General Plan: A legal document with a City’s policies to guide its long-term development in the form of maps accompanied by
text. State law requires a General Plan to contain certain chapters, or elements, including land use and circulation (or mobility).

24.1]
Human Services: Services with the objective of meeting human needs through an interdisciplinary knowledge base, focusing on
prevention as well as remediation of problems, and maintaining a commitment to improving the overall quality of life of service
populations. [Policy 16.3]
Infill Development: Development of vacant or underutilized land (usually individual lots or left-over properties) within areas
that are already largely developed. [Policy 25.2]
Intensity, Building: For residential uses, the actual number or the allowable range of dwelling units per net acre. For non-
residential uses, the actual or the maximum permitted floor area ratios (FARs). [Development Density/Intensity Standards]
Land Use Classification: A system for classifying and designating the appropriate use of properties, as shown on the Land Use
Diagram.
Mansionization: New construction or additions on residentially zoned lots that are out-of-scale with the surrounding
neighborhood, but which comply with the current City zoning regulations. [Policy 22.1]
Massing: In architecture, massing refers to the general shape and size of a building. [Policy 4.11]
Mixed-Use: When non-residential uses (such as offices, shops, or restaurants) are combined with housing in a building or on
the same property. [Land Use Classifications]
Multi-modal: Involves using two or more modes of transportation, such as driving, taking public transit, walking, and biking, in a
journey. [Goal 18]
Multi-family Residential: Two or more dwelling units on a lot.
Neighborhood Park: Generally, neighborhood parks provide informal, general-use areas developed with children’s play areas,
multi-purpose open turf areas, and other amenities used for smaller social gatherings. Some larger neighborhood parks may
include active recreation elements such as ball fields. Neighborhood parks play an important role in providing neighborhood
focus and identity. [Policy 21.10]
Neighborhood Villages: Lower density mixed-use clusters of residential and commercial uses developed in an integrated
“village-like” environment with buildings clustered on common plazas and open spaces designed as communal places that are
walkable from surrounding neighborhoods. [Goal 30]
Non-conforming Use: A use of a structure (either conforming or nonconforming) or land that was legally established and
maintained before the adoption of the Zoning Code and which does not conform to current Code provisions governing
allowable land uses for the zoning district in which the use is located. This includes uses that do not conform to the land use
regulations for the district in which they are located and were established prior to July 1, 1985, under a use of property
variance. [Policy 3.6]
Open Space: A Land Use Element category that includes natural open spaces as well as active and passive recreational facilities.
The designation applies to lands owned by the City.
Parklets: A parklet is a small space serving as an extension of the sidewalk to provide amenities and green space for people
using the street. It is typically the size of several parking spaces and extends out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk
to the width of the adjacent parking space. [Policy 10.12]
                                                                                          SECTION 3: LAND USE ELEMENT GLOSSARY |PAGE 67

Paseos: Public places or paths designed for walking, like promenades. [Policy 10.12]
Pedestrian-Oriented Development: A development that includes a mixture of land uses, shorter distances between likely
origins and destinations, and design improvements to the pedestrian environment. [Policy 5.2]
Per capita: A citywide value or number – such as water use – divided by the number of people who live and work in the city.
Personal Services: A business providing non-medical services to individuals as a primary use. Examples include barber shops,
beauty salons, shoe repair shops, tailors, etc. [Land Use Classifications, Commercial]
Placemaking: A multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a
local community’s assets, inspiration, and potential, ultimately creating good public spaces that promote people’s health,
happiness, and well-being. [Goal 4]
Planned Development: A comprehensively planned project on a site of at least two acres in size where an applicant proposes
and the City desires to achieve a particular mix of uses, appearance, land use compatibility, or special sensitivity to
neighborhood character. An increase in the allowable Floor Area Ratio for such projects, not to exceed a total of 3.0, can be
allowed through a discretionary process for projects of high-quality, architectural design that is in context with the existing
surrounding development. [Policy 4.13]
Public Art: Art in any media that has been planned and executed with the intention of being staged in the physical public
domain, usually outside and accessible to all. [Policy 6.5]
Research and Development (R&D): An industrial use that involves the study, testing, design, analysis or experimental
development of products, processes or services. [Land Use Classifications, Commercial]
Setback: The distance by which a structure, parking area or other development feature must be separated from a lot line
easement, other structure or development feature. [Land Use Classifications, Housing]
Single-family Residential: A building containing one dwelling unit located on a single lot, but may include a second residential
unit in compliance with Section 17 of the Zoning Code.
Specific Plan: A planning document governing a particular area within the City that serves as a tool to implement the policies
stated in the General Plan, and which contains specific criteria and standards applying to the plan area.
Streetscape: Roadway characteristics that include its physical design (width, grade or slope), amenities (street furniture, bus
stop shelters), landscaping, lighting, etc., that affect street users and nearby residents. [Goal 4]
Sustainability: Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs. Further defined as balancing the three E’s: environment, economy and equity. For example, a decision or action aimed
at promoting economic development should be balanced with issues involving environmental quality and social inequity. [Goal
10]
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): A development located within walking distance of a light rail station or other transit
node and that encourages non-auto travel. [Goal 18]
Transit: A system of regularly-scheduled buses and/or trains available to the public on a fee-per ride basis. Also called mass
transit.
Transit Villages: Moderate to high density mixed-use clusters of residential and commercial uses developed in an integrated
“village-like” environment with buildings clustered on common plazas and open spaces in proximity to Metro Gold Line stations
capitalizing on their induced market demands and land values, facilitating ridership, and reducing automobile use while
increasing walkabilty. [Goal 29]
Trip Generation: The dynamics that account for people making trips in automobiles or by means of public transportation. Trip
generation is the basis for estimating the level of use for a transportation system and the impact of additional development or
transportation facilities on an existing, local transportation system. Trip generations of households are correlated with
destinations that attract household members for specific purposes. [Land Use Categories, Mixed-Use Corridors and Villages]
SECTION 3: LAND USE ELEMENT GLOSSARY |PAGE 68

Urban Design: The attempt to give form, in terms of both beauty and function, to selected urban areas or to whole cities.
Urban design is concerned with the location, mass, and design of various urban components and combines elements of urban
planning, architecture, and landscape architecture. [Goal 9]
Urban Form: The general pattern of building height and development intensity and the structural elements that define the City
physically, such as natural features, transportation, open space, public facilities, as well as activity centers and focal elements.
[Goal 4]
Urban Forest: The total collection of trees and associated plants growing in a city or town. It includes trees in parks and yards,
along roadways and paths, and in other areas. [Policy 10.13]
Urban Housing: In Pasadena, refers to a high-density multi-family project in the Central District, in a commercial zoning district,
or a part of a transit-oriented development around a light rail station. [Land Use Classifications, Housing]
Urban Open Space: Pasadena has a large variety of public outdoor open spaces that cannot be classified as parks but these
spaces do fulfill many of the same functions as public parks. These urban open spaces and special facilities can be either city-
owned or privately-owned. Public plazas, paseos, golf courses and the grounds of museums and historic sites are all examples
of this type of open space. Another good example of this form of land use is a community garden. These are public spaces that
can contain passive features such as paths, benches and landscaping or could include plots for residents to grow fruits and
vegetables. A pocket park (also known as a vest pocket or mini-park) is typically much the same as a community garden, except
the emphasis would tend to be less on horticulture and more on site amenities such as picnic facilities and small playgrounds.
[Policy 10.12]
Vehicle Trips: A trip by a single privately operated vehicle regardless of the number of persons in the vehicle. [Land Use
Classifications, Mixed-Use]
View Shed: The area within view from a defined observation point. [Policy 6.4]
Walkability: A measure of how friendly the built environment is to walking.
Watershed: The land area that drains into a stream; the watershed for a major river may encompass a number of smaller
watersheds that ultimately combine at a common point. [Policy 2.14]
Work/Live: Buildings or spaces that are used for both housing and commercial purposes (such as an artist’s studio, or a home-
based business) for the same occupant. [Land Use Classifications, Mixed-Use]
Zoning: The division of a city or county by legislative regulations into areas, or zones, which specify allowable uses for real
property and size restrictions for buildings within these areas; a program that implements policies of the General Plan.
                                                                                           SECTION 3: LAND USE ELEMENT GLOSSARY |PAGE 69

City of Pasadena General Plan
SECTION 4: LAND USE ELEMENT DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY APPENDIX
The 1994 General Plan Land Use Element established a system of development caps for each of the proposed specific plans.
The General Plan Update of 2014 carries forward a system of development caps. The following is a description of the
mechanics and practices of the City will use in governing the development caps.
Upon adoption of the General Plan update and the final certification of the General Plan Environmental Impact Report, the
system of caps from the 1994 General Plan Land Use Element (including the 2004 update) will be retired. The new
development caps established by the 2014 General Plan Update will be in place. The caps included in the 1994 Land Use
Element will be zeroed out and the new caps will take effect; the 2014 caps are not in addition to the 1994 caps.
Development Caps: As described in Policy 1.3, the General Plan designates the intensity of development and the mix of
allowed uses within each specific plan area. A shift of development cap from one specific plan to a different specific plan is not
permitted.
Net -New: The development caps provide for a certain quantity of net-new development. If an existing building is demolished
and a new building is constructed on the same site, the square footage of the existing building is subtracted from the square
footage of the new building in determining the total “new” square footage on the site regardless of use.
Regardless of Use: Unless modified by a specific plan, the non-residential development caps are provided irrespective of the
type of commercial use. The caps in the Land Use Element are not sub-divided between different types of non-residential or
residential development. If a retail building is demolished and replaced with an office building of the same square footage,
there is withdrawal from the development caps.
Reuse: The reuse of an existing building without the addition of square footage does not result in “new” square footage on the
site.
Parking Structures: Parking structures are exempt from the development caps, unless the specific plan establishes otherwise.
Gross Floor Area: The square footage of a structure shall be calculated using the Zoning Code’s definition of gross floor area.
Housing Unit: A housing unit shall be defined by the Zoning Code’s definition of a dwelling unit.
Affordable Housing: Affordable housing units are not toward the development caps, unless the specific plan determines
otherwise. Because of this net-new residential development may exceed the development caps in a specific plan area.
Allocation of Capacity: The practice of the City is to allocated development capacity at the time of building permit issuance.
Educational Institutions: The development caps do not apply to educational institutions as their impact on the community is
more closely tied to enrollment than building square footage.
As a charter city, Pasadena is not currently required to meet the State law requirement for consistency between the general
plan and the zoning ordinance. However, it is the policy of the City to maintain such land use consistency.
