        The intent of the Circulation Element of the General Plan is to provide for the efficient
transportation of people and goods throughout the Red Bluff Sphere of Influence. To that aim,
the Circulation Element contains goals, objective, policies, and programs designed to maintain
and improve circulation. In addition, it contains an assessment of the current circulation
conditions in the area and provides recommendations for improvements to the transportation
systems anticipated as being required based on the Land Use map included in the General
Plan.
        It is also the intent of this element to be integrated with the overall General Plan, as
other elements must be considered as having strong interrelationships with circulation.
Vehicular, rail and air traffic are significant generators of noise in the Red Bluff area. For this
reason, noise considerations are part of this Circulation Element.
        Land use and circulation are interlinked by the primary need for circulation results from
disparate locations of needed land uses. To illustrate, if one lived adjacent to close place of
work and in close proximity to shopping, then one’s demand for circulation is significantly
reduced. Mixed and integrated land uses are considered mitigations for circulation impacts.
For this reason, housing is included in the Circulation Elements.
        Housing is also interrelated with circulation. The location, density, and build-out volumes
are prime factors in determining circulation system needs. Accurate determination of housing
needs, coupled with the intelligent location of such, can minimize demands on a circulation
system. For this reason, housing is included in the Circulation Element.
        Safety is another element vitally linked to circulation. Safety services, such as police,
fire, and ambulance, require a circulation system adequate to
                                                  August 13, 1991                        Page 1 of 50

gain access to victims or put out fires, wherever they may be. Likewise, hazardous substances
are transported on circulation systems and must be considered. For these reasons, safety is
addressed in the Circulation Element.
                                              August 13, 1991                     Page 2 of 50
                                    EXISTING CONDITIONS
       The City of Red Bluff is served by an extensive network of various types of roadways, as
defined by the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual. These include:
FREEWAY:             Characterized by high speed and limited and controlled access, freeways
                     primarily serve regional and long distance travel.
RURAL HIGHWAY:       Rural highways are generally higher speed, medium capacity two-lane
                     roadways with one lane for travel in each direction. Passing of slower
                     vehicles requires the use of the opposing lane where traffic gaps allow.
                     Undivided multi-line highways without full control of access as found in
                     freeways may also be classified as rural highways.
ARTERIAL:            Major: These streets are generally higher speed, higher capacity
                     transportation corridors that link the community with highways and
                     freeways.
                     Minor: Medium speed and medium capacity, these roads are principally
                     for travel between larger land uses within the community.
COLLECTOR:           Relatively low speed and low capacity; collector streets are generally two
                     lanes connecting neighborhoods with other neighborhoods as well as with
                     the arterial system.
                                              August 13, 1991                       Page 3 of 50
LOCAL STREET:        Local streets are low speed; low capacity streets that provide direct
                     access to adjacent land uses and are typically meant only for local, as
                     opposed to through, traffic.

      CITY OF RED BLUFF
GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT N. 18
  1991 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
             August 13, 1991 Page 6 of 50
        The circulation system of Red Bluff encompasses a great many transportation methods
and facilities. The facilities hierarchy includes: Interstate 5, state highways, local roadways,
intersections and parking; while other circulation methods include: rail, truck, public, bicycle and
air transportation.
INTERSTATE 5
        It connects Red Bluff north to the regional center of Redding and south to the major
metropolitan area of Sacramento. There are four points of access to the interstate from Red
Bluff (see figure 2):
             The South Red Bluff Interchange and Diamond Avenue separation is located south
              of the city center east of the airport, is configured in two parts due to a Southern
              Pacific Railroad underpass along the freeway. This interchange allows northbound
              traffic to exit Interstate 5 onto Old Highway 99 and southbound traffic to exit
              Interstate 5 either onto Diamond Avenue or onto Old Highway 99. Entering the
              freeway, it is possible to travel north or southbound from Old Highway 99 but only
              northbound from Diamond Avenue. This interchange is significant for traffic
              destined for the industrial and commercial areas in the southern portion of the City.
             The East Red Bluff Interchange is located just east of the downtown area, is the
              main interchange in Red Bluff. It is a full cloverleaf configuration, allowing traffic to
              enter and exit the freeway in any combination of origin and destination. This
              interchange is heavily used by traffic originating or destined for the downtown as
              well as most residential area. It further provides interconnection between State
              Route 36, State Route 99, and Interstate 5 for interregional transit.
                                                   August 13, 1991                        Page 7 of 50

         FIGURE 2
INTERSTATE 5 INTERCHANGES
         August 13, 1991  Page 8 of 50
            The North Red Bluff Interchange is located to the north of the city center at the
             north end of Main Street. This interchange provides only southbound exit off the
             freeway and only northbound entrance onto the freeway, each from Main Street.
             The interchange is significant for commercial and industrial traffic destined for sites
             in the northern sectors, as well as connecting Highway 36W to Interstate 5.
            The Wilcox Golf Road Interchange is located at the northern edge of the Red Bluff
             City Limits several miles north of the city center at the intersection of Wilcox Road
             and Wilcox Golf Road. This interchange features full access to the freeway in both
             north and southbound directions. The interchange provides access to residential,
             commercial, and recreational site in the far northern portions of Red Bluff.
            Interstate 5 bisects Red Bluff to the east of the downtown area. The main east
             west access over the freeway and river is via the four-lane over-crossing and
             interchange at Antelope Boulevard (State Highway 36). In addition, the Adobe
             Road separation provides an overpass without entrance or exit onto the freeway.
SACRAMENTO RIVER
        The Sacramento River also bisects the city, running in a roughly southwest direction
north of the city and subsequently curving to the southeast direction. The river is located to the
east of the downtown area. While the river is navigable, no commercial shipping exists in the
area although there is extensive recreational use emanating from boat ramps at River Park and
at the south end of Sale Lane.
                                                August 13, 1991                         Page 9 of 50

STATE HIGHWAYS
         State Highway 36 is the major thoroughfare serving the mountain communities of
Susanville, Chester, and Mount Lassen to the east; and providing a route over the mountains to
State Highway 101 to the west. Highway 36 enters the Red Bluff Sphere of Influence from the
eastern edge of the Red Bluff City Limits. It runs west on the entirety of Antelope Boulevard and
then turns north onto Main Street. At the northern edge of the city limits, the highway turns west
on Beegum Road and exits the area. Along Antelope Boulevard and Main Street in the
downtown area, State Highway 36 comprises the most heavily congested route in the city, as a
result of regional through travel as well as local downtown traffic.
         Sate Highway 99 links Red Bluff with the regional center of Chico to the south. Highway
99 enters the Red Bluff area from the southeast, connecting the Highway 36 at the eastern edge
of the Red Bluff City Limits. Highway 99 runs west along Antelope Boulevard, and terminates at
its intersection with Interstate 5.
LOCAL ROADWAYS AND INTERSECTIONS
         Significant local roadways in the Red Bluff area include South Jackson Street, Luther
Street, South Main Street, Monroe Street, and Walnut Street. These roadways provide the
major intercity routes from access to work, shopping, and home trips.
         Major intersections in the Red Bluff area are generally controlled by traffic signals; these
also represent the most crowded area. The most
                                                August 13, 1991                         Page 10 of 50
significant intersections in the area include Antelope Boulevard at Belle Mill Road, and Walnut
Street at Main Street. Other intersections, such as South Jackson Street at Luther Road, are
also utilized in peak hours.
PARKING
        Parking facilities are available in all areas of Red Bluff. Red Bluff has adopted City
Ordinance 828, governing parking requirements for various parking uses. This ordinance
provides specific parking requirement formulas for specific residential, commercial, and
industrial uses. For example, the ordinance requires two off-street parking places per unit for
residences. Most commercial uses require off-street parking at a ratio of 1 space per 350
square feet. Residential areas have uncontrolled, on-street parking.1
        Parking demand is most intense in the downtown area. Metered on-street parking is
available along Main Street, Walnut Street, Pine Street, Oak Street, Washington Street, and
Jefferson Street. The City also maintains metered parking lots at the northeast corner of
Washington Street at Pine Street, and at the southeast corner of Rio and Hickory Streets.
Timed, unmetered on-street parking predominates the remainder of available parking in the
downtown area.2 Current figures show an inventory of 2385 parking spaces in the downtown
area. 1396 of these spaces are on-street, with 177 in city lots, and remainder in private lots.
The overall occupancy rate for parking in the downtown area, as well as for on-street parking, is
approximately 48%, while the occupancy rate for city parking lots is only 20%.3
                                                  August 13, 1991                     Page 11 of 50
RAIL TRANSPORTATION
         The Southern Pacific Railroad tracks split the city, running along State Highway 36 north
of the city, along Madison Street in the area west of the downtown area, intersecting with South
Main Street in an overpass just north of Luther Road, and exiting the area to the south along
Old Highway 99. Rail traffic is chiefly long distance freight; an average of twelve such trains
traverse the city daily, generally between hours through the city, Southern pacific Railroad
officials estimate that the average traffic delay causes by freight train to be two minutes. Two
Amtrak passenger trains run through the city daily, one in each direction, between 2:00 a.m. and
4:00 a.m. There is no passenger stop at Red Bluff. The nearest boarding facilities are at
Redding and Chico.4 There are currently no provisions regarding rail transported toxic or
hazardous waste through the Red Bluff area.5
TRUCK TRANSPORTATION
         Red Bluff streets host a relatively high number of heavy trucks, especially in the
downtown area, due to regional through traffic on State Highways 36 and 99 and local
destinations. No formal truck route exists at present, although there is an informal route
designation from Interstate 5 at the Antelope Boulevard, south of Main Street past Luther Road
down to the South Red Bluff Interchange at Interstate 5, and west along Luther Road to the
airport industrial area. There are currently no provisions regarding truck transported toxic or
hazardous waste through the Red Bluff area.6
                                                 August 13, 1991                       Page 12 of 50

             August 13, 1991        Page 13 of 50
WATER TRANSPORTATION
         While the Sacramento River is technically navigable, no commercial shipping or ferries
are currently operating in the area. There is, however, extensive recreational use emanating
from boat ramps at River Park and at the south end of Sale Lane. There are various creeks and
sloughs that flow into the Sacramento River, Reeds Creek being the largest of these, but none
of which are navigable.7
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
         Regional public transportation is available in Red Bluff. Intercity bus transportation is
provided by Greyhound Bus Lines, which dispatches an average of seven express and local
buses in both the northbound and southbound direction daily.8 Cascade Trailways, which
operates through the Greyhound Bus facilities, also has one bus daily in each direction,
northbound and southbound. Mount Lassen Motor Transit connects Red Bluff with the
mountain communities of Mineral, Chester, and Susanville on one daily run six days per week.9
There is currently no commercial passenger service from Red Bluff Airport; the nearest
commercial flights are available at Chico or Redding Airports.10 11 While two Amtrak passenger
trains run daily through Red Bluff, citizens must embark at Amtrak’s nearest boarding stops at
Chico and Redding.12
         Intracity transportation is available for all populations. The Red Bluff Taxi Service is a
24-hour service with two vehicles; ridership averages 80 riders per day with a maximum
demand of 120 persons. 13 Special populations within Red Bluff City Limits have been served
by the VanTrans system since 1982. Operated by a private, non-profit agency, it provides local
dial-a-ride van services to the elderly and disabled members of the community though a
                                                  August 13, 1991                       Page 14 of 50

contact with Mount Lassen Motor Transit. The VanTrans system is financed through state and
local funding, and patrons pay $1.50 per ride. The system operated Monday through Friday
from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In response to concerns regarding limited service hours, VanTrans
has supplemented their services by contracting with the local taxi service to provide subsidized
taxi rides to the elderly and disabled during the hours VanTrans does not run, specifically 6:00
a.m. to 8:00 a.m., 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., and on weekends. Patrons pay $2.00 per ride for the
taxi, and VanTrans picks up the other #3.00 of the $5.00 negotiated flat rate fee.14
         The Volunteer emergency Transportation Service (VETS) serves the needs of the
elderly and disabled in Red Bluff and in rural areas of Tehama County. Eligible persons
needing transportation to medical or other appointments call ahead to the VanTrans Office; their
needs are coordinated with the schedules of volunteers who provide transportation by private
automobile. The volunteers are reimbursed $.25 per mile for the use of their car through
separate state and local funding.15
BICYCLE TRANSPORTATION
         Bicycling is the common means of transportation for many who cannot afford an
automobile or a recreational alternative for those who enjoy the health and environmental
benefits of bicycling. A large percentage of those who depend on bicycles are children riding to
and from school.
         Bicycle route designations, denoting type and quality, are enumerated in Table 2.
                                               August 13, 1991                       Page 15 of 50
                                                TABLE 2
                                BICYCLE PATHWAY DESIGNATIONS
CLASS I bicycle pathways are fully separated from any traffic lames, either in a setback
landscaped corridor adjacent to the road, or in a totally separated corridor apart from the street.
CLASS II bicycle pathways are within the right-of-way of streets, usually collectors and arterials.
The lanes are up to seven feet wide, located adjacent to the travel lanes with signage and a
stripe on the pavement demarking the lane.
CLASS III bicycle pathways are shared usage of streets with no specific separation of different
modes of traffic. Street signage is often used to designate a roadway as a bicycle route.

                                              August 13, 1991                         Page 16 of 50
        A bicycle route was designated through the Red Bluff Sphere of Influence in the 1974
Red Bluff Park System General Plan, utilizing both Class I and Class III bicycle path; there are
not Class II bicycle paths in the area. None of the Class I bicycle routes are developed as yet
and much of the routes within the designation are in rough terrain, such as creekbeds and
obscure trails. This bicycle route is roughly circular, extending along the area creeks and rivers,
and connecting several major destinations such as schools, parks, and the downtown area 16
(see Figure 4).
        The 1990 Regional Transportation Plan for Tehama County shows a more current
bikeways system comprised solely of unsigned Class III bicycle routes (figure 5). Although
overlapping the 1974 plan routes slightly, the 1990 version includes many more area of the city.
In addition, portions of local streets Douglass Street, Cedar Street, Franklin Street, First Street,
Washington Street, Orange Street, Sacramento Avenue, Madison Street, Sycamore Street,
Riverside Way, Ash Street, Kaer Avenue, Paynes Creek Road, Mulberry Avenue, and
Berrendos Avenue are included.17
        While the large bicycle route system in the Red Bluff area extends to most shopping,
work, and school applications, significant care is required to use the Class III bicycle lanes in
many area of the city. There are no bicycle route signs erected to alert drivers to the presence
of bicyclists. Moreover, bicycle route users must struggle with a number of obstacles and
hazards, such as parked cars, heavy trucks, and narrow lanes of congested traffic, especially on
major arterial streets such as Main Street and Antelope Boulevard.

AIR TRANSPORTATION
        Red Bluff Municipal Airport is located southwest of the city center south of Luther Road
between South Jackson Street and Paskenta Road. As an FAA Flight Service Station 18 with a
6,000-foot runway, the airport is capable of handling all small aircraft up to and including jets.
There is no scheduled commercial air service at the airport. It is the intent for the airport to
accommodate local and private business traffic and there are no plans to further expansion to
attract commercial airline traffic.19
                                               August 13, 1991                        Page 20 of 50
                                     LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS)
         The level of Service, or LOS, indicated the relative congestion and quality of operating
conditions of an intersection based on the ratio of traffic volume to capacity. LOS ratings range
from best to worst: specifically, from LOS A, which is a volume to capacity ratio of less than
60%, to the LOS F, which indicates a volume to capacity ratio of 100% or more. Table 3 gives a
full explanation of each LOS and volume to capacity ratio.
                                               August 13, 1991                        Page 21 of 50
                                               TABLE 3
                                 LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS
Level of Service “A” represents free flow. Individual users are virtually unaffected by the
presence of others in the traffic stream. Freedom to select desired speeds and to maneuver
within the traffic stream is extremely high. Intersection delays are very short, less than 5
seconds. The general level of comfort and convenience provided to the motorist, passenger, or
pedestrian is excellent.
Level of Service “B” is in the range of stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic
stream begins to be noticeable. Freedom to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected, but
there is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from LOS A.
Intersection delays are somewhat increased, to between 5 and 15 seconds. The level of
comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less that at LOS A because the presence of
others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual behavior.
Level of Service “C” is in the range of stable flow, but marks the beginning of the range of flow
in which the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions with
others in the traffic stream. The selection of speed is now affected by the presence of others,
and maneuvering within the traffic stream requires substantial vigilance on the part of the user.
Intersection delays are in the range of 15 to 25 seconds. The general level of comfort and
convenience declines noticeably at this level.
Level of Service “D” represents high-density but stable flow. Speed and freedom to maneuver
are severely restricted, and the driver or pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of
comfort and convenience. Intersection delays are between 25 and 40 seconds. Small
increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at this level.
Level of Service “E” represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level. All speeds
are reduced to a low, but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic
stream is extremely difficult, and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or pedestrian
to ‘give way’ to accommodate such maneuvers. Intersection delays range between 40 to 60
seconds. Comfort and convenience levels are extremely poor, and driver or pedestrian
frustration is generally high. Operations at this level are usually unstable, because small
increases in flow and minor perturbations within the traffic stream will cause breakdowns.
Level of Service “F” is used to define forced or breakdown flow. This condition exists
wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount which can transverse
the point. Queues form behind such locations. Operations within the queue are characterized
by stop-and-go waves, and they are extremely unstable. Vehicles may progress at reasonable
speeds for several hundred feet or more, then be required to stop in a cyclic fashion.
Intersection delays are greater
                                                 August 13, 1991                      Page 22 of 50

than 60 seconds. Level-of-service F is used to describe the operating conditions within the
queue, as well as the point of the breakdown. It should be noted, however, that in many cases,
operating conditions of vehicles or pedestrians discharged from the queue may be quite good.
Nevertheless, it is the point at which arrival flow exceeds discharge flow, which causes the
queue to form, and level-of-service F is an appropriate designation for such points.

         In addition to traffic volume, level of service may be affected by a variety of ‘friction’
factors. These may include large amounts of on-street parking, driveways or access points to
the roadway, truck volumes, pedestrian activity, lack of left-turn lanes, traffic signals, and low
driver familiarity with the area. Presence of these factors may significantly reduce LOS below
the actual vehicle volume to capacity ratio. This is the case in the downtown Red Bluff, which
has on-street parking, may access points, and a large volume of trucks. LOS of the key Red
Bluff roadways and intersections are operating at or above LOS C. Deficient roadways are
listed in Table 4.

        Existing traffic volumes were measured in June 1990 through February 1991 at 19 key
roadways and intersections throughout the city. Using the peak hour method in accordance
with the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual, counts were made between 7:00 a.m. Monday
morning and 6:00 p.m. Thursday evening to obtain representative samples and to include
commuter traffic from outlying areas such as Redding and Chico. The traffic volumes obtained
are comparable to available CalTrans figures. The summary of the results are shown in Table 5
and illustrated in Figures 6 and 7.

                                       FUTURE CONDITIONS
        In order to forecast future traffic volumes and Levels of Service, the QRS II traffic
projection model was employed. Using the build-out of all land uses and roadway networks
shown in the General Plan, along with scheduled improvements, the computer model calculates
projected traffic volumes. The traffic volumes are distributed onto the roadway system by the
complex modeling formulas set forth in the national cooperative Highway Research Program
Report No. 187, Quick-Response Urban Travel Estimation Techniques and Transferable
Parameters, and projects the logical route choices of residents. The route choices are
determined by several factors, such as speed, capacities, travel times, distances, and
avoidance of congested area. The output of the program is the average daily traffic (ADT’s) and
peak hour volumes of roadways and intersections at buildout. Using this data, intersections and
roadways that may require improvement or alternative routes in order to maintain adequate
ease of circulation are spotlighted. These figures are shown in Table 6.

        The anticipated future traffic conditions in Red Bluff at buildout includes increasing traffic
on minor arterials and collectors. South Jackson Street and Monroe Street will experience
levels of service degradation generated by increased development in the north and south
sectors of the city, as well as drivers attempting to avoid the gridlock of the downtown area. The
construction of a bridge over Reeds Creek will facilitate increased traffic on Paskenta Road
between Walnut Street and Luther Road. South Jackson Street from Walnut Street to Luther
Road will also realize increased traffic as a result of the new east-west linkage of Willow Street
to Aloha Street, which will create a major intersection that will require signalization. Additionally,
aloha street will have expanded use as a link to developments in the west.
        The overriding circulation concern for the Red Bluff area, both currently and in the future,
is the downtown area of Antelope Boulevard form Sale Lane to Main Street, and Main Street
from Antelope Boulevard to Walnut Street. Because Antelope Boulevard is the only east-west
link from the outlying eastern area to the city core over the Sacramento River and Interstate 5,
all east-west traffic must use this roadway. As a consequence, it is virtually required that the
intersection of Antelope Boulevard and Main Street, Antelope Boulevard and Rio Street,
Antelope Boulevard and Belle Mill Road, and Antelope Boulevard and Sale Lane be used to
gain this cross-town access. With greater numbers of access roads, lower density, and higher
speeds, traffic dissipates easily on Antelope Boulevard east of Sale Lane. On the west side of
Antelope Boulevard, at Rio Street and Main Street, limited access and high density create
gridlock. While these areas are currently at unacceptable levels of service, the problems that
have created this gridlock
                                                August 13, 1991                        Page 35 of 50
 are not anticipated to change. The situation will, therefore, continue to degrade as
development occurs.
         The traffic problems of the main downtown intersections (Antelope Boulevard and Rio
Street, Antelope Boulevard and Main Street, and Main Street and Walnut Street) were studied
by traffic engineering consultant Joseph Holland in 1986. The report, entitled “Traffic Analysis:
Antelope Blvd. & Rio Street, Red Bluff, California” provides valid alternatives to reduce
downtown congestion:
    1. Remove some on-street parking and restripe portions of Main Street, Antelope
         Boulevard, and Walnut Street to increase the number of lanes, thereby increasing traffic
         capacity and LOS. The resulting decrease in parking in an area already perceived as
         having insufficient parking proved quite unpopular.
    2. Signalize the intersection of Rio Street and Antelope Boulevard to shift some of the
         traffic from Main Street onto Rio Street. Further analysis of this alternative indicated
         there would be notable improvement in traffic conditions at the Antelope Boulevard/Main
         Street intersection with a slight improvement a the Walnut Street/Main Street
         intersection. The negative impact, however, would include greater traffic volumes on Rio
         Street, longer delays in turning onto Antelope Boulevard from Main Street necessitated
         by the coordination of the two sets of traffic signals, potential peak hour blockage of the
         Rio Street intersection from backup of westbound traffic from the Antelope
         Boulevard/Main Street intersection, and significant cost of signal installation. The report
         goes on to state that while the traffic situation would improve in spots,
                                                 August 13, 1991                        Page 36 of 50

         the overall delay for through traffic would actually increase as a result of the
        signalization of the Antelope Boulevard/Rio Street intersection.
    3. Restrict left turns from Rio Street onto Antelope Boulevard during peak hours. This
        course of action would improve traffic volumes on Rio Street, eliminate the significant
        left-turn delay from Rio Street, and be of minimal cost. In terms of downtown
        congestion, the results would be minor: left-turn traffic would be diverted from Rio Street
        to Main Street, but overall delays would be virtually unchanged.20 This alternative was
        the one chosen by CalTrans and the City of Red Bluff for implementation, expanding the
        prohibition of left turns from peak hours to 24 hours per day.
        Another possible solution to the downtown traffic congestion not suggested in Holland’s
report is the conversion of Main Street and Rio Street between Sycamore Street and Cedar
Street to a one-way street couplet. Additional signalization would be needed at several sites,
including Rio Street at Antelope Boulevard, Rio Street at Walnut Street, and Main Street at
Sycamore, to facilitate this change. The chief advantage would be the significant reduction in
intersection delays, thus increasing the capacity and LOS. On the other hand, signalization
costs would be significant, and funding for such would be difficult to obtain. Further, the
reeducation of the driving public may be slow, as residents accustomed to the current
configuration may take a long time to readjust their driving habits and use the one-way streets
correctly. The City has noted significant opposition to this alternative when suggested in the
past, and there is no indication that public sentiment has significantly changed.
                                                August 13, 1991                         Page 37 of 50

        Recognizing that a new overpass of Interstate 5 and the Sacramento River would be
prohibitive on both financial and environmental grounds, the addition of an interchange at the
existing overpass of Interstate 5 at Adobe Road is being explored. The object would be to
provide eastbound access via the freeway thereby bypassing Main Street and alleviating
downtown congestion created by through traffic on Highway 36. Future plans include possible
extension of Adobe Road to connect, via freeway, with Antelope Boulevard. The project may
include the addition of a frontage road along the west side of Interstate 5 and ramp interchanges
providing southbound entrance to and northbound exit from the freeway, or may include the
realignment of Adobe Road to Walton Avenue. This alternative appears popular amongst
residents, as well as being of low cost to the City. Discussions between the City and CalTrans
are currently ongoing, and initial projections calculate the ramp construction to begin no sooner
than 1997, and most likely will commence after the year 2000.
        The final alternative is to do nothing about the downtown congestion. Current LOS is at
unacceptable levels. Future development will only exacerbate the situation, as there are no
convenient alternative routes in crossing to the east side of the City. Doing nothing may be
quite costly in terms of driver frustration, delays, and increasing complaints to the City. 21
        Another perceived problem in downtown circulation is availability of parking. With many
destinations, such as banks, shops, and restaurants along Main Street, Oak Street, and Walnut
Street, competition for on-street parking on these streets is most intense. There is, however, an
abundance of parking generally available within one or two blocks of these destinations, on
Washington, Jefferson, and Rio Streets. While distribution of parking may
                                                 August 13, 1991                      Page 38 of 50
    not be optimal convenience for users in terms of proximity to destinations, in sum, parking
availability in the downtown area is sufficient.

                     GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
I.  GOAL
    Problem-free circulation throughout Red Bluff
A. OBJECTIVE:                Provide convenient access to all areas of the city.
   1.      POLICY:           Level of Service (LOS) should not deteriorate below a Level “C”
                             On city streets during peak traffic hours.
           a.                Program:     Monitoring of LOS at key intersections shall assist to
                                           determine when and if traffic levels approach
                                           degradation of LOS.
   2.      POLICY:           Development and roadway improvements should be phased such
                             that LOS does not deteriorate significantly.
           a.                Program:      Approval of development proposals that may result in
                                           a degradation of LOS may be postponed until
                                           roadway improvements are made.
   3.      POLICY:           Traffic improvement priority shall be given to improve city streets
                             LOS to level “C” or better, where feasible.
   4.      POLICY:           Use of existing transportation facilities and mediums shall be
                             maximized.
   5.      POLICY:           Strip commercial and “drive-in” land uses shall be discouraged,
                             except where specifically designated, due to the friction of the
                             traffic generated.
           a.                Program:      Site-specific traffic impact studies may be required of
                                           any vehicle-intensive use.
   6.      POLICY:           Turning lanes shall be incorporated wherever appropriate to direct
                             channel traffic.

                              LAND USE ELEMENT
                    CITY OF RED BLUFF GENERAL PLAN
I. INTRODUCTION
   A.      Purpose of the Land Use Element
           The Land Use element of a general plan is intended as the principal guideline for
   decision about community growth. It is central to the plan and requires the greatest
   degree of relationship with the other six required elements. As succeeding elements of
   the plan area adopted or amended their relationship to the Land Use element must be
   assured through consistent policies, standards and locational parameters.
                   The Land Use element identifies the spatial arrangement of existing and
   proposed uses of the land including public lands and facilities. It lays out the distribution
   of classes of land use; the intensity of those uses and proposes a strategy of goals,
   objectives, policies and implementation measures to promote a wise use of land to
   promote the welfare of the community.
           1.      State Requirements
           The authority for the Land Use element is found in California Government Code.
   Section 65300 requires every city and county to draw up and adopt “a comprehensive,
   long-term general plan for the physical development” of the community. The Land Use
   element is specifically defined by Government code section 65302(a). The plan must
   include:
           “…a land use element, which designates the proposed general
           distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land
           for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture,
           natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
           education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste
           disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses
           of land. The land use element shall include a statement of the
           standards of population density and building intensity
           recommended for the various districts and other territory covered
           by the plan. The land use element shall identify areas covered by
           the plan, which are subject to flooding and shall be reviewed
           annually with respect to those areas.”
           2.      The General Plan Process
           The process of preparing, amending or updating a general plan includes a
   number of steps, which insure an adequate and effective set of policies and standards to
   be applied in the land use decision making process. The steps given below should be
   applied to any review and modification of the general plan. This will serve to keep the
   plan current and active to coordinate the review of development proposals, public land or
                                              1

facility improvements and to facilitate the management of community resources and
quality of life.
          An eight step process recommended by the State of California, General Plan
Guidelines includes the following steps: (See Planning Process Diagram in Appendix)
          Step 1          Identify Issues, Opportunities and Assumptions
          Step 2          Formulate Goals, Objectives
          Step 3          Collect and Analyze Data
          Step 4          Revise Goals and Objectives
          Step 5          Develop and Evaluate Alternative Plans
          Step 6          Select and Adopt the Preferred Plan
          Step 7          Implement the General Plan
          Step 8          Monitor and Amend the Plan
          Steps 1 – 8     Include Public Participation and Insure Government Coordination
          Steps 3 – 8     Coordinate with the Environmental Review Process
          3.      Consistency with other Elements and Plans
          Planning Law in California, embodied within Government code Section 65000
et.seq., requires that general plans be internally consistent. No conflict should exist
between the policies, textual or diagrammatic, within or between elements of the general
plan. This requirement is specified in Government Code Section 65300.5.
          Within element, or internal, consistency requires that data, analyses, goals,
objectives, polices and implementation measures within the element must complement
one another. Conflicts that arise between statements, data or diagrams must be
resolved during and process of plan amendment or adoption.
          Between elements there must be consistency in assumptions, proposals, goals,
objectives, policies and data bases. Amendments of any one element must necessarily
require appropriate revisions to portions of other elements, which are affected.
          Though not required specifically by Government Code it is highly recommended
that goals, objectives, policies, data base and assumptions regarding growth be
coordinated with the general plan of Tehama County. Land areas within the City
Sphere-of-influence and Planning Area are regulated by County planning regulations
and policies. These may well be inconsistent with those of the City. An active effort
should be made to insure consistency in policy regarding growth in these areas.
          4.      Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures
          Guildelines for community decision making for land use are embodied within the
structure of adopted goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures. Each is a
statement of a desirable community condition or approach to achieving that condition.
Each should be used as a guideline for making decision regarding land use questions.
                                            2

         Goals are unquantified ideal future condition toward which the community works.
It is the end which can probably not be achieved but which nevertheless is the ideal. An
example might be: To provide a Crime Free Community.
         Objectives are measurable and expected outcomes. As these are achieved
through time the community draws closer to its goals. Objectives are stated outcomes,
which may be achieved through expenditure of time, energy, resources or completion of
programs, activities or governmental actions. An objective may be: Establish an
Alternative, Safe Roadway Access from the Freeway to the Municipal Airport, or:
Construct Noise Attenuation Devices along the Residential Frontages with the SPRR,
Freeway and State Highways.
         Policies are statements, which are used to guide decision. They are to be
considered wherever appropriate before making a recommendation, administrative or
legislative decision regarding land use. These statements are stated in active speech to
give wise counsel and continuity to decisions. They are adopted as the body of the
general plan and its elements and represent the community consensus for the direction
the community should follow. Should that course change, then policies within the plan
should be changed to reflect new thinking. Otherwise, the plan may become
inadequate, inconsistent and out of date and will not meet the requirements of Sate
Planning, Zoning and Development Laws.
         Implementation Measures are specific actions, programs, techniques or
legislative initiatives (e.g. ordinances, plan adoption, ect.), which are meant to bring
about change or a desired result. The measures are intended to carry out the plan,
through the appropriate policy directions, and to achieve objectives set out by the
community.
B.       The Planning Area
         The general plan of a community must consider all the land and facilities within
its corporate boundaries as well as “any land outside its boundaries, which in the
planning agency’s judgment bears any relation to its planning”. (Government Code
Section 65300) This area is one with which the City probably has strong economic and
social interaction and which is probably reasonably contiguously developed though
generally not provided with City services.
         The planning area is extremely important to consider when making projections
for urban service capacities, infrastructure improvements and local City accommodation
for increased demands on central city roadways and other land and programs. The
planning area is that extra-governmental territory within which the City should coordinate
planning decisions with County administrators. This will improve the continuity of
character of peripheral urban development and insure consistency of urban development
standards for areas, which may eventually become incorporated. Specific boundaries of
the City of Red Bluff planning area are given on the Planning Area and City Sphere map.
Generally, the boundaries of the planning area are as follows:
         North: The north edge of the 100-year floodplain of Blue Tent Creek from the
                  Wilcox Road intersection southeast along the floodplain to a point ¼ mile
                  south of the Jelly’s Ferry I-5 interchange, then southeast along the
                  eastern side of the freeway and then east of the northeast 100-year
                  floodplain of Dibble Creek to the Sacramento River, across the
                  Sacramento River where Adobe Road meets its 100-year floodplain,
                  northeast to St. Mary’s Avenue, south to Stice Road and east to State
                  Highway 36.
                                             3

        East: The east edge of State Highway 36 from Stice Road to Tuscan Ave., then
               east to Salt Creek, south across Highway 99 along Salt Creek and thence
               to the grant line to a point 4000 feet south of Antelope Boulevard, west to
               Hoy Road, south to Gilmore Ranch Road, west to the northern extension
               of Olive and south to the east side of the Red Bluff Diversion Dam.
        South: The south edge of the 100-year floodplain of Red Bank Creek from the
               Red Bluff Diversion Dam to a point 1200 feet west of a southerly
               extension of Paskenta Road.
        West: A line running parallel and 1200 feet west of Paskenta Road from Red
               Bank Creek to the south 100-year floodplain of Reeds Creek, west to a
               point 800 feet west of Wilder Road, north to the channel of Brickyard
               Creek, east to a line to a point 800 feet north of the Baker Road /
               Highway 36 intersection, northeast to the Southern Pacific Railroad right-
               of-way, north to the south edge of the Blue Tent Creek 100-year
               floodplain and across the floodplain to the point of origin.
C.      The City Sphere of Influence
        The City of Red Bluff sphere-of-influence represents “the probable ultimate
physical boundaries and service area” of a jurisdiction. (California government code
Section 56076) the sphere-of-influence extends beyond City jurisdiction along lines of
transport and into areas most likely to be annexed and easily served by City services.
The purpose of the sphere boundaries is to communicate to other jurisdictions and
agencies that area within, which the City has a long term interest in the nature of land
use decisions and development standards with which it must eventually administer
consistent with City policies and standards. In these areas, the City may make
proposals to County government for land use policy and zoning (pre-zoning).
        The previous sphere-of-influence boundaries were aligned closely with the City
limits. They were very conservative in foreseeing “ultimate physical boundaries and
service area”. The proposed sphere boundaries are more consistent with population
growth projections, likely growth areas and expected extensions of city sewer and water
services. (See Land Use Map, page 6) Generally, the boundaries are as follows:
        North: The north edge of the 100-year floodplain of Blue Tent Creek to the east
               right-of-way of the Interstate 5 freeway, then south to the northeast edge
               of the 100-year floodplain of Dibble Creek, southeast and across the
               Sacramento River and then to the existing Sphere boundary north of
               Antelope Boulevard. There minor expansions of the Sphere boundary
               along the north and south margins of Antelope Boulevard.
        East: Extend the Sphere boundary from previous terminus north and south of
               Antelope Boulevard to the east margin of the 100-year floodplain of the
               Salt Creek overflow (west branch), from the previous Sphere boundary at
               Wiltsey Road, south along Philbrook Avenue, to Sykes Avenue, then west
               to Paynes Creek Slough, diagonally southwest to Williams Avenue and
               song the previous Sphere boundary following Williams Avenue, the City
               limits boundary to Sale Lane and south to Gilmore Ranch Road, then
               west to the edge of the freeway, south to the west bank of the
               Sacramento River and southeast edge of the 100-year floodplain of Red
               Bank Creek.
        South: The south edge of the 100-year floodplain of Red Bank Creek from the
               Sacramento River to a point west of the junction of Rawson and Pimentel
                                           4

      Roads then west to a point 500 feet west of the southerly extension of
      Paskenta Road.
West: North along a line 500 feet west of Paskenta Road to the south edge of
      the 100-year flood of Reeds Creek, then north and east along that
      boundary to Baker Road, then north, west and north along the City Limit
      continuing north along the west edge of Baker Road to Beegum Road
      (Highway 36) then northeast to the west margin of the Southern Pacific
      Railroad right-of-way and north to a point where the south margin of the
      100-year floodplain of Blue Tent Creek meets the SPRR right-of-way,
      northeast across the floodplain to its northeast edge to complete the
      Sphere boundary.

 VII. See also the Policies Appendix beginning on page 55.
 ______________________________________________________________________
 II.   LAND USE CLASSIFICATION AND EXISTING LAND USE DISTRIBUTION
       A.     Land Use Classifications
              All land uses within the City are classified by type and are defined by intensity
       and density standards. The land use classifications, or designations, must be consistent
       with zoning district classifications and hopefully consistent with actual existing land uses.
       Land use classifications in Red Bluff are given below. Each classification may include
       several intensities (different levels of concentration or intensity of use) and densities, or
       numbers of units or equivalent persons per acre. The location of land use designations
       are given on the Land Use map.
              1.       Residential
              R-L      Residential – Low Density
                       Residential – Low Density is a classification intended for the lowest
                       density residential areas of the City, which are served by water, sewer
                       and other services. They are a contiguous part of the built-up area and
                       include such allowable uses as one and two family buildings, agriculture,
                       care homes, home occupations, non-profit organizations and flea market
                       activities. Allowable unit densities are no more than 10 dwelling units per
                                                  9

    gross buildable acre. Consistent zoning includes R-1 and R-2 zoning
    districts. (see page 14)
R-M Residential – Medium Density
    The medium density residential classification is intended to designate
    areas of the City in which multiple family housing will be permitted by
    right. These areas are more efficiently served by City services.
    Allowable unit densities may not exceed 20 dwellings per gross acre.
    Consistent zoning includes R-3 and R-4 districts. (see page 14)
2.  Commercial
C   Commercial
    The commercial land use classification applies to all areas in the City in
    which commercial establishments are permitted as a right. They are
    located in neighborhoods at a smaller scale and with limited ranges of
    goods and services, in the central business district with a wider range of
    specialized functions and are located at principal transport access points
    or satellite business concentrations where volume and sale of special
    purpose goods and services are offered. Consistent zoning districts
    include C-1 (Neighborhood), C-2 (Central) and C-3 (General) regulations.
    (see also page 15)
3.  Industrial
I   Industrial
    Land uses which include product fabrication, processing or the sale or
    storage of bulk, hazardous or unfinished materials or industrial equipment
    are classified as industrial. These uses have the potential to generate
    nuisance and should be separated from residential classed areas by
    commercial or open space buffers or appropriate barriers or screening.
    The uses are generally located along principal transport corridors, airport
    locations or in isolated rural locations. Consistent zoning district include
    M-1 (Light), M-2 (General) and M-L (limited) regulations. (see also page
    16)
4.  Public
PS  Public Service
    The public service classification is reserved for publicly owned lands
    which provide utility, safety, government, business or educational
    services, open space, recreation, or protection of community resources.
    These are located near important service points or with appropriate
    access to public need. Consistent zoning includes the P-A and A-V
    districts.
                               10

5. Overlay Land Use Districts
G  Greenway
   The Greenway overlay district is intended to apply standards for river and
   flood corridor conservation throughout the City. Standards for land cover,
   drainage and grading are imposed to protect the native riparian corridors
   that course through the planning area namely, the Sacramento River and
   Red Bank, Grasshopper, Reed’s, Brickyard, Brewery, Dibble and Blue
   Tent Creeks and their wooded tributaries. Along these corridors
   continuous strip of native oak woodland remains. Whatever zoning
   district has been historically imposed, the effect of the overlay district will
   be to protect wildlife habitat, tree cover, minimize erosion, and limit the
   effects of flood and fire hazard. It will also insure the maintenance of
   scenic corridors and potential community resources.
F  Floodplain
   The floodplain overlay district is the mapped boundaries of the 100-year
   floodplain as defined by the National Flood Insurance Program of the
   Federal emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or consultant
   designation on the land use map. All areas mapped within Zone A on
   FEMA flood hazard boundary maps should experience flooding at least
   once within a one-hundred-year-period, averaged over the long-term.
   (See 100-year floodplain map on page 13)
   Flood hazards area are most prevalent within the Sacramento River
   floodplain along a corridor 1 – 2 miles wide to the east of downtown Red
   Bluff and to the south and north of the City, east of the I-5 freeway. The
   100-year floodplain is approximately 2000 feet wide along Red Bank
   Creek, 1000 feet wide along Grasshopper, Dibble and Blue Tent Creeks
   and 100 to 500 feet wide along Reed’s, Brickyard and Brewery Creeks.
   The effect of the Floodway overlay designation will be to limit or condition
   any use of the land within the zones. For purposes of maintaining public
   safety the interim City Land Development Policies and City Grading,
   Drainage and Ground Cover Policies will be implemented within these
   zones.
   The provisions of the Floodplain overlay district in the Land Development
   Guidelines will supplement and / or supersede those of any zoning district
   over which it is superimposed.
   NOTE: A FW (Floodway) overlay is established in the 1993 Safety
   Element. Due to the flood hazards that exist in those areas use,
   development and alteration within the floodways is severely restricted.
H  Hillslope
   On hillsides exceeding 20 percent slope no grading or land development
   improvement will be permitted except by special use permit (see also
   page 57).
                              11

        6.     Planned Development Standards and Other Overlay Zoning Districts
        PD     Planned Development (Planned Development Use Permit)
               Planned Development Districts are conditions or regulations rather than
               district boundaries on a Zoning Map with accompanying Zoning
               Standards. Planned Development may be applied to residential,
               commercial or industrial zones to supplement applicable zoning district
               requirements. They are intended to introduce flexibility and creative
               design within proposed projects. These planned developments, involving
               the careful application of design, are encouraged to achieve a more
               functional, aesthetically pleasing and harmonious living environment
               within the City (Chapter 25, City Code).
               The PD use permit regulations are a type of “floating” district, the
               conditions of which may be superimposed on most zoning districts.
        AZ     Approach Zone
               Densities for residential land within the Red Bluff Municipal Airport
               Approach Zones will be limited to 3.5 units per acre. Further restrictions
               are included in the Comprehensive Airport Land Use Commission.
        CZ     Clear Zone
               The Clear Zone overlay extends 1300 feet in a widening segment from
               the ends of the principal runway of the municipal airport. As discussed in
               the Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan, all development within the
               Clear Zone is strictly limited. The overlay supersedes all underlying
               zoning districts.
        N      Noise
               Standards for development in areas of excessive noise propagation may
               be found in the Land Development Guidelines, the Comprehensive
               Airport Master Plan and in the Noise element of the Red Bluff General
               Plan.
        A      Agricultural Overlay Zone
        F      Highway Overlay Zone Frontage
        MHCA Mobile Home Common Area
The regulations of the combining districts about are additive to any district with which
they are combined. They increase the requirements for a particular zone where local
conditions require special concern in the public interest.
                                          12

                             13
B.     Land Use Distribution and Density
       The distribution of existing residential densities follow closely the pattern of land
use designations on the plan diagram, the City zoning map and on the map of existing
land uses. The location and densities of residential land is as follows:
       1.     Low Density Residential Land
              II.B.1.a.1.1.1. DENSITIES:
              Low Density Residential (1 – 10 units per acre or 2.47 – 24.7 persons per
              gross buildable acre @ 2.47 persons per household unit)
                       Low density land uses include single family and duplex residential
              districts. Allowable densities are 10 units per gross acre or less. Ten
              families per acre equals about 24.7 persons per acre at 1990-census
              average household size. This land use class will generate 100 vehicle
              trips per day per gross acre of land.
                       Densities of 10 units per acre are comprised almost completely of
              single-family housing. Duplex lots make up about 3 percent of the lots in
              this class or just over 100 units. (See Appendix Figure 2)
                       Single family, single lot residential development accounts for 3175
              units in the City. (U.S. Census, 1990) These units make up 63% of the
              5062 housing units within the City (1990 Census). The 2245 acres of
              single family and duplex lots are 80% of all residential acreage (Table 1-
              B, page 18).
              II.B.1.a.1.1.2. DISTRIBUTION:
                       Low density residential land is distributed uniformly north, west
              and south of the central City. Very few scattered low density settlements
              are found within the City east of the Sacramento River.
                       Low density residential uses were built at the center of town
              during Red Bluff’s early history and always at the edge of town
              progressively farther from the center as the city grew. Competing
              commercial, industrial and other land activities appeared within the
              residential areas at economic and accessible locations and very often
              replaced the older single family residences. The resulting low density
              residential land distribution is widespread. More uniform, expansive
              tracts appear all around the periphery at the least accessible locations
              and at the greatest travel distances from the principal destinations. Mixed
              low density residential and other uses are found in older developed areas
              of the town. It is in these more central areas that most conflicts are
              created between once quiet neighborhoods and the increasing nuisances
              and hazards of more intensive land uses. Policies are included in the
              plan to minimize the conflicts that may be created by land use changes in
              more central city locations.
                                         14

2. Medium Density Residential Land
   II.B.2.a.1.1.1. DENSITIES:
           Medium Density Residential (10.1-20 units per acre or 25-49
   persons per acre @ 2.47 persons per occupied household unit)
           Densities over 10 units per acre are comprised of apartment or
   condominium developments on relatively large parcels. However, many
   single lot complexes occur. Developments with 4 or more units per lot
   make up virtually all medium density residential areas. In 1990, there
   were over 233 such lot locations in the city. (Appendix, Figure 2) These
   lots make up about 20% of all residential acreage (Table 1-B, page 18).
                            15
   II.B.2.a.1.1.2. DISTRIBUTION:
            Medium density housing is distributed with little pattern across the
   City. The existing Land Use Map indicates the largest of these
   complexes to be along south Sale Lane, east of the Sacramento River
   along Lakeside Drive and Gilmore Road, along the south bank of Reeds
   Creek near the Sacramento River (manufactured homes), and at many
   scattered locations along Walnut Street, South Jackson St., along Luther
   and Kimball Roads, Dephinium Court, David Avenue and in the Franzel
   Road and Deborah Drive areas.
            Small lot medium density development, with few units in each, are
   found scattered predominantly in the central city and immediately north
   and west of it in what are the older residential area of the town.
            Land, which is designated and zoned medium density residential,
   is located in generally central locations of the City. Medium density
   residence permits up to twenty units per acre, equaling up to 20 families,
   or 49,4 person per acre (@ 2.47 persons per family. (Source: 1990 U.S.
   Census) Vehicle trip generation is up to 10 trips per household per day or
   200 trips per day per acre in this use class. (See trip generation
   estimates in the Circulation Element.)
            Central or high access locations are best for medium density
   housing. Also, higher density uses are also favored next to public
   grounds to provide maximum public access to recreation and open space.
   All these locations minimize vehicle trips, travel and time, roadway
   congestion and vehicular emissions.
            In Red Bluff medium density zoning districts are presently located
   to the west of the downtown and east of the public High School and north
   of Oak Hill cemetery. They are also found along and on both sides of the
   Sacramento River. Medium density districts in outlying areas are located
   near principal arterials, schools and shopping districts. They are found
   south of downtown, east of the airport and South Jackson Street, near the
   new Red Bluff Shopping Plaza, east of town in the Antelope corridor, west
   of town, along Walnut Street and north of town between the Wilcox Oaks
   golf club and commercial districts.
3. Commercial Land
            Commercial land varies in form, function, location and intensity
   with its period of development, its accessibility to a particular consumer
   market and with its peculiar locational economics. In Red bluff this land,
   approximately 16% of the City (Table 1-B, page 18), is located in these
   definable situation. The largest and most diverse concentration of
   commercial land is located in the central city. The forces of a historically
   compact city made central location very desirable. As the city grew, the
   attraction of lower priced highway frontage and vacant land in the town’s
   periphery allowed the spread of this activity.
            Roadway corridors and their high accessibility / visibility
   encouraged the first spreading along Antelope Boulevard to the east,
   Walnut to the west and Main St. to the north. Alignment of the Interstate
   5 freeway enhanced the locational advantages of the Antelope Blvd.,
                              16

   South Main St, and Highway 36 interchanges and stimulated commercial
   development at the first tow of these. Large scale development to the
   south of the city center has encouraged siting of commercial activities
   along South Main Street (due in part to large tract availability and lower
   site costs not available in the City center). Also, proposed commercial
   development will serve more remote suburban development along South
   Jackson and north of Wilcox Rd.
            Commercial land use designations and zoning reflect the real
   need for commercial development in response to the above economic
   principles. Commercial policies in the plan promote the anticipation of
   future commercial land use needs, promote the concentration of such
   land uses in appropriate locations, discourage unnecessary proliferation
   of those uses into low density residential areas and promote
   redevelopment of commercial activity in the central city.
4. Industrial Land
            The historical location of industrial activities in Red Bluff was
   closely associated with the location of the Southern Pacific railroad
   alignment and old highway 99 West. This is particularly true of the
   forestry products industries on the south side of the city and small scale
   manufacturing and warehousing along the railroad and Monroe Street
   along and just west of the central city corridor. Mixed industrial uses
   later located along the north alignment of the railroad, at the west edge of
   the city northwest of the Walnut St. and Baker Rd. intersection and most
   recently with the designation of an industrial park adjacent to the
   municipal airport.
            The general plan affirms the need for industrial activities in the
   city. Proposed designations of land for this propose is influenced by three
   considerations. The first is the industrial activities are encouraged at
   locations where high freeway, railroad and airport access make it a
   desirable use of land. This presumes the ability to minimize the
   nuisances and hazards that may affect residential areas. The sound
   consideration is the uncertainty of the future strength of the forest
   products industry in the regions. The designation for future use of large
   tracts of wood products industry land may be questioned. The City must
   consider alternatives in the long-term economic interest of the community.
   The third consideration is the generally undesirable nuisance and safety
   concerns of railroad linked uses through the center of the community.
   Policies will generally encourage transition to lower intensity land uses.
5. Public Land
            Public land use activities are distributed throughout the community
   in a pattern determined by their function. Public administrative offices
   and services are generally centrally located for high public accessibility.
   Public utilities and disposal sites are generally peripheral to the City
   because of engineering requirements and nuisance characteristics. The
   municipal airport and adjacent reserved open space represents a need
   for locational removal from high use residential activities.
                              17
                   Public schools and public open spaces are located at generally
          regular intervals to provide for neighborhood access. Higher level
          education or large scale open space sites depend more on site qualities
          (adequate space or ideal site environments along the Sacramento River).
          (Existing public land use is illustrated on the Land Use map.)
                   Community growth will create demands for additional space and
          facilities.
                   Planning for these spaces is ongoing by appropriate departments
          of the City government. (see proposed land use section, III-B). The land
          use planning process is especially important for conservation of open
          space for future public needs. The Conservation / Open Space element
          of the general plan provides special reference to open space needs.
   6.     Floodplains
                   The Land Use Map designation for floodplains indicates all
          corridors along principal streams in Red Bluff, which flood beyond their
          annual floodway channels.
                   The 100-year floodplain boundaries have been transferred to the
          Land Use Map from Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) prepared by the
          Federal emergency Management Agency ((FEMA) (Where the flood plan
          boundary is not indicated on the F.I.R.M. an estimated boundary is
          noted). The boundaries indicate the calculated extent of a flood event
          expected at least portions of the Sacramento River, sloughs, and Red
          Bank, grasshopper, Reed’s, Brickyard, Brewery, Dibble and Blue Tent
          Creeks, which flow through the City of Red Bluff.
                   The land use element includes policies governing the use of land
          in floodplains. They guide decisions and provide constraints for property
          improvements and human habitation in these flood hazard zones.
C. Land Use Acreages
          A land use survey was prepared for the City of Red Bluff. Existing parcel
   development and vacant areas were mapped for the period 1990-1991. The
   map reflects the acreage totals given below. It is displayed in the City
   Community Development Department.

D.       Effects of Regional Transportation Access on Local Land Uses
         1.      The Interstate Highway (5)
         The effect of the State freeway through Red Bluff has been to increase access of
the City to external markets and regional highway movements. The freeway improves
the locational advantages of Red Bluff for economic development opportunities.
         The local effects of the freeway have been to improve the value and opportunity
for industrial and commercial land uses at the principal freeway access points in the City.
The freeway access east of Kimball Road in the south and Antelope Boulevard east of
town center have stimulated development of this type.
         The access at Antelope has influenced the highway oriented commercial
development there. The area within the City limits is almost fully built and with the
constraints of the Sacramento River and its floodplain (e.g. prim agricultural land) little
vacant land remains for future development.
         The South Main Street freeway access, east of Kimball Road, is the principal
access to south Red Bluff, its industrial zones, including the municipal airport and
industrial park to the west, and to the shopping centers on South Main Street. This
freeway access points provide northern city limit connections with Wilcox Road and with
Main Street. The effects of these on local land use are minimal at this time. Their
remote location serves local traffic and at Main Street, a more direct connection of the
northern districts of the City. Land use development potential in the near future is
limited. However, should a freeway interchange be constructed at Adobe Road
development potential would increase substantially. The area in the vicinity of the Main
Street access (limited to south-bound off-ramp and north-bound on-ramp) and the area
adjacent to the Wilcox Oaks gold and residential area, at Wilcox Road, are both largely
vacant and are generally suited to residential and commercial use.
         2.      The Southern Pacific (SP) Railroad
         The SP Railroad has always been an important element in the area economy.
Rail access has enabled the historic growth of the lumber industry, once the principal
employment base in the area. Today the railroad continues to serve this economy but in
a much-diminished railroad continues to serve this economy but in a much diminished
capacity. Mill production is greatly reduced and is unlikely to ever return to its original
scale or local importance.
         The SP Railroad is principally a routing corridor through Red Bluff. Its right-of-
way bisects the community and introduces something of an inconvenience to the
circulation system and a nuisance to the visual and acoustic environment. The right-of-
way disturbs the central city environment and has left remnant land uses, such as vacant
warehouses, storage buildings and commercial and industrial structures and vacant land
sites. These sites have little value for conversion due to the low demand for rail services
and the high nuisance of the railroad location.
         Current land uses along the SP line are negatively influenced by noise, vibration,
visual aesthetics and limited access. Development of these sites will depend upon the
ability to mitigate those negative effects and restore value to the affected sites.
         3.      The Municipal Airport
         The 280-acre municipal airport is an important transportation asset to the
community. Its location southwest of the City and just adjacent to the urbanizing fringe
provides excellent open space resources and has excellent land development
opportunities. The promotion of industrial site development in the airport industrial park
                                          21
is a principal direction for an appropriate City economic development policy. It offers the
foremost opportunities for high value, high technology, and industrial development in the
community.
          However, airport connections with the freeway, 1 ½ miles to the east, are
marginal and there is no rail access. Principal issues that remain to be resolved which
affect land use development are, 1) improved, non-residential corridor access to the
freeway and 2) development regulation in approach and over-flight areas around the
airport. The airport land use plan will provide some solutions to the latter problem.
E.       Vacant Land
         There are 1566-acres of vacant (or undeveloped) land in the City of Red Bluff.
This represents about 33% of the City area. The distribution of this vacant land is largely
in the categories of single-family R-1 zoned land (920-acres) and multiple-family R-2, R-
3 zoned land (335-acres). The next largest category is commercial zoned land with 172-
acres (see Table 1-B, page 18).
         Vacant lands are distributed by area largely to the north and south ends of the
City limits. To the north most of the land is found in the 572-acre Wilcox-Oaks complex
of districts including single-family, mobile home, commercial and industrial zones. To
the south, the largest single tract (approximately 320-acres) is within the municipal
airport district intended for airport related commercial and industrial uses. To the east,
between South Jackson Street and Montgomery Road, two single and multifamily zoned
tracts account for almost 200-acres and along Montgomery Road, about 40-acres of
industrial land. The remaining vacant land is generally zoned low density residential and
is found in the area south of Luther Road (about 50-acres) adjacent to the north section
of Monroe Ave. (about 175-acres) and in the area adjacent to the east of Baker Road
(about 160-acres), (see Lane use and Vacant Land Map). Smaller tracts of vacant land
are scattered throughout the City.
F.       Natural Resources Areas, Floodplains, and Other Resources Areas
          Natural resources in the Red Bluff area are reviewed in the Conservation and
Open Space elements of the General Plan. For consistency they are referred to here
and within the Land Use Policies.
         1.       Biotic Resources
         The principal biotic resources of Red Bluff are natural vegetative tree and ground
cover and the plant and animal life, which inhabit tree and ground cover and the rivers
and creeks, which flow through the town. These natural biotic resources survive in
greenway corridors, which are belted along the Sacramento River and its tributaries,
flowing through Red Bluff including: Blue Tent Creek, Dibble Creek, Brewery Creek,
Brickyard Creek, Reeds Creek, Grasshopper Creek and Red Bank Creek and their
tributaries.
         The floodplains, banks and hillsides adjacent to these waterways have high
water tables and soil moisture content. This supports natural associations of Oak and
scrub vegetation and an intricate network of plant and animal species, which are
interdependent as sources of food and shelter (cover). These are ecologic habitats, the
elements of which should be protected by leaving them as much as possible in their
natural states. The greenway corridors are fragile and sensitive to fire, erosion, water
depletion and habitat destruction by excessive human use. By excluding unnecessary
development from these corridors they will remain a permanent biotic resource, which is
very important to the small town and rural character of the City.
                                            22

          Floodplains, designated as the 100-year floodplain by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), are an important resource. They are a critical basin to
receive, hold and slowly release the short-term run-off from heavy rainstorms. Their
filling, channelizing or modification simply increases flood potential along other parts of
the floodplain or diverts scouring and erosive forces to adjacent or downstream banks.
          Floodplains and the adjacent belt of woodland (Greenways) are also the zone of
highest native vegetation growth. Natural vegetation systems within the floodplain are
an important natural erosion control system and the only natural habitat for animal life
that remains in the City (see Greenway and Floodplain Map).
          Within the floodplain is the floodway. It is generally devoid of vegetation except
for grasses and small shrubs. It is the annual zone of flooding. The floodways in Red
Bank, Reeds and Dibble Creeks are characterized by annual deposition of sand, gravel
and rock. As they approach confluence with the Sacramento River, their gradients are
so low that sediment carried from the foothills to the west is dropped in the flood
channel.
          2.      Mineral Resources
          The principal floodways of Red Bluff are a principal mineral resource for
aggregate mining. Sand, gravel and rock for construction are easily removed and with
conditions placed on operations little damage may be done to floodplain habitats or
down stream water quality. These resource zones will be zoned for industrial use but
with strictly imposed conditions for operation by the City and by the requirements of the
Federal Surface Mining and Reclamation Act.
          3.      Agricultural Resources
          Tracts of prime agricultural land occupy a portion of the City to the northeast,
adjacent to the freeway and the Sacramento River. No other area of the City to the
north, west or south, possess such resources and it is not the policy of the City to annex
agricultural lands to the east of the Sacramento River.
          Agricultural resource lands currently within the City are intended for development
as for more intensive uses. Due to their small scale and unimportance directly for the
City of Red Bluff, they will not be included in its resources policies. The plan should,
however, be attentive to the policies for farmland preservation presented in the Tehama
County General Plan.
          4.      Aesthetic Resources
          The principal natural aesthetic resources of the City lie in its river and creek
corridors, oak woodland and chaparral covered hills. These provide an open space
resource for visual enjoyment and recreational pursuits and are essential to maintain the
rural, open and small town character of the community.
          Urban trees and tree landscaping programs in residential, commercial, urban
stream and industrial areas are important to restoring the historic wooded and small
town scale aesthetics in the City. These objectives will be supported by tree planting
and preservation ordinances.

III. EXISTING AND PROJECTED POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT
     A.      Existing and Projected Population
             1.      Historic and Existing Population and present Household Characteristics
             An accurate record of annual population has been maintained by the City
     Community Development Department. The source of population levels include the U.S.
     Bureau of Census for 10-year interval census of population, special local census counts
     supervised by the State of California and annual estimates provided by the State of
     California and annual estimates provided by the State Department of Finance,
     Population Research Unit. Those figures are shown below in Table 2 for each year
     figures were available and are shown in Figure 3 for every 10-year period since 1970.

        2.      Population Base and Assumptions
        Population base figures are taken from the U.S. Bureau of Census for 1970,
1980 and 1990, and those for intervening periods prepared by the California Department
of finance. Census tracts 5,6, and 7 in 1990 enumeration district 643, 644 and 646 were
added to City population figures.
        The unincorporated area population of Red Bluff is located principally north and
south of Antelope Boulevard. Its size has increased from 2,125 to 4,483 from 1970 to
the present. The unincorporated, peripheral urban population was approximately 22% of
the urban population in 1970, 28% in 1980 and 27% in 1990 (See Table 4 and Figure 4).

        3.      Projected Population
        Population projections are compiled for the City of Red Bluff and for the greater
urban area, including unincorporated Tehama County, for the 10-year period 1991-2000.
Forecasts are based upon certain assumptions. The first is that trends of population
growth, which have occurred during the past 20 years, will continue over the next 10
years. Inherent in the first assumption is the second that those economic and social
forces, which have been operating during the past 20 years, will continue. The
presumption is that economic growth, following the current recession, will resume at a
moderate and stable annual rate. It is assumed that the rate of growth will resemble the
immediate past rates of growth (see Table 5).
        Another assumption is that the City of Red Bluff will continue to exhibit a
relatively constant proportion of the total urban area population. It is expected that its
annexation policy will continue to be conservative and that most City population
increases will occur within the present City corporate limits or its proposed Sphere-of-
Influence.
        A final assumption is that the rate of unincorporated area population growth will
decline during the forecast period. This is justified due to the lack of available urban
services, groundwater contamination problems and diminishing areas of small lot, prime
development land with good highway access.

      B.       Proposed Land Use
               Allowable land use activities within the corporate limits of the City are presently
      given by the current land use designation diagram and by the underlying zoning districts
      shown on City zoning maps. Outside the City boundary, however, land use activities are
      presently managed by Tehama County. In the belt of land adjacent to the City limits lies
      that City Sphere-of-Influence. Within this zone, the area into which the City expects to
      grow, the community may specify land use activities, which will be consistent with its
      present land use policy and with its goals for growth. The City may propose future land
      uses within the sphere-of-influence, designate them on the land use map and pre-zone
      their specific land use character.
               The proposed City Sphere-of-Influence (SOI) is defined about and illustrated on
      the land use diagram. Proposed land use activities are as follows (also see the Land
      Use Map):

C.      Proposed Residential Development Densities
        1.      Allowable Densities
        Throughout the planning area residential densities are constrained by the upper
level of permitted units per acre for each zoning district. These limits are presented in
sections II A & B above and in the City Zoning Regulations.
                                           29
               Residential densities are further constrained by hazardous conditions in 100-
       Year floodplains as designated by the U.S. Corps of Engineers. Those allowable
       densities will be provided in the City Land Development Policies.
               Development densities for vacant residential designated land reference above
       are as follows:
               a.    Within existing and proposed Residential-Low Density districts the upper
                     limits to allowable development densities is 1 – 5 units per acre for R-1
                     zoned land and 5.1 – 10 units per acre for R-2 zoned land.
               b.    Within existing and proposed Residential-Medium density districts the
                     upper limit to allowable development densities is 10.1 – 15 units per acre
                     for R-3 and 15.1 – 20 unit per acre for R-4 zoned land.
               The standard for population density forecasting is 2.47 persons per household.
       This is the value calculated for Red Bluff by the U.S. Bureau of Census for the 1990
       Census period (see previous discussion of population characteristics in Red Bluff in
       Table 3).
               2.      Expected Densities on City Residential Land (See Table 1-B, page 18)
               Within the present corporate limits of Red Bluff, there remain 975 acres of vacant
       low-density residential land and 280 acres of vacant multi-family or medium density
       residential land. At median density values (6 units per acre at low density and 16 at
       medium density) the number of units and population (at present mean family size) that
       will occupy the present vacant land is as follows:

Class                                        Acreage               Units           Persons
Low Density Residential                           975              5,850             14,450
Medium Density Residential                        280              4,480             11,066
                        TOTALS                  1,255             10,330             25,516
               At median allowable densities, about 1,255 vacant residential acres within the
       present corporate limits of Red Bluff will accommodate approximately 25,516 persons, a
       number twice as large as the current 1991 City population.
               3.      Expected Densities on Proposed Residential Development
                       Outside the Present City Corporate Limits (Excluding Floodplain Lands)
               Within the area bounded by the proposed City Sphere-of-Influence and outside
       the present corporate limits, there are approximately 1,838 acres of vacant developable
       land (Land in the 100-Year Floodplain is excluded Proposed Floodplain densities are
       included in the City Land Development Policies). A breakdown of approximate area by
       region and expected densities by type of proposed residential development is as follows:

                At median allowable densities, the approximately 1,230 vacant proposed
        residential acres within the proposed City Sphere-of-Influence will accommodate
        approximately 19,900 persons, or about 160% of the present City population.
        D.      Proposed Commercial and Industrial Development and Densities
                Within the City limits, there are an estimated 172 acres of vacant commercial
        land and 139 acres of vacant industrial land (estimates are being updated under an
        ongoing Chico State University study).
                Outside the present corporate limits and within the proposed City Sphere-of-
        Influence, approximately 887 acres of vacant land is proposed for commercial and
        industrial development and for undetermined public services use.

The allowable development densities for commercial and industrial land are provided by City
Ordinance 828 of Chapter 25 of the City Codes (Zoning). Development densities within 100-
Year Floodplain areas are provided for the City Land Development Policies (III-A, page 59) and
Chapter 26 of the City Code.
        E.      Implications of Growth for Urban Circulation
        Vehicular circulation is addressed in depth in the Circulation Element of the Red Bluff
General Plan. The implications of expected growth during the 10-year planning period and for
the ultimate buildout of the areas given above will complement that element and should be the
bases for urban circulation policies.
                                                   31

        Present levels of traffic generation and increases, which will follow from residential
development over the next 10-years will add a burden to the streets of the City. Increased
congestion, noise generation, vehicular emissions and delays in travel time will result. The
implications of increased population, business and industrial land use development will be loss
of ease and comfort of movement on the street of the City. Without alternative and improved
methods for reducing traffic flows or facilitating them, a significant deterioration in traffic service
levels will occur at the following locations. Policies addressing the impacts given below are
provided in the Circulation Element of the City General Plan.
                1.      Monroe Street
                        The development of residential properties off Monroe Avenue will cause
                        significant increase in flows from the Walton Avenue intersection to the
                        south. There are safety concerns for low density and residential
                        frontages and for children walking to Sacred Heart School. The City has
                        proposed local road improvements to Walton Avenue and signalization of
                        the intersection.
                2.      Walton Avenue
                        Traffic volumes will increase on Walton Avenue through the Walton
                        Avenue neighborhood as commuters divert to Main Street for more direct
                        access to central Red Bluff. Noise and safety considerations will affect
                        the neighborhood. The City recommends speed control to minimize
                        effects.
                3.      Main Street (North of Walnut)
                        Traffic volumes will increase beyond design capacities as the Street
                        serves as access to central retail and services for larger populations in
                        northerly developing areas. Access to the freeway at Adobe Road may
                        circumvent through City traffic.
                4.      Antelope Boulevard (Between Main Street and the Freeway)
                        Traffic will increase along an already congested section of Antelope Blvd.
                        Buildout of vacant commercial and residential land to the north and south
                        of the freeway intersection, continued growth along the east Antelope
                        Blvd corridor and increasing use of the Antelope Blvd freeway exit by
                        resident from northerly and southerly locations will create excessive traffic
                        backups and delays at all intersections from the freeway to Main Street.
                        A new Adobe Road freeway access may abate some of this congestion.
                        Diversion of traffic along parallel one-way streets east of Main Street may
                        also relieve congestion and delays.
                5.      South Main Street (Between Walnut Street and Luther Street)
                        The development of the shopping plaza at South Main Street and Luther
                        Road as a regional commercial center and destination has drawn larger
                        traffic flow from outlying areas and much of it along South Main Street.
                        As South Main Street remains the principal access for most of the
                        population of Red Bluff, traffic volumes will increase. Congestion at
                        signalized intersections will increase and heavy and slower traffic flow
                        along the length of the street section will occur.
                        No other roadway is an appropriate alternative to South Main Street. The
                        City should explore improving the attractiveness for shopping in the
                                                   32
                  downtown. This will provide more balance in shopping destinations and
                  less congestion on South Main Street.
         6.       Main Street and Walnut Street Intersection
                  Maximum levels of service have been exceeded at the intersection of
                  Main Street and Walnut / Antelope Blvd. The peak hour flows and left-
                  turn cycles cause long delays and the implications of growth are that this
                  condition will worsen. It is doubtful that engineering improvements at the
                  intersection will have significant or long-term beneficial effects. Some
                  circulation mechanism should be adopted to divert traffic away from the
                  intersection.
         7.       Luther Road Airport Access
                  With increased industrial development in the Airport Industrial Park, most
                  of the need for access has been shown to be for truck traffic. The
                  principal connection from the freeway to the industrial park has been
                  Luther Road and secondarily Kimball Road. Luther Road was designed
                  and accessed principally as a minor arterial street. Heavy truck traffic has
                  degraded this function and increases safety concerns for pedestrians,
                  schools, churches and low-density residence along the road. Noise, dust
                  and vibration further degrade the neighborhood environment. New
                  industrial development in the area and additional residential growth will
                  exacerbate the problem.
                  The City will propose a new airport limited access arterial south of Luther
                  Road.
IV. PUBLIC FACILITIES
    A.   Existing and Proposed Water and Sewer Facilities
                  In May 1991, the City completed its Master Plan for Infrastructure Capital
         Improvement Programs. The consultant report outlined the infrastructure system
         including water supply and distribution, wastewater collection, water recycling,
         traffic circulation, flood protection facilities and community services facilities and
         proposed a capital improvement program and fee structure for projects relating to
         those systems.
         1.       Water Supply and Distribution
                           The City of Red Bluff pumps groundwater from 12 deep wells and
                  discharges it directly to its water distribution system. Well pumping
                  capacity ranges from 500 to 2,644 gallons per minute. The water system
                  mains consist of 52.65 miles of 4 to 24 inch diameter pipe (47% is 6” and
                  35% is 8”) made of asbestos cement, cast iron, mortar lined steel, steel or
                  polyvinyl chloride.
                           The groundwater supply is abundant and of high quality and will
                  be adequate for the long-term needs of the City. Well pumping capacity
                  is also adequate to meet consumer demand.
                           Although the distribution system is of adequate coverage, the
                  preponderance of small diameter pipe, especially in areas of relatively
                  higher City elevation or distance from the well pumping stations has
                  caused a problem of low water pressure during periods of peak demand.
                                              33

           Also, the system may not deliver adequate pressure for fire demand in
           remote locations.
                     Master Plan recommendations for the water distribution system
           are: 1) to construct new parallel mains (6.14 miles), 2) create a new
           pressure zone for elevations about 350 feet and, 3) increase reservoir
           storage capacity by modifying the well pump on / off control logic.
   2.      Sewer Collection and Treatment (Recycling)
                     The City maintains 36 miles of 6 to 30-inch sanitary sewer
           pipeline. The system includes collection pipe (excluding individual
           building laterals), 12 pumping stations and the wastewater treatment
           (recycling) facility.
                     Public and private users generate 1.1 million gallons of
           wastewater per day (an average of 88 gallons per capita) and
           summertime infiltration of groundwater into the system adds .15 million
           gallons per day (12%) to the wastewater flow. During wet weather,
           infiltration rates are much greater and flows approach three times the
           summertime flows.
                     The Master Plan reports that “over 10,000 feet of trunk sewer
           mains are deficient under existing wet weather conditions and almost
           40% (will) have inadequate capacity.. at buildout”. Capacity restrictions
           are expected approaching buildout of the planning period (to 2020).
           Capacity will be reached especially in areas where sections of pipe have
           reduced diameters or run along flat gradients. “Pumping stations also
           have a limited capacity for limited flow.”
                     The water recycling facility processes 1.25 million gallons of
           effluent per day with a capacity of 2.0 mgd. The process includes primary,
           secondary and filtration and disinfection levels of treatment including
           anaerobic disasters for sludge. The quality of discharged effluent is lower
           in suspended solids than that of the Sacramento River into which they are
           released. The plant has adequate secondary treatment capacity until
           2010. Repair, maintenance and improvements of other elements of the
           system should be undertaken during the next 10 years.
                     The Master Plan recommends construction of a Monroe Street /
           Reed’s Creek relief sewer, upgrading capacity of several pumping
           stations, sewer system repairs, and upgrading and improving equipment
           and processing systems at the recycling plant.
B. Existing and Proposed Solid and Hazardous Waste Disposal
           Solid and hazardous waste disposal are of significant concern to Red
   Bluff. The City presently relies on the Tehama County sanitary landfill to dispose
   of most of its solid waste and must export hazardous waste out of the county to
   Sacramento, Kings and other counties. An analysis of solid waste management
   was included in the 1991 Tehama County study, Multi Jurisdictional Source
   Reduction and Recycling Element. Hazardous waste generation and disposal is
   reviewed in the 1989 Tehama County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.

           Estimates of total tonnage of solid waste disposed of from the City
   of Red Bluff for 1990 are given in Figure 1 in Multi Jurisdictional citied

   All the above waste was disposed of at the Tehama County landfill. The
   proportionate share by type of generator is commercial (51.6%),
   residential (33.8%), or about 1.9 pounds per person per day, and
   industrial (14.6%). Red Bluff contributes 38.2% of the total 33,245 tons
   disposed in the county landfill in 1990. Forecasted levels of waste
   generation are that it will increase at the same rate as population growth
   (study estimates 2.7% per year). Source: Multi Jurisdictional above.
   The study proposes a 10-step program of alternatives to landfill disposal.
   They include:
           1.      Residential Curbside Recycling
           2.      Multi-Family Recycling Receptacles
           3.      Commercial – Industrial Recycling
           4.      Drop – off Recycling Centers
           5.      Buy-Back Centers
           6.      Institutional / Office Recycling
           7.      Mobile Collection
           8.      Manual Materials Recovery
           9.      Mechanized Material Recovery
           10.     Landfill Salvaging (removing bulky materials from the water
                   stream)
           11.     Composting
                              35

   2.       Existing and Proposed Hazardous Waste Disposal
            All hazardous waste generated by business, institutions, public agencies
   and households by law must be disposed of in State Department of Health
   Services Hazardous Waste Facilities. These are located in Sacramento, Contra
   Costa, Kings and Santa Barbara Counties only. All businesses, institutions and
   public agencies are required to complete a manifest when hazardous waste
   leaves the site of generation.
            The Tehama County Management Plan estimates that 96.3 tons of
   hazardous waste are generated annually in Tehama County and are shipped to
   off-site facilities. It further estimates that 124 tons of hazardous wasters are
   generated by households each year (estimate 47 tons from the City of Red Bluff).
   There is no monitoring of this waste and virtually all of it is disposed of in garbage
   headed for the County Landfill. The ignorance of households of the potential
   danger of local disposal creates a local environmental hazard, which is not
   monitored by federal or state law. Examples of household hazardous wastes
   include pesticides and herbicides, household cleaners, automotive products,
   paint and coatings, polish, adhesives and sealants and batteries.
            There are six identified hazardous waste contaminated sites in Tehama
   County and 16 sites associated with leaking underground tanks. Two
   contaminated sites affecting Red Bluff are the Louisiana Pacific Corporation
   south of the City and the land previously occupied by the PG&E Gas Plant at the
   northeast corner of Oak and Rio Streets. The Louisiana Pacific site was found to
   have discharged contaminated wastewater and to have failed to register
   underground tanks or remove contaminated soils. Remedial action has been
   taken by the company. Contaminants at the PG&E site in Red Bluff have not yet
   been identified.
            The management plan recommends treatment, storage and disposal
   (TSD) of hazardous wastes in the County. The plan recommends alternative
   practices including: Source Reduction, Recycling, Treatment, Incineration,
   Stabilization, Repositories and Land Disposal. No specific sites were
   recommended for recycling, treatment or disposal (see also the Hazardous
   Waste and Substance Site List published by the State Office of Planning and
   Research.
C. Existing and Proposed Recreation Facilities and Activities
            The City of Red Bluff has 81 acres of recreation land not including public
   school property, undeveloped future recreation sites and various athletic courts.
   The City of Red Bluff Department of Parks and Recreation makes active use of
   most of these spaces and facilities in the Summer season and Fall-Winter-Spring
   season programs. An inventory of recreation facilities and programs is given
   below.
                                        36

activities. They include the swimming pool at the Red Bluff High School;
volleyball and basketball at the High School and Vista School; softball, baseball
and badminton at the High School and soccer at Vista School.
                                     37

2.      Recreation Activities

        Senior Citizens Activities
3.      Other Recreation Opportunities
        The City of Red Bluff is fortunate to be location in a region of abundant
recreational opportunities. In the immediate locale, the Sacramento River offers
opportunities for boating, fishing and viewing boat races. The United States
Department of Agriculture is proposing the development of Lake Red Bluff. The
recreation area will offer swimming, camping, trails, a nature pond and
environmental study area, interpretive facilities, day use and picnic areas,
boating and fishing.
        The City has designated an urban bikeway. It affords an excellent
opportunity for area family cycling. The bikeway is designated along only a
portion of its entire length, however.
        The larger region offer many opportunities for hiking, camping, hunting,
skiing and other activities at Lassen Volcanic National Park.
                                  38
        4.      Expansion of Recreation Opportunities
                A number of sites are proposed for expansion of the City recreation land
        inventory. New City owned sites, which may be improved include the following:
                a.      Spaulding Acres
                                 The old City Dump on Baker Road is the largest vacant
                        City owned tract considered for recreational use. The site may
                        contain dangerous materials, however, and before any use is
                        considered, a full soils and groundwater analysis should be
                        completed. Planning for the site should be coordinated with the
                        City Parks and Recreation Department.
                b.      Forward Park Expansion
                                 A large acreage of floodplain and wooded land lies to the
                        east of Forward Park (not unlike Chico’s Bidwell Park in
                        character). This land is ideal for recreational and day use and is
                        presently used and somewhat abused, informally. Improving
                        trails, providing family picnic sites and limiting off-road vehicle
                        access while improving auto access and managing activities
                        would provide Red Bluff a very significant addition to its park
                        inventory.
                c.      Jackson Heights School Property
                                 A substantial amount of the Jackson Heights School
                        grounds are ideal for recreational purposes. Agreements with the
                        school district for its use will allow expansion of recreational
                        opportunities in a very central location.
                d.      Kraft Playground
                                 The improvement and maintenance of Kraft playground, off
                        Rio Street, is a worthwhile project for the City. The quiet location
                        and river view opportunities make it ideal for day and short-term
                        use for children and downtown workers.
V. EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND PROJECTED DEMANDS
   A.   Existing Educational Facilities
                There is a range of public and private educational programs in the Red
        Bluff urban area. They include public supported education at the following: Red
        Bluff Union Elementary District including Bidwell, Jackson Heights, Matter and
        vista Schools and the campus of Red Bluff Union High School.
                Private education is available at Mercy High and Sacred Heart
        Elementary Schools (Catholic), Community Christian Schools (Baptist), and 7th
        Day Adventist School.
                                            39

B. Enrollments and Projections
   1.       Red Bluff Union School District (K-8)
            From the 1987 / 1988 school year to the close of the 1990 / 19991 year
   the district has shown annual growth of 169, 69, and 77 students. Most of this
   has occurred in the kindergarten and 1st grade levels with lesser average
   increases in 6th and 8th grades. Enrollment figures for the 1991 – 1992 academic
   year show a decrease of 73 students to a total of 2,282 students. There is no
   apparent grade level pattern in the decrease. No particular reason for the
   decrease is clear to the district administration.
            A fair presumption is that local economic conditions have caused the out-
   migration of families with younger children. Assuming that those conditions have
   stabilized in the short-term, then enrollments should also stabilize. Projections
   for elementary public school enrollments are that they will slightly decline and
   level in the next two years.
            Currently, phase II construction at Matteer School is underway and
   existing classroom space needs should be met. The district is responding to a
   northerly shift in student distribution. As the City grows to the north, a school site
   will be required on the north end of Red Bluff. The district is attempting to acquire
   8 acres near Monroe Avenue.
   2.       Red Bluff High School District
            The High School district has shown annual increases in enrollment of
   from 60 to 65 students per year. In 1990 – 1991, enrollments increased by 83
   students 1,790 and in 1991 – 1992, they increased by 134 to a total of 1,924
   students. Increases were noted from feeder schools, but the pattern or causes
   were unclear. It must be assumed that most of the increase was due to
   movement of a larger group into the high school from the 8th grade (44 more than
   the previous year from Red Bluff elementary school alone).
            Assuming the downturn in local economic conditions may have affected
   enrollments overall in Red Bluff, it is not apparent in the High School statistics. It
   is assumed that older children are from families with more job seniority and with
   more transferable skills than younger families and have been less displaced by
   the recession. Assuming the economic conditions stabilize, enrollments for the
   High School District should also stabilize. Numbers of students moving up from
   elementary schools will decline somewhat. The High School District projects an
   additional 60 students form the 1992 – 1993 year.
            The High School District is undertaking a project to construct 1 or 2
   portable classroom on-site for the 1992 – 1993 academic year. These should
   accommodate additional space requirements. In the long term, the District will
   continue to meet its needs for space on the present site or through improvements
   on a 20-acre site it owns in the Antelope area off Trinity Street.
                                      40

3. Private Schools
   a.        Mercy High School (9 – 12)
             In recent academic year, Mercy High School has enrolled between
   100 – 110 students. In the 1991 – 1992 academic year, its enrollment
   climbed to 143. The cause for the increase is not well known to the
   administration. Further increases are not anticipated and additional
   educational space will not be required. Its present capacity for high
   school level education is for approximately 200 students.
   b.        Sacred Heart Elementary School (K – 8 plus Pre-School)
             Enrollments at Sacred Heart Elementary School have increases
   from 125 students in 1986 – 1987 by an annual average of 5 – 8
   students. The 1991 – 1992 enrollment is 150. No significant increase
   was noted during the present academic year nor is it anticipated in the
   next. The K-8 capacity is 225 children and no new facilities are
   anticipated.
   c.        Community Christen School (Pre-School, Day School,
             Kindergarten Campus) (1 – 8 Campus)
             Both campuses of the Community Christian Schools are
   increasing enrollments. Present enrollment in the Cedar at Jackson Pre-
   School / Kindergarten campus is 40 and is projected to 50 – 60 over the
   next 2 – 3 years. Enrollment in the grade 1 – 8 church facility near
   Roundup and Chestnut Streets (near Antelope Blvd.) is presently 80
   students. It is projected to grow to 120 students over the next 2 – 3
   years.
             Growth of the student population at present rates will require
   acquisition of a 10-acre site for construction of a facility to house both
   present campus programs. A site at Willow and Chestnut Streets is
   under consideration. The School anticipates action on expansion during
   educational program to include a secondary school.
   d.        7th Day Adventist School
             The 7th Day Adventist School on South Jackson has a 1991 –
   1992 enrollment of 14 students in the grade 1 – 8 program. Enrollments
   have been stable over the last three years and are expected to remain at
   present levels. The church has adequate space for growth in its present
   facility.
                              41

                     Total 1991 – 1992 Academic Year Enrollments Summary

 VI.    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS FOR GROWTH
        The State of California expects that as a part of the planning process, local governments
can develop and maintain a high quality environment. The adoption, update, or amendment of
a general plan or element constitutes a project under the California Environmental quality Act
(CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines. If any policy (ies) of the adopted plan or element,
individually or cumulatively, may have a significant effect on the environment then the
government must adopt an Environmental Impact Report or Mitigated Negative Declaration.
        The environmental effects of adopting and implementing the Land Use Element of the
City of Red Bluff General Plan are reviewed below and in Appendix “C”. They are presented
directly or by reference to the element section in which the information appears.
        A.      Description of the Project
                1.      Planning Area
                        The City of Red Bluff planning area and sphere-of-influence are described
                on pages 4 and 5 of the element and on the Land Use Diagram. The planning
                area extends well into unincorporated land around the City but describes that
                area which logically may be considered to be related to the economy, social area
                and zone within which land use activates will affect the City. The Sphere-of-
                Influence is the area into which the City logically expects to expand within the
                planning period of ten years and for which the City would seek some coordination
                with the County of Tehama for growth management.
                2.      Growth Goals, Objectives and Policies
                        Goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures are central to
                the project description. They are included within section (Roman) I, D –
                Introduction of the element beginning on page 7 and within section VIII –
                Appendices A, 1, 2 & 3. Goals which have potential environmental impacts are
                those including Goal III. Community Growth and Annexation, Goal IV. Industrial
                Development and Goal V. Central Business Development. Possible
                                                  42

   environmental impacts may result from implementation of various objectives of
   those goals. The objectives are presented below?
   Community Growth and Annexation (See page 8)
   Objective A.    Provide and maintain rural and urban services and facilities of
                   high quality for adequate health, safety and comfort, and
                   educational, cultural and recreational facilities for public benefit
                   and enjoyment.
   Objective B.    Expand the Sphere-of-Influence where appropriate to reflect
                   realistic growth frontiers.
   Objective D.    Promote infill development through incentives to manage
                   community land use balance and increase efficiency of service
                   delivery.
   Objective H.    Direct residential development, under careful site and project
                   design, to areas south of Kimball Road, to the west outside creek
                   floodways and riparian habitat, and to the north, west of the
                   freeway.
   Industrial Development (see page 8)
   Objective A.    Phase appropriate future industrial development to the area south
                   of the municipal airport.
   Objective B.    Direct heavy truck and rail oriented industrial development to the
                   freeway/S. Main St. interchange and Montgomery Road area.
   Central Business Development (See page 9)
   Objective A.    Promote lot assembly and marketing (in the Central Business
                   District).
   Objective C.    Undertake “Main Street” development program (in the Central
                   Business District).
           The Land Use Element also anticipates that environmental impacts will
   occur due to the location and intensity of residential growth. This growth will be
   based on population forecasts in Table 5, page 27, and according to locations
   and intensities outlined in sections III B, Proposed Land use (also see Land Use
   Diagram); III C Proposed Residential Densities: III D, Proposed Commercial and
   Industrial Densities and III E, Implications of Growth for Urban Circulation.
B. Environmental Setting
           The environment setting for the Land Use Element is summarized under
   Section II of the element, Land use Classification and Existing Land Use
   Distribution. Specifically, the appropriate environmental issues regarding
   vegetation, minerals, agricultural resources, aesthetics and recreation are
   presented in the following sub-section: II F, Natural Resource Areas, Floodplains
   and other Resource Areas: IV C, Existing and proposed Recreational Facilities
   and Activities.
           Existing systems of local infrastructure are detailed in several sources
   and sections of the Land Use Element. The best source of infrastructure
                                      43

        information is presented in Master Plan for Infrastructure prepared in 1991 by
        Bryan Murphy. Relevant sections are presented in the Land Use Element in
        Section IV A, Existing and Proposed Water and Sewer Facilities.
                 Transportation facilities, modes and movements are presented in the
        Circulation Element of the City General Plan. They are reviewed and assessed
        summarily in Section II D, Effects of Regional Transportation Access on Local
        Land Use and III E, Implication of Growth for Urban Circulation.
C.      Possible Effects of the Project on the Environment and
        Proposed Mitigations
        One of the purposes of the environmental analysis is to evaluate the degree to
which element objectives; policies or proposals involve commitment of land or lead to
alterations in the physical environment, which result in significant effects.
Unquestionable, the expected growth of the City population (from 12,434 in 1990 to
14,714 in 2000 and the urban area from 16,719 in 1990 to 20,213 in 2000) with
simultaneous development of the economic base and infrastructure for both will have
significant effects on the physical environment (see figure 4, page 26). Individual
projects will require specific assessment of those effects. A summary of the expected
overall effects is listed below:
        1.       Disruption of the Landscape
                 Environmental Effects
                         New land development will inevitably require alteration of the
                 surface soils or geology. The significance will depend on the scale of
                 grading, filling and disruption of the surface. Any significant increase in
                 erosion, siltation, soil compaction, surface instability or loss of prim
                 agricultural soils should be mitigated.
                 Mitigations
                 a.      Implement Community Environment Objective I A to protect prime
                         agricultural land (see page 7).
                 b.      Implement Community Environment Objective I C to incorporate
                         natural site landscape features into project design.
                 c.      Implement Section IV – Grading Policies of the adopted Grading,
                         Drainage and Ground Cover Policies of the Land Use Element
                         (see page 63).
                 d.      Implement Appendix Chapter 70 (Grading) of the Uniform Building
                         Code.
                 e.      Implement appropriate surface development standards provided
                         by Objective I C and the policy adopted as Land Development
                         Policies in Appendix A-1 (see page 55) and Grading, Drainage
                         and Groundcover Policies, in Appendix A-2. See especially
                         subsections IV (see page 63) and VI (see page 65).
                                            44

2.       Impacts on Air Quality
         Environmental Effects
         The air quality effects of increasing the City economic base and
population by over 18 percent in the next ten years will be significant. Air quality
will be degraded along principal traffic corridors, in the downtown and in the
industrial zone along south Main Street. Levels of nitrogen oxides, particulates,
carbon monoxide, ozone and hydrocarbons will be elevated but probably remain
below harmful concentrations. Individual development proposals should provide
models of projected emissions and compare them with applicable air quality
standards.
         Mitigations
         Implement mitigations numbered 10 a, b, f, g, & h recommended below
under Effects on Urban Circulation (see page 47).
3.       Impacts on Water
         Environmental Effects
         The growth and development of Red Bluff during the next ten years is
likely to have substantial effects on surface and groundwater in the area. Effects
will include the following:
         a.      Change in the rate of surface absorption on areas covered by
                 impermeable cover, i.e., roads, driveways, buildings, ect.
         b.      Earth fill of floodplains will alter the course and flow of floodwaters
                 and induce flood potential.
         c.      Cover native and induced wetland areas.
         d.      Change the quantity and quality of ground waters through reduced
                 infiltration of storm water and increased infiltration of surface
                 contaminants resulting from residential, commercial and industrial
                 uses.
         e.      Increase in surface runoff due to increased area runoff coefficients
                 with greater surface impermeability.
         f.      Increased runoff turbidity and siltation discharged into local water
                 systems due to increased surface erosion. Water systems
                 affected will include Red Bank Creek, Reed’s Creek, Dibble Creek
                 and Lake Red Bluff (recreational Sacramento River).
         Mitigations
         a.      Implement Objective I A (see page 7) to discourage development
                 within riparian and wetland areas.
         b.      Implement Objective III H to discourage development within creek
                 floodways and riparian areas.
                                     45

        c.       Implement Land Development Policies Sections II B, (see page
                 56) III C and IV in Appendix A-1, regarding floodways,
                 watercourses, erosion control and storm runoff.
        d.       Implement Grading, Drainage and Ground Cover Policies
                 Sections IV B (see page 63) and VIII B regarding runoff and
                 erosion control.
4.      Impacts on Plant Life and Wildlife Habitat
        Environmental Effects
        The effect of land use development during the planning period is that
substantial amounts of surface vegetative cover will be removed including native
grasses, shrubs and trees. The most notable effect will be the potential loss of
native oak woodland in the rolling hills on the northern porting of the City. The
potential loss of riparian communities must be considered especially along
Reeds, Red Bank, Brickyard, Grasshopper, Brewery, Dibble and Blue Tent
Creeks. Though the potential loss of local native plant and animal communities
may occur, no rare or endangered species in the area should be affected. Loss
of agricultural land will occur Adobe Road and the freeway.
        Mitigations
        a.       Implement Objective I A (page 7) to discourage development in
                 riparian, wet and agricultural areas.
        b.       Implement Objective I B to preserve and replace native trees.
        c.       Implement Grading, Drainage and Ground Cover Policies Section
                 IV A in Appendix A-2 (page 63) to minimize disturbance of riparian
                 and other existing vegetation and Section V regarding vegetation
                 preservation, replacement and new species introduction.
        d.       Implement Land Development Policies in Appendix A-1, Section II
                 B, 3 & 5 regarding tree over and endangered species, III B
                 regarding natural tree cover, and III C regarding development
                 within greenways and floodplains.
5.      Noise Impacts
        Environmental Effects
        The expected growth and development in Red Bluff will increase noise
levels along principal arterials and collector roadways and will expose people to
elevated noise levels along those and the railroad corridors through the
community.
        Mitigations
        a.       Implement Objective III I (page 8) to discourage residential
                 development adjacent to principal roadways, the railroad and the
                 airport.
                                    46
        b.      Implement Objective IV C (page 8) to limit the effects of rail traffic
                and IV D to discourage noise sensitive development on land
                adjacent noise sources.
        c.      Adopt and implement section III D (page 59) of the Land
                Development Policies to set noise buffering standards within
                adopted noise corridors.
6.      Land Use Impacts
        Environmental Effects
        Implementation of the Goals, Objectives and Policies including the
proposed land use distribution will be strictly in accordance with the planned land
use for the City. There will be no conflicts with uses proposed by the County of
Tehama or with other land uses in the vicinity. With the exception of the small
acreage at Abode Road and the freeway, there will be no conflict with agricultural
uses of the land (the policy of the City is not to seek urban expansion onto prime
agricultural lands east of the Sacramento River).
        Mitigations
        None are required.
7.      Natural Resources / Aesthetics Impacts
        Environmental Effects
        The proposed land use element has the potential to degrade scenic
resources in the north Red Bluff area.
        Mitigations
        Implement mitigations listed above under Impacts on Plant Life and
Wildlife Habitat (see No. 4 above).
8.      Population Impacts
        Environmental Effects
        The land use element proposes with allocation of anticipated population
growth in the City. The spatial affects of population growth will be found within
each of the sections of the land use element. The distributional effects are that
growth will take place to the south, west and north of the City. Effects include
demand for adequate public utilities and services in those areas.
        Mitigations
        The goals, objectives and policies of the Land Use element presented in
the Introduction of the element, Implementation Measures found in Section VIII
(Policies Appendix, page 55 – 68) of the element and other measures contained
                                  47

in the City Zone Code, Master Plan for Infrastructure and other plans are
adequate mitigations for population growth effects.
9.      Housing Impacts
        Housing Effects
        The effects of population growth on housing demand are presented in
        Sections III B & C of the Land Use Element. The discussions of
        Proposed Land Use and Proposed Residential Development Densities
        outline expected population and unit densities within all proposed
        development areas of the City Sphere-of-Influence. The particular effects
        on demographic sectors of the community and on government agencies
        are presented in the Housing Element of the General Plan.
        Mitigations
        Mitigations for the environmental impacts of housing growth are
        presented in all other sections of this Negative Declaration.
10.     Effects on Urban Circulation
        Circulation Effects
        The environmental impacts of growth on circulation in Red Bluff are
        addressed in section III E, Implications of Growth for Urban Circulation.
        Nine areas in the community are highlighted for the effects of increased
        traffic volumes. The principal effects are where road design capacities
        will be exceeded, congestion and delays will occur, pedestrian safety
        becomes jeopardized, increased noise, vibration and general hazard
        result. The particular effects are indicated for each area where circulation
        deterioration is expected (see the Circulation element for related effects).
        Mitigations
        a.       Reduce vehicular use of urban arterial and collector streets by
                 increasing density of population in central urban locations.
                 Increase allowable densities in those locations and promote infill
                 development (see Objective III D).
        b.       Centralize heavy truck oriented industry to freeway sites. Restrict
                 cross-town industrial vehicle access to the airport industrial park to
                 lightweight vehicles with infrequent service. To facilitate this,
                 encourage siting of only light industry in the airport industrial park.
                 Implement Industrial Development Objectives IV A & B.
        c.       Work with the California Department of Transportation to provide a
                 freeway access point at Adobe Road. Improve collector access to
                 Adobe Road from Monroe Avenue without degrading the Walton
                 Avenue area neighborhood.
        d.       Improve signalization and traffic signing along the Antelope
                 Boulevard approach to Main Street, at the intersection of antelope
                                   48
                 and Main Streets, at Walton and Monroe Avenues and along
                 Luther and Kimball Roads.
         e.      Reduce the nuisance effects of increased circulation through
                 adoption of a noise corridor overly to the land use diagram setting
                 noise buffering standards along appropriate freeway, highway,
                 arterial and collector roadways, along the SP railroad right-of-way,
                 near heavy industrial sites and in the airport over flight zone.
                 Implement Industrial Development Objectives IV C & D.
         f.      Complete and encourage use of the City bikeway.
         g.      Promote use of public transit within the City.
         h.      Support a program to stagger work schedules for business,
                 industry and government.
11.      Public Services Impacts
         Public Services Effects
         The effects of growth, managed by policies in the land use element, will
include diminished capacities in public utilities and increased demands on
services now provided by the City. The effects on public utilities are outlined in
Section IV A, Existing and Proposed Water and Sewer Facilities in the Land Use
Element. It is noted that present capacities are adequate for the planning period
but that improvements should be implemented.
         The effects of growth on the public education systems are reviewed in
Section V Education Facilities and Projected Demands. Similarly, adequate
capacity exists for projected facility demand.
         The effects of growth on recreation in Red Bluff are minimal. Section IV
C Existing and Proposed Recreation Facilities and Activities in the land use
element addresses the issue. Adequate space and scope of activities will meet
growth in demand with exception of expanding neighborhood on-site needs.
         The effects of population and economic growth on police and fire services
will be significant. The ratio of police officers and fire officials will decrease with
an increase in population. With an increase of about 2,300 person over tem
year, an additional 3 police and 3 fire personnel will be required (1.5 emergency
service personnel per 1,000 population). An increase in 1 – 2 administrative staff
will also be required. Expansion of facilities will be necessary to accommodate
this expansion of personnel, equipment and office requirements.
         The requirements for City administration services will increase with
population growth. Overall staff requirements in Public Works, Community
Development, Recreation and other services will increase at approximately 3
persons per 1000 increase in population. An increase in staff by about 7 person
will be required by 2000. A new City Council Chamber and public meeting hall
has been proposed by the City to permit expansion for necessary new staff and
work space requirements.
         The County Library system serving the City of Red Bluff will have to be
expanded to meet the needs of a growing population. The Tehama County
General Plan outlines requirements for these facilities.
                                    49

Mitigations
        a.      Implement the schedule of development fees and user changes
                proposed in the 1991 Master Plans for Infrastructure, Capital
                Improvement Programs and User Charges and Development
                Fees. The revenues generated by expanded growth will be
                directly related to necessary improvements. User charges ill
                compensate the costs in the existing system public services
                systems. Also see Section VI in Appendix A-1 (page 61).
        b.      New developments should provide for on-site recreation
                opportunities. Children’s play areas and leisure space should be
                a necessary component of subdivision design. See also Section
                V lot or Site Improvements in the Land Use element Land
                Development Policies (page 60).
        c.      Use developer fees to provide for increased public service costs
                outline above.
12.     Energy Impacts
Environmental Impacts
        The growth of population in the City of Red Bluff during the next ten years
will have energy impacts for housing, business, industry and for energy
consumption by additional vehicle commuting, over longer distances and in
longer traffic delay. Increase in energy consumption may be unavoidable but
might be minimized with appropriate mitigations.
Mitigations
        a.      Increase in energy consumption may be mitigated through
                adoption of the recommended mitigations outlined above in
                Negative Declaration Section 10, Effects on Urban Circulation.
        b.      Promote energy conservation through, City, public school and
                energy utility company programs and advisories.
13.     Impacts on Solid Waste Disposal
Environmental Impacts
        The effect of population ad economic growth will be to increase solid
waste generation and reduce capacity of County landfill facilities. A discussion of
the municipal solid waste stream is provided in Land use element Section IV B 1
Existing and Proposed Solid Waste Disposal.
Mitigations
        Solid waste mitigations are presented in the Land use element Section IV
B 1 Existing and Proposed Solid Waste Disposal. The City is encouraged to
continue its Sold Waste Reduction and Recycling Program.
                                   50

   14.      Cultural Resources Impacts
   Environmental Impacts
            Historic riverbanks and bluffs in the Red Bluff area are archeologically
   sensitive. Development in these areas may result in the loss of historical
   resources and site evaluations should preclude approval of any subdivision map.
   Mitigations
            Adverse impacts on cultural resources may be mitigated by requiring site
   review by qualified professional prior to development approval.
D. Cumulative and Unavoidable Impacts
            Cumulative and unavoidable effects of implementation of the Land use
   Element of the Red Bluff General Plan include those, which are a simple function
   of increases in population and business development. Cumulative effects are
   those, which may be limited for any particular development but cumulatively, for
   all proposed development might be significant. All the environmental impacts of
   effects given above are cumulatively significant. Mitigation measures are
   presented to minimize those cumulative effects.
            Unavoidable effects of the implementation of the Land Use element are
   those, which may be mitigated but not unavoided. Certain effects are
   unavoidable and significant. These include the following:
            a.      Increased consumption of open space lands around Red Bluff.
            b.      Increased traffic flow on principal collector streets, arterials and
                    highways. Increased congestion at principal intersections.
            c.      Decreased competitiveness of traditional downtown business and
                    proliferation of roadway and satellite business development.
            d.      Erosion of rural community character.
            e.      Increased cost of government services and facilities.
E. Alternatives to the Proposed Land Use Element
            During preparation of the Land Use element several alternatives for the
   allocation of population and for growth management were considered.
            One growth alternative was to consider extension of the sphere of
   influence and annexation to the east of Red Bluff along the Antelope Boulevard
   corridor. The cost of services and fiscal returns to the City would cause a net
   decrease in the ability to support that development and ensure the health and
   safety of residents.
            A second growth alternative was to increase density of development on
   presently well served, incorporated land to the south of the City. That alternative
   was not desirable due to the lack of demand of higher proportions of apartment
   style housing at that distance from the downtown and without adequate public
   transit.
            A third growth alternative was to permit conventional development in
   accordance with existing zoning in proposed and expected housing development
                                       51
   on the north side of the City. The third alternative would have cost the removal of
   large acreages of native oaks, filling of intermittent drainage channels and the
   loss of significant habitat.
           The fourth alternative is the proposed land use and growth management
   alternative in the Land Use Element, outlined in Sections III B, C and D above.
           The ‘no project’ alternative was not considered since California
   Government requires the periodic updating the City General Plans.
F. Growth-Inducing Impacts
           Population and economic growth in the Red Bluff area are inevitable. The
   purpose of the Land Use element of the general plan is to forecast the magnitude
   and direction that growth will take. There is little in the Land Use Element that
   may constitute an inducement of growth either in magnitude or location.
           The population forecast is a conservative one. Unexpected growth will
   not occur as an outcome of growth projections.
           The distribution of growth proposed in the element will not induce growth.
   The areas of expected growth are those logically expected based on past
   patterns. None of the expected growth will be approved until community utilities
   and services are in place to support them. Existing roadway infrastructure will
   support that growth. No new access roadways are proposed in the element.
                                      52

II. IMPLEMENTATIONS MEASURES
    A.      Adopt and Periodically Update Plan Goals, Objectives and Policies
            Section 65100 of the California Government Code requires that planning
    agencies prepare, periodically review and revise as necessary the general plan. There
    is no mandatory schedule for update of the land use element, although the element
    should be revised and updated regularly. State law provides that the element may not
    be amended more than four times per year, however.
            Traditional procedure is that policies, the information base and the entire content
    of the element be reviewed for update at least each ten years. If the constant updating
    process keeps the plan and elements current, that wholesale update will require little
    effort and expense. Should the plan or elements become out of date and bear little
    relationship to City land development and planning activity, the City will have little basis
    with which to backup its decisions as rational ones based in the security of legal
    consistency.
    B.      Implement Policies for Land Development: Grading Drainage and
            Ground Cover; and Annexation (See Policies Appendix)
            The goals, objective and policies and substantive direction given by the internal
            recommendations of the text of the land use element and Land Use Map must be
            implemented by action of the Planning Commission and City Council.
            Implementation is accomplished through the wise use of the City zoning
            ordinance, subdivision regulations, policies provided in the appendix and other
            City ordinances and standards (see Section D beginning on page 79 below).
                    Plan implementation means simply that these guidelines and standards
            be used to influence or direct consistent, sound decisions regarding land
            development or public improvements.
    C.      Insure Consistency in Planning, Zoning and Within and Between
            Plan Elements
                    Section 65300.5 of the California Government code requires that the
            general plan and its elements comprise an integrated and internally consistent
            and compatible statement of policies. The State Code requires that actions to
            adopt, modify or implement any policy, provision or measure in any element of
            the general plan must be consistent with the policies or provisions contained in
            other elements of the plan. Consistency more narrowly defined requires (1)
            equal status among elements, (2) consistency between elements, (3)
            consistency within any element, (4) consistency between the test of the general
            plan and the land use diagram (map).
                    For general law cities like Red Bluff, the government code further requires
            consistency between zoning and subdivision provisions and those of the general
            plan, especially the land use element (see Government Code Sections 65860
            and 66473.5). Lastly, capital facilities decisions must be consistent with the
            general plan. Government code Section 53090 requires most projects
            undertaken by special districts, including school districts, be consistent with
            zoning and the general plan.
                                              53
      D.   Adopt and Implement Special Land Development Ordinances (Additional to
           Section B Above)
                   The City of Red Bluff should adopt additional regulations and standards to
                   implement the goals, objectives and policies addressed in section I D of
                   the Land Use Element. Suggested ordinances and standards are given
                   below:
           1.      Landscape Easements and Standards
           2.      Noise Ordinance and Sound Attenuation Standards
           3.      Tree Ordinance
           4.      Architectural and Sign Review Ordinance
           5.      Grading Ordinance
           6.      Hillside Development Standards
           7.      Non-Residential Floor Area and Landscaping Standards
           8.      Parking Lot Landscaping Standards

                          1.      LAND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
I.  Overall Housing Densities
            For urban and suburban land use classifications including “R-L”, Residential-Low
    Density; and “R-M”, Residential-Medium Density, the proposed residential densities per
    gross acre of the development site are as follows: (see map, page 6 and proposed
    densities on pages 29-30).
                 A.     “R-L”, Residential—Low Density
                        For urban areas served by City water and sewer systems and for
                        which other urban services are or may be available. The appropriate
                        zoning is R-1, or R-2:
                        Up to 10 Dwelling Units per Acre
                 B.     “R-M”, Residential-Medium Density
                        For urban areas intended for multi-family and apartment dwellings
                        where all urban services and site improvements are available. These
                        areas have been zoned R-3 or R-4:
                        Ten point one (10.1) to 20 Dwelling Units per Acre.
II. Development Pattern
            A layout plan of a proposed development shall be submitted indicating the
    pattern or design of streets, dedications, and other improvements in relation to the
    landscape conditions of the project site. The site topography, drainage pattern, geology,
    soil characteristics, vegetative cover and hydrology will determine the resultant pattern of
    surface grading, improvements and lot layout.
            Two development pattern options are acceptable. One pattern is the traditional,
    uniform development design pattern. The second pattern is a planned development
    pattern which is designed to conform to physical constraints and opportunities afforded
    by the site.
    A.      Uniform Development Pattern
            1.      The City will permit traditional uniform development if all of the following
                    site conditions exist:
                    a.       No natural area in the development exceeding a 10% slope.
                    b.       Absence of 100-year floodplain, natural spring, seasonal stream
                             course or wetland as defined by the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
                    c.       Absence of established natural tree cover or groves of trees the
                             mature individuals of which have trucks diameters exceeding 6
                             inches at 3 feet above ground level.
                                               55

               d.       No evidence of unstable surface or subsurface geology that
                        cannot be stabilized through methods recommended by a
                        qualified professional.
               e.       No evidence of rare or endangered plant or animal species.
               f.       No riparian habitat as delineated on maps or as defined in text
                        adopted by the City.
        2.     Permitted Densities and Design
               Where a uniform development pattern is approved by the City, the
               maximum densities will be allowed, as specified by the appropriate zoning
               district classification.
        3.     Density Bonuses (Affordable Housing)
               In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the environmental
               conservation policies of the land use element and the affordable housing
               requirements of the housing element, density bonuses may be allowed.
               The City may allocate these bonuses as specified by Chapter 4.3 of the
               State Planning, Zoning and Development Law.
               To qualify for affordable housing density bonuses, the development
               proponent must agree to provide all additional bonus units in the form of
               units determined to be needed by the housing element of the general
               plan.
B.      Planned Development Pattern
        A planned development pattern will be required by the City whenever local site
conditions indicate a need for environmental conservation due to an unstable,
hazardous, or ecologically sensitive landscape. Design review by the City will be
required and will be consistent with all policies and standard of the PD use permit
provisions of Chapter 25 of the City regulations.
        1.     Conditions Requiring A Planned Development Pattern
               Where the conditions listed below are found on a project site
               development shall conform to a plan submitted to the Planning
               Commission. This plan shall conform to the City’s Design Review
               Guidelines and Planned Development Use Permit Zoning Regulations.
               The plan shall also include conditions applied to development relating to
               density, grading, land cover, landscaping, improvements, erosion control
               and /or surface restoration.
               a.       Natural area within the project site exceeding 10% slope
               b.       100-year floodplain, natural spring, seasonal stream course or
                        wetland as defined by the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
               c.       Natural tree cover or stands of trees, the mature individual of
                        which have truck diameters exceeding 6 inches at 3 feet above
                        ground level.
               d.       Evidence of highly erodible soils or unstable surface or subsurface
                        geology.
               e.       Evidence of rare or endangered plant or animal species
               f.       Presence on site of a Greenway overlay designated in General
                        Plan or Zoning district text and or maps.
               g.       Presence on site of a Noise Corridor overlay designated in
                        General Plan or Zoning district text and or maps.
               h.       Annexation or Pre-zoning is requested.
                                          56

            2.       Permitted Density and Design
                     Where a Planned Development pattern is approved by the City, the
                     maximum density will be established as specified by the appropriate
                     zoning district and as specified in these Land Development Policies in
                     Part III below (Design Policies for Environmental Conditions Requiring
                     Development Pattern).
III.  Design Policies for Environmental Conditions Requiring Planned Development Pattern
     A.     DEVELOPMENT PROHIBITED IN CERTAIN AREAS:
     Plans must be submitted to the City demonstrating that the following areas will not be
     disturbed:
            1.       Areas with a natural (undisturbed by human activity) slope of 20% or
                     more.
            2.       Areas within a 100-year floodplain as delineated on the current Flood
                     Insurance Rate maps (FIRM) published by the Federal Emergency
                     Management Administration (FEMA).
            3.       Areas within the boundaries of the 100-year flood level of any seasonal
                     stream or drainage-way in number 2 above.
            4.       Areas between the tops of banks of seasonal or year-round creeks,
                     sloughs, streams, drainage-ways or oxbows.
            5.       Areas within wetlands as defined by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
            6.       Areas within riparian habitat or zones as delineated on maps or as
                     defined in text adopted by the city.
            7.       Areas within fifty- (50) feet of the areas described in No. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
                     above.
     Exception: The reason for granting an exception to this standard is to avoid loss of all
            development density if 100% of small lots exist in the areas listed in 1-7 above.
            After making appropriate findings and approving a Planned Development Use
            Permit, the Planning Commission may allow development of the areas listed in 1-
            7 above. Any such areas that are disturbed must be replaced with
            environmentally equivalent systems. The Planning Commission does not have
            the authority to override Federal or State regulations and conditions.
     Subdivision shall not create lots that consist entirely of the area listed in 1-7 above.
     B.     Densities Within Greenways and Wooded Areas
                     Greenways are defined as continuous canopy of woodland, which is
            found along and with varying distance adjacent to storm corridors or wetlands.
            They are dependent upon available groundwater near the surface in these low-
            lying zones. These belts of wooded land are mapped as an overlay to the Land
            Use Map.
                     Wooded areas may be found in upland or other rolling terrain in the
            northern portion of the City where historically grazing or less active use of the
            land has occurred. Coverage is generally continuous with open canopies on
            hilltops and frequently closed canopies in deeper ravines.
                     Where native stands of trees exist and mature individuals have trunk
            diameters equaling or exceeding 6-inches at three-feet above the ground; steps
                                                57
   must be taken in project design and during site improvements to preserve the
   integrity of the stand. Each mature tree should be indicated on the development
   plan and areas of closed crown woodland and of open non-treed area shall be
   indicated.
             In order to preserve established tree cover, to preserve the wooded
   character of the site, the City will require the developer to modify the
   development pattern.
   Cluster Development
                     The City may allow unit development to be clustered at several
             locations, at higher densities in each, to avoid development in tree cover
             that would significantly reduce the wooded character of the site. The
             Commission will review a cluster development plan to insure its
             compatibility with other land development policies.
C. Densities Within Designated Greenways and Floodplains
             Where Greenway or Floodplain overlays have been indicated on the Land
   Use Map, the City will require that part or all of the overlay zone be left
   undeveloped and unimproved. Project plans, designed under the requirements
   of the Planned Development Use Permit, must be submitted. These plans shall
   show drainage, riparian habitat, watercourses, 100-year floodway and floodplain,
   wetland areas, degree of slope, unstable surfaces and areas of other potential
   geologic hazard. The project plans must show how the undisturbed areas will be
   left in their natural state in the development process by creative design or use of
   lower densities.
D. Densities Within Noise Corridors
             A noise corridor overlay is designated for all residential districts through
   which freeways, State highways, or active railway right-of-ways are present. The
   corridor overlay shall require, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, a
   noise buffer between the noise source and occupied structures within the
   proposed development area. Use of the buffer zone will be required to comply
   with the criteria set out in the Noise Element of the Red Bluff General Plan. The
   criteria includes buffer zone dimensions for each affected roadway and railroad
   corridor, and acceptable techniques to be used within the buffers.
                                        58

   59
IV.  Lot Coverage
            For the purpose of increasing rainfall infiltration and reducing storm runoff, a
    minimum percentage of the development lot area should be left in open space.
    Development plans shall be submitted showing the proportion of each development lot,
    which will be left unimproved or with previous surfaces. The portion of this type of area
    is inversely related to development density (Cluster or density transfer sites in Planned
    Development projects will be exempted from these provisions with approval of the
    Planning Commission). The period of each lot, which must remain in pervious open
    space for each zoning density district follows:
            Zoning District           Minimum Open Space
                   R-1                       50%
                   R-2                       40%
                   R-3                       33%
                   R-4                       25%
V.   Lot or Site Improvements
            Development shall conform to Lot or Site Improvement Plans submitted to the
    City. The plans shall show resident workspaces, children’s shaded play area(s) and
    landscaped areas as described below.
    A.      Resident Work Space
                     In each residential development (other than detached single family
            dwellings) an improved exterior work area is required where tenants can perform
            activities unobtrusively. Such activities include washing vehicles without
            obstructing traffic circulation through the parking lot or water spraying other
            vehicles. A space equivalent to the area of one parking space for each four units
            is required unless specified otherwise by the Planning Commission.
    B.      Children’s Play Areas
                     In each residential development, (other than detached single family
            dwellings) a summer-shaded children’s play area is required. The area maybe
            shaded with vegetation (trees/vines) or structures (trellis/roof). The play area
            shall include playground equipment, a sandbox and surrounding free play space
            of at least 900 square feet for each 12 units or faction thereof within a project
            unless specified otherwise by the Planning Commission.
    C.      Landscaping
                     Each project site shall be landscaped with non-poisonous native
            vegetation and native or non-native decorative plants to improve the aesthetics of
            the site.
VI. Fiscal Impact Assessment
            Development will not be subsidized by the City. The City will require that the
    proponents of a development project prepare a fiscal impact analysis identifying the
    short and long term costs of providing City maintenance and services, the short and long
    term revenues to be generated by the project to the City and the net benefit or cost to
    the City.
            In the case of a net cost to the City, the proponents must submit a long-term plan
    for financing the fiscal deficit to the City. The proponents should consider all practical
                                                60

options and be prepared to implement and subsidize those options (e.g. assessment
district, user fee schedules, service district formation, private assumption of debt and
service costs or other mechanisms) to insure a sustained independent responsibility for
the short and long-term costs of the development.
                                          61
             2.      GRADING, DRAINAGE AND GROUND COVER POLICIES
I.  PURPOSE
             The purpose of these policies is to promote site development practices that will
    preserve the natural physical site characteristics of development sites in especially
    sensitive areas of the City of Red Bluff. These include hillsides, greenways, wooded
    areas, streams and drainage-ways. The policies are intended to encourage the use of
    alternative designs, which are less disruptive to those natural areas. They expect that
    as a part of the design and review process, the developer will address physical site
    characteristics. They are intended to proved design guidelines, during the preparation of
    preliminary development plans, to preserve the natural character of new growth sites in
    the City. These policies address issues including maintenance of natural topography,
    vegetation, erosion control and the off-site environmental impacts of development. They
    are not intended to dictate design, rather to promote an environmentally sensitive and
    less costly approach to site planning.
             In the case that existing allowable building densities are in conflict with the
    policies of site conservation, every effort will be made by the City to allow density
    transfer within the site to less environmentally sensitive areas.
             Proponents of development may be permitted, within the site, by use of Planned
    Development Use Permit, through subdivision maps, use permits and variances, to vary
    lot size and placement, street width, improvement’s requirements and waiver of open
    space dedication requirements.
             These policies are intended to supplement existing standards in the City’s Design
    Review Guidelines and Appendix Chapter 70 [Chapter 26 City Code], and Subdivision
    Standards (Chapter 20 and 20A City Code). City staff and the reviewing Planning
    Commission will refer to these combined Policies and Guidelines when reviewing plans
    for proposed development. These policies may affect all existing plans for as yet
    undeveloped lands within the City.
             The City is willing to discuss alternative development strategies including density
    transfer, building clustering, zoning variances and other alternatives to achieve the aims
    set out in this strategy.
II. LEAD STAFF AND PLANS
             The Community Development Department shall act as lead staff to coordinate
    inter-departmental review of development activities subject to these policies. It shall also
    be responsible for monitoring compliance with development conditions that follow from
    the application of the policies.
             As part of the development plan preparation and review process, applicants may
    be expected to submit mapped information regarding physical site characteristics
    including: natural site contours, existing seasonal drainage channels, locations of trees
    with a significant diameter or high density stand, areas of existing erosion, steep slopes
    and significant existing natural wildlife habitat. City staff may require proposed grading
    plans, vegetation removal or replacement plans, run-off abatement and erosion control
    plans, landscaping and maintenances plans or other information to insure compliance
    with imposed development conditions consistent with these policies and standards.
                                                62

III.  APPEALS
              Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) decisions regarding the application of these
      policies and guidelines (including those elsewhere published) may be appealed in writing
      to the appropriate body.
IV.   GRADING POLICIES
              Development shall conform to Grading Plans submitted for city review. The
      grading plans must conform to at least the criteria listed below:
      A.      Existing Site Character: Development shall be designed to minimize cut and fill
              operations, avoid disturbing natural drainage courses, riparian habitat, historic
              resources (e.g., archaeological sites, historic buildings, ect.), scenic qualities and
              existing vegetation where possible.
      B.      Cuts and Fills: Earth cuts and fills shall blend with natural surface contours
              wherever possible. Cuts and fills shall be finished with curved rather than planed
              surfaces. The surfaces of all disturbed areas shall be stabilized. Natural
              contours on unbuilt surfaces shall not be disturbed. Fill materials shall not
              encroach upon floodways, drainage-ways, protected trees, adjacent lots or
              properties, nor may they create unstable or erodible surfaces. Engineered fills
              are subject to approval by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC).
      C.      Embankments: Site design shall not promote surface erosion or earth flows.
              Development shall be designed and graded to assure that the boundaries of lots
              are a safe distance from cut and fill embankments. Long-term responsibility for
              bank stability shall remain with property owners.
      D.      Roads and Building Pads: Roadway alignments and building siting shall follow
              natural surfaces wherever possible. The integrity of grading access and egress
              from the building site and building pads shall be preserved. Right-of-way and
              utility improvements shall follow natural contours where possible.
V.    VEGETATION PRESERVATION, REPLACEMENT AND NEW SPECIES
      INTRODUCTION
 Development shall conform to Vegetation Plans submitted for City review. Vegetation
 preservation and introduction plans shall conform to at least the criteria listed below.
      A.      Preservation: Where surface grading is not required for buildings, facilities or
              improvements consistent with these policies, non-hazardous and desirable
              natural vegetation shall be left undisturbed on the site. Trees or shrubs shall not
              be removed prior to submission and approval of development plans except for
              weed mowing abatement procedures. Development plans, which minimize
              disruption of desirable natural vegetation, are necessary.
              Streets, buildings and utilities must be aligned away from rare or scenic species.
              A mixture of large native trees and young trees must be preserved to assure
              continuation of the species and a balanced landscape as older trees are
              removed during the life of the project.
      B.      Replacement: If natural vegetation is lost or damaged, the same species shall
              be reintroduced to restore original cover as closely as possible. Restore as
              much of the original vegetation character as possible. Native Oak Trees with a
                                                 63
               diameter of 6-inches or more at least 3-feet above grade, if removed for
               development, shall be replaced on or off site with the same species or other
               species approved by the City.
      C.       New Vegetation: New vegetation shall be planted on the development site. It
               shall be established on all surfaces where cuts and fills have been created. Trees
               shall be planted and maintained on sites of new construction or building
               alteration to improve area aesthetics and introduce shade to buildings and
               parking areas.
               1.      Yards: If trees have not been preserved on a residential lot at least two
                       shall be planed in each street frontage yard. In nonresidential yards,
                       trees shall be planted in street frontage yards at not more than 30-feet on
                       center (By comparison, trees on the south side of Walnut St. between
                       Robinson Dr. and Scottsdale Ave. are spaced approximately 30-feet on
                       center).
               2.      Commercial Space: Trees or shrubs shall be planted adjacent to sound
                       attenuation walls and walls of commercial, professional and multi-family
                       residential buildings (This will create visual breaks of the building line).
               3.      Parking Lots: Trees shall be planed in parking lots of an average density
                       of not less than one tree per 3600 square feet (approximately 6—feet on
                       center). The mature crown of the tree shall shade at least 50% of the
                       surface area of the parking spaces. The planter area for each tree shall
                       not be smaller than the area of one non-compact auto parking auto
                       parking space. The trees required in subsection C-4 below (“street right-
                       of-ways”) shall not be included in the count of trees required to conform to
                       this section.
               4.      Street Right-of-Ways: Grass, shrubs and trees shall be planted along
                       right-of-way margins to stabilize soil and inhibit surface runoff (See
                       unplanted cut and fill exposures along north Monroe Avenue and South
                       Main Street). Developers should maintain vegetation until such time as
                       the exposures are stabilized.
               5.      Maintenance of Planted Vegetation: Development Plans shall include a
                       statement that the owner shall be responsible for irrigating planted
                       vegetation species until they become self-sustaining. Drought resistant
                       species shall be planted to insure their long-term survival in area where
                       no permanent irrigation is provided (Lists of recommended species are
                       available in the Community Development Department). Landscape
                       maintenance plans shall be prepared by a qualified professional.
VI.   DRAINAGE
Development shall conform to Drainage Plans submitted for city review. Drainage plans shall
conform to al least the criteria listed below.
      A.       Natural Drainageways: Natural stream channels, floodways, drainageways and
               riparian habitat shall be unaltered by grading. The storm water run-off capacity
               and the riparian water retention characteristics shall be left intact to maintain the
               natural hydrologic characteristics of the site.
                                                 64

     B.      Run-off and Erosion Control: Run-off calculations, the design of drainage works
             and water retention or diversion systems shall be prepared by qualified
             personnel. Any construction or grading, which causes damming of storm run-off,
             including water retention or erosion control shall be reviewed by the City.
             Drainage calculations shall include an analysis of impacts on off-site
             drainageways, especially the likelihood of erosion or siltation. The analysis shall
             include recommendations for natural, alternative, and erosion control measures.
             These measures shall be designed by qualified personnel. Recorded easements
             will be required if artificial subsurfaces facilities or diverted surface drainage
             cross property lines.
             Where induced run-off is diverted into artificial underground drainage systems,
             the developer shall restore the natural condition of the surface drainageway. No
             construction, except engineered, artificial, underground drain systems, shall be
             designed for the drainageway and a easement shall be established on the
             affected private lots.
     C.      Materials and Methods: Developers must use vegetation and natural materials
             within drainageways in the design of erosion control and drainage features.
             Concrete and metallic materials may be used when a qualified professional
             demonstrates that vegetation, rocks, gabions and other natural material will not
             effectively control erosion.
             Creation of undrained areas outside natural drainageways through building and
             grading practice is not allowed. Residual fill materials moved to development site
             perimeters often have this effect and will not be permitted.
     D.      Debris: Owners must remove abandoned vehicles, vehicle parts, building
             components, construction materials, pollutants and other non-natural debris from
             the development site and within drainageways (see section IV B regarding
             recycling inert waste for erosion control).
VII. General Provision and Exceptions
     Applicability: These policies apply to grading activities and vegetation and drainage
     issues regardless of whether a project is exempt from provisions of the Uniform Building
     Code, Appendix Chapter 70.
     Gravel extraction may be permitted in natural drainageways, (with approved excavation
     permits). If performed in a manner that conforms to plans and/or studies approved by
     local, State or Federal government agencies (by example, the State Department of
     Water Resources encourages excavation in the Reed’s Creek bed to increase flow
     capacity).
     Responsibility for planting and maintaining vegetation until the site is sold remains with
     the developer. After the site is sold, the owner is responsible for maintaining vegetation
     in a manner approved by the City.
                                                 65

      The City may require an EIR or an expanded initial study to address these policies or
      standards in any land subdivision or development and for reference during the mitigation
      monitoring process.
VIII. Suggested Implementation Measures
      Grade Retaining Facilities: To protect vegetation from adjacent fill or excavation, the
      developer is encouraged to construct retaining wall devices or stabilized banks near the
      vegetation.
      Erosion Control: The developer is encouraged to use vegetation and natural materials
      to inhibit erosion (see VI C above). (He/She is encouraged to use gabions, retention
      basins, low profile check dams, wood crib walls and brash wiers to retain run-off and
      reduce erosion from the site.) the California Department of Water Resources or other
      qualified personnel may provide useful direction in this regard.
      Sloping Lots: Construct homes with stepped foundations and wood floors. Also,
      construct detached or attached garages or accessory buildings with floor elevations at
      local grade and not necessarily at house floor elevation. To minimize grading and
      impervious cover, construct common driveways to serve more than one lot. Provide at-
      grade driveway access.
      Construct two-story or split-level structures to reduce building “footprint” size.
      Cluster buildings or increase lot densities on level terrain to reduce densities on steep or
      heavily vegetated land. This would require Public Works and Public Safety Department
      approval.
      Building pads should be graded immediately prior to construction rather than during
      initial phases of the project to minimize erosion due to long exposure of soil to wind and
      rain.
      Reference Material: Developers may wish to consult with documents listed below
      (copies available at City Hall):
                   Controlling Erosion on Construction Site; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
                   Conservation Service, Agriculture Information Bulletin 347.

                                        LAND USE ELEMENT
                                  INTERIM ANNEXATION POLICIES
AREA REQUISITES
        Before the City will consider annexation, the prospective area shall quality by virtue of its
location and demographic attributes. Applications for annexation will first be reviewed by the
City for conformance with the following:
               1.       The proposed annexation area shall constitute a geographic unit. It shall
                        be defined by streets, continuous urban development that is consistent
                        with Red Bluff Policies and Standards, adequate surface drainage and
                        adequate access to area public services. All property shall have street
                        access.
               2.       State law requires that the proposed area must lie within or adjacent to
                        the City Sphere-of-Influence. Prior to annexation it must be brought
                        within the Sphere.
               3.       The area must support urban densities comparable to or greater than
                        those found within the lowest densities in the City.
AREA ENVIRONMENTAL AND FISCAL ASSESSMENT
        The City will require the proponents of annexation to submit environmental and fiscal
assessments of impacts on the City and the area environment, facilities and services.
Proponents of annexation should pay the cost of preparation of the following supporting
documents:
               1.       Environmental Impact Report
                        The City will require that the area residents finance a professional
                        environmental report, contacted through the City of Red Bluff. The EIR
                        be focused on the effects of annexation on agricultural land conversion,
                        water quality, on resource impacts, and other impacts identified by the
                        City.
               2.       Fiscal Impact Analysis
                        The City will require that the proponents of an annexation prepare a fiscal
                        impact analysis identifying the short and long term costs of infrastructure
                        improvements, urban services, facilities and maintenance. The analysis
                        will include the short and long term revenue to be generated by the
                        proposed annexation and the net cost or fiscal benefit to the City.
                                                   67
                        In the case of a net cost to the City, the proponents will submit a long-
                        term plan for financing the fiscal deficit to the City. The proponents will
                        consider options and be prepared to implement and subsidize options
                        such as creating assessment districts, user fee schedules, service district
                        formation, private assumption of debt and services costs or other
                        mechanism to insure a sustained local responsibility for the costs of
                        annexation.
URBAN IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
        The City will impose infrastructure and urban facilities improvements standards similar to
those required in the City subdivision and development approval process, including dedications,
exactions and impact fees within the area of proposed annexation. The proponents will also be
required to finance the infrastructure improvements to levels of City standards under a phased
development agreement with the City. Such infrastructure and improvement could include
streets, water, sewer, flood protection, fire protection, conformance to City street signing,
lighting, naming and numbering, recreation facilities, nuisance abatement and correction of local
conditions, which threaten public health. These will include correction or mitigation of
substandard housing, accumulation of trash or debris, abandoned vehicles or junk, non-
conforming uses and other nuisances or hazardous conditions.
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS
        Prior to approval of an annexation application, proponents must comply with all
necessary procedural requirements. These will include the following:
                1.      Proponent will apply to prezone the area consistent with the City General
                        Plan.
                2.      Proponents will submit copies of all county service agreements,
                        development agreements and statements of area fiscal liability.
                3.      The City will require the proponents to provide for mitigation of the effects
                        of annexation without recourse to statements of overriding consideration.
                                                  68

                                     I.  INTRODUCTION
A.    General Description of the Element
        The Natural Environment Element is a collaboration element that fulfills the
statutory requirements of both the Conservation and Open Space Elements. The
purpose and intent of this collaboration is to provide the reader with a more
comprehensive and holistic view of the natural environment in the City of Red Bluff.
        The Conservation and Open Space elements address issues that are either
directly or indirectly related. This interrelationship fostered the need and ability for the
element. Although there are no State guidelines for a Natural Environment Element,
there are individual statutory guidelines for both the Conservation and Open Space
elements. Those requirements were the basis for this element, and were carefully
examined and addressed in order to secure the legal viability of this element.
B.    Statutory Responsibilities / Requirement of the Element (s)
        The Conservation and Open Space Elements are required to address certain
mandatory issues. In general, the Natural Environment Element should address issues
relating to: vegetation, wildlife, water resources, soil resources, atmospheric resources,
mineral resources and open space. The preservation, conservation and managed
production of these resources is a fundamental part of the element.
        A more detailed summary of the statutory responsibilities and requirements of
Conservation and Open Space Elements is presented in Appendix a.
C.    Internal Consistency
        It is mandated by California State Law that, “…that the general plan and
elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible
statement of policies for the adopting agency (Governor’s Office of Planning and
Research 1992, 24).”
        In order to comply with the internal consistency statute and to increase general
effectiveness of the element, all existing plan elements (Circulation, Housing and Land
Use) were reviewed. Relevant goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures
provided by the three updated elements were incorporated into the Natural Environment
Element and are indicated with underlining. The Noise and Safety Elements are
currently being updated, and so they were unavailable for review and inclusion.
D.    The Natural Environment Element as a Planning Tool
        Once the Natural Environment Element is adopted by the City Council, it
becomes law. In turn, all the policies, programs and implementation measures cited in
the element become legally enforceable. It is important that elements be thoroughly
reviewed before adoption so that it reflects the needs of the community once it becomes
law.

        In order to be effective, the guidelines set forth in this element must be
implemented. It is the responsibility of local decision makers and the City staff to ensure
that these guidelines are followed. Each section of this element is concluded with an
executive summary, followed by a set of goals, objectives, policies and implementation
measures. These are the tools for implementation and are therefore the responsibility of
the City.
        The physical environment and needs of a community are constantly changing.
This element should be dynamic to ensure it reflects theses changes and maintains its
effectiveness as a planning tool. This can be accomplished through periodic review and
revision.
        A list of related case laws and other planning laws that maybe used to enforce
this element can be found in Appendix B.
                               NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                    II.   VEGETATION
 A.   Introduction
         There are a three general vegetation types/habitats found naturally in the Red
Bluff Planning Area. These include: riparian corridor, oak woodlands (which include
upland areas with valley grasslands mixed with shrubs and scattered oaks), and
wetlands.
 B.   Oak Woodlands and Valley Grasslands
         The oaks in California are geographically distributed in fifty-two of the fifty-eight
counties in the State and comprise a latitudinal distance of more than eight degrees
(Allen, 1990,pg 22). These habitats range from the low Mojave Desert slopes to the high
western ridges of the Klamath Ranges. This variation in spatial distribution is reflective of
the great diversity in oak woodland habitats (Griffin and Muick, 1990, 6).
         There are sixty species of oaks (Quercus) that occur in the United States. There
are nineteen species of Quercus that are endemic to the State of California. Of these:
ten are tree oaks and nine are shrub oaks There are also twenty-one hybrid species of
Quercus that occur naturally in California (Griffin and Muick, 1990, 4).
         The most prevalent species of oaks founding the Red Bluff Area is the Blue Oak
(Quercus Douglasii), Live Oak (Quercus Wislizenii), Valley Oak (Quercus Lobata) and
Canyon Live Oak (Quercus Chuycalepis). Valley and Live Oaks are often associated
with riparian areas. In Red Bluff, species of Blue Oaks (woodlands) normally dominate
the upland slopes adjacent to riparian areas.
         In general, Blue Oak woodlands are dominated by Blue Oaks and are often
interspersed with other Oak species in valley areas. Soil type and slope determine the
morphology of the woodland. The canopy is usually divided into tow stories with the
tallest containing oaks from 15 to 45 feet in height. Average girth rages from 8 to 12
inches in diameter at four above the base (Department of Water Resources 1991, 39).
         There are many definitions of Oak woodlands, and for the purposes of this
element, the City should use the definition cited below. This definition was presented in
the Department of Water Resources study entitled, Sacramento Valley Westside
Tributary Watershed Erosion Study, Reed’s Creek Watershed. The study was prepared
in 1991 and is reflective of the oak woodlands located within the City. The definition is
divided into three categories based on canopy cover, and they are as follows:
         “Blue Oak Woodland (40 percent and greater tree cover). These areas are
         characterized by natural or nearly natural stands of Blue Oak. The trees are
         evenly distributed and undisturbed by harvesting activity.

        Blue Oak Woodland (15 to 40 percent tree cover). These areas are
        predominantly mixed woodland and grassland. Tree stands are irregular and
        patchy; hill crowns are commonly bare of trees, and trees are most abundant on
        steep slopes and in gullies and ravines. Many places show evidence of selective
        cutting.
        Blue Oak Woodland (0 to 15 percent tree cover). These areas are predominantly
        woodland converted to grassland with very spare stands of Bluff Oak remaining.
        Some natural savannahs are included (Department f Water Resources 1991,
        40).”
        Valley grassland in Red Bluff normally occur on the upland periphery of riparian
areas and function as a transition zone between riparian and oak woodland habitats.
These areas consist of annual and perennial grasses and forbs. Scattered individual
species of oaks are also common in these grasslands (Department of Water Resources
1991).
        There is a strong interrelationship between wildlife and oak woodland and
grassland habitat. It has been estimated that there are currently 5,000 species of
insects that utilize oak trees in California. Of these, approximately 1,000 are dependent
upon the oaks for survival. There are fifty-eight species of lizards, snakes and
amphibians that are associated with oak habitat. One hundred and five species of
mammals depend on the oak woodlands as resource for their survival. Nearly all of the
State’s game species can be included in that number. Birds also utilize the habitat
provided by the oak trees. In fact, it has been estimate that approximately 170 species
of birds use these habitats at some point in their life span (Griffin and Muick, 1990, 5).
        The oak trees, both in stands and singly, provide many important functions in the
environment. Beyond the provision of wildlife habitats, oaks; “[…] aid the cycling of
nutrients, help prevent soil erosion, protect water quality on watersheds, purify the air we
breathe, provide income from sale of hunting rights and wood products, enhance
property values and attract tourist.” These oaks are considered a valuable part of the
State’s heritage and yet only 48% of the planning agencies in the State have adopted
tree protection ordinances (Whittington, 1991, 20 & 22).
        The Blue Oak, Valley Oak and Live Oak are of special concern in California for
several reasons. One of the major concerns is the difficulty they have in regeneration.
Another reason is the continued loss of habitat due to grazing and cultivation
(Department f Water Resources 1991).
 C.   Riparian Corridors
        The City of Red Bluff is contained within the watershed of the Sacramento River.
The Sacramento Basin covers an area of approximately 22,000 square mile and
discharges an estimated 17,870,000-acre feet of water a year (from the lower
Sacramento River) (Warner and Hendrix 1985, 3.8).
        Riparian systems are a cumulative term that refers to the riparian areas and the
associated plant and animal life. For the purposes of this element, the definition
provided by Warner and Hendrix, 1985 (Department of Fish and Game) will be used.
The definition is as follows:

         Riparian Systems “[…] are terrestrial sites where water, transported in from
         another place, accumulates sufficiently in the soil and other terrestrial substrates
         to potentially permit the growth of mesic (requiring medium to high soil moisture)
         terrestrial plants and associated animals […] the riparian zone itself is bounded
         on the inner side by the aquatic zone itself saturated soils and hydrophytic plants
         and on outer side by the drier soils and xeric plants of the upland zone (Warner
         and Hendrix 1985, 3.1).”
         It is estimated that there are currently between 600,000 and 1 million linear miles
of riparian habitat in the State of California. This estimate was derived from the analysis
of watercourse data for USGS 1:24,000 topographic maps. In general, the riparian zone
extends from the watercourse to the 100-year floodplain. These are several physical
attributes, which influence the type and extent of the riparian habitat (Warner and
Hendrix 1985, 3.1).
         The tree major influences in the formation and structure of riparian habitat are:
geomorphology, climate and hydrology and ecological interrelationships. The
morphology of the land directly influences the characteristics of the riparian area by
affecting the watercourse (and flow), erodibility, and associated vegetation. Location
also influences which species will utilize the habitat area. Climate and hydrology affect
the system by altering soil moisture, sunlight availability (photosynthesis capability hence
biomass productivity), and the formation and perpetuation of microclimates within the
system. The ecological interrelationships of riparian habitats can be very different from
the surrounding (upland) areas. In fact, the species associated with these habitats do no
always coincide with the natural distribution of flora within California (Warner and
Hendrix 1985, 3.16-17). Riparian habitat areas (when undisturbed) provide a corridor for
wildlife. An example of this is the important role riparian areas play in the migration of
waterfowl (e.g. the Pacific Flyway).
         The extensive riparian areas in the City of Red Bluff naturally provide a lush and
diverse habitat for many species of plants and animals. There are seven streams, which
run through the Red Bluff Planning Area: Red Bank Creek, Grasshopper Creek, Reed’s
Creek, Brickyard Creek, Brewery Creek, Dibble Creek, Blue Tent and their tributaries.
All of these tributaries drain into the Sacramento River from the west. To the east:
Paynes Creek Slough, Samson Slough and East Sand Slough offer areas of potential
riparian habitat.
         Riparian systems provide many environmental and social values. It has been
state that, “[…] no ecosystem is more essential to the survival of the nation’s fish and
wildlife […and that…] western riparian ecosystems contain approximately 42 percent of
the mammal species of North America, 38 percent of the reptiles, and 14 percent of the
breeding birds…(Warner and Hendrix 1985, 408).” A list of these and other species
potentially found in Red Bluff can be located in appendices D, E, F, G and H. Additional
values include: shading (for adjacent watercourses), bank stability (erosion prevention),
organic input (and biomass), and habitat for aquatic insects, recreation, and scientific
and economic values.

 D.    Wetlands
         Wetlands are transitional habitats between an aquatic and terrestrial environment
where the water table is at or near the ground surface or the ground is covered by
shallow water (Stokes et al 1989, 22). There are many different definitions for wetlands.
The definition provided in the Federal Manual for identifying and Delineating
Jurisdictional Wetlands will be utilized for the purpose of this element. This definition
should also be used for future studies (and surveys) performed by the City unless an
updated version or other definition is deemed more appropriated by the City.
         The definition was chosen based on its merits as a Federally accepted definition.
It is endorsed by four Federal Agencies, including: The United State Fish and Wildlife
Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Army (Army Corp of
Engineers), and the Soil Conservation Service.
         The definition is, “Those areas that re-inundated or saturated by surface or
groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in
saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and
similar areas (Wetland Training Institute 1989, 4).” For more detailed guidelines refer to
the Federal Manual for identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands.
         The term ‘wetlands’ encompasses a diverse collection of habitats, which include:
tidal flats, freshwater marshes, mangrove swamps, prairie potholes, peat bogs, cypress
swamps, riparian wetlands, and vernal pools (Stokes 1989, 22 and Lollock et al 1988,
25-31). The habitat type varies with geographic occurrence. Some of the factors, which
influence habitat type, include: proximity to the ocean, type of climate, and relation to
inland water body and soil type. Two types of wetlands occur within the Red Bluff
Planning Area: riparian wetlands and vernal pools.
         The riparian wetland habitat is found in areas dominated by short (scrub/shrub)
and tall (forested) hydrophytic vegetation, which have a minimum of 25% canopy cover
(when foliage is present). These habitats are often associated with permanent and
intermittent lakes, rivers and streams. Examples of typical plant species that dominate
such habitats are, Western Sycamore, Alder, Willow, California Bay, Cottonwood,
California Blackberry, Salmonberry, Gooseberry, Wax-myrtle, Black Walnut, Box Elder
and Twinberry (Lollock et al, 1988, 25).
         The riparian wetland provide habitat for an, “[…] unusually high number of fish
and wildlife species (Lollock et at 1988, 25).” Some species depend on the riparian
wetland during different stages of their livers, while others may spend their entire life
within the habitat. Approximately 50% of the state and federally listed endangered and
threatened fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals rely on riparian wetland.
         Many species of birds depend on riparian wetland for, “[…] perching, roosting
and nesting substrate […and they also provide...] refuges and migratory corridors
(Lollock et all 1988, 25).” Fish rely on riparian wetlands for, “[…] cover […] spawning
substrate, regulation of water temperatures, and riparian wetlands provide terrestrial
organisms with a cool environment, and a reliable, easily recognizable water source.

         In addition, riparian wetlands provide humans with a variety of recreational
activates including, fishing, hunting, bird watching, nature study, picnicking, and hiking.
        Vernal pools are seasonal wetlands, which are associated with the
Mediterranean climate region of California (Lollock at al 1988, 31). There are only four
other areas in the world that share this type of climate: Western Australia, the
Southwestern corner of South Africa, Central Chile, and the Mediterranean Basin. The
general characteristics of this climate are mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.
Vernal pools correspond to this climate by collecting water in the winter months and then
shrinking and drying in the summer months.
        Vernal pools not only require specific climatic conditions, but also require a
certain combination of topography and soils. The topography is usually level plains
dotted with small, shallow basins or depression. Below the surface there is normally an
extensive impervious layer, which permits the water to gather and remain for long
periods of time. The weather and temperature will affect the duration of this inundation.
The soils associated with this type of habitat are hydric and very fragile (Gustafson, SS
1990).
        Vernal pools, like riparian wetlands, provide habitat for a number of both state
and federally threatened and endangered species. Examples of these species include,
“[…] frogs, toads, salamander, […], aquatic insects, [...], and plants of plants (Lollock et
al 1988, 31).” Migratory waterfowl such as: Black-neck Stilts, Avocets, greater and
lesser Yellowlegs, Egrets, Herons, and smaller dabbling ducks, utilize the resources
provided by this type of habitat. Vernal pools provide such a delicate and rare balance
of physical attributes, that entire orders of invertebrates are found only in these
environments (Lollock et al 1988, 31).
        Although these habitats provide valuable resources, they have and continue to
be destroyed at an alarming rate. There have been many estimates as to statewide
losses, however, it is generally accepted that these were originally 3—5 million acres of
wetland habitat in the state. Today, that number has been reduced to less than 500,000
acres. This figure includes flooded agricultural lands, which do not provide the abundant
values for wildlife as available in naturally occurring wetlands (Lollock et at 1988, 21).
        The destruction of wetlands in California has been the result of a variety of
human induced activity. At present, the three main causes of habitat destruction in the
state are, “[…] 1) conversion of inland managed wetlands to intensive agriculture and
changes in crop practices; 2) urban, industrial, and port development on the coast of
San Francisco Bay; and 3) channellization and ongoing maintenance of flood control
channels (Lollock et al 1988, 21).”
        Wetland habitat loss and degradation has placed immense pressure on the
species of flora and fauna, which depend on wetlands for food, shelter and breeding
grounds. The Tule Elk was completely eliminated from areas due to such habitat loss
and also due to over hunting (Lollock et al 1988, 21). There are approximately 24
animal species and several plant species that are listed as endangered, rare or
threatened because of the loss of statewide wetland habitat. The remaining wetlands in
the Central Valley provide wintering habitat for 60% of the waterfowl utilizing the Pacific
Flyway (Lollock et al 1988, 21).

       The overwhelming environmental, social and economic benefits associated with
wetlands is the basis for giving them special consideration during the planning process.
Their continual destruction and rapid extinction reinforces the need for protection.
  E. Executive Summary
        The existing native vegetation in the Red Bluff Planning Area provides
environmentally and socially valuable resources for the community. These areas
provide diverse and ecologically rich habitats for wildlife (including some endangered
and threatened species), protect the soils from erosion, increase groundwater
percolation, maintain water quality, and provide recreational and aesthetic resources for
the public.
        The majority of the City’s natural vegetation occurs within and along stream
corridors and adjacent upland areas. The exception to this, is the potential wetland
(vernal pool) habitat areas located in the southwest section of the Planning Area,
surrounding the Airport. Both the riparian corridors and wetland habitat areas are
sensitive to development and are continually threatened by urban intrusion. It is vital to
the maintenance of the current environment and standard of living that the City protects
and preserves these areas. In order to achieve this, decisive regulation must begin
today.
        Currently, the Greenway and floodplain overlay zones (established in the Land
Use Element) provide protection oak woodlands and riparian habitat areas. The goals,
objectives, policies and implementation measures set forth below are intended to
provide more extensive regulation and guidelines for these resources. In order for these
guidelines to be effective, decision makers must consider and incorporate these into
each land use decision. The directly reflect their effectiveness as planning tools.
                                            Goals
   Preserve the remaining oak woodlands and individual native species of trees in the

                       NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                  III.  Wildlife
A.     Introduction
       The Red Bluff Planning Area includes extensive tracts of urbanized land,
which have replaced mush of the natural habitat that once existed. The majority of
wildlife found within the Planning Area occurs in the waterways that bisect the area
and in the three vegetation types discussed in the prior section: Oak woodlands
and grasslands, riparian corridors (and greenways), and wetlands. These diverse
habitats provide areas for breeding, nesting, feeding and shelter to a multitude of
species. The following section briefly discusses the species of wildlife that are
commonly associated with the habitat types found in Red Bluff.
B.     Red Bluff
           1) Birds
             Riparian and wetland habitats provide important feeding grounds for
migratory species of birds. These areas offer food, protection from the sun and
predators, water and breeding grounds. Species that can be found in these areas
are: the Great Blue Heron, Brown-headed Cowbird, Osprey, Black-shouldered Kite
and several species of Swallows. The Sacramento River is also a foraging area for
the Bald Eagle; a federally listed endangered species (USDA Forest Service 1990,
111-4).
             Oak woodlands and associated savannah areas provide foraging
habitats for bird of prey species, including Hawks and Kites. Several species of
ground nesting birds also utilize this habitat type. Examples of these birds include:
the White-Crowned Sparrow Western Meadowlark, and Ring-necked Pheasant.
For a comprehensive list of potential species of birds in the Red Bluff Planning
Area see Appendix C.
             The Tehama County General Plan recognizes two species of birds
whose habitat areas are included in the North I-5 planning area, which
encompasses the City of Red Bluff. Although the habitat area may not be
contained within the Red Bluff Planning Area, the information may still prove
useful. The two species of birds are; the Wild Turkey and the Sandhill Crane. The
maps delineating their habitat areas are available at the Tehama County Planning
Department.
           2) Fish
             The Sacramento River flows through the Planning Area from the north
to the south. The river itself provides an important habitat and breeding area for
several species of fish. These species include; the federally listed endangered
species of Chinook Salmon, Steelhead Trout, Striped Bass, King Salmon,
American Shad, and White Sturgeon (Department of Water Resources 1984, 7 and
Tehama County Planning Department 1983, 11-44).
             The Westside tributaries and eastside sloughs of the Sacramento River
also provide important habitat areas for different species of fish. The majority of
the fish that utilize these waters however, are non-game species such as Suckers.
The headwaters of the larger tributaries maybe periodically used game fish
(Salmon, Trout, ect). For a more comprehensive list of fish species found in the
Sacramento River and its tributaries, see appendix D.
           3) Insects
             There are a variety of insects associated with each of the major habitat
types found in the Red Bluff Planning Area. The aquatic insects of the riparian
systems play an important role in the food chain (Warner and Hendrix 1991, 4.26).
The most notable insect in Red Bluff however, is the Valley Elderberry Longhorn
Beetle.
             Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle (Desmocerus Californicus
Dimorphus) is currently listed as a federally threatened species. The California
Department of Fish and Game’s Natural Diversity Data Base identified a
community of beetles along the Sacramento River where it bisects Interstate 5.
This location is discussed at further length in the Endangered Species Section of
the element.
           4) Mammals
             Species of deer, beaver, mice, squirrels and bats are often associated
with the riparian and wetland habitat areas in Red Bluff (USDA Forest Service
1990 and Warner and Hendrix 1991). A comprehensive list of potential species of
mammals found in Red Bluff is located in appendix E.
           5) Reptiles
             There are approximately twenty species of reptiles associated with the
riparian habitat found along the Sacramento River. The Westside tributaries of the
Sacrament River (specifically; Blue Tent Creek, Dibble Creek, Brewery Creek,
Brickyard Creek, Reed’s Creek and Red Bank Creek) provide some type of habitat
for over thirty species of reptiles. See appendix F for a species list.
           6) Amphibians
             The riparian habitat areas in Red Bluff provide optimal conditions for a
variety of amphibian species. These species utilize riparian habitats for different
phases of their lives; some even spend their entire life cycle within the habitat. A
species candidate list for amphibians that may be found within the Red Bluff
Planning Area may be found in appendix G.
C.     Executive Summary
             The City of Red Bluff constitutes over 7.5 square miles of land. The
majority of this land is urbanized or will be in the future. The existing wildlife in Red
Bluff is dependent on remaining areas of natural habitat. The proper administration
of the goals, objectives, policies and implementations measure of this section and
the Vegetation section are imperative to the maintenance of these populations.

              It is the responsibility of the City to ensure that the guidelines of this
  element are enforced and that the existing wildlife is protected.
                                            Goals
   Protect remaining populations of native wildlife in the Red Bluff Planning Area.
   Preserve existing wildlife habitat areas, including; Oak woodlands, valley
    grasslands, riparian areas, and wetlands.
   Conserve and improve groundwater, natural habitat, mineral, aesthetic, soil and
    air resources in the Red Bluff Planning Area (Land Use Element).
                                          Objectives
   Prevent the extinction of wildlife species in the Red Bluff Planning Area.
   Maintain, improve and where possible increase habitat areas in the Red Bluff
    Planning Area.
   Encourage the preparation of a local species list, which incorporates location,
    status, and extent of occurrence.
                                           Policies
    Encourage projects that minimize the impact on habitat areas.
   Encourage the sharing of information regarding wildlife between the public and
    private developers.
   Promote infill and cluster developments in existing urban areas, and direct
    growth out of habitat areas.
   Promote infill development through incentives to manage community land use
    balance and increase efficiency of service delivery (Land Use Element).
   Encourage urban creek restoration (Land Use Element.)
   Discourage further development on prime agricultural soils and within riparian
    habitat, woodland, scenic areas and designated wetlands to preserve urban area
    environmental resources (Land Use Element).

                             Implementation Measures
 Require a wildlife survey for all projects located in a potential habitat area and
  require that the findings of the survey be incorporated into the decision making
  process.
 Restrict development in areas where special (endangered or threatened) species
  of animals have been located.
 Provide development incentives for projects, which incorporate habitat protection
  into project design.

                           NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                IV.   Endangered Species
 A.   Introduction
        The purpose of this section is to address the location and type of special species
of plants, mammals, fish, birds and insects in the Red Bluff Planning Area. The
existence of these species is already threatened and it is therefore imperative that they
be addressed during the planning process.
 B.   Natural Diversity Data Base
        IN 1989, the California Department of Fish and Game converted the Natural
Diversity Data Base to a Geographic Information System (GIS). The computing
platform is made up of Hewlett-Packard computers and HP-UX (UNIX) operating
system. The software is Genamap, which is a vector-based GIS. The Genamap
software handles the graphic and geographic functions. The textual information is
handled by Oracle, a relational data base manager (Department of Fish and Game
1992).
        The NDDB provides information concerning special plants, animals and natural
communities throughout the State. The cartographic base is modeled after the USGS
1:24,000 topographic quadrangles. The City of Red Bluff Planning Area is covered in
two quadrangles: Red Bluff East and Red Bluff West. The maps are mylar overlays and
they are accompanied by descriptive text. The maps and text are property of the City
and may be found at the Planning Department.
        There were a total of seven species identified on the two overlays. Three of
these species occurred in the Planning Area, and two were just outside the periphery.
The description, including location for these five occurrences is presented below.
 C.   Natural Diversity Date Base Listings
        The following descriptions are taken from information provided by the
Department of Fish and Game’s NDDB. These listings were current as of May 6, 1992.
Northern Hardpan Vernal Pool – is one of the occurrences located just outside the
Planning Area. It is currently not rated on either a Federal or State level. It is located on
the Red Bluff West USGS quad, immediately southwest of Bidwell Airport, along
Paskenta Road. There is approximately 160+ acres of the habitat. A field survey
prepared by T. Griggs in 1980 can provide additional information.
Riparia riparia (Bank Swallow) is the other occurrence located just outside of the
Planning Area periphery. The location is approximately one mile south of the Red Bluff
Diversion Dam, on the left bank of the Sacramento River. Bank Swallows are normally
associated with riparian forests. Currently this species is on the California threatened
list.
Cryptantha Crinita (Silky Cryptantha) – is rated Category 2 under Federal listings.
Category indicates that the species is currently under consideration for a Federal listing.
The plants were located on the southern bank of the Dibble Creek, approximately 400

feet southeast of the northbound I-5 bridge. The species was found on cobble banks,
gravel and sandy bars.
Juncus Leiospermus Var Leiospermus (Red Bluff Dwarf Rush) – was located
approximately two miles south of Red Bluff near the Diversion Dam. Approximately 35%
of the identified area fell within the Planning Area boundaries. The species is listed as
under Federal Category 3C, which indicates that the species has been withdrawn from
candidacy. The plant was found “[…] in low places in grain field, treeless plain and red
clay soil.”
Desmocerus Californicus Dimorphus (Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle) – was located
on the right bank of the Sacramento River at mile 246.2, along I-5 in the City. The beetle
was found in a riparian habitat that had an elderberry understory and was overgrown by
grape and blackberry. The species is currently listed as Federally Threatened.
 D.   Executive Summary
        The data cited above provides valuable information as to the location and type of
sensitive species located within the Red Bluff Planning Area. This information should be
made available to the Planning Commission, City Council, Planning Staff and the
general public. Even the occurrences located outside the planning area could prove
useful, as indicators for potential occurrences in similar habitat areas within the planning
area. It is therefore considered advantageous for the City to utilize all information
provided by the Natural Diversity Data Base, and give it special consideration during the
decision making process.
        In order to maintain a viable natural community in Red Bluff, it is important to
consider all facets of its environment, regardless of size. Balance is the key to
maintaining this type of community and it can be done in a variety of ways.
        One of the most important facets in maintaining a balanced environment is first
the recognition and understanding of its components. Special consideration should be
given to those natural elements, which are already threatened. One major source of
information is the Department of Fish and Game’s Natural Diversity Data Base. Copies
of the overlay maps, base maps, and text are all available for City use at the Planning
Department. It is a policy of the Department of Fish and Game that this information may
not be copied and or used for private purposes.
        A second way to acquire more detailed information is to require, and or
encourage the preparation of site surveys on a project-by-project basis. This type of
review will include any project, which requires discretionary review by the City, including:
all new developments, subdivision maps, and conditional use permits. This will allow the
decision makers, the public, and developers to better understand an area before
irreversible alterations begin.
        The cost of these site surveys could be left to the applicant (of the project),
therefore eliminating the burden for the City. In exchange, the phase of his/her project.
Prior knowledge of this type could save the applicant considerable money, while
providing valuable information to the City. This information could also be made available
to the public for educational purposes.

                                    GOALS
 Provide a balanced environment in which all species are allocated habitat areas
  free from human disturbances,
 Protect and preserve viable populations of all special (endangered, threatened or
  sensitive) species of plants and animals in the Red Bluff Planning Area.
                                 OBJECTIVES
 Protect and maintain ecologically rich habitat areas in order to prevent human
  induced eradication of endemic wildlife species.
 Conserve and protect habitat areas associated with special species of plants and
  animals.
                                   POLICIES
 Restrict all development in areas where endangered and or threatened species
  have been identified by the Natural Diversity Data Base and other sources.
 Encourage biotic and botanical surveys for all projects, including those that are
  exempt (categorically and otherwise) from the CEQA process.
 Restrict any development or disruption that would later the habitat where specific
  rare and or threatened species of wildlife and natural communities have been
  identified.
 Maintain and utilize current copies of the Natural Diversity Date Base.
 Encourage projects, which take the natural environment into consideration, by
  modifying site design as a means to buffer sensitive areas.
                        IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
 Require an extensive survey and study of areas located near the periphery of
  known occurrences of rare and or threatened species of wildlife and natural
  communities, and use those findings during the decision making process.
 Require that all information regarding new occurrences be transmitted to the
  Department of Fish and Game, Natural Heritage Division (see Agency Reference
  List in appendices for contact person and phone number).

                             NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                  V.    Water Resources
 A. Introduction
        This section of the Natural Environment Element discusses issues relating to the
City’s water supply and water quality. Issues relating to the watershed and riparian
resources are addressed at further length in other sections of the element (Vegetation
and Wildlife).
        During the regular session of the State Legislature in 1983-84, Assembly Bill 797
was passed. This bill resulted in California Water code Section 10610 et. Eq. And
required, “[…] all urban water purveyors with more that 3,000 service connections to
prepare, adopt, and submit a water management plan to the State Department of Water
Resources no late than December 21, 1985 (City of Red Bluff Public Works Department
1985,1).” At that time, the City of Red Bluff had an estimated population of 11,100 and
was servicing 3,500 water connections. It was therefore required that the City prepare a
management plan. This plan was updated in 1990 and then amended again in January
of 1992.
        It is required by State Law that the conservation element of the general plan be
consistent with any pre-existing water management plan. It is therefore imperative that
the existing plan be addressed here. The following information is presented in the City’s
Water Management Plan (and consequent updates); Annual Water Quality Reports
(1989 – 1991); 1991 Annual Report to the Office of Drinking Water; and the 1991
Management plan prepared by Bryan Murphy and Associates.
 B. History
        The City of Red Bluff owns and operates the municipal water supply and
distribution system. The system was purchased from a local private company in 1921
(City of Red Bluff Public Works Department 1990). During the early 1920’s there were
approximately 3,100 people in need of water services. Today, there are 12,568 people
and approximately 3,700 water service connections (City of Red Bluff Public Works
Department 1991; 1991 Annual Report to the Office of Drinking Water; and Bryan
Murphy and Associates 1991.)
        The major source before the 1921 sale f the service system was the Sacramento
River. This source was abandoned in 1921, and Antelope Creek was added at a later
year. The Antelope Creek source was abandoned in 1963. Presently, all municipal
drinking water is taken from ground well (City of Red Bluff Public Works Department
1990).
 C. Water Supply and Consumption
        The City of Red Bluff’s water distribution system is completely self-supplied,
therefore not requiring the purchase of water from outside sources. All the groundwater
comes from the Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin (SVGB). The SVGB supplies
groundwater for the majority of Tehama County, and the county supplies approximately

21% of the recharge for the basin. Red Bank and Reed’s Creek play an important role in
the recharge (Tehama County Planning Department 1983, 111-28).
        The water supplied to the residents of Red Bluff comes from a reservoir and
twelve ground water wells. The ground water table is considered to be abundant with
levels from 30 to 60 feet below surface elevation. The water table has remained
relatively stable, even in the years of drought and it is not anticipated that there will be a
water shortage in the near future (through 2000). The depth of the aquifer occasionally
fluctuates resulting in increased energy consumption for the electric well pumps motors
(City of Red Bluff Public Works Department 1990).
        The average annual rainfall in the City of Red Bluff is 22 inches. The majority of
this precipitation comes during the period from November through April. Summers are
hot and dry, and winters are moderately cold. During the summer months of July and
August, temperatures in excess of 100 degrees F are common. It is during these
summer months that the highest water usage and demand occurs (City of Red Bluff
Public Works Department 1990).
        In 1991, the system produced a total of 1,498.7 million gallons of water, and
served a population of 12,568. The month of maximum water use was June, in which
200.5 million gallons of water were consumed (City of Red Bluff Public Works
Department 1992).
        The largest consumer group was the ‘general and residential’, consuming a total
of 900 million gallons of water. The second largest user was the commercial sector with
a total of 569 million gallons. The industrial sector utilized the lest amount with a total of
3 million gallons for the year.
        There are five improvements made to the system in 1991. These improvements
include: the completion of a computerized system for improved management and
design; alternation (lowered bowls 40 feet) of well No. 8; the addition of three dedicated
sampling stations; the replacement of 2,100 feet of deteriorated and undersized mains;
and the closing of the loop near Walnut and Bayless Street.
 D. Water Quality
        The City of Red Bluff has an excellent source of ground water, which has
consistently maintained a high level of purity. Each year, the city prepares an annual
water report that contains information regarding water source and quality. These reports
were mandated by the State of California and began in 1989. Each year, a copy of this
report is distributed to every consumer.
        The State has Maximum Contaminant Levels for mineral and chemicals in
drinking water. The State Department of Health Services establishes these standards
for drinking water based on the National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations
(promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency; City of Red Bluff Water
Department 1990, pg 3-1998 annual report).
        The Maximum Containment Levels and the corresponding levels detected in the
Red Bluff wells are presented in each annual report. The parameters of the report
include: Clarity, Microbiological, Organic Chemicals, Inorganic Chemicals, Radioactivity,

and Additional Constituent. All sources, with the exception of Bacteriological and
Radiological, are tested every three years at a private laboratory (City of Red Bluff
1990).
          Bacteriological sources require testing four times a week and the results of these
tests are reported to the State Department of Health Services on a monthly basis.
These tests are preformed by the City, in a City laboratory. Radiological test are
preformed every four years at a private laboratory. Pesticides are also tested, but only
on an as requested basis (City of Red Bluff 1990, 1991 and 1992).
          In the years following the initial 1989 annual report, water quality levels have
remained constantly high. See Appendix H for the most recent (1991) water quality
statistics.
          There were a total of 42 written r verbal complaints made by customers in 1991.
Twenty-four of these were regarding leaks, all of which were repaired. The remaining 18
complains were regarding physical problems, such as pressure, and were all
investigated. There were no complaints regarding water quality (City of Red Bluff Public
Works Department 1991).
 E. Wastewater and Sewage Disposal
          The present wastewater and sewage collection system comprises approximately
36 miles of sanitary sewer pipelines, six major trunk sewers, tem pumping station and
one sewage treatment (or water recycling) facility. The majority of the 36 miles of piping
are located within the public right-of-way (Bryan Murphy Associates 1991).
          The sewage treatment plant, otherwise known as the water recycling facility is
located along the Sacramento River (just south of where East Sand Slough joins the
Sacramento River) on Messer Road. The average annual flow of discharge through this
facility is over 1.15 million gallons per day and it has a capacity of 2.0 million gallons per
day. After the wastewater reaches the plant, it goes through a four-part reclamation
process.
          The reclamation process includes: screening and grit removal, secondary
treatment, disinfection and solid stabilization. The liquid portion of the final product is
discharged into the Sacramento River. This effluent is high in quality, and often contains
a lower amount of suspended solids than the water in the Sacramento River (Bryan
Murphy Associates 1991). For more detailed information, maps and logistics of the
wastewater and sewage disposal system, please refer to the City of Red Bluff 1991
Master Plan (Infrastructure Capital Improvement Program) prepared by Bryan Murphy
Associates.
          Hazardous waste disposal is managed by the county, as dictated by the Tehama
County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (Volumes I and II). The hazardous waste
generated by institutions, businesses and public agencies are removed from the site of
generation and taken to an off site facility where they will be stored, disposed of or
recycled. The majority of waste shipped off site in 1985/1986 was: empty containers
(42.5%), followed by PCBs and Dioxins (32.95%) and Organic Liquid (26.82%) (Vence
et al 1989, 2-14, 15, 16).
         It is estimated that individual households in Tehama County (including the City of
Red Bluff) produced 124 tons of hazardous waste in 1986. The tope three waste groups
were: waste oil (35%), dye and paint sludges/resin (25%) and other inorganic solid
wastes (16%) (Vence et al 1989, 2-29). Many of these wastes are disposed of or stored
improperly and eventually result in the contamination of the natural environment.
         One way to mitigate improper household waste disposal is to develop and
administer a plan for its disposal. Another possible way is through education. Educating
the public as to what common household products are hazardous to the environment
and how to dispose of those products could help decrease the rate of contamination.
This issue is addressed in the Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation
Measures of this section.
         The Tehama County Hazardous Waste Management Plan identifies six
contaminated sites in Tehama County. Three of the contaminated sites are located
within the Planning Area, and one is located just outside of the southern boundary of the
Planning Area. All four sites have been investigated and are either undergoing remedial
action or have completed it. The four contaminated sites and a brief description of each
are presented below.
         In 1981, it was reported that the Diamond Lands Lumber Products, located on
Diamond Avenue in Red Bluff, had two potential contamination sites. In 1985, it was
discovered that the Plywood Division had been discharging phenotic resin into Reed’s
Creek and the Lumber and Fiber Division had been discharging recycled water
containing wood wastes into the Sacramento River. The sites were investigated by the
Regional Water Quality Control board (RWQCB) and remedial actions were requested.
By 1987, both the RWQCB and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined
that , “[…] no further action was necessary (Vence et al, 1989, 2-34, 35).”
         In July of 1986, the Pacific Gas and Electric gas plant located on the corner of
Oak and Rio Streets was discovered. No contaminants have been identified as of yet
and the Department of Health Services has, “{…} place the site in the backlog site
cleanup report portion of the Bond Expenditure Plan (Vence et al 1989, 2-36).” This plan
is reviewed annually and it dictates specific remedial action plans for each site. The
Sobek Ranch site in Paskenta is also listed in the Bond Expenditure Plan for Tehama
County. For more information regarding the plan, please see the Tehama County
Hazardous Waste Management Plan section 2.2.7.
         The Louisiana Pacific Corporation site is located just south of the Planning Area
(south of Red Bank Creek) on Reading Road and was discovered in 1985. This site
violated several codes and contamination included: wastewater discharge, soil
contamination, and unregistered underground tanks (including improper closure and or
abandonment). Currently, all tanks are registered, and the corporation is taking
measures to rectify all violations (Vence et al 1989, 2-36).
         Leaking underground storage tanks (for fuel, pesticides, herbicides, ect.) are
another potential hazard that could influence water quality in Red Bluff. It has been
estimated hat one out of every ten tanks (or 10%) will undergo either a structural failure
or leak of some sort. There were 318 tanks registered in the county as of 1987. This
number does not include certain tanks, which have a capacity of less than 1,000 gallons
(Vence et al 1989, appendix M and 2-37).

        There are two basic pieces of legislation, which monitor and govern underground
storage tanks: California Administrative Code (Title 23, Subchapter 16) and California
Health and Safety Code, (Division 20, Chapter 6.7). The Regional Water Quality Control
Board, Department of Health Services, California Department of Fish and Game,
Division of Environmental Health, Red Bluff Fire Department may also become involved
in cases of contamination (Vence et al 1989, 2-37.
        The potential for contamination through tank leakage (10% of all tanks) is
substantial enough to warrant special consideration in this section of the Natural
Environment Element. This consideration is reflected in the Goals, Objectives, Policies
and Implementation Measures of this section.
  G. Conservation Techniques
        The most aggressive conservation currently employed by the City is the
conversion from a flat rate system to a metered one. This action was initiated by
Ordinance 580 (Section 24.281), and will eventually result in a more effective way to
monitor water consumption. In addition to increased efficiency, it allows the City to
impose a new rate structure based on consumption, which will add a fiscal incentive for
conservation.
        According to the 1991 Annual Report to the Office of Drinking Water, there are
currently 3,711 active connections in the system. As of yearend 1991, 2,158 still remain
on the flat rate system (City of Red Bluff Public Works Department 1992-see above).
This process of conversion is expected to be completed within the next ten year (City of
Red Bluff Public Works Department 1990).
        According to the 1990 update to the Water Management Plan, there are twelve
ordinances that address water conservation. The specific issues range from: prevention
of waste to re-circulating of air conditioner water. The most predominate issue,
however, is the above state conversation of a flat rate to a metered system.
        Resolution No. 12-1992 concluded that it is not appropriate at this time for the
City of Red Bluff to, “[…] implement the State of California model water efficient
landscape ordinance (City of Red Bluff 1992 (Res. No. 12-1992)).” Reclaimed water,
however, is currently being used as a conservation method by the City. The sewage
treatment plant utilizes reclaimed water for landscaping/irrigation purposes. Cal Trans is
also utilizing reclaimed for the landscaping along Highway 5 (City of Red Bluff Public
Works Department 1990).
  H. Executive Summary
        The City of Red Bluff has an excellent source of ground water. The future
maintenance of ground and surface water quality depends on many factors, including:
the prevention and or mitigation of hazardous waste contamination (of both soil and
water resources), watershed protection, prevention of soil erosion, and preservation of
recharge areas (through open space).

                                         GOALS

                           NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                VI.   GEOLOGY AND SOILS
         This section of the Natural Environment Element addresses the general geology
and soil types found within the City of Red Bluff Planning Area. Included in soil types
are the Department of Conservation’s Important Farmland Map Series classifications.
Soil erosion is also addressed, as it was determined to be an issue of concern for the
City during the scoping phase of this project.
 A. Geology
         The City of Red Bluff is located within the Great Valley Geomorphic province.
The province includes that area known as the Great Central Valley of California and
extends 400 miles north to the south and 60 miles east to west (Department of Water
Resources, 1991, 11). It is encompassed by the Coast Ranges (metamorphic), the
Klamath Ranges (metamorphic), the Cascade Range (volcanic) and the Sierra Nevada
(granitic and metamorphic).
         The majority of rocks and deposits found within the province are sedimentary.
The age of these rocks and deposits range form Upper Jurassic to recent (Department
of Water Resources 1991, 11).
         The Tehama Formation is a Plio-Pliestocene occurrence that is composed of
fluvial sedimentary deposits of “[…} semi-consolidated pale-green, gray and tan sand,
tuffaceous sand, silt and clay. The formation has scattered, discontinuous lenses of
gravel (Department of Water Resources 1991, 13).” This semi-consolidated material
ranges in depth from 5—40 feet within the formation. The general appearance of the
formation is fine-grained (Department of Water Resources 1991, 4).
         The California Division of Mines and Geology prepared a geologic map, which
includes the City of Red Bluff in 1962 (most recent reprint completed in 1977). The map
is entitled the Redding Sheet and it has a scale of 1:250,000. Although the scale is too
small for general planning practices, it provides adequate depth for this purpose. A copy
of the map available at the Red Bluff Community Development Department or at the
California Division of Mines and Geology (1416 Ninth Street, Room 1341, Sacramento).
 B. Soils
         There are six major factors that influence and control the characteristics of the
soil for any given area, and they are; climate, relief/topography, organic content, parent
material, time and human activity ((Department of Water Resources 1991, 21 and Soil
Conservation Advisory Committee 1987, 3).
         Most soils have several layers. In areas where there has not been significant
disturbance, there are usually three main layers. These layers are commonly referred to
as; the surface, topsoil or solum, the subsoil, and the underlying or parent material (Soil
Conservation Service 1990, 10). The soil profile refers to the all layers of the soil, from
the surface down to the parent material. The characteristics of each layer vary with
depth and type.

        The following information has been provided by various government agencies
and it would be advantageous for the City to consider this information when making land
use decisions. The Soil Conservation Service, under the United State Department of
Agriculture, prepared a Soil Survey, Tehama County California in May of 1967. This
report provides general soil maps (orthophotos) and accompanying text for the entire
county. The City of Red Bluff Planning Area is included in four of these maps; sheets
67, 68, 74, and 78.
        It has been estimated that there are over 1300 different soil types in the state of
California (Soil Conservation Advisory Committee 1987, 3). After examination of the soil
maps provided by the Soil Conservation Services, it was determined that there are 37
different soil types within the Red Bluff Planning Area. These soil types, along with their
map symbol, acres (county total), and slope percent are identified in Appendix K. A brief
discussion of each type can be found in the Appendix L. These descriptions were
adapted directly from the Soil Conservation Service Survey.
        Of the 37 soil types identified in the Planning Area, 15 general soil series are
represented. These series include; the Arbuckle Series, the Clear Lake Series, the
Columbia Series, the Corning Series, the Cortina Series, the Hillgate Series, the
Maywood Series, the Nacimiento Series, the Newville Series, the Perkins Series, the
Red Bluff Series, the Redding Series, the Riverwash Series, the Tehama Series and the
Zamora Series.
C. Agricultural Lands
     1) Important Farmland Mapping Series
        The California Department of Conservation offers a series of maps entitled the
Important Farmland Maps. These maps are part of a statewide Farmland Mapping and
Monitoring Program. The purpose of the program is, “[…] to monitor conversation of the
state’s agricultural land to and from agricultural use, and to report that conversation
annually to the Legislature, local government, and the public (California Department of
Conservation 1984, opening letter).” One of the methods by which this task is
accomplished is through the preparation of a series of statewide maps entitled the
Important Farmland Series Maps.
        The base maps used for this series are originally drafted by the United State
Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service. The maps are then modified to
show farmland and urban areas by the California Department of Conservation.
Although the primary purpose of these maps is related to agriculture, they offer valuable
information relating to the soils types and land uses within the Red Bluff Area. There
are eight different classifications that used this series and they include: Prime
Farmland, Farmland of Stateside Importance, Unique Farmland, Farmland of Local
Importance, Grazing Land, Urban and Built-up Land, Other Land and Land Committed
to Non-agricultural Use. These classifications have a minimum mapping unit of 10
acres, with the exception of grazing land, which has a minimum mapping unit of 40
acres.
        The Department of Conservation utilizes the definitions provided by the USDA
Soil Conservation Service Important Farmland Inventory System in determining their
classification criteria. This interrelationship has resulted in several internal

 consistencies within the two agencies’ findings. One result is the determination of soil
 candidates for farmland classification (assigned by the Soil Conservation Service).
         The Department of Conservation prepared a table for soil candidate listings for
 both the “Prime Farmland” and “Farmland of Stateside Importance”. Nineteen of the soil
 mapping units founding the Red Bluff Planning Area are candidates for the “Prime
 Farmland” soils classification, and the four qualify for the “Farmland of Sateside
 Importance”. See Appendix M for the names of these soils. This listing could be used
 for cross referencing and location analysis of specific soils.
         The fertile soils fo the Sacramento Valley and climate provide an unique growing
 area. These fertile soils are presently under the constant threat of urban development.
 The above-cited Important Farmland Map Series provides scientific information as to the
 existence and location of agricultural soils within the Red Bluff Planning Area. There is
 another issue, which must be addressed, lands covered by the Williamson Act
 (otherwise known as the California Land Conservation Act).
     2) The Williamson Act
         The Williamson Act provides landowners (farmers, ranchers, etc.) and local
officials with the legal tools to protect agricultural land. The tool is a ten-year, self-
renewing contract, which allows farmers (and other landowners) to maintain specified
land use (agriculture, ranching, open space, etc.), in exchange for preferential land
assessment for property tax purposes. The City of Red Bluff is currently surrounded by
either lands actively under contract or lands of recent contract termination.
         The land to the East of the Sacramento River, along the Sphere of Influence
periphery and into the Planning Area is encompassed with lands under contract. This
pattern follows along to the south of the City and across the Sacramento River to the
west.
         There are several parcels (two of which are relatively large) under contact
bordering Red Bank Creek to the south. Surrounding these active areas, are several
parcels that withdrew from the program in 1991. Although Red Bank Creek is the
southern boundary of the Planning Area; it would be advantageous of the City to
consider this in land use decisions associated with the area.
         There is a small parcel under contract, along Reed’s Creek to the East of the
Paskenta Road. There is another parcel bordering this area to the South that was
deactivated in 1991. Another, larger parcel exists to the east of Baker Road where it
meets Brickyard Creek. The final parcel is the South of Dibble Creek (and Highway 36)
and East of Monroe Avenue. This parcel is also large and is bordered to the East of
more Williamson Act lands.
 D. Soil Erosion
         There are two general types or erosion; geologic and accelerated. Geologic
erosion is more or less a natural type of erosion that occurs at a very slow rate. This
type of erosion is not usually associated with areas where human activity takes place
(Soil Conservation Service 1990, 7). The process of accelerated erosion is influenced
and perpetuated by human disturbance and is therefore an issue of concern for the
purposes of the Natural Environment Element.

          Accelerated erosion is the result of many anthropogenic activities, including;
logging, bulldozing (for urban development), overgrazing, and expansion of agricultural
lands. There are ways to modify the effects of these activities on soil erosion. However,
before solutions can be addressed, it is important to examine the forces behind the
problem.
          There are four major properties of the soil, which can be used to determine its
erodibility. These properties are: texture, slope, structure and organic matter content
(Soil Conservation Service 1990, 10).
          Texture, is generally considered as the most important property for purposes of
soil erosion. Texture identifies the relative proportion of particles within the soil. The
particles are classifies by size and include, sand, silt and clay (Soil Conservation Service
1990, 10).
          Slope is the relative steepness of the ground surface. As the steepness of slope
increases, so does the potential for erosion. After disturbance, steep slopes are
especially susceptible to the erosive forces of water. The steeper the slope, the more
erosivity of runoff and the bonds of soil particles begin to break more actively (Soil
Conservation Service 1990, 10-11).
          The structure of the soil is the way in which soil particles are clustered. These
clusters are the result of both physical and chemical bonds. These bonds form
aggregates, which in turn form peds. Peds are visible clumps of soil that have similar
size and range in undisturbed areas. However, as disturbances occur, the peds are
broken down (and sometimes built up) and this consistency is lost (Soil Conservation
Service 1990, 11).
          Organic Matter is the, “[…] decomposed remains of plants and animals (Soil
Conservation Service 1990, 12).” This property of soil influences; soil fertility, water
infiltration and storage, soil structure and erodibility. Humans can, and o increases the
amount of organic matter of soil. It can be used as a means to repair soil already
damaged by erosion. It is however, a slow process (Soil Conservation Service 1990,
11).
          Soil erosion poses many problems and hazards for an urban community,
including but not limited to; an increase in sediment load of surrounding waterways,
degradation of surrounding vegetation, loss of fertile topsoil, and the accumulation of silt
on sidewalks and roadways.
          There are several areas in Red Bluff, which exemplify the problem of soil erosion.
The slope on the east side of South Main from diamond Avenue to the Interstate 5 is one
example. The efforts to seed this area were unsuccessful, and as a result, the soil is
continually degraded by water and wind. The Willow Creek subdivision, currently being
constructed, off of Luther Road is another example. Large amounts of fertile topsoil
have been displaced as a result of grading. These areas, when left exposed, are
undergoing erosion and creating the potential for future environmental hazards.
          The Willow Creek subdivision is currently under construcitn and there is still an
opportunity to mitigate the problems associated with soil erosion. The Fairway Oaks
development, just south of Willow Creek on South Jackson, reflects what can happen
when soil erosion is not properly mitigated. This subdivision, including surrounding

easements, provides an example of the type of soil damage that can occur. This type of
soil damage, when properly considered and managed during the design stages of a
project, can be effectively mitigated.
         One way to determine the erosion potential of a soil, is to utilize the USDA Soil
Conservation Service’s capability classification for soil types. The basic purpose for this
classification method is to determine agricultural suitability. There is a sub-classification,
however, which indicated the limitations of the soil due to erodibility. There are ten soil
types in the Red Bluff Planning Area, which have been categorized under this sub-
classification (e). These soils are presented in Appendix N. An on-site evaluation of soil
type would be a more accurate way to determine erosion potential.
 E. Executive Summary
         Soil is a basic resource, which directly and indirectly influences other resources
within the Red Bluff Planning Area. The condition of the soil directly affects the health of
associated vegetation and wildlife species. The degradation of soil resources adversely
affects agricultural practices. Accelerated soil erosion poses many environmental
hazards, including: degradation of water quality, soil sterility, desertification, increased
sedimentation of streams, and safety hazards.
         Proper planning and mitigation can help prevent and or lessen some of the soil
hazards associated with urban development. In some cases this mitigation can be as
simple as seeding exposed slopes, and the result is long term protection of a valuable
resource.
         The purpose of the following goals, objectives, policies, and implementation
measures is to provide the guidelines for soil preservation and protection. Some of the
policies founding the Red Bluff Land Development Policies and the Grading, Drainage
and Ground cover Policies are incorporated into this section. A list of more specific
preservation methods and on-site construction techniques is currently being prepared by
the Planning Director and myself.
         A potential for the degradation of soil resources through hazardous waste
contamination does exist in the City of Red Bluff. This type of contamination also has
the potential for water pollution and is address in the Water Resources section of this
element.

                           NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                VII. Atmospheric Resources
 A. Introduction
         The City of Red Bluff is located within the Sacramento Valley Air Basin, which is
a large area that has been divided into a smaller division referred to as the Northern
Sacramento Valley Air Basin (NSVAB). This basin includes the counties of: Butte,
Colusa, Glenn, Shasta, Tehama and Yuba.
         The Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin is bordered by physical barriers,
which create a ‘bowl’ type basin. The barriers include: the Coastal Mountain Range to
the north and west, the Cascades (southern portion) and the Sierra Nevada Mountains
(northern portion) to the east. To the south and southwest, there are two air basins,
which generate high amounts of ozone and it precursors: the Broader Sacramento Area
and the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin.
         The pollutant form the Broader Sacramento Area Air Bain and the San Francisco
Bay Area Air Basin are of concern to the NSVAB, and the City of Red Bluff for two
reasons. The first reason is wind carried transport of pollutants. The influx of marine air
into the Bay Area carries the pollutants on to the Carquinez Strait, where they will
continue on to Sacramento. The prevailing northerly winds will then carry these
pollutants up into the NSVAB. The second reason of concern is the physiography of the
basin itself. The ‘bowl’ type terrain acts as a trap for the pollutants. It traps not only the
pollutants generated within the basin, but also the pollutants transferred by winds from
the more populous areas to the south.
 B. Air Quality Monitoring
         There are two primary agencies involved in monitoring air quality within the Red
Bluff Planning Area. These agencies are: the California Air Resources Board and the
Tehama County Air Pollution Control District. The California Air Resources Board
monitors area and mobile pollution emissions and the Tehama County Air Pollution
Control District monitors stationary sources. The Tehama County Air Pollution Control
District is also responsible for the management of the air quality plan for the area, which
includes the discretionary functions associated with permit issuance.
    1) State Monitoring
         The California Air Resources Board prepares a statewide report entitled,
California; Air Quality Data on a quarterly and annual basis. The most recent of these
reports available, is the July-August-September 1991 quarterly report. These reports
are prepared specifically by the Air Resources Board Technical Support Division and
they assesses air quality for each of the 14 air basins in the state (California Air
Resources Boards 1990, 16).
         The quarterly reports assess 19 pollutants for over 120 areas throughout the
State. These pollutants include; ozone, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide,
oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, total hydrocarbon, methane, particulate matter (10
microns), particulate sulfate (10 microns), particulate nitrate (10 microns), particulate

chloride (10 microns), particulate ammonium (10 microns), total suspended particulates,
suspended particulate lead, suspended particulate sulfate, suspended particulate
nitrates, soiling index (coefficient of haze), and hydrogen sulfide. Future copies of this
report may be acquired by calling (910) 322-2990 (California Air Resources Boards
1991).
     2) Regional Monitoring
         In 1991, the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin 1991 Air Quality Attainment
Plan was prepared. The purpose of the plan is to comply with and attain ambient air
quality standards designated by State and Federal Law. This plan was the result of a
joint effort by air quality pollution control districts and air quality management districts for
the counties of: Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte, Colusa, Sutter and Yuba.
         The plan indicates which counties have been designated ‘attainment’ and non-
attainment’ areas by the State. These classifications are based on standards for the four
criteria pollutants established by the California Clean Air Act of 1988. These pollutants
are: ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and suspended particulate matter less
than 10 micron in diameter (PM10).
         All the counties in the NSVAB, including Tehama, have been designated as non-
attainment areas for tow of the criteria pollutants; ozone and PM10. The non-attainment
status, however, can be misleading as indicator for air quality. Misleading because any
county, which exceeds the state air quality standards for a minimum of one hour is
classified as non-attainment for an entire year. A good example of how this status can
be deceptive is the fact that Los Angeles and Tehama County are both non-attainment
areas for ozone.
         There are two monitors in Tehama County, which measure these ‘non-
attainament’ pollutants. Both monitors are located within the Red Bluff City limits. The
ozone monitor is located just off of Highway 5 on the roof of the sewage treatment plant.
The PM 10 monitor is located behind the Tehama County Air Pollution Control District
office 1750 Walnut Street. The PM10 monitor is owned by the State (Air Resources
Board), on loan to the district and the ozone monitor is owned by the district (Williams
1992).
         The Tehama County Air Pollution Control Board is currently performing a study
on ozone levels in Red Bluff. The purpose of the study is to determine the major
sources of ozone pollution. It is generally accepted that the majority of ozone in Red
Bluff is created by automobile emissions. The controversy is over where those
emissions are generated within the City, transported in from other areas, or produced by
the highway corridors, which bisect the City (Bovee 1992).
         Background information and associated health affects of the two non-attainament
criteria pollutants: ozone and PM10 are listed below. The most recent ozone and PM10
data are presented in Appendix O.

 C. Criteria Pollutants
        The following information was provided by the Northern Sacramento Valley Air
Basin 1991 Air Quality Attainment Plan. According to the plan, Tehama County has a
‘non-attainment’ status for ozone and particulate matter less than 10 micron in diameter
(PM10).
    1) Ozone
        Ozone (O3) is a secondary pollutant. Secondary, in that it is not directly emitted
into the atmosphere, but is the result of a chemical reaction that occurs between
nitrogen oxides (NOX), reactive organic gases (NOG) and sunlight. Nitrogen oxides are
emitted into the air as a result of fuel combustion at high temperatures (the burning of
gasoline in automobile engines). Reactive organic gases are emitted into the air in two
ways; as the result of fuel combustion and through the evaporation of organic solvents.
Once present in the atmosphere, a photochemical reaction occurs and ozone is formed
(NSVAB Air Pollution Control and Quality Management Districts 1991, 8-9).
        Ozone is considered a seasonal problem in the Northern Sacramento Valley Air
Basin (NSVAB). The season of peak concern is normally April through October. The
NSVAB shares the Sacramento Air Basin with the Broader Sacramento Area (BSA),
which adds to the atmospheric content of ozone. The Broader Sacramento Area
emissions are transported by the prevailing winds north, into the NSVAB (NSVAB Air
Pollution Control and Quality Management Districts 1991, 8).
        There are several health affects associated with Ozone. The majority of these
affects on humans are related to the respiratory system. Low concentrations of ozone
can cause a decrease in resistance to air passage within the tissue of the lungs. At
higher concentrations, ozone can cause severe damage and premature aging of lung
tissue. A research project sponsored by the Air Resources Board and the University of
southern California demonstrated that there is a connection between ozone exposure
and the deterioration of the alveoli.
        Pre-existing health problems are also aggravated by exposure to ozone. For
example, the adverse affects of asthma, bronchitis, eye irritation and cardiovascular
disease can be increased by the exposure to ozone. At high levels of ozone
concentration, people with respiratory and cardiovascular difficulties, become
increasingly susceptible to these affects. This is especially true for the elderly, children
and pregnant women. Ozone, however, can have adverse affects on people of all ages
and physical conditions. Some of the more common affects include: nauseous,
dizziness, headaches, coughs, and burning sensations in the chest area (NSVAB Air
Pollution Control and Quality Management Districts 1991, 9).
    2) Suspended particulate Matter
        Suspended particulate matter, for the purposes of this element will be those
particulates with a diameter of 10 microns or less, otherwise known as PM10. The
primary components of these particulates are: dust, nitrates and sulfates. The
production and release of these products into the atmosphere is a result of fuel
combustion and abrasion. The automobile engine is one source of combustion; tire and

brake linings are examples of abrasion. PM10s are also release through chemical
reactions (NSVAB Air Pollution Control and Quality Management Districts 199,10).
         PM10s can cause adverse health affects in humans. The small size of the
particulates enables them to pass through the natural defense mechanisms and mucous
membranes of the body and enter the lung tissue. Once present in the lungs, they can
cause damage to the alveoli. Toxic compounds (such as carcinogens) can attach to the
surface of the particulates, thereby providing direct transport to the lung tissue (NSVAB
Air Pollution Control and Quality Management Districts 199,10).
         Larger particulates (with a diameter of more than 10 microns) do exist and can
cause irritation of the throat, nose and bronchial tubes. The natural defense
mechanisms of the body, such as sneezing, however, normally protect the body from
serious damage caused by these larger particulates.
 D. Facility Emissions
         The California Air Resources Board prepared a study entitled, Emissions by
Facility Summary (1989 Draft Emission Inventory) for the Tehama Pollution Control
District. As of this time, these figures have not been formally adopted. The tentative
results of the study presented 8 facilities in the City of Red Bluff that were under
operation and emitting pollutants into the atmosphere.
         Of the 8 facilities emitting pollutants, six are currently in operation. The six
facilities are: Diamond International Corporation (on Reed Avenue), Packaging
Company of California (on Diamond Avenue), Louisiana Pacific Corporation (on Reading
Road), Fiber Enterprises (on Vista Way), Al Bon Company (Highway 36) and Crown
Plastic (on Vista Way). See Appendix P for emissions data.
         The industrial facilities in Red Bluff contribute only a minor amount of air
pollutants. The most critical sources are automobile emissions (Ozone) and agricultural
practices (PM10) (Bovee 1992).
 E. Executive Summary
         The major cause of air pollution in the City of Red Bluff is vehicle emissions
(ozone). The specific source of the pollution (locally generated, transported, or
generated by highway corridor) has not been determined. The Tehama County Air
Pollution Control Board is actively studying this problem and will have the results in the
future. Once these findings are approved, they should be incorporated into this section
of the Natural Environment Element.
         It is also recommended that the City modify the goals, objectives, policies, and
implementation measures of this section to reflect these findings.
         Other sources of air pollution in the Red Bluff Planning Area include the industrial
facilities cited above (PM10) and agricultural practices (PM10). These issues are
addressed below, with the exception agriculture. The majority of agricultural practices
occurs beyond the City Limits and are therefore out of the control of the City.

                           NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                       VIII. MINERALS
A. Introduction
         The Tehama County General Plan, adopted in 1983, provides an informative and
general assessment of the mineral resources found within the county. The information
provided in this plan is summarized in the following paragraphs.
         Aggregates, including: non-metallic sand, gravel, and volcanic cinder account for
the majority of mineral extraction activity in the county. These materials are typically
used for construction and paving purposes. The high costs of transportation and the
heavy weight and bulk of aggregates ensures that the preponderance of these materials
are used for local projects. Mineral extraction and construction account for
approximately 4% of current employment in the county (Tehama County 1983 111-
50,51).
         Although mineral extraction is somewhat limited, there is the potential for future
expansion. This expansion would be controlled by both resource and availability and
future demand. Fourteen other mineral resources have been identified in the county by
the California Division of Mines and Geology, Minerals of California; Bulletin No. 189.
These minerals include: aragonite, borax, chalcopyrite, chromite, copper, cristobalite,
galena, garnet, opal, pectolite, penninite, sassolite, and Wallsonite (Tehama County
1983).
         The most plausible mineral for future development is chromite, Chromite is used
for steel production. The demand for domestically mined chromite is currently at a lull,
given that the majority of the country’s supply is imported (Tehama County 1983). Most
of the chromite deposits are found in the western section of the country and would
therefore have little or no effect on the City.
B. Local Extraction
         The California Office of Mines and Geology maintains a database entitled Mine
Files, which includes an inventory of mining activity on a county-side basis. According to
this source, there are 62 mine sites located within Tehama County. These site vary in
activity status from abandoned to active.
         There were four permits granted in the Red Bluff Planning Area for mineral
extraction. The four extraction sites were located along four creeks; Red Bank Creek,
Reed’s Creek, Dibble Creek, and Blue Tent Creek (Brewer 1992). The operation of Red
Bank Creek has been abandoned. The Reed’s Creek, Dibble Creek, and Blue Tent
Creek operations are currently active, although do not operate on a year-round basis.
The site on Reed’s Creek is owned by Sale Truck Repair. The Dibble Creek Site is
owned by Al-Bon Corporation. The Blue Tent Creek site is owned by Elmer Heightman
and extraction is minimal and intermittent at best.
         The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act provides the legal regulations and
guidelines for extraction operations. As part of the Act, a permit application and review
process is mandated for each extraction activity. This permit procedure is governed by

the lead agency. All three sites are governed by the County. The Dibble Creek mine is
the only site currently located within City limits. The permit for this site was originally
filed with the County, and the land was later annexed into the City. The Blue Tent Creek
site borders the City limits, however, the application is on file with the County.
C. Executive Summary
         None of the extraction activities located within the Planning Area fall under City
jurisdiction. As the City continues to grow, however, some of these sites may be
annexed into City limits. There is also current undeveloped potential for extraction within
the City limits. The City should take advantage of this situation and prepare for future
mineral extraction practices.
         The following goals, objective, policies and implementation measures are
intended to provide guidelines for future extraction activities within the City limits. The
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMAR) will also function as a guide. The
administration of the policies contained within this section and SMAR are the
responsibility of the City.
                                            GOALS
        Conserve the mineral resource base in the Red Bluff Planning Area.
        Conserve and improve groundwater, natural habitat, mineral, aesthetic, soil and
         air resources in the Red Bluff Planning Area (Land Use Element).
                                         OBJECTIVES
        Utilize mineral resources, where extraction is deemed to have a mutually
         beneficial impact on the community (both environmentally and economically).
        Maintain and apply all government plans and restrictions to all active mineral
         extraction activities in the Red Bluff Planning Area.
                                           POLICIES
        Discourage extraction in environmentally sensitive areas, including those areas
         designated by other elements of the general plan.
        Encourage the reclamation of mined lands for recreation, aesthetic, open space
         or other public purposes.
        Review and update all City ordinances, which address the extraction of mineral
         resources on a regular and as needed basis.
        Ensure the protection of all non-mineral resources surrounding the site of a
         proposed mineral extraction area.

 Require that the City monitor the environmental impacts of current and future
  mineral extraction activities and ensure proper mitigation for adverse affects.
                       IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
 The City shall prepare and adopt a mineral extraction plan, as detailed in the
  Open Space Action Program of this element.
 Require a reclamation plan with each new application for a mineral extraction
  permit, as mandated by the Surface Mining and Reclamations Act of 1975.
 Require that all land use conflicts associated with mineral extraction be
  determined, considered, and mitigated in verbal and written form (conditions for
  approval) during the decision making process.

                              NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                                       IX.   Open Space
 A. Introduction
        Open Space as defined by the State of California is, “[…] any parcel or area of
land or water, which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use […]
(Governors’ Office of Planning and Research 1992, 37).” There are four types of open
space use recognized by the State, and they are; open space for the preservation of
natural resources, open space used for the managed production of resources, open
space for outdoor recreation, and open space for public health and safety.
        Currently, there is not an ‘open space’ zoning classification in the City of Red
Bluff. All the city owned land is zoned under a general PS-Public Service. Public parks
and recreational areas are included under this zoning classification, as is the land
surrounding the airport and the sewage treatment facility. There is a sub-classification,
f-floodplain, under the PS zoning, which indicated a more specific land use.
        The following sections address the current and future possibilities for
implementing the four State recognized types of open space.
 B. Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
        This type of open space use includes area, “[…] required for the preservation of
plant and animal, […] for ecologic and other scientific study purposes,[…] rivers,
streams, […] banks of rivers and streams, and watershed lands (Governor’s Office of
Planning and Research 1992, 37).”
        Greenways, an overlay zone initiated by the Land Use Element, would qualify for
this type of open space. Greenways are defined as, “[…] continuous canopy of
woodland, which is found along and with varying distance adjacent to stream corridors or
wetlands (Collins 1992, 52).” The purpose of Greenways is to preserve natural
resourced found within these wooded areas. The result is open space, which provides
many assets including preservation of; habitat, soil stability, and aesthetic and recreation
resources.
        Designated open space areas for the preservation of natural resources can have
dual purposes. Quite often the preservation of natural resources, such as vegetation,
soil, and air quality has a positive impact on other resources. For example, by protecting
riparian habitat we can increase; bank stability, water quality, aesthetics, recreation and
provide valuable habitat for wildlife.
        It is important to identify areas of high resource value, so that they may be
protected and growth can be guided into more suitable, less abundant areas.

 C. Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources
        This type of open space use includes, “[…] forest lands, rangeland, agricultural
land, […] areas required for recharge of ground water basins, […] areas containing
major mineral deposit (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research 1992, 37).”
        There is no zoning classification for this type of open space, at present in the City
of Red Bluff.
        There are areas of prime agricultural soils in the Planning Area, as indicated in
the Geology and Soils sections of this element. The current production of food and fiber
within the City limits, however, are relatively small in scale and have little direct
importance to the City (Collin 1992, 17). The surrounding, rural areas, of the county
provide an environment more conducive to large-scale agricultural practices. In
accordance the Land Use Element, it should be the policy of the City to take County
farmland preservation methods under consideration when making land use decisions.
        There is only one active mineral extraction facility located within the Red Bluff
City Limits. This site is owned by the Al-Bon Corporation and is located on Dibble
Creek. The mine site was originally located in Tehama County, when the extraction
permit was files. The land was later annexed into the City. The mine type, as classified
by the Office of Mines and Geology, is a gravel bar skimming operation. The mine
produces sand and gravel (Office of Mines and Geology 1992).
        There are other sand and gravel extraction activities located near the City Limits.
There is one site just east of Paskenta Road on Reed’s Creek. There are also several
abandoned and intermittent mining activities located near City Limits. The Surface
Mining and Reclamation Act provisions mandate that the lead agency take responsibility
for permit application and approval process. These other sites, being located in the
County, would therefore be out of City jurisdiction.
        It is imperative to preserve not only the sand and gravel resources, but the
watershed from which they are generated. A holistic view of this type of extraction would
be beneficial, both from an economic and environmental standpoint.
 D. Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
        This type of open space use includes, “[…] areas outstanding scenic value,
historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes,
including access to lakeshores […] rivers and streams; and area which serve as links
between major recreation and open-space reservation, including utility easements,
banks of rivers and streams, trails (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research 1992
37).”
        The City of Red Bluff currently has over 80 acres of park and recreational land
(Collins, 1992 31). In 1974, the City hired Nickolas Von Rotz, Jr., a Park-Planning
Consultant, to prepare the, Red Bluff Park System General Plan. The plan was
completed in October of 1974. The plan cataloged eight park facilities, of which most
already existed and some were anticipated for future development and or expansion.

The plan also addressed a bike trail system that was to be implemented. Although the
plan is currently out-of-date, it does provide maps of each facility.
         The updated Land Use Element, prepared in 1992, accurately assesses the
current park and recreational facilities available in Red Bluff. The element identifies and
describes the following ten park and recreational facilities; Samuel Ayer and Dog Island,
Trainor Park, Diamond Park, Forward Park, River Park and Marina, Campfire Recreation
Area and Building, Carl Coleman Tennis Courts, Jackson Heights Park, Lincoln Street
Tennis Courts, and Luning Street Park. For further information, see the Land Use
Element and Map.
         In 1991, Bryan Murphy Associates, Inc. prepared the City of Red Bluff Master
Plan. The purpose of the plan was to assess current and future infrastructure needs, in
order to develop a capital improvement program for the City. The Master Plan
concluded that “The City Council and Administration in the past (Bryan Murphy, 1991, 2-
25).” This conclusion was based on a per capita ratio of facility availability. The current
ratio exceeds 6 acres per 1,000 people. According to standards recognized by the
Greenbelt Alliance, this ratio is considered adequate for an urban environment.
         In a recent publication entitled, Bay Areas Public Lands, the Greenbelt Alliance
identifies the people to city owned acres ratio for all the municipalities in the Bay Area.
In this report, they also present a ratio they deem adequate for city park acres per
population. This ratio is 3-5 city park acres per 1,000 people (Greenbelt Alliance 1992,
8). The City of Red Bluff exceeds the low end of this standard by almost 100%.
According to the linear regression model of future population growth, the City will not
exceed these standards in the next ten years. See Appendix Q.
         Future open space areas for the purpose of recreation are therefore considered a
lower priority when compared to three other three types of open space. The City can
secure and maintain this satisfactory ratio by encouraging the inclusion of open space
areas in new developments. This technique would alleviate the burden for the City to
maintain these areas, while securing that these areas will exist. There are currently
standards for lot coverage (% of required open space) and children’s play areas in the
Land Development Policies (section IV and V.B.), which are discussed further in the
Open Space Action Program.
 E. Open Space for Public Health and Safety
         This type of open space includes, “[…] areas which require special management
or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as earthquake faulty
zones, unstable soil areas, floodplains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks,
areas required for the protection of water quality and water reservoirs and areas required
for the protection and enhancement of air quality (Governor’s Office of Planning and
Research 1992, 33).”
         There are currently two overlay zones, which could be included in this type of
open space. They are floodplain (f) and Hillslope (H). Both of these overlay zones were
dictated by the Land Use Element.

         Floodplain overlay districts correlate with the 100-year floodplain as designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These areas are delineated
on the City’s Land Use Map. The purpose of this overlay is to limit and or condition any
development within the floodplain for public safety purposes. The most predominate
floodplain is located along the Sacramento River. There are also designated floodplain
areas along creeks, which run through the City. These areas vary in width form
approximately 2000 feet along Red Bank Creek, 1000 feet along Grasshopper, Dibble
and Blue Tent Creeks, and 100 to 500 feet along Reed’s, Brickyard and Brewery Creeks
(Collin 1992, 9).
         Hillslope overlay districts occur in areas where slope exceeds 20 percent. The
purpose of this type of overlay is to restrict and or modify development in these unstable
areas. This is accomplished by requiring special use permits on a project-by-project
basis within the zone. The development density is also regulated in these areas, in
order to provide for public safety (Collin 1992, 9).
         These two overlay zones represent the extent of open space designated for the
purposes of public health and safety in the City of Red Bluff. These zones, although
beneficial, do not always qualify as open space. According to State law, in cases where
restricted development is allowed, these areas cannot be considered open space.
         Included in the State’s definition of open space, is the protection and
maintenance of water quality. At present, the City of Red Bluff has an excellent source
of groundwater. It is important that the City maintain this resource, including surface
water. It would be advantageous for the City to consider an open space zoning
classification, which provides for this type of protection. In doing this, the City could
accomplish many diverse objectives, including the preservation of: vegetation, stream
banks, soils, recreation areas, aesthetics and wildlife habitat. This issue is addressed at
further length in the Water Resources section of this element, and in other elements of
the general plan.
         The Safety Element addresses the natural hazards of the community at more
depth. The scope of the Safety Element includes,: “[…] the protection of the community
form any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced surface
rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope
instability leading to mudslides and landslides, subsidence and other geologic hazards
[…] flooding; and wildland and urban fires (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research,
1992, 25).”

 F. Executive Summary
       The City of Red Bluff has many valuable areas of open space. It is important that
these areas be considered and protected while population and urbanization continues.
Section X, Open Space Action Program, provides specific guidelines for the
preservation, conservation and management of open space. This action program is
required by State Law and functions as the goals, objectives, policies, and
implementation measures for the open space section.
                                  NATURAL ENVIRONMENT ELEMENT
                               X.   Open Space Action Program
A. Introduction
         It is the intent of the Natural Environment Element to satisfy the statutory
requirement of the Open Space Element of a general plan. In order to secure the legal
viability of this element, it is imperative that an action program be included.
         Article 10.5 of California Government Code requires that, “Every local open-
space plan shall contain an action program consisting of specific programs, which the
legislative body intends to pursue in implementing its open-space plan (Governor’s
Office of Planning and Research, 1992, 34).”
B. Existing Methods of Implementation
         The following section discussed techniques currently available for the
preservation of open space. The techniques are broken down into four open space
types.
                                Preservation of Natural Resources
         The updated Land Use Element initiated two overlay zones, which can be utilized
to implement this plan. The zones are Greenways and Floodplains, and they are
delineated on the Land Use Map. These zones mandate additional restrictions for
development the Planning Commission is granted the power to restrict development all
together.
         The Land Development Policies, Section IV. Lot Coverage provides guidelines
for the minimum amount of open space according to zoning district. The stated purpose
for this type of open space regulation is to, “[…] (increase) rainfall infiltration and
(reduce) storm runoff [...] (Collin 1992, 5).” The minimum open space is determined on a
percentage basis (of total land area) and is as follows:
                  Zoning District                     Minimum Open Area
                        R-1                                   50%
                        R-2                                   40%
                        R-3                                   33%
                        R-4                                   25%

                                Managed Production of Resources
         There are no methods currently available for this type of open space
preservation. Potential types of resource production in the Red Bluff Planning Area
include agriculture and sand and gravel extraction. Large scale agriculture is not a

feasible type of resource production for an urban city, and therefore, no future provision
for this type of open space are made in this program.
         Sand and gravel extraction is a potential source of managed resource production
for the City. Technique #2, cited below, proposes a potential solution for future
development.
                                     Outdoor Recreation
         The Land Use Element’s Land Development Policies, Section V. Lot or Site
Improvement, subsection B. Children’s Play Areas provides guidelines for the inclusion
of open space into residential developments. The guidelines apply to development
projects of medium density or greater. The power to enact these provisions rests with
the Planning Commission, as they are not arbitrary requirements.
                                   Public Health and Safety
         The Greenway and Floodplain overlay zone, cited above, qualifies as an
implementation tool for the preservation of open space for public health and safety.
Projects located within the zone are subject to specific development policies (as
mandated by the Land Development Policies and the Land Use Element). A state
purpose of both zones is to limit the effects of flooding on public safety. In addition, the
Greenway zone is intended to decrease the potential for fire hazard.
         The Land Use Element dictates standards for development on hillsides
exceeding 20% slope. These areas are designated as Hillslope (H) and require a
special use permit for any type of development.
         The Clear Zone (CZ) is an overlay zone, which extends 1300 feet from the ends
of the principal runways at the Bidwell Municipal Airport. The zone is mandated in the
Airport Land Use Plan and is delineated on the Land Use Map. Development is
restricted in this area and it supersedes existing zoning districts in that area (Collin 1992,
10).
C. Suggested Revisions of Existing Techniques
Revision #1: Incorporate minimum lot coverage standards for all zoning classification
into Section V. of the Land Development Policies.
         The inclusion of all zoning classification into this section will provide a more
comprehensive far reaching form of open space preservation.
Revision #2: Interpret the Greenway and Floodplain overlay zones so that they
included specific development standards.
         There are no specific standards associated with the Greenway overlay zone. Not
all floodplain overlay zones are delineated on maps. Currently, the Planning
Commission has the responsibility of determining and enforcing the guidelines for
development in these sensitive areas. Establishing a list a detailed standards for each
zone further secures their effectiveness as preservation tools.

D. New Techniques for the Preservation of Open Space
Technique #1: Prepare and adopt a city ordinance in accordance with the Quimby Act.
         The Quimby Act (Government Code Section 66477 et seq) provides a method by
which a local government can exact either land dedication or in lieu of fees for park and
recreational purposes. The details and limits to this program can be found on pages
147-150 of the 1992 Planning, Zoning, and Development Laws.
         There are several advantages to adopting this type of ordinance. It will help to
secure that the City maintains an acceptable ratio of park land/population. The current
ratio is 6.3 acres/1,000 people. If the present inventory of open space (for recreational
purposes) remains constant, the ratio will decrease to 4.77 acres/1,000 people by the
year 2002. See Appendix Q for the statistics.
         One possibility is to collect “in lieu of fees” until there is adequate to money to
purchase vacant land adjacent (or near) the developing area. The land could be left in
its natural state, which would lessen the future fiscal responsibilities of the City. This
type of open space could, depending on location, function as one or more types of open
space under State classifications.
Technique #2: Prepare and adopt a resource extraction plan for the City.
         This plan should address areas of potential open space for the purposes of sand
and gravel extraction within the City. The areas should be assessed based on
environmental, social and economic impacts. Intergovernmental agency coordination
should be an implicit part of the plan.
         The plan should also include any other potential extraction activities located in
the Planning Area. Once complete, the plan will serve as a guide for all extraction
practices within the City jurisdiction.
E. Executive Summary
         The revisions and new techniques presented in this action program should be
implemented immediately following the adoption of the Natural Environment Element.
They, in addition to the goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures
presented in other sections of the element, should be actively enforced and monitored to
ensure compliance. The proper administration of these programs and policies is vital to
the cumulative effectiveness of the element.

As a soil textural class, soil material that is 40 percent or more clay, less than 45 percent
sand, and less than 40 percent silt.
Drainage (natural-soil) – refers to moisture conditions that existed during the
development of the soil, as opposed to altered drainage, which is commonly the result of
artificial drainage or irrigation but may be cause by the sudden deepening of channels or
the blocking of drainage outlets. Seven different classes of natural drainage are
recognized.
        Excessively Drained Soils – commonly very porous and very rapidly permeable
         and have a low water holding capacity.
        Somewhat Excessively Drained Soils – rapidly permeable and are free from
         mottling throughout their profile.
        Well-Drained Soils – typically free from mottling, moderately permeable, and
         commonly of medium texture.
        Moderately Well-Drained Soils – commonly have a slowly permeable layer in or
         immediately beneath the lower subsoil. They have uniform color in the surface
         soil and in the upper subsoil and have mottling in the lower subsoil and in the
         substratum.
        Imperfectly or Somewhat Poorly-Drained Soils – wet for significant periods, but
         not all the time, and many soils commonly have mottlings below 6 to 16 inches in
         the lower surface soil and in the upper subsoil.
        Poorly-Drained Soils – wet for long periods and are light gray and generally
         mottled from the surface downward, although mottling may be absent or nearly
         so in some soils.
        Very Poorly-Drained Soils – wet nearly all the time. They have a dark-gray or
         black surface layer and are gray or light gray with or without mottling, in the
         deeper parts of the profile.

         one or many causes-loss of habitat or change in habitat, overexploitation,
         predation, competition, and disease. An endangered species must have help or
         extinction will probably follow.
        Rare – A rare species or subspecies is one that, although not presently
         threatened with extinction, is in such small numbers throughout its range, that it
         may be endangered if its environment worsens. Close watch of its status is
         necessary.

Goal – “[…] is a direction –setter. It is an ideal future end-condition or state related to
the public health, safety or general welfare toward which planning and planning
implementation measure s are directed. A goal is a general expression of community
values and, therefore, is abstract in nature. Consequently, a goal is generally not
quantifiable, time-dependent or suggestive of specific actions for its achievement
(Governor’s Office of Planning and Research 1990. 16).”
Hardpan – A hardened or cemented soil horizon or layer. The soil material may be
sandy or clayey, and it may be cemented by iron oxide, silica, calcium carbonate, or
other substance.

Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin – consists of the counties of Butte, Colusa, Glenn,
Shasta, Sutter, Tehama and Yuba.
Objective – “[…] is a specific end, condition or state that is an intermediate stop toward
attaining a goal. It should be achievable and when possible, measurable and time-
specific. An objective may only pertain to one particulate aspect of a goal or it may be
one of several successive steps toward goal achievement. Consequently, there may be
more than one objective for each goal (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research
1990. 17).”
Parent Material – the horizon of weathered rock or partly weathered soil material from
which soil has formed.
Pergelic – The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 0°C (32°F).
Permeablility -- The quality of a soil horizon that enables it to transmit water or air.
Terms used to describe permeability are very slow, slow, moderately slow, moderate,

measures.”
Riparian Habitat – “Riparian Systems” as defined in Section II-C on page 5 or as
delineated on maps adopted by the City.

very rapid, rapid, medium, slow, very slow and ponded.
Root Protection Zone (RPZ) – is that zone which extends 1.5 times the size of the area
between the tree trunk and the drip-line of tree.
Sand – Individual fragments of rocks or minerals that have diameters ranging from 0.05
(0.002 inch) to 2.0 (0.079 inch) millimeters. Most sand grains consist of quartz, but they
may be any mineral composition. The term sand also is applied to a soil that contains
85 percent or more sand and not more than 10 percent clay.

Silt – mineral particles in a soil that range in diameter form 0.002 (0.000079 inch) to 0.05
(0.002 inch) millimeter. The silt is also applied to a soil that contains 80 percent or more
silt and less than 12 percent clay.
Soil Moisture Regimes – are used in defining soil classes at various levels in the soil
taxonomy system.
Soil Profile – The sequence of natural layer, or horizon, in a soil; it extends from the
surface down into the parent material.
Soil Structure – the arrangement of the primary soil particles into lumps, granules, or
other aggregates. Structure is described by the grade:
        Weak, Moderate or Strong Grade -- that is, the distinctness and durability of the
        aggregates.
        It is also described by the size of the aggregates – very fine, fine, medium,
        coarse or very coarse; and by their shape – platy, prismatic, columnar, blocky,
        granular, or crumb.
        A soil is described as ‘structureless’ if there are no observable aggregates.
        Structureless soil – may be massive (coherent) or single grain (non-coherent).

        rounded surfaces that join at sharp angles.
        Blocky, sub-angular – Aggregates have some rounded and some flat surfaces;
        the upper sides are rounded.
        Columnar – aggregates are prismatic and are rounded at the top.
        Crumb – aggregates are generally soft, small, porous, and irregular, but tend
        toward a spherical shape.
        Granular – aggregates are roughly spherical and small. They may be either hard
        or soft, but are generally more firm and less porous than crumb and are without
        the distinct faces of blocky structures.
        Platy – aggregates are flaky or plate-like.
        Prismatic – aggregates have flat, vertical surfaces, and their height is greater
        than their width and depth.
Soil Temperature Regime – are used in defining soil classes at various levels in the soil
taxonomy system.

                                        APPENDIX A
                            Summary of Statutory Responsibilities
                                     and Requirements
Section 65300 of the California 1992 Planning, Zoning and Development Laws status
that,
       “[…] Each planning agency shall prepare and the legislative body of each
       county and city shall adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for
       the physical development of the county or city, and of any land outside its
       boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its
       planning (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research).”
State Law also requires that seven mandatory element be included in this plan. These
elements are: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise and
Safety. There are specific requirements and guidelines for each element. These
requirements are addressed below for the Conservation and Open Space Elements.
                                        Conservation
The statutory responsibilities of the Conservation Element, as indicated by Section
65302 (d) of the California 1992 Planning, Zoning and Development Laws is as follows:
       “[…] (d) A conservation element for the conservation, development, and
       utilization of natural resources including water and its hydraulic force,
       forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals
       and other natural resources. That portion of the conservation element
       including waters shall be developed in coordination with any countywide
       water agency and with all district and city agencies which have
       developed, served, controlled or conserved water for any purpose for the
       county or city for which the plan is prepared. The conservation element
       may also cover:
       (1) The reclamation of land and waters.
       (2) Prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other waters.
       (3) Regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas
             required for the accomplished of the conservation plan.
       (4) Prevention, control, and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches,
             and shores.
       (5) Protection of watersheds.
       (6) The location, quantity and quality of the rock, sand and gravel
             resources.
       (7) Flood control.

                                          Open Space
The statutory responsibilities of the Open Space Element are more detailed and lengthy
than those of the Conservation Element. Under the above-cited Section (65302) there
are no direct responsibilities stated for the Open Space Element. Those requirements
are found in Article 10.5, which commences with Section 65560. Due to the complexity
and length of these statutes, a brief, more concise selection of the law is presented here.
In general, State Law defines that:
        “[…] (b) “Open-space land” is any parcel or area of land or water which is
        essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-space use as defined in
        this section, and which is designated on a local, regional, or state open-
        space plan as any of the following:
        (1) Open space for the preservation of natural resources, including,
             but not limited to; areas required for the preservation of plant and
             animal life, including habitat for fish and wildlife species; areas
             required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes; river,
             streams, bays and estuaries; and costal beaches, lakeshores, banks
             of rivers and streams, and watershed lands.
        (2) Open space used for the managed projection of resources,
             including, but not limited to forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands
             and areas of economic importance for the production of food or fiber;
             areas required for recharge of ground water basins; bays, estuaries,
             marshes, river and streams, which are important for the management
             of commercial fisheries; and areas containing major mineral deposits,
             including those in short supply.
        (3) Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to,
             areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value; area
             particularly suited for park and recreation purposes, including access
             to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas which
             serve as links between major recreation and open-space
             reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams,
             trails, and scenic highway corridors.
        (4) Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited
             to, areas which require special management or regulation because of
             hazardous or special conditions such as earthquake fault zones,
             unstable soil area, flood plains, watersheds, areas presenting high
             fire risks, areas required for the protection of water quality and water
             reservoir and area required for the protection enhancement of air
             quality (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research 1992, 37).”
The Legislature also defines the policy and intent of open space lands. A clear
understanding of these policies and intent is crucial to the appropriate administration and
implementation of an open space plan. Section 65561 and 65562 of Article 10.5 of the
California 1992 Planning, Zoning, and Development Laws address these issues:
        Section 66561. The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
        (a) That the preservation of open space land, as defined in this article, is
            necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state,
            but also for the assurance of the continued availability of land for the

             production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic beauty, for
             recreation and for the use of natural resources.
         (b) That discouraging premature and unnecessary conversion of open
             space land to urban uses is a matter of public interest and will be of
             benefit to urban dwellers because it will discourage non-contiguous
             development patterns, which unnecessarily increase the costs of
             community services to community residents.
         (c) That the anticipated increase in the population of the state demands
             that cities, counties, and the state at the earliest possible date make
             definite plans for the preservation of valuable open space and take
             positive action to carry out such plans by the adoption and strict
             administration of laws, ordinances, rules and regulations as
             authorized by this chapter or by other appropriated methods.
         (d) That in order to assure that the interests of all its people are met in the
             orderly growth and development of the state and the preservation and
             conservation of its resources; it is necessary to provide for the
             development by the state, regional agencies, counties and cites,
             including charter cities, of statewide coordinated plans for the
             conservation and preservation of open space land.
         (e) That for these reasons this article is necessary for the promotion of
             the general welfare and for the protection of the public interest in open
             space land.
         Section 6652: It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this article:
         (a) To assure that cities and counties recognize that open space land is a
             limited and valuable resource, which must be conserved wherever
             possible.
         (b) To assure that every city and county will prepare and carry out open
             space plans, which along with state and regional open space plans,
             will accomplish the objectives of a comprehensive open space
             program.
It is also required that every local open space plan, “[…] shall contain an action
program consisting of specific programs, which the legislative body intends to
pursue in implementing its open-space plan (Governor’s Office of Planning and
Research 1992, 34).”
There are several clauses that require internal consistency between the actions
of the city or county and the open space element. These requirements are found
in Section 65566 and 65567. they are as follows:

       Section 65566. Any action by a county or city by which open space land
             or any interest therein is acquired or disposed of or its use restricted
             or regulated, whether or not pursuant to this part, must be
             consistent with the local open space plan.
       Section 65567. No building permit may be issued, no subdivision map
             approved, and no open space-zoning ordinance adopted, unless the
             proposed construction, subdivision or ordinance is consistent with
             the local open space plan.
       In addition to the responsibilities dictated by Article 10.5 for the
preparation of an Open Space Element, Article 4 of the California 1992 Planning,
Zoning, and Development Laws requires that:
       “Every city and county […] shall prepare and adopt an open-space zoning
       ordinance consistent with the local open-space plan adopted pursuant to
       Article 10.5 (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research 1992, 74).”

CASE LAW
Save El Toro Assn. V Days (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 64, reinforces the open-space
plan requirement. The California Court of Appeal held that because the city of
Morgan Hill had not adopted an open-space plan, the city could not acquire,
regulate or restrict open space land or approve a subdivision map. Mere
adoption, however, does not protect a local jurisdiction from the adverse
consequences of a lawsuit challenging an open-space element. An open-space
element must also meet the specifications of the Government Code, including an
inventory of open space resources.
Sierra Club v Kern County (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, voided a precedence
clause that gave a land use element priority over an open-space element on the
grounds that it violated Government Code Section 65300.5 (requiring that
elements of a general plan comprise an integrated, internally consistent and
compatible statement of policy).
No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1988) 196 Cal.App.3d 223, offers an
interpretation of the meaning of the term ‘open space for the managed production
of resources.’ A citizens’ group challenged the city’s approval of oil drilling zones
in a coastal area designated as open space by the Brentwood-Pacific Palisades
district plan. Absent specific contradictory language in the district plan, the court
held that because oil recovery is the managed production of a natural resource it
was therefore consistent with the plan’s open space areas. In light of this
decision, it is strongly recommended that local general plans specify the types of
land use, which are intended to comprise open space.
Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App3d 692 (as
modified by 222 Cal.App.3d 516a) the California Court of Appeal affirmed that a
general plan may consist of several documents. Nevertheless, the information in
associated documents, when not referenced by the general plan, may not
compensate for deficiencies in the conservation element.

                                           NOISE ELEMENT
Authority and Purpose
        The purpose of this Noise Element of the Red Bluff General Plan is to help protect the
health and welfare of the community by promoting development, which is compatible with
accepted noise standards.
        Section 65302(b) of the California Government code requires that a Noise Element be
prepared as part of all City General Plans. This State Law requires that a jurisdiction, through
its Noise Element, identify and work toward elimination of noise problems in the community.
        The Government Code (Section 65302(g) specifically requires:
                 A noise element in quantitative, numerical terms, showing contours of present
        and projected major transportation elements. These include, but are not limited to,
        highways and freeways, ground rapid transit systems, and ground facilities associated
        with all airports.
                 These noise contours may be expressed in any standard acoustical scale, which
        includes both the magnitude of noise and frequency of its occurrence. The
        recommended scale is sound level A, as measured with A-weighting network of a
        standard sound level meter, with corrections added for the time duration per event and
        the total number of events per 24-hour period.
                 Noise contours shall be shown in minimum increments of five decibels and shall
        be continued down to 65 dBA. For regions involving hospitals, rest homes, long-term
        medical or mental care, or outdoor recreational areas, the contours shall be continued
        down to 45 dBA.
                 Conclusions regarding appropriate site or route selection alternatives or noise
        impacts upon compatible land uses shall be included in the general plan.
                 The state, local, or private agency responsible for the construction or
        maintenance of such transportation facilities shall provide to the local agency producing
        the plan, a statement of the present and projected levels of the facility, and any
        information that was used in the development of such levels.
        This Noise Element recognizes the guidelines established by the State Office of Noise
Control and the State Department of Health Services and analyzes current and projected noise
levels for highways and major city roadways, railroad operations, aircraft, local industrial plants
and other ground stationary sources identified by the local government as contributing to the
community noise environment.
        The noise level contours and tables presented in this element are required to be used as
a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the Land Use Element that minimizes the
exposure of community residents to excessive noise. The noise element is in a sense a
supplementary element in that its standards and proposals are to be superimposed upon, the
environment, which may result from proposed public and private development projects.
                                                                                        Page 1 of 20
         Present and future noise levels are shown in this document. They are stated in terms of
day/night sound levels (Ldn). This is the preferred format for implementing the State of
California’s Noise Insulation standards. The following section of this element presents an
explanation of the concepts of environmental noise and how it is evaluated.
Effects of Noise on People
         Hearing Loss: When sounds are too intense and prolonged, the hearing receptor cells,
or ‘hair cells’, can be damaged. The inner ear (cochlea) is a coiled tube about 34 millimeters
long, containing about 17,000 hair cells. Hearing loss can occur along all parts of the cochlea.
Thus, the degree of hearing loss depends only on the severity of injury at any one location, but
upon the spread of hearing loss in the inner ear. Hearing loss usually occurs above the
speaking ranges and spreads downward. Damage can, therefore, be substantial before hearing
loss is noticed.
         Most experts believe that noise levels of 70 dBA or more contribute to loss of hearing
over a lifetime. Clear evidence is available that noises about 80 dBA can contribute to inner ear
damage and eventually hearing loss if they are frequently and regularly encountered. Trucks,
trains, sports cars, and motorcycles all exceed 80 dBA at 50 feet. Amplified music at close
range may reach 120 dBA. In industry, excessively loud machinery is common.
         Speech and Sleep Interference: Speech interference begins occurring at about 40 – 45
dBA and becomes severe at 60 dBA and above. Excessive background noise can reduce the
amount and quality of verbal exchange and adversely affect education, family life-styles,
occupational efficiency, and the quality of one’s relaxation.
         To protect a person from sleep interference sound levels should not rise about 35 – 40
dBA. Whether a person is actively awakened by a particular noise will depend upon noise
levels, characteristics of the noise, stage of sleep, the person’s motivation to awaken, age, sex,
and so on. Elderly people and persons who are ill are particularly susceptible to sleep
interference cause by noise.
         Stress Inducement: Noise as a source of stress is a likely contributor to what many
medical authorities believe are stress-related diseases such as ulcers, high blood pressure,
heart disease, and arthritis. As a source of stress, noise may also be a contributing factor in
mental illness, anxiety, and psychological distress. This distress, in turn, can lead to instability,
sexual impotency, headaches, nausea, general anxiety, and changes in general mood.
         Performance and Learning: Work performance can be adversely affected by noise
through distraction and through the physical reactions previously described. While noise does
not seem to have an affect on overall work productivity, it can reduce accuracy of work,
particularly of complex tasks, and inhibit learning. Even if it does not do this, the price may be
increased fatigue, distraction, and irritability on the part of the employee or student. Studies
conducted in Europe recommend 55 dBA as an upper limit for peak-interfering noise in
classrooms.
         Annoyance: Many factors affect how annoyed people will be by environmental noise. A
first consideration is the characteristics of the noise itself including loudness, duration,
steadiness, or whether it contains speech or music. Secondly, background noise levels affect
the determination of how intrusive a particular noise is perceived. Thirdly, the time of day and
seasonal variations can make a difference. People are most likely to be disturbed at home, at
night, and during warm weather.
                                                                                          Page 2 of 20

         The number of people disturbed by noise generally goes up as noise levels increase.
Predicting annoyance responses to noise in particular situations is difficult. Individuals who
complain are generally not unusually physically sensitive to loud sounds. They do tend to have
higher incomes and levels of education than those who do not complain. Community side
annoyance response also depends on leadership within the community and a total sense of
community by the population.
         Complaints are not, then, a very good criteria to apply in setting protective noise
standards. As a result, criteria bases on the harmful and disturbing effects of noise on persons
have emerged as more objective, measurable, and protective approaches to the problem of
setting noise standards.
Measurement and Management of Environmental Noise
         Sound travels through the air as waves of minute air pressure fluctuations caused by
some types of vibrations. In general, sound waves travel away from the noise source as an
expanding spherical surface. The energy contained in a sound wave is consequently spread
over an increasing area as it travels away from the source. The result is a decrease in loudness
at greater distances from the noise source.
         The human ear is subject to a wide range of sound intensities and people hear changes
in sound in proportion to those intensities. The decibel (dB) scale is a logarithmic scale used to
compress this range. The threshold of human hearing corresponds roughly to 0 db. Figure 1
shows the sound levels of typical sources encountered in the environment. The “A” weighting
scale, that which most closely resembles human hearing, is used in this plan and is noted by the
symbol (dBA).
         Varying noise levels are often described in terms of the equivalent constant decibel
level. Equivalent noise levels (Leq) are used to develop single-value descriptions of average
noise exposure over various periods of time. Such average exposure ratings often include
additional weighting factors for annoyance potential because of time of day or other
considerations. In this general plan, the time-varying character of environmental daytime and
nighttime noises and is used as the basis noise impact evaluation and for land use planning
criteria.
         Ambient noise levels constitute the composite from all sources far and near. In this
context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise
at a given location.
         Parameters used when estimating traffic noise relate to the traffic, the roadway and the
receiver. Traffic parameters affecting noise are the number and type of vehicles passing a point
during a particular time period and the average speed of the vehicles. Roadway variables
include its surface, gradient and geometry.
         Highway noise increases as the number and average speed of automobiles on it
increases. For example, if the automobile traffic volume doubles, the noise level from those
autos increases by about 3 dbA. However, if the speed decreases to half, the noise level from
autos decrease by about 6 dbA. The engine exhaust system and tire roadway interaction
contribute prominently to overall automobile noise.
                                                                                        Page 3 of 20

         Truck noise behaves differently. Nose from tires, exhaust, intake engine and gears all
contribute to the total noise environment. An average truck generates A-levels about 15 dbA
higher than the average car. The condition of the truck’s muffler is particularly important.
Another significant difference between the two vehicle sources is that the main noise from autos
is from tires, whereas from heavy trucks it is the exhaust stack.
         When distance is the only factor considered, sound levels from an isolated noise source
will typically decrease by about 6 db for every doubling of distance from the source. When the
noise source is essentially a continuous line (e.g., vehicle traffic on a highway), noise levels
decrease by about 3 db for every doubling of distance.
         Receiver parameters are those, which affect the relationship of the receiver’s position to
the vehicle-roadway noise source. The distance between the observer and the highway is the
most significant factor. The greater the distance, the lower the noise level. Doubling the
distance from the highway (for example going from 100 to 200 feet) reduces the average traffic
noise at the receiver’s position by about 4 to 6 dbA.
         Railroad noises may also be measured and compared using Ldn levels as a basis for
evaluation. Railway noise is produced by the combination of diesel engine noise and railway
car noise. Other variables are distance to the receiver, numbers of train operations, speed of
the trains and numbers of cars per train. Engine air horns and grade crossing warning are
treated as single event noises.
         Noise from overhead aircraft around general aviation airports is evaluated based on the
number of daytime and nighttime operations for jet and non-jet takeoffs and landings. Ldn
contours are drawn, which include consideration of aircraft altitude and other surrounding noise
sources.
         Noise levels are mapped using Noise Exposure Contours. They are lines drawn about a
noise source, which indicate constant energy levels of noise exposure. The contours are
usually drawn in Ldn levels.
         Numerous criteria have been developed over the years for assessing the acceptability of
community noise levels, including many more or less complicated procedures for assessing
annoyance.
         Federal Agency Guidelines
         The federal Noise Control Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-574), established a requirement
that all federal agencies must administer their program in a manner that promotes an
environment free from noise that jeopardizes public health or welfare. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) was given the responsibility for providing information to the public
regarding identifiable effects of noise on public health and welfare, publishing information on
levels of environmental noise that will protect the public health and welfare with tan adequate
margin of safety, coordinating federal research and activities related to noise control, and
establishing federal noise emission standards for selected products distributed in interstate
commerce. The federal Noise Control Act also directed that all federal agencies comply with
applicable federal, state, interstate, and local noise control regulations.

NOTE: A ten (10) decibel increase in sound level on dB(A) scale doubles the apparent loudness or
annoyance of the sound
                                                                                               Page 5 of 20

         Although the EPA was given major coordination roles regarding public information and
federal agencies, each federal agency retains authority to adopt noise regulations pertaining to
agency programs. The EPA, however, can require other federal agencies to justify their noise
regulation in terms of the federal Noise Control Act policy requirements. The Occupational
Safety and Health Administration retain primary authority for setting workplace noise standards.
Because of aviation safety consideration, the Federal Aviation Administration retains primary
jurisdiction over aircraft noise standards. These standards apply to evaluation of aircraft noise
levels at the Red Bluff municipal airport.
         In response to the requirement of the federal Noise Control Act, the EPA has identified
indoor and outdoor noise limits to protect public health and welfare (e.g. hearing damage, sleep
disturbance, and communication disruption). Ldn values of 55 db outdoors and 45 db indoors
are identified as desirable to protect against speech interference and sleep disturbance for
residential, educational and health care areas. The noise level criterion to protect against
hearing damage in commercial and industrial areas is identified as a 24-hour Leq value of 70 db
(outdoors and indoors).
         The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has adopted criteria for determining
whether the noise impacts associated with federally funded highway projects are sufficient to
justify noise mitigation actions (47 FR 131:29653-29656). The FHWA noise abatement criteria
are based on peak-hour Leq noise levels, not Ldn or 24-hour Leq values. The peak 1-hour Leq
criteria for residential, educational, and health care facilities are 67 db outdoors and 52 db
indoors. The peak 1-hour Leq criterion for commercial and industrial areas is 72 lb (outdoors).
These criteria would be used if the City of Red Bluff were to participate in federally funded
highway projects.
         The relationship between peak-hour Leq value and associated Ldn values depends
upon the distribution of traffic over the day. A peak-hour Leq value cannot be converted
precisely to an Ldn value. Hoever, in areas with heavy traffic, the peak-hour Leq is typically 2 to
4 lb lower than the daily Ldn value. In less heavily developed areas, the peak-hour Leq is often
equal to the daily Ldn value. For rural area with little nighttime traffic, the peak-hour Leq value
will often be 3 to 4 db greater than the daily Ldn values. The average difference between the
peak-hour and the Ldn level in Red Bluff is about a 2 to 3 db higher peak than Ldn levels.
         The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has established guidelines for
evaluating noise impacts on residential projects seeking financial support under various grant
program (44 FR 135:408060-40866). Sites are generally considered acceptable for residential
sue if they are exposed to outdoor Ldn values of 65 db or less. Site are considered ‘normally
unacceptable’ if they are exposed to outdoor Ldn values of 65—75 db and completely
unacceptable if outdoor Ldn values are above 75 db. These criteria must be considered when
the City of Red Bluff evaluates potential sites for federally funded housing projects.
         State Guidelines and Local Standards
         The California Department of Health Services (DHS) has published guidelines for the
preparation of noise elements of local general plans. This city noise element is in compliance
with those guidelines. The Guidelines include a noise level/land use compatibility chart, Figure
2 that categorizes various outdoor Ldn ranges into four compatibility categories (normally
acceptable, conditionally acceptable, normally unacceptable and clearly unacceptable),
depending upon land use. For some land uses, the chart shows overlapping Ldn ranges of two
                                                                                         Page 6 of 20

or more computability categories. The City of Red Bluff, by adoption of this element, has
adopted these standards for new development.
         This Red Bluff General Plan Noise Element identifies the normally acceptable range for
low-density residential uses as less than 60 db, while the conditionally acceptable range is 55—
70 db. The normally acceptable range for medium and high-density residential uses is identified
as Ldn values below 70 db. For educational and medical facilities, Ldn values below 70 db are
considered normally acceptable, while Ldn valies of 60—70 db are considered conditionally
acceptable. For office and commercial uses, Ldn values below 70 are considered normally
acceptable, while Ldn values of 67.5 to 77.5 are categorized as conditionally acceptable.
         The local standard for noise levels near existing airports in Tehama County is 60 dBA
Ldn for residential areas or other sensitive receptors. Figure 3 from the Comprehensive Airport
Land Use Plan show detailed Airport/Land use Noise Compatibility Criteria. A map of airport
noise contours from that plan is also included here as Figure 4. Title 21 Section 5012 of the
California Public Utilities Code states, “No airport proprietor or a noise problem airport shall
operate an airport with a noise impact area based on the standard of 65 dB CNEL unless the
operator has applied for or received a variance […]” The Red Bluff airport is not in violation of
Section 5012 nor will it be in violation within the next fifteen years.
         The relative acceptability or unacceptability of particular land uses with respect to the
noise levels to which they would be exposed is indicated in the Airport/Land Use Noise
Compatibility Criteria Matrix. These criteria shall be the principal determinants of whether a
proposed land use is compatible with the noise would affect the specific proposal’s sensitivity
(e.g., the extent or lack of outdoor activity) also shall be taken into account.
         The California Department of Housing and Community Development has adopted noise
insulation performance standards for new hotels, motels, and dwellings other than detached
single-family structures (24 Cal. Adm. Code 25—28). These standards require that “interior Ldn
with windows closed, attributable to exterior sources, shall not exceed an annual Ldn of 45 db in
any habitable room.” These standards are required to apply to conditions for issuance of
building permits for all such multifamily dwellings in California and all single-family units to be
located in Red Bluff.
         The California Vehicle Code includes limits for noise emissions from motor vehicles.
Enforcement of these sections (figure 5) is done by the California Highway Patrol and local law
enforcement agencies.

LAND USE ACCEPTABILITY                         INTERPRETATION/CONDITIONS
   ++    Clearly Acceptable      The activities associated with the specified land use
                                 can be carried out with essentially no interference
                                 from the noise exposure.
    +    Normally Acceptable     Noise is a factor to be considered in that slight
                                 interference with outdoor activities may occur.
                                 Conventional construction methods will eliminate
                                 most noise intrusions upon indoor activities.
    0    Marginally Acceptable   The indicated noise exposure will cause moderate
                                 interference with outdoor activities and with indoor
                                 activities when windows are open. The Land Use is
                                 acceptable on the conditions that outdoor activities
                                 are minimal and construction features, which provide
                                 sufficient noise attenuation, are used (e.g., installation
                                 of air conditioning so that windows can be kept
                                 closed). Under other circumstances, the Land Use
                                 should be discouraged.
   --    Normally Unacceptable   Noise will create substantial interference with both
                                 outdoor and indoor activities. Noise intrusion upon
                                 indoor activities can be mitigated by requiring special
                                 noise insulation construction. Land uses, which have
                                 conventionally constructed structures and/or involve
                                 outdoor activities, which would be disrupted by noise
                                 should generally be avoided.
  -- --  Clearly Unacceptable    Unacceptable noise intrusion upon Land Use
                                 activities will occur. Adequate structural noise
                                 insulation is not practical under most circumstances.
                                 The indicated land use should be avoided unless
                                 strong overriding factors prevail and it should be
                                 prohibited if outdoor activities are involved.

Noise Issues in Red Bluff
         At various times throughout the spring of 1993, noise levels were recorded in several
locations in Red Bluff. Both peak hour were recorded in several locations in Red Bluff. Both
peak hour and 24 hour levels were recorded in 15 minute samples with a 13 Bruel and Kjar
(B&J) Model 166 noise classifier, which was calibrated before each set of readings were taken.
Procedures for taking the sound level samples were those presented in FHWA-DP-45-1R,
Sound Procedures for Measuring Highway Noise: Final Report.
         The field readings were also used to calculate a computerized noise prediction model
using EPA and Federal Highway Administration procedures for noise prediction. U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Guidelines were used for railroad and
aircraft noise prediction. The computer predicted levels approximate the field measurements
within 1 to 3 dbA.
         Current and predicted noise level contours in Red Bluff are presented in Figures 6, 7, 8
and 9. The 60 db contour lines on the map included in this element (Appendix A) indicate
where there may be conditions exceeding of the City noise standards. When compared with the
land use map and field observation it may be seen that the following locations are now
experiencing or will experience noise problems in the future.
         Areas affected by noise from freeway traffic and lying within the 60 dBA contours
include:
                 All developable areas on Messer Road
                 The eastern portions of Brearcliffe and Homstead Drives
                 The easternmost portions of Walton and Wenmark Roads
                 The area zoned R-Mf adjacent to the west side of the freeway south of the
                 Antelope interchange
                 The R-L area transected by Adobe Road bounded on the west by Main Street
                 and on the east by I-5
                 The area east of I-5 south of Grasshopper Creek in the R-L zone
                                                                                    Page 11 of 20

       Areas affected by both freeway and railroad noise are the R-L and R-Lf areas east of
Montgomery Street and west of South Main Street and any areas considered for development
between Hess Road and Interstate-5.
       The River Oaks Mobil Home Park west of the I-5 corridor near the downtown area is
subject to noise from highway, which has been reported to CalTrans. At the edge of the
freeway right-of-way, the L10 (peak) noise level is 75 dBA. At vacant spaces 80 feet distant
from the edge of the right-of-way, the recorded level is 72 dBA. This exceeds the City standard
for new construction.
       Areas throughout the City affected by railroad operations are:
               Montgomery Road, Hinkle Road, James Avenue, Duncan Road and Thompson
               Place
               The area north of Breckenridge Street, east of a line along Jefferson Avenue and
               Oriole Drive extending to Highway 36 and east to the railroad
               The area between Hess Road and the railroad
               South of Oak Street along Madison Street, west of Washington Street to Willow
               Street on the south and east of the railroad
       Part of the noise impact area, the Ingot Estates Subdivision, required a special railroad
noise study, which indicated that:
               Calculations of the day-night noise level (Ldn), using the HUD model, produce
               values of 79 dB at 100 feet and 76 dB at 150 feet. The 65 Ldn line lies 600 feet
               from the edge of the tracks. The factor with the greatest influence of these Ldn
               values is the presence of the grade crossing and the need to use warning horns
               by trains within one-quarter mile of the crossing.
       Areas within the 60 dBA airport noise contour are:
               South of Walnut Street, east of Michael Drive, north of Stonybrook Drive and
               west of David Avenue
               North of Walnut, south of Brickyard Creek, east of Baker Road and west of Hook
               Road zoned R-L and R-Lf.
               Homes on Paskenta Road west of Michael Drive, north of Stonybrook Drive and
               south of Walnut Street
       The only sensitive residential area affected by traffic noise from City arterials includes
the home facing South Main Street between Willow Street and Aloha Street.
       Other sensitive receptor within the 60 dBA contours are:
               Tehama County Library, 645 Madison Street (Railroad)
               Brentwood Convalescent Hospital, 1795 Walnut Street (Airport)
                                                                                      Page 14 of 20
                 St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, 2550 Sister Mary Columbia Drive (Freeway)
                 Antelope School, 22630 Antelope Blvc. (Arterial)
                 Jackson Heights School, 225 Jackson Street (Railroad)
        Noise from local truck traffic is particularly noticeable on Antelope Blvd, Walnut Street,
Luther Road, Main Street and Jackson Street. Again, this is generally within the City standards
for nonresidential land uses, but noise from diesel engines and refrigerator box motors left on
for extended periods of time could cause complaints.
        The most frequent noise complaints to the City Police Department is usually from
barking dogs or from social events (parties) in residential areas. Both of these situations are
more in the form of annoyances best addressed with a noise ordinance rather than with land
use regulations.
        It is expected that some periodic peak noises from agricultural operations in the area
        may exceed desired ambient levels. There is no accepted standard for these levels and
        they are not considered a significant problem in Red Bluff.
        The Red Bluff Airport Land Use Plan states: “the 2005 60CNEL (Ldn) contour is as
        shown on the Airport Master Plan and affects little territory outside the airport boundary.”
                                                                                      Page 15 of 20

Findings
         Objectionable noise from transportation facilities and stationary sources can have, and in
some areas do have, a significant potential for impact on public health and welfare.
         Future development along railroads lines and highways, if allowed, could cause
significant noise problems.
         Residential development near the airport, if allowed, could cause significant noise
problems.
         Some land uses in Red Bluff are not currently compatible with existing noise levels and
activities.
         The Land Use in Red Bluff General Plan state, “The expected growth and development
in Red Bluff will increase noise levels along principal arterials and collector roadways and will
expose people to elevated noise levels along those and the railroad corridors through the
community (p. 45).”
Goals, Policies and Implementation Measures
         Noise Goals
         1.     Reduce outdoor noise levels in existing residential areas where economically and
                aesthetically feasible.
         2.     Ensure that new development conforms to City noise level standards
         3.     Locate new noise sensitive land uses away from noise sources unless mitigation
                measures are included in development plans.
         4.     Correct or prevent point source noises that have been demonstrated to be
                annoying to nearby residents.
         5.     Plan and design new streets or other public facilities to minimize noise in
                adjacent areas.
         6.     Follow policies and noise mitigation measures contained in the Airport Land Use
                master Plan adopted by the Tehama County Airport Land Use Commission.
         Noise Policies
         1.     Establish buffer areas between sensitive land uses and noise sources.
         2.     Establish buffers where necessary to ensure that residential, hospital, retirement
                care and recreational areas are not particularly subject to excessive noise levels.
         3.     Require noise mitigation measures when new residences are built in proximity to
                major transportation
                                                                                      Page 16 of 20

4.     Adopt and implement section III D (page 58) of the Red Bluff Land Development
      Policies in the Land Use Element to set noise buffering standards within the
      noise corridors.
5.    Require environmental impact reports and/or project initial studies to include a
      thorough noise analysis for residential projects and all other projects involving
      other projects involving other sensitive receptors such as schools and health care
      facilities. All new projects within the noise overlay zones shall also require a
      project level noise analysis.
6.    Encourage and plan for airport development and discourage noise-sensitive
      activities near the municipal airport.
7.    Locate recreational activities that have a potential to cause excessive noise away
      from noise sensitive land uses.
Noise Programs
1.    Adopt and enforce an appropriate noise ordinance.
                The City of Red Bluff is considering the adoption of a noise ordinance to
      regulate noise sources located on private property. The ordinance prohibits the
      generation of noise levels that increase background 15-minute Leq values
      bymore than 5 dbA on adjoining residential property, or by more than 8 dbA on
      adjoining commercial or industrial property. The ordinance also prohibits noise
      sources on public property if background 15-minute Leq values are increased by
      more than 15 dbA at a distance of 25 feet from the noise source. The ordinance
      contains several exemptions for alarms and warning devices, daytime
      construction activities, emergencies, public safety activities and related
      situations. The ordinance also provides a permit procedure to authorize
      exemptions for special events or situations where it is impractical to comply with
      ordinance provisions.
2.    Utilize the noise corridor overlays as designated in the Land Use Element
      of the Red Bluff General Plan and delineated on Appendix A of this Noise
      Element.
                 A noise corridor overlay is proposed to be designated for all residential
      districts through which freeway, state highway or active railway right-of-ways are
      present. The corridor overlay shall require, at the discretion of the Planning
      Commission, a noise buffer between the noise source and occupied structures
      within the proposed development area. Use of the buffer zone maybe required to
      comply with Title 24 criteria for multifamily dwellings and for the community noise
      level standards set forth in this General Plan Noise Element. The criteria for the
      overlay is as follows:
              A. Buffer Zone Width
              The following distances from the edge of the roadway to the nearest
              occupied structure, without a noise attenuation barrier at the edge of the
              right-of-way or at the occupied structure property boundary, may be
              required: Freeway corridor – 450 feet, Railroad Corridor – 600 feet, State
              highways and urban arterials – 100 feet. These distances can be greatly
                                                                              Page 17 of 20

          reduced with the construction of noise barriers as close to the noise source
          as possible. These standards reflect worst-case predictions of future noise
          impacts from transportation sources. See Appendix A for a more accurate
          delineation of noise contours and the requirements of barriers or other
          mitigations may be modified after analysis by a qualified professional.
          B. Barrier specification
          Noise mitigation barriers should be constructed as specified in item 3
          below.
          C. Buffer Zone Uses
          Vegetation and land contours should be retained whenever possible in the
          buffer zone. Only accessory structures and fencing are recommended for
          occupancy of the buffer zones.
          D. Density Transfer
          Transfers of residential densities to accommodate noise buffer zones may
          be permitted in accordance with the character of the development site and
          by means of the approach given in Section III (B) of the Land Development
          Policies in the Land Use Element.
3. Implement staff and Planning Commission review of potential noise issues
   in new project location and design features.
            By taking advantage of the natural shape and terrain of a site, it is often
   possible to arrange buildings and other uses in ways that will reduce or eliminate
   noise impacts. Site planning techniques include increasing the distance between
   the noise source and the receiver; placing non-noise sensitive land uses such as
   parking lots, maintenance facilities, and utility areas between the source and the
   receive; using non-noise sensitive structures such as garages to shield noise-
   sensitive area; and orienting buildings to shield outdoor spaces from a noise
   source.
            In many cases, noise reduction can be attained by careful layout of noise-
   sensitive spaces. Bedrooms, for example, should be placed away from busy
   roadways. Quiet outdoor spaces can be provided next to a noisy highway by
   creating a U-shaped development that faces away from the highway.
            Noise barriers or walls are commonly used to reduce noise levels from
   ground transportation noise sources. Noise barriers serve a dual purpose in that
   they can reduce both outdoor and indoor noise levels. To be effective, a noise
   barrier must be large enough to prevent significant noise transmission through it.
   It also must be high and long enough to shield the receiver from the noise
   source. A safe minimum surface weight for a noise barrier is 3.5 pounds per
   square foot of masonry or similar construction. The barrier must be constructed
   so that there are no creaks or openings in it. To be effective, a barrier must
   intercept the line of noise between the noise source and the receiver.
            An important and often overlooked consideration in the design of noise
   barriers is the phenomenon of ‘flanking’. This is a term used to describe the
   manner by which a noise barrier’s effectiveness is compromised by noise
   passing around the end of a barrier. Short barriers, regardless of height, provide
                                                                         Page 18 of 20

   little reduction in overall noise level. The effects of flanking can be minimized by
   blending the wall away from the noise source at the ends of the barrier.
             If site planning, architectural layout, noise barriers, or a combination of
   these measures do not achieve the required noise reduction, walls, roofs,
   ceilings, doors, windows and other structural features of buildings may need
   modified.
4. Implement staff and Planning Commission analysis of potential noise
   problems in proposed rezonings and general plan amendments.
             Where land use changes are being considered, it is appropriate to
   evaluate the potential for one land use to conflict with another through direct
   generation of noise or through generation of traffic, which may, in turn, generate
   additional noise. New or revisions of City zoning and land use map designations
   should include requirement for distance buffers or constructed barriers between
   incompatible land uses before the proposed land use change is approved. It
   should not be the City’s policy or procedure to approve land use changes that
   may create noise problems with the expectation that new development applicants
   will mitigate those problems.
5. Incorporate the noise mitigations identified in initial studies and EIRs for
   new projects as conditions for approval. Examples of such mitigations or
   conditions are:
           A. Development plans shall include features that will mitigate noise
                impacts originating from project development that will exceed General
                Plan Noise Element guidelines.
           B. Development plans shall include mitigation in the form of shielding or
                building insulation from off site noises that exceed General Plan Noise
                Element Standards on site.
           C. The owner shall retain a Certified Planner, Acoustical Engineer, or other
                qualified professional to design noise attenuation features for projects
                that present special acoustical problems.
           D. Construction activities shall be limited to daylight hours. Construction
                equipment shall be in good working condition and shall incorporate
                abatement measures shown in Figure 10 where deemed feasible by
                City Staff.
           E. Acoustical Screening shall be provided around mechanical equipment in
                a manner approved by City staff.
                                                                             Page 19 of 20

      6.   For properties otherwise approved for development within one half mile of
           the municipal airport, within the Airport Land use Planning Area delineated
           by the Tehama County Airport Land Use Commission and under the Air
           Traffic Pattern adopted by the City, a grant of aviation easement shall be
           required.
                   Such agreements should contain perpetual easement and right-of-way for
           the unobstructed passage of all aircraft in the airspace above the property and
           the right to cause in all airspace about the surface of the property such noise or
           other effects that may be caused by the operation of aircraft landing at, or taking
           off from, or operating at or on the Red Bluff Municipal Airport.

SAFETY ELEMENT
 I.   INTRODUCTION
      A.    PURPOSE OF THE SAFETY ELEMENT
                      The purpose of the Safety Element is to make the City of Red Bluff aware
            of any natural or human induced hazard or safety problems so that planning
            decisions may be influenced by this knowledge, and to encourage adoption of
            developmental and emergency planning practices designed to reduced loss of
            life, injuries, property damage, and economic and social dislocation which might
            otherwise result. The Safety Element is intended to identify risks from major
            hazards or safety problems in Red bluff, and to provide an assessment of
            existing protection services and suggest options the community might pursue in
            order to improve its level of public safety. In this regard, the Safety Element is
            the primary vehicle for relating local safety planning to city land use decisions
            and a city should establish land use planning policies and standards based on
            the analyses provided within it. The Safety Element is mandated by the State of
            California in Government Code Section 65302(g):
                      A Safety element for the protection of the community from any
            unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced
            surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and
            dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
            subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to
            Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of Division 2 of the Public
            Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative
            body; flooding; and wild land and urban fires. The safety element shall
            include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall
            also address evacuation routes, military installations, peakload water
            supply requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around
            structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.
            (1) Prior to the periodic review of its general plan and prior to preparing or
                 revising its safety element, each city and county shall consult the
                 California Geological Survey of the Department of Conservation and
                 the Office of Emergency Services for the purpose of including
                 information known by and available to the department and the office
                 required by this subdivision.
            (2) To the extent that a county’s safety element is sufficiently detailed and
                 contains appropriate policies and programs for adoption by a city, a
                 city may adopt that portion of the county’s safety element that pertains
                 to the city’s planning area in satisfaction of the requirement imposed
                 by this subdivision
                      The Safety Element has been developed to both correlate and be
            consistent with the other six mandated elements in the Red Bluff General Plan.
            The general plan purposes, processes, and a detail description of the planning
            area and the city sphere-of-influence to be considered are all discussed in the
            introduction to the Land Use Element.
                                                                                     Page 1 of 28

        The concept of public safety expressed in this element is based upon the
following assumptions:
1.      That natural hazard systems are an unavoidable aspect of life and that
        not every degree of risk or all hazards can be fully eliminated (e.g.,
        volcanic eruptions)
2.      That the impacts of some natural hazards can be increased by human
        activities (e.g., flooding)
3.      That there are human-induced safety problems which can be dealt with in
        a parallel manner to natural hazards (e.g., hazardous materials)
4.      That public policy and action are appropriate in a community to mitigate
        against hazards which: (a) have a high degree of risk to the general
        public or (b) have a relatively low risk but which would be considered
        disasters should the hazardous event occur.
                                                                        Page 2 of 28
B. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES FOR
   PUBLIC SAFETY
   1.    GOAL:       PUBLIC SAFETY
         To protect the community of Red Bluff from injury, loss of life, and
         property damage resulting from natural catastrophes and any hazardous
         conditions.
   2.    GOAL:       SEISMIC SAFETY
         To effectively minimize risks associated with seismic hazards by
         regulating the design and siting of new development in the City of Red
         Bluff.
         OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES:
         a.      Require a review of all potential geological hazards, including
                 seismic hazards, for all new developments in identified hazardous
                 areas.
         b.      Avoid placement of critical structures, public facilities, and high-
                 occupancy structures in areas prone to ground failure during an
                 earthquake.
         c.      Establish acceptable seismic safety standards so that all new
                 building shall be constructed to resist the stresses and ground
                 shaking produced during earthquakes.
         IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
         a.      Record information on potential geologic and seismic hazards with
                 parcel or subdivision maps.
         b.      Review Building Code requirements to determine the adequacy of
                 standards necessary to protect against all seismic hazards and to
                 assure that the Code is current with the latest technological
                 advances.
         c.      Develop programs in cooperation with other public agencies to
                 increase public awareness of seismic hazards and to educate the
                 citizens of Red Bluff on public and private actions that can help to
                 minimize injury and property loss before, during, and after an
                 earthquake.
                                                                            Page 3 of 28
3. GOAL:      GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS SAFETY
   New development proposed within areas of potential geological hazards
   shall not be endangered by, nor contribute to, the hazardous conditions
   on the site or an adjoining properties.
   OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
   a.      Adequate mitigation shall be required on sites with landslide
           potential, or erodible soils to protect against injury and property
           damage and to assure a level of development, which will not
           accelerate runoff or degrade water quality.
   b.      Replanting of vegetation following development shall be required
           on all slopes prone to erosion and / or instability. Drought-
           resistant plant types shall be used for landscaping on post-
           development slopes where excess watering might induce land
           slippage or soil erosion.
   c.      Discourage clustering of development away from areas
           considered geologically unstable.
   d.      Require protection of exposed soil from erosion during the wet
           season.
   e.      Require topsoil to be stockpiled and reapplied upon completion of
           grading to promote vegetative regrowth where feasible.
   f.      Prohibit earthmoving operations in areas of high soil and slope
           erosion hazard potential during the wet season unless
           preauthorized. If such activities are not allowed, measures for
           sediment containment and erosion control must be in place at the
           conclusion of each day’s work.
   g.      Require approval of final site development plans, including
           drainage and erosion control plans, in areas subject to high
           erosion hazard potential prior to authorization of any initial grading
           and clearing activities.
   IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
   a.      Adopt and enforce a comprehensive Grading and Erosion Control
           Ordinance, requiring control of existing erosion problems as well
           as the installation of erosion, sediment, and runoff control
           measures in new developments.
   b.      Adopt regulations relative to zoning and subdivision ordinances
           which regulate land alternatives, road construction or structural
           development on slopes of 15% or greater.
                                                                     Page 4 of 28

4.       GOAL:      FLOOD HAZARD SAFETY
         To protect new and existing structures and surfaces from flood damage in
order to minimize the economic impacts and threats to public safety. To prevent
adverse impacts on drainage basins and stream channels, and to maintain their
beneficial function for runoff, water storage and transports, and protection of
biotic resources.
         OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
         a.     Protect the Red Bluff community from risk of flood damage.
         b.     Approve only those new development proposals that do not
                compound or impact the potential for damage from flooding in
                developed areas or adjacent properties.
         c.     Deny any development proposal, which would disrupt existing
                drainage channels, in such a manner that total site runoff would
                be impeded.
         d.     Require that any increased runoff from a proposed grading or
                development site be effectively channeled into existing storm
                drains and not as overland flow onto adjoining properties.
         e.     Ensure that any development plan does not serve to aggravate
                the flooding potential of the streams that flow through Red Bluff,
                especially at times of peak flow.
         f.     The City shall regulate land uses in flood-prone areas and should
                allow development only in those areas with appropriate mitigation.
         g.     The City should promote community awareness regarding the
                severity and extent of potential local flooding.
         IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
         a.     Utilize the 100-year flood profile for all streams as a basis for
                evaluating future land use in flood plain areas.
         b.     Enact an ordinance regulating siting of new development within
                the flood plain, and specific regulations for spacing development
                near stream channels and channels slopes, with at least a 50-foot
                setback from stream banks.
         c.     Develop a flood warning system in order to alert residents in flood
                prone areas.
         d.     Strictly enforce existing City (and County) ordinances preventing
                building fences, dumping trash and fill, altering vegetation, or
                construction within the mainstream channels.
                                                                         Page 5 of 28
        e.       Construct storm drainage improvements in order to correct
                 identified significant flood prone portions of the urban area.
        f.       Maintain culverts and drainage facilities on public roads, and
                 eliminate obstructions from existing drainage ways.
5.      GOAL:        FIRE HAZARD SAFETY
        To protect the public from wildland and urban fire hazards and reduce the
risks of wildfires and structural conflagrations by mitigating or minimizing use and
development in high fire hazard areas, and by maximizing fire prevention
measures and citizen awareness of fire hazards.
        OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
        a.       All new development shall be constructed, at a minimum, to the
                 fire safety standards contained in the locally-adopted Uniform Fire
                 and Building Codes.
        b.       Require all new development, including single-family dwellings on
                 existing parcels of record, to provide adequate access for fire
                 protection.
        c.       Amend City ordinances to include specific road standards
                 developed in conjunction with the Red Bluff Fire Department.
        d.       It shall be the City’s goal to maintain a maximum response time of
                 6 minutes to 90% of the city’s emergency calls and field an initial
                 assignment of 12 firefighters within 10 minutes total.
        e.       Maintain an average response time for three-four minutes to all
                 areas of the City.
        f.       Provide adequate water supplies for fire fighting, especially at
                 times of peak demand.
        g.       Discourage new development on the periphery of the urban area
                 where wildfire risks are high due to natural factors or provide
                 adequate mitigation measures to address the elevated fire threat.
        IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
        a.       Enforce the existing City ordinance regarding weed abatement on
                 all lots and larger properties within city limits.
        b.       Adopt an ordinance for the provision of fire-resistant materials and
                 landscaping, and the use of early warning systems such as
                 sprinklers with alarms for all new developments.
                                                                          Page 6 of 28

        c.       To the maximum extent feasible conduct periodic inspections of
                 vacant properties to ensure that dry weeds and other combustible
                 fuels are not permitted to accumulate.
        d.       Adopt a policy for providing adequate water supply for fire fighting
                 purposes to all parts of the airport.
        e.       Adopt a policy for ensuring a rational system of signing and
                 mapping for City structure, and for detailed mapping of each
                 dwelling in multi-residence structures for aid in location by fire
                 fighting units.
        f.       Continue to provide staffing for fire fighting personnel within
                 acceptable guidelines.
6.      GOAL:       PUBLIC PROTECTION SERVICES
        Maintain public safety services (police and fire) at an approved and
effective level.
        OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
        a.       Level of service for personnel, equipment, and facilities for policy
                 and fire protection services to the greatest possible extent shall be
                 maintained.
        b.       A goal of a ratio of two sworn police officers per 1,000 city
                 population shall be regarded as optimum.
        c.       Involve fire department input in the planning for fire protection
                 services in areas to the south or north of the City of Red Bluff that
                 may extend the response time of the department beyond
                 acceptable limits.
        d.       Incorporate fire and crime prevention measures into development

C. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
   1.       GEOLOGY
            The City of Red Bluff is located in the northern end of the Sacramento
   River Valley of California. The city has developed on a relatively level series of
   terraces on both sides of the Sacramento River at a general elevation of 300-360
   feet above sea level. Red Bluff is surrounded by mountains on three sides, with
   the Coast Ranges roughly 30 miles to the west, the Sierra Nevada about 40
   miles to the east, and the Cascade system about 45 miles to the northeast and
   north. The general topography of the Red Bluff area is one of rolling hills, which
   have been dissected locally by steam flowing, from the adjacent highlands as
   tributaries to the Sacramento River.
            Geologically the region is considered to be part of the Great Valley
   province, which is a 400 mile-long by 60 mile-wide sedimentary basin located
   between the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Rangers. The valley floor and the
   adjacent hills and riverine terraces are thus composed of sedimentary and
   volcanic deposits which differ lithologically from the mainly granitic and
   metamorphic rocks of the Sierra Nevada and the metamorphic rocks of the Coast
   Ranges.
            To the west of the Sacramento River, about 55% of the City of Red Bluff
   lies atop the Tehama Formation. The Tehama Formation is also the major
   geologic unit that underlies the drainage systems west of the city. This formation
   is Upper Pliocene in age and is comprised of non-marine sedimentary rocks. It is
   semi-consolidated and typically fine-grained, both of which are characteristics,
   which influence the general topography and can act to determine natural rates of
   erosion. The rocks of the Tehama Formation are characterized as “poorly sorted
   pale yellow to greenish gray silt, silty clay, locally tuffaceous sand and gravel
   which weather to pale bluff and yellow-brown color” (U.S. Geological Survey,
   1960). The formation also contain scattered lenses of gravel often intermixed
   with a clay or silt matrix. The soil erodibility and landsliding potential of this
                                                                                 Page 8 of 28

formation depends on its composition with silt outcrops being more erodible than
sand or clay (DR, 1991). The Tehama Formation generally weathers into
rounded hills with moderate relief and a thin soil cover. Along stream courses it
is exposed in bluffs from 20 to 60 feet in height.
         Roughly 20% of the City of Red Bluff sits on rocks of the Red Bluff
Formation. This is a coarse gravelly deposit of non-marine sedimentary rocks,
which is Pleistocene in age. The Red Bluff Formation originally formed on a
regional gently inclined erosional surface (the Red Bluff pediment) atop the
Tehama Formation. It is characterized as “well-rounded boulders and gravel
within a tan to brick-red iron-stained matrix of sand and some clay” (USGS,
1960). The Red Bluff Formation underlies the city to the south and southwest
and also outcrops in the northeast, just south of Dibble Creek. In the City of Red
Bluff and in the lower course of Brickyard Creek, the formation is as thick as 30
feet and is very coarse in texture.
         The remaining 25% of the City of Red Bluff has been developed on post-
Pleistocene (recent) river and stream channel deposits in the adjacent to the
valley of the Sacramento River. This includes all of the Red Bluff east of the
Sacramento River and the main course of Reeds Creek. These deposits are
comprised of sand, gravel, silt, and minor amounts of clay, which have been
deposited along channels and atop flood plains, and natural levees of the major
stream. Since these alluvial deposits have been formed by stream erosion
primarily of the older Tehama and Red Bluff formations, their texture is high in
gravel and soils formed on them are generally well drained, have moderate
permeability, and have a high runoff due to reddish clay substrata. Along the
immediate stream courses, alluvial deposits occur as loose unconsolidated sand
and gravel in the active stream channel and as sand, silt and clay intermixed with
lenses of gravel on the flood plain and levees adjacent to the active channel (DR,
1991).
2.       TOPOGRAPHY AND DRAINAGE
         The topography of the City of Red Bluff is gently rolling with little general
relief except along stream courses. Slopes within the city are generally below
ten percent; however, slopes of thirty to seventy percent can occur along stream
banks. Slopes atop riverine terraces and in valley floors are generally less than
five percent.
         The city is crossed from west to east by a sequence of active streams
flowing as tributaries to the Sacramento River. From north to south these are
Blue Tent Creek, Dibble Creek, Brewery Creek, Brickyard Creek, Reeds Creek,
Grasshopper Creek and Red Bank Creek. All of these streams show active
alluvial processes, which include high discharges in the winter-early spring
period, and annual deposition of sand, gravel and silt as they join the
Sacramento River.
         The flooding history of the largest of these streams, Reeds creek, has
generated concern on the part of the Department of Water Resources of the
State of California, which has resulted in two recent studies focusing on this
problem (DR, 1987 and 1991). These studies, corroborated by others in similar
                                                                          Page 9 of 28

locales, clearly demonstrate that human activities in the water-shed upstream
from Red Bluff play a significant role in sedimentation, peaks of water flow, and
erosional capacity streams as they flow downstream across the City of Red Bluff.
Since the city lies at the eastern ends of these drainages and has areas of high
residential densities and paved streets, runoff from these urban surfaces
represent an additional source of water for the channels. At times of peak
discharge, this can lead to localized flooding and the back up of urban drainage
systems. There is a partial levee system along the lower portion of Reeds Creek,
which helps to protect the adjacent urban area from overbank flooding during
periods of high stream flow.
3.       SOILS
         The description of the soils of Red Bluff are provided in the Open Space
and Conservation Elements of this plan. Of special concern in this Safety
Element is the degree to which specific soils can be considered to be hazardous
in term of erodibility or accommodation to a hazardous event such as earthquake
or flooding. Soil erosion is generally of greatest concern on hillsides and along
stream banks where runoff waters reach their highest velocities and can undercut
or carry away ground deposits that support structures. Erosion can also pose a
hazard where runoff materials deposit their sediments, as along stream
confluences with the Sacramento River.
         Soils can serve to increase the seismic hazard in an area by undergoing
liquefaction during the shaking accompanying an earthquake. Additionally, the
high shrink-swell potential of a soil can lead to is classification as an expansive
soil which can lead to problems for the siting of structures upon it. The Tehama
County General Plan (1974) maps nearly all the City of Red Bluff as being
located on “high expansive soils.” This designation is also applied to all surfaces
west of the city regardless of geologic formation, altitude, topography, or changes
of substrata. While there are locally high deposits of weathered secondary
minerals such as clay and also local areas of clay headpans and substrates, this
characterization can only be considered to be too generally for use as a planning
guide.
4.       CLIMATE
         The climate of Red Bluff may be characterized as a subtropical summer-
dry (inland Mediterranean) type. This climate has warm to hot summers and mild
to cool winters, with a distinctive winter precipitation regime. The long, dry
summer period is unique to this climatic type and is a feature shared commonly
with most of the California. The winter season is characterized by the passage of
mid-latitude cyclonic storms (wave cyclones) passing eastward from the Pacific
Ocean and bringing moist, unstable air masses into interior Northern California.
The actual number of storm centers of low pressure, as well as the strengths of
associated cold and warm fronts, is quite different from year to year. This
variability is the primary determinant of precipitation quantities from one year to
another (Table 1).
                                                                         Page 10 of 28

        Red Bluff receives roughly 21.5 inches of precipitation annually, based on
data, which has been collected since 1871. The city is located somewhat in the
rain shadow of the Coast Ranges and precipitation quantities generally increase
to double this amount along the western sides of the Sierra Nevada and three
times as much near Sierran summits to the east. There is a wide fluctuation in
the annual precipitation at Red Bluff, from an absolute minimum of 7.20 inches in
1976 to an absolute maximum of 48.98 inches in 1983. Lengthy periods of wet
years are rate, with the wettest two consecutive seasons providing about 70-80%
greater than normal, and the wettest three consecutive seasons providing about
64% greater than normal (Table 1). Snowfall is infrequent and usually very light
in amount when it does occur. Precipitation during the late spring and summer
months is confined to occasional convectional thundershower activity and is
likewise quite light in amount.
        Winter months are dominated by the passage of storms and by general
cooling. Cooler air tends to settle into the northern Sacramento Valley from
adjacent mountainous area, where radiational cooling during relatively calm,
clear winter night can lead to low temperatures. Winter temperatures range from
a monthly normal of 45.5 F for January to about 54 F March and November.
Absolute minimum of 20 F have been recorded for both December and January.
The rainiest months are between November and March, with 79% of the annual
total being received during those five months. This concentration is significant in
terms of stream regimes and peak periods of runoff leading to a potential flooding
hazard in wet years.
        The summer months are usually quite dry with only about 1.52 inches,
7% of the annual total, arriving in the five-month period of May-September. By
mid-summer the Sacramento Valley is usually occupied by an elongated thermal
low pressure due to intense heating accompanied by an elongated thermal low
pressure due to intense heating of the land surface. The retreat northward of the
winter storm tracks is accompanied by the domination of Northern California by
massive atmospheric subsidence from the eastern margins of the north pacific
subtropical high-pressure system. Warm, dry sinking air masses now dominate
the Sacramento Valley and its foothills bringing clear skies and maximum
sunshine exposure. Winter percentages of possible sunshine ranged from 52%
in December to 69% in March. Summer percentages of possible sunshine range
from 85% in May to 94-96% in July and August – leading to an annual figure of
79% (Table 2). Average summer temperatures range from 71.6 F to April to 98 F
and 95.7 F in July and August. Record high temperatures of 119 F for July and
121 F for August have been recorded, and long periods of daily temperatures
above 90 F are noted (27 for July and 25 for August). Relative humidities during
the mid to late summer are also quite low, ranging between 10-23 % (late
afternoon) for the June-September period.
        The summer patterns of rainfall, sunshine, temperature, and relative
humidity are crucial in explaining the seasonality of the wildland fire hazard in the
Red Bluff region.
        Prevailing winds are up the valley from the southeast and down the valley
from the northwest. Highest wind speeds are usually southerly in association
                                                                       Page 12 of 28

with frontal activity, frequently reaching 50-60 miles per hour (and occasionally
greater) with the strongest fronts (Lingenfelter, 1970). Northerly winds reach
speeds of 30-40 mph and only rarely exceed 50 mph. These winds occur mainly
in the fall-winter-spring month. Persistent radiation and evaporation fogs occur
during winter months under the influence of a stagnant high-pressure system,
and particularly if there are calm conditions and if the ground is saturated from
recent rains. Wind scour acts to relieve foggy conditions; however, it is noted
that the number of foggy days per year is increasing due to human air pollution.
Like snowfall, fog and high wind are not important climatic hazardous variables
on a long-term basis at Red Bluff.

II. POTENTIAL NATURAL HAZARDS
    A.   SEISMIC HAZARDS
         1.       FAULTING AND EARTHQUAKES
                  All aspects of seismic safety are regarded as critically important aspects
         of any general plan Safety Element in California. The primary seismic hazard is
         earthquake activity, which originates as shock waves, generated by faulting –
         movements as rocks are displaced along an active fault. The primary associated
         seismic hazard are ground shaking and the potential for ground rupture along the
         surface traces of the fault line. Secondary seismic hazards result from the
         interaction of ground shaking with existing bedrock and soil conditions and
         include liquefaction, ground subsidence and landslides. Water bodies affected
         by earthquake shock waves may demonstrate tsunamis along seacoasts and
         seiches in enclosed water bodies.
                  The devastating San Fernando earthquake of February 1971 heavily
         influenced the California legislature to codify the codify the approach to planning
         for the earthquake hazard. The Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Act was
         signed into law in December 1972 and went into effect on March 7, 1973. The
         purpose of this Act is to prohibit the location of most structures for human
         occupancy across the traces of active faults and mitigate thereby the hazard of
         fault-rupture (earthquake shaking) (Section 2621.5). Under the Act, the State
         Geologist (Chief of the Division of Mines and Geology) is required to delineate
         “Special Studies Zones” along known active faults in California. Cities and
         counties affected will be provided with Official Maps of these faults in order to
         regulate certain development projects within these zones. They must withhold
         development permits for sites within the special studies zones until detailed
         geologic investigations demonstrate that the sites are not threatened by surface
         displacement from future faulting (CDC, 1990 revision). The mapping of Special
         Studies Zones began in 1973 with attention to the most important known surface
         faults in California (e.g., the San Andreas, Calaveras, Hayward, and San Jacinto
         faults). As of January 1990, 448 Official Maps of Special Studies Zones have
         been issued, and nearly 25% of these have been re-studied and revised.
                  The most recent listing of cities and counties affected by the Alquist-Priolo
         Act does not include either the City of Red Bluff or Tehama County. The closest
         surface fault to Red Bluff is the Elder Creek Fault, which lies 21 miles to the
         southwest. The nearest recently active surface is the Cleveland Hill Fault, a
         relatively short fault in southeastern Butte County about 66 miles from Red Bluff.
         An earthquake on this fault occurred on August 1, 1975 and had a magnitude of
         5.7 on the Richter Scale. Studies relating to the earthquake hazard in the
         northern Sacramento River Valley and adjacent northeastern California generally
         support the following conclusions:
                  (a)         Of known earthquakes in this region, 90% were of intensity V
                              or less on the Mercalli Scale.
                  (b)         There have been no human injuries or deaths and only very
                              limited property damage from earthquakes within this region.
                                                                                 Page 15 of 28

         (c)          There is no evidence of an earthquake greater than
                      magnitude 6.5 having occurred in the region in historic times.
         (d)          Since a hypothetical intensity VIII earthquake might occur
                      anywhere in interior Northeastern California (a large
                      earthquake), planning within this region should be based upon
                      this event as a maximum intensity. And,
         (e)          The earthquake hazard in this region is not great when
                      compared with the rest of the State, nor is it great when
                      compared with other natural systems in the same regions
                      (Guyton and Scheel, 1974).
         Based on present geologic knowledge of the City of Red Bluff and
adjacent portions of Tehama County, there is little likelihood of a Special Studies
Zone being mapped based on an “active fault”, which is one which has had
surface displacement during the last 11,000 years (the Holocene). There is also
no evidence of a “potentially active fault”, which is defined as one, which has
shown evidence of surface displacement during the last 1.6 million years (the
Pleistocene Epoch). The only mapped fault system in Red Bluff has been named
the Red Bluff Fault. The Red Bluff Fault is a “subsurface feature that extends
northeast and southwest form Red Bluff” as mapped by Harwood and Helley
(USGS, 1987). The evidence for this fault is based upon proprietary subsurface
data: however, they report that “there are no surface feature that can be
associated unequivocally with the fault even though there may be as much as
450 feet of subsurface vertical offset, south side down (DWR, 1991, p.17).
         The objectives and policies listed previously reflect the somewhat
anomalous position of planning the earthquake hazard for the City of Red Bluff.
It is clear that the broader statewide dimensions of planning for the seismic
hazard include toward carefulness, however, a tendency to heavily discount this
hazard based upon the historically low profile of damaging activity might occur.
The policies as listed reflect a middle course of action which would recommend a
consideration of potential geological hazards for all proposed developments, yet
require detailed geological investigations only for those areas with known
geological problems. Major projects where considerable public risk is apparent,
as in the case of the siting of municipal facilities or critical structure such as
hospitals, should be required to submit carefully documented geological and
engineering reports which should consider the local seismic risk along with all
other related non-seismic geological hazards.
2.       OTHER SEISMIC HAZARDS
         a.       Ground Shaking
         Several factors influence the amount of ground shaking at any locality.
The principal ones are the distance from the epicenter of the fault movement,
and the local bedrock-soil conditions. Bedrock areas will have a different shaking
impact compared with area underlain with softer, less consolidated materials.
The stream valleys, which are veneered with alluvium, would thus be more likely
to be affected by ground shaking, as would any areas with sand and mud.
                                                                           Page 16 of 28

           b.      Liquefaction
           Wherever there is poorly consolidated material (such as sand and salt)
   and a shallow depth to groundwater, there is a potential for the soil to liquefy
   during ground shaking. Only strong earthquakes provide sufficient intensity of
   shaking to cause liquefaction, but if one does, the soil can act as a fluid.
   Structure can tilt or sink, highway overcrossings, levees, and bridge abutments
   can fail, and lateral ground movement can occur on slopes as low as 3%. Areas
   of Red Bluff most susceptible to such potential activity would be the beds of
   stream courses and riverbank exposures such as bluffs. Site investigations and
   testing would have to be conducted in order to determine the potential for soil
   liquefaction as well as the potential for other seismic impacts.
           c.      Landslides
           Slope failure due to mass movement processes under the influence of
   gravity can occur with or without an earthquake. These include debris slides,
   earth flows, slump blocks, mudflows, and rock avalanches. The major factors
   creating this hazard are: slope steepness, parent materials, water content in the
   materials involved, and human-caused alternations. These alternations may take
   the form of: over-steepening of slopes by excavation, cutting and filling along the
   bedding plane, removal of materials at the base of a slope, placing fills or
   structure on potentially unstable slopes, adding irrigation water to slop or terrace
   surfaces, and vegetation removal leading to accelerated erosion. Some
   potentially unstable slopes can be stabilized or developed in such a manner as to
   minimize landsliding. Site investigations, careful planning in areas of steeper
   slopes, and mitigation designs are needed. If investigation indicates a limit to the
   mitigating measures, the landslide potential may constrain the ultimate human
   use of the site. This may be the situation along the banks of major streams such
   as the Sacramento River, Reeds Creek and Brickyard Creek. Aerial
   photographic surveys reveal that large-scale landslides are rare in the 75 square
   miles of the Reeds Creek drainage basin; however, several large earthflows
   occur outside the city limits along the north side of Brickyard Creek (DWR, 1992).
           d.      Tsunami
           A tsunami is a seismic sea wave generated by earthquakes on ocean
   floors, which serve to generate long ocean waves. These waves cause high
   water damage when they ultimately strike a seacoast. Because of its inland
   location, the City of Red Bluff is not susceptible to such a hazard.
           e.      Seiche
           Seiche is the periodic oscillation of a landlocked body of water such as a
   lake or reservoir, usually caused by seismic activity. The lack of such aquatic
   features in the Red Bluff area renders the city not subject to this hazard.
B. NON-SEISMIC GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
   1.      EROSION
                                                                          Page 17 of 28
            Erosion of topsoil is generally of greatest concern on hillsides and along
   terrace sides and stream banks where runoff reaches its highest velocity. This
   can serve to undermine structures by carrying away supporting ground materials.
   Deposition of eroded materials can also create a hazard when debris is
   deposited at the base of a slope or where streams reach a confluence, thus
   impeding drainage. Erosion can be prevented or minimized by proper siting of
   development projects away from steep slopes and back from stream banks.
   Other mitigations include: minimizing landform alteration, limiting vegetation
   removal, recontouring to allow for proper runoff and soil drainage, and
   revegetating or covering graded areas to slow runoff velocity and encourage
   slope stability.
   2.       VOLCANIC HAZARD
            The City of Red Bluff is located 45 miles from Mount Lassen, the 10,452
   foot high mountain, which was the most recent large-scale volcanic eruption in
   California. The volcano erupted sporadically between 1914 and 1921 and in its
   eruptions of June 14, 1914 and May 19, 1915 produced vertical clouds of vapor
   and ashes to a height of over five mile in the atmosphere. These clouds were
   witnessed from Red Bluff, which was not affected by debris fallout due to the lack
   of high winds and the distance involved. Additional recent volcanic activity
   occurs near Paynes Creek, 21 miles to the northeast of Red Bluff. Tectonically,
   Red Bluff is situated on as much as 2,000 feet of sedimentary materials in the
   Great Valley structural trough, which is more a product of ancient plate tectonic
   movement than volcanic eruptions, which characterize the Cascades geologic
   province. The treat of a volcanic eruption within the Red Bluff area is thus
   minimal.
C. FLOOD HAZARDS
   1.       TYPES OF FLOOD HAZARDS
            Flood hazards fall within three basic categories: natural seasonal
   flooding, dam inundation, and mud and debris flows. Natural flooding results
   from seasonal rainstorms that cause streams to overflow their banks, and the
   degree of local flooding can be aggravated by inadequacies in local storm drain
   facilities. Dam inundation occurs in association with structural failure of a nearby
   water impoundment. Mud and debris flows originate in hilly areas having
   sediment deposits that are poorly drained. These would mainly occur in upland
   areas some distance to the west of the City of Red Bluff.
            Red Bluff would be affected by a structural failure of Shasta Dam, 42
   miles to the north. Both this dam, and the smaller Keswick Dam to the south, are
   major impoundments of drainage waters of the Sacramento River and its
   northern tributaries. Lake Shasta has a holding capacity of 4.5 million-acre feet
   of water and Keswick Reservoir has a capacity of 0.02 million-acre feet. A failure
   of Shasta Dam would release considerable floodwaters into the main channel of
   the Sacramento River, and, depending on the quantity released, the timing of the
   flooding, the amount under storage, the season of the year, and pre-existing
   hydrological conditions along the Sacramento River and its tributaries between
   Redding and Red Bluff, the consequences could be catastrophic.
                                                                           Page 18 of 28
         The major natural hazard system affecting the City of Red Bluff is natural
seasonal flooding. The construction of Shasta Dam was part of the Central
Valley Project, a scheme, which involves a system of twenty dams and
reservoirs, as well as canals, power plants, and other facilities. The Red Bluff
Diversion Dam, which diverts water from the Sacramento River into the Tehama-
Colusa Canal, and affects the impoundment of water into “Lake Red Bluff,” is a
part of this project. Shasta Dam was intended by the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation to be a major flood control storage facility, thus lessening the threat
of natural winter-spring flooding to communities downstream, such as Red Bluff.
         The flooding hazard of the City of Red Bluff, while not severe overall, is
today most notable along the lower courses of the main streams that flow from
the eastern foothills of the Coast Range through Red Bluff to their confluences
with the Sacramento River. These streams are: Red Bank, Grasshopper, Reeds,
Brickyard, Brewery, Dibble, and Blue Tent Creeks. Overbank runoff from these
streams pose the greatest threat of urban flooding. Thus, the hydrological
profiles of these drainage systems are of concern in floodplain planning in the
City of Red Bluff. The drainage carried by these tributary streams are largely a
function of the amount and season of rainfall, the basin drainage area, and
channel characteristics.
         The most recent flooding events in the City occurred during January,
March, and December 1983 when Reeds Creek overflowed its banks along the
lower mile of its course through Red Bluff. These flood events flooded 65 homes
and involved considerable emergency efforts by local agencies. Floodwaters
were estimated to be between 3 – 4 feet deep inside homes in the affected
areas. As part of the public outcry for remediation, a number of studies have
been made of the Reeds Creek drainage basin, and the flooding potential of the
stream by the Department of Water Resources. These studies have examined
both the natural factors and the human factors of the flood hazard along this
stream, and these conclusions may be extrapolated to the other streams flowing
through Red Bluff.
2.       FACTORS AFFECTING THE FLOOD HAZARD
         The natural climatic pattern of the region plays a role in stream flooding.
It is significant to note that 1983 was the wettest year on record (48.98 inches). It
is also notable that heavy rainfall during November-December, 1982 and
November-December, 1983 acted to swell the runoff into Reeds Creek. The
monthly total in the early to mid-winter period may be more important indicators
of flooding potential than annual totals, since the flooding of 1964 occurred with
only 17.08 inches of total precipitation, but 9.31 inches occurred in November-
December alone.
         The human factors that have affected the watersheds of steams like
Reeds Creek are: the operation of the Red Bluff Diversion Dam, which has
caused short-term changes in the stream erosion-deposition cycle (especially
situation in the stream channel downstream); clearing of oak trees and soil
compaction by grazing animals, which have caused increased runoff and peak
flows; placing of obstructions (bridges and pipelines) in stream channels; human
                                                                        Page 19 of 28

occupation of floodplains, and the spread of impermeable urban surfaces such
as streets which can increase the velocity of surface runoff into stream channels.
         The streams, which flow through Red Bluff, drain significant watershed to
the west of the City. Reeds Creek has a drainage basin of 74.4 square miles,
Red Bank Creek occupies 89.6 square miles, and the aggregate of these and the
other five stream drainage basins is 246.5 square miles. It is clear that long-term
land management decisions in these basins, especially with regard to forest
clearance and streamside alterations is of concern of the residents of Red Bluff.
3.       PLANNING FOR FLOOD HAZARDS
         In floodplain planning, the 100-year floodplain can be mapped. This is
the area, which is estimated to have a 1% chance per year of inundation. It must
be considered that this is only statistical probability. Also mappable, given
detailed data, are 50-year, 20-year, 10-year, and 5-year floodplains. The 100-
year (recurrence interval) of floodwaters from Red Bank Creek has a magnitude
of 21,000 cfs., while the 10-year magnitude is 12,000 cfs. These data would
allow proper planning of drainage-ways during times of peak flow. The 100-year
floodplain has been set by FEMA as the “base flood” standard for acceptable
risk. The National Flood Insurance Program (FEMA) has studies the floodways
of Red Bluff and has prepared maps of the 100-year (and 500-year) floodplains
for all streams flowing through Red Bluff.
         At the present time, Red Bluff relies on the natural drainage channels for
its surface runoffs. A study conducted in 1962 resulted in the identification of
potential flood hazard areas, and drainage facilities were constructed by the City
to relieve these. However, some “missing flood control improvements” are yet to
be constructed primarily because the financial sponsorship is lacking and the infill
nature of urbanization in Red Bluff has allowed some development to avoid
mitigation of drainage impacts from their isolated projects (Bryon and Associate,
1991). The City Master Plan study for infrastructure systems (Bryon and
Associates, 1991) identifies local flood hazard areas and suggests remedies.
Similar recommendations were made by the Department of Water Resources in
the 1987 study of the Reeds Creek flood of 1983. the main areas affected are:
         (1)     Most homes on Musick Avenue and along Aloha Street from
                 South Jackson Street to Aloha Court are located on the 100-year
                 floodplain.
         (2)     Vista School at Vista Way and South Jackson would suffer from
                 drainage problems.
         (3)     An area east of Airport Blvd. and north of Kimball Road would
                 suffer from runoff backup.
         (4)     A potential exists for some inundation of Forward Park.
         (5)     The vicinity of the Union Pacific right-of-way between Walnut
                 Street and Reeds Creek has a high potential for future flooding
                 with continued development.
The 1991 infrastructure plan concludes:
                                                                       Page 20 of 28

           “Red Bluff relies for runoff primarily on the natural drainage
           courses, which bisect its sphere of influence. Current
           design philosophy permits overland flow in street gutters
           as a means of balancing flood protection needs with local
           financial resources.          However, as development
           approaches buildout in the core area, it may be desirable
           to convey the peak runoff quantity from a 100-year storm
           event (design capacity) to the receiving stream in some
           type of physical facility, e.g., storm drain pipes, concrete-
           lined channels, detention basins, ect.”
           Limiting land uses in the floodplain to those that can sustain periodic
   flooding will have the greatest long-term benefits. Appropriate uses would be
   open space and recreation. Developments already occurring in the floodplain
   should be encouraged to undertake appropriate development must mitigate
   potential impacts, upstream and especially downstream. No development should
   be allowed, which would raise the level of the 100-year flood. Surface runoff
   from areas that drain into streams should be controlled by measures, which
   prevent erosion, and soil erosion during construction should likewise be carefully
   monitored and controlled. Since localized flooding may occur where immediate
   access to stream channels is not feasible for runoff, or, if runoff is blocked by
   existing development project, storm drainage improvements will be required.
           An FW (Floodway) overlay is hereby created with the adoption of this
   Safety Element. The boundaries of the FW Zoning District shall correspond to
   the Floodway Boundaries on the approved Floodway Boundary and Floodway
   Maps produced by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA).
           No use, development or alteration of the FW overlay is allowed with prior
   City approval. Prior to granting approval to use, develop or alter land within an
   FW overlay area, the City shall make findings that the proposed use,
   development or alteration of the floodway conforms to the City’s Flood Damage
   Prevention Regulations (City Code Chapter 26) and applicable Federal (FEMA)
   regulations.
D. FIRE HAZARDS
            Wildfires continue to pose significant threat to most Northern California
   communities, including Red Bluff. The wildfire hazard is the consequence of
   three main factors:
   (1)     A climatic pattern with long dry summers, clear skies with maximum solar
           radiation, high daytime summer temperatures, and extremely low relative
           humidities.
   (2)     Vegetation communities, which often have adapted to this seasonal
           drought by becoming fire tolerant (e.g., chaparral), and have high fuel
           loading.
   (3)     Human settlement patterns which often are interspersed with areas of
           heavy vegetation/fuel accumulations along canyons, slopes, and foothill
           areas.
                                                                           Page 21 of 28

         The City of Red Bluff is affected by the first of these factors but is only
minimally affected by the last two. The main vegetation communities of the city
are oak woodland, valley grasslands, and riparian forest (see Conservation
Element for a complete description of these types). Heavy concentrations of
chaparral shrubs are rare, and the main vegetative cover is scattered oak trees
with an understory of native and introduced herbaceous species of grasses and
other non-woody plants. Riparian strips of denser tree growth with an understory
of shrubs and scrub oak are sporadic along some of the major stream courses
such as Reed’s Creek.
         A catastrophic wildfire has not affected Red Bluff in recent decades and
the threat from one is small. The rapid response time of units from Red Bluff Fire
Department has allowed containment of vegetation fires, while they are still
small. The number of vegetation (grass and brush) in 2007 was 44 out of a
total of 152 incidents, a figure, which is about the average for the 2000-2007
period.
         When considering the wildland fire hazard, the primary environmental
concern is the buildup of combustible material. Combustible fuels management
is the most direct method of reducing the intensity, and thus the potential
damage, of wildfires. The California Department of Forestry (CDF) estimates
the following fuel volumes from the vegetation communities of the Red Bluff area:
VEGETATION COMMUNITY                          TONS OF FLAMMABLE
                                                 FUEL PER ACRE
1. Blue Oak Woodland                                1.05    -   3.40
2. Open Chaparral Shrub                             7.31    -  32.54
3. Closed Riparian Forest                          27.19    -  35.00
                                                                       (CDF, 1976)
         The high fuel loading coupled with long, dry summer season creates a
peak fire hazard during June to October. Other conditions, which might serve to
increase the fire hazard, include slope and exposure, the nature of access roads,
the distance from the main fire station, water availability, and competition for
response by multiple calls for assistance. Additionally, the arrival of heavy fall to
spring rainfall, while lowering the fire hazard during this period, can lead to
heavier late spring vegetative growth, which leads to an increased fire hazard by
late summer – early fall.
         An awareness of these conditions led to the enactment of a strong weed
abatement ordinance in April 1990 (City ordinance 821 – See Appendix A). This
ordinance establishes effective measure for the control of flammable vegetation
on open spaces within the city prior to June 1. Additional Weed Abatement
Standards are followed for parcels of three acres and larger (Appendix). The
Red Bluff Fire Department is in conformance with the California Fire Safe
Regulation enumerated in Public Resources Code 4290.
         Specific implementation recommendations by Fire Department officials
relate to hydrant spacing, traffic flow in new subdivision, and the need for
appropriate sprinkler regulations for new developments. These have been
                                                                      Page 22 of 28

          integrated into section I.B of this element, and should be viewed alongside
          parallel recommendations included in the Land Use Element and the Open
          Space Element.
III. PUBLIC PROTECTION SERVICES
     A.   FIRE
                   The City of Red Bluff has one centrally located Fire Department and
          station, which shares a facility with the Policy Department. The central location
          of the fire station is important in the provision of services to all parts of the city.
          It is the City’s goal to maintain an average response time of 4 minutes or less to
          90% of the annual emergency calls. The City currently employs 13 full-time
          firefighters and an additional 25 part-time personnel. The department is an all-
          risk agency with strong automatic and mutual aid agreements with the Tehama
          County Fire Department. The department has four fire engines, one aerial truck,
          one quick attack unit, one air/light unit and a number of 4X4 staff and utility
          vehicles.
                   In 2006, the Insurance Services Office (ISO) recommended that the Red
          Bluff Fire Department (RBFD) maintain its ISO PPC rating of “3” – a rating that it
          has held since 1990. Since the deparment maintains four engines companies
          and one truck company, the number of required firefighters would need to be in
          the range of 22-24, given a recommended fire protection standard of 1.67
          firefighters per per 1,000 people. Should the department be increased in
          personnel to a level commensurate to increasing the rating to class 2, there
          would be a reduction of fire insurance rates by about 10% for commercial
          occupancies within the City of Red Bluff. A clear objective of the Fire
          Department is therefore to increase available fire-fighters per shift to seven.
                   Additional qualified fire-fighter protection as well as consequent
          equipment needs will also be needed as Red Bluff continues to increase in
          populationSince population increase is most evident in new subdivision to the
          south and north of the city center of Red Bluff, the response time from the central
          fire station may be diminished due to distance, increased traffic loads on main
          arterials, and the need to traverse networks of secondary roads. Attention
          should be paid to the potential future need for a second fire station in the
          southern part of Red Bluff in order to plan for such a geographical pattern of city
          expansion. The present facility has served the city for nearly thirty years;
          however, there is an obvious shortage of space in the 7,000 square foot station
          complex, and this will become even more acute as new functions and personnel
          are added (Bryon and Murphy, 1991).
                   Current Fire Department concerns relative to land use planning and future
          development projects within the urban area are addressed in the objectives and
          policies in section I.B, and relate to the following:
                                                                                    Page 23 of 28

   (1)      The provision of adequate water supplies, especially during times of peak
            demand, with water flows of 1,500gal/min. in residential areas and 3,000
            gal/min. for commercial areas. Hydrant spacing should be 500 feet and
            300 feet in residential and commercial areas respectively.
   (2)      Providing adequate access and egress of large and heavy fire apparatus
            to every proposed project and development must always be considered.
   (3)      The adequate planning for fire-fighting capabilities in areal of critical
            facilities, e.g. at the airport, water for fire-fighting should be available to
            the end of each runway.
   (4)      A regular and consistent system of signing and addressing needs to be
            applied in all new subdivisions in order to ensure proper guidance of fire-
            fighting units.
B. POLICE
            The City of Red Bluff is staffed with 23 sworn officers and 11 ancillary
   staff members, for a total of 34 personnel. The Police Department operates out
   of the central Public Safety Complex in the city center. The city owns and
   operates five marked patrol cars, one traffic enforcement car, three detective
   cars, two motorcycles, and one Community Service Officer (CSO) pick-up truck.
   The department shares vehicular maintenance functions with the Fire
   Department, which results in a savings to the city of expenses in this area.
            Professional staff is assisted by six trained police officers who assist
   sworn officers in such activities as: riding in patrol units, park supervision, and a
   t special activities where large crowds are involved. This function is seen as
   critically important by the department, which is continuing its recruitment, training,
   and award programs for this volunteer effort. The department has implemented
   or jointly participates in a total of 21 specialized law enforcement programs,
   including Neighborhood Watch, Secret Witness, Juvenile Services, Interagency
   Drug Enforcement, D.U.I., Weapons Training, among others. The department
   participates in mutual aid agreements with the Tehama County Sheriff’s Office
   and the California Highway Patrol. The department also benefits from the close
   proximity of police facilities of these two agencies to the Red Bluff urban area.
            The Police Department, like the Fire Department, has an important role in
   emergencies. The primary role of the Policy Department in a fire emergency is
   public safety and traffic control. Personnel in both departments have had training
   in advanced first aid and CPR. Additionally, two sworn officers are fully trained in
   hazardous material response. Police personnel are fully integrated in the
   “emergency operations plan” and are prepared to respond to all types of
   incidents.
            The location and function of Red Bluff have a special impact on policy
   protection services. Red Bluff serves as the County Seat of Tehama County,
   and also is located at the junction of a major intercity highway (Highway 99) and
   Interstate 5. These factors ensure a large daytime service function and traffic
   corridor problems that peak during the day but extend to a 24-hour basis.
   Departmental estimates indicate that the residential population of 12,900 is
   expanded to a daily service population of nearly 30,000 during peak times. The
                                                                               Page 24 of 28

   present sworn officer to population ratio of the Red Bluff Policy Department is
   about 1.8 per 1,000 people. The ideal ratio, by department standards, would be
   maintain a ratio of 2:1,000 people, which, given the present population of the city
   alone would mean the addition of three sworn officers to the police force.
C. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
            The City of Red Bluff has no high hazardous materials use facility such as
   oil refineries or chemical manufacturing plants. There are also no large storage
   facilities for hazardous materials such as chemicals, solvents, or fuels.
   “Hazardous Materials” covers a large number of substances that are an actual or
   potential danger to the public. These include heavy metals, toxic chemicals;
   flammable and/or explosive gases, liquids, and solids; corrosive materials,
   infectious substances, and radioactive materials. After domestic or commercial
   use many of these substances become “hazardous waste materials.” The need
   to develop a rational planned approach to long-term hazardous waste
   management became increasingly important after 1980. Partly in response to
   this concern, Assembly Bill 2948 was passed in 1986. This bill provided funding
   to California counties to prepare hazardous waste management plans.
            Tehama County elected to prepare a County Hazardous Waste
   Management Plan (CHWMP) under the auspices of AB 2948. The Tehama
   County CHWMP complies with the California Department of Health Services’
   “Guidelines for the Preparation of Hazardous Waste Management Plan” (DHS,
   June 30, 1987). The plan was presented in September 1988 and revised in
   January 1989. The plan is currently used by Tehama County and its guidelines
   are relied upon by the City of Red Bluff for all aspects of tis management of
   hazardous wastes. The Tehama CHWMP was the basis for the
   recommendations for “existing and proposed hazardous waste disposal” (Section
   IV B) of the Land Use Element. The specific guidelines of the CHWMP were
   enumerated therein.
            The transportation of hazardous materials (and waste) within the City is a
   matter of public protection concern. The transportation of hazardous materials is
   largely regulated by federal and state agencies; however, an accident involving
   the spillage of hazardous materials becomes a county or city response need
   depending on the locality. The danger of such an occurrence relates directly to
   the presence of a major interstate highway and railroad line transecting the city.
   While these two transport lines are relatively straight and level, they represent
   areas involving high traffic congestion within the city limits. The Tehama CHWMP
   suggests specific policies to review for adequacy of the inspection and licensing
   activities for vehicles used in the county, to periodically check manifest records to
   ensure that licensed haulers are being used, review county transportation routes
   to determine if there are roads on which hazardous substances or waste
   transport should be prohibited, ensure that vehicles hat transport hazardous
   materials for county agencies are in full compliance with state and federal law,
   and review adequacy of the County’s monitoring (and agency procedure) for
   transporting hazardous materials and wastes. These policies can be adapted to
   city needs and the appropriate city ordinances can be adopted to conform with
   County policies and actions and to fit the needs of the people of Red Bluff.
                                                                          Page 25 of 28

D. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
           The public agencies of the City of Red Bluff were integrated into the Fire
   Department’s “emergency operations plan” in August 1991. This plan has
   integrated agency response to a variety of potential emergencies: Flood, Fire,
   Earthquake, Explosion, Snow Storm, Civil Disturbance, and Hazardous material
   Spill. A stepwise procedure involving notification, Mutual Aid involvement, and
   appropriate agency and personnel response, is detailed for each potential
   emergency circumstance. A copy of this disaster plan is included in the
   Appendix to this element.
           In addition, all fire-fighting personnel attend training sessions dealing with
   vehicle extrication procedures, hazardous materials handling, cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation, and advance first aid procedures. Police personnel are similarly
   trained, with two sworn officers fully trained in hazard management response.
   Both the Fire and Police Departments feel comfortable with the level of
   emergency preparedness of their staffs, and with the recommendations for
   handling hazardous materials in the County’s management plan. Both Public
   Safety agencies maintain Mutual Aid agreements with appropriate outside fire
   and policy agencies, and emergency medical response personnel are on duty or
   on call at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, the City’s major health provider.
           The official Emergency Plan for the City of Red Bluff was written in May
   1975, updated in 1977, and extended as current by the State of California Office
   of Emergency Services in 1981, with a need to update in 1984. The City
   Emergency Plan will need to be correlated with the “emergency operations plan”
   and fully updated to existing emergency, safety, and public health guidelines.
                                                                           Page 26 of 28
