Gateways
An important aspect of community design is to clearly mark the tran-
sition from one area, use, or city to another. Using gateways to cre-
ate a sense of arrival can be dramatic in desert environments where
visitors often travel through wide expanses of open space before
arriving at their destinations. Despite its beauty, many people don’t
realize when they have arrived in Rancho Mirage.
To enhance the sense of arrival, Rancho Mirage should make strong
entry statements that reinforce the city's identity. The most important
entry to Rancho Mirage is the intersection of Bob Hope Drive and
Ramon Road, as it is the primary entry from I-10, and is the longest,
most centrally located corridor in Rancho Mirage.
The primary gateways should be situated at the locations identified
on the Community Design Maps (Exhibits 32 and 33). The design of
these gateways should incorporate monument signage in the con-
text of enhanced intersections, including special paving, widened
setbacks, and coordinated, accent landscaped treatment at all four
corners. Exhibit 34 provides a plan view of the ideal gateway in-
tersection and Exhibit 35 shows a rendering of the ideal multi-use
gateway intersection.

landscaping at the intersections.
The design plan for Rancho Mirage’s arterials exists at three levels:
boulevard, gateway, and special arterial streetscape plans. The
boulevard streetscape plan involves the two most important arteri-
als from the perspective of overall city identity: Bob Hope Drive—
the primary entry and longest, most centrally located corridor and
Highway 111— the most important commercial corridor and link to
neighboring Cove communities. This designation envisions a formal
landscape plan incorporating community-wide design themes.
Gateway landscaping is reserved for major entry points into Rancho
Mirage from Monterey Avenue and the northern stretch of Bob Hope
Drive between Dinah Shore and Ramon Road. Monterey Avenue,
the western half of which lies in Rancho Mirage, plays an important
role in distinguishing Rancho Mirage from its neighbors. Bob Hope
Drive curves and rises from Ramon Road to gradually reveal more
and more dramatic views of Rancho Mirage and its surrounding
mountains. This gateway landscape plan envisions a formal, skyway
design with decorative palms interspersed with smaller specimens
creating a dramatic and rhythmic entry into Rancho Mirage.
The third design designation is special arterial landscaping. This is
reserved for the east/west arterials, and parts of Monterey Avenue                                                                              Desert landscaping and artistic, permeable surfaces contribute to the scenic quality

Landscaping
As one of Rancho Mirage’s most salient features, landscape design
is critical to place making and reinforces the important delineation
between the various elements that comprise the built environment.
One example is the use of diversely planted medians to break up
the expanse of asphalt on the arterial roadways. Another solution
involves the formal design of rows of palm trees with low-scale, me-
andering parkways.
It is important to remember that a desert climate does not preclude
attractive landscaping. Many drought-tolerant plant specimens
bloom for months at a time. Combining trees with low-lying bushes
and ground cover provides variety and can create a dramatic sense
of rhythm along roadways. Carefully planned landscaping provides
Rancho Mirage with its best opportunity to beautify its public spaces.

The Rancho Mirage Public Library continues to be recognized re-
gionally and nationally for its outstanding public relations efforts,
and is a true staple of the community, attracting visitors from all over
the Coachella Valley and beyond. Construction of an observatory
on City-owned land adjacent to the library began in early 2017. The
addition of this unique facility will further distinguish Rancho Mirage
as a leader in the development of culturally significant resources in
the region.
Additional undeveloped land is available adjacent to the library for
future institutional uses, one of which may be a gallery to house and
showcase the various collections that have been donated over the
years.
