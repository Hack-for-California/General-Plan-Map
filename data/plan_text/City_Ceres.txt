Introduction
P URPOSE AND NATURE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
i
This General Plan formalizes a long-term vision for the physical evolution of Ceres and outlines policies, standards, and programs to guide day-to-day decisions concerning Ceres' development through the year 2015. Designed to meet state general plan requirements, the General Plan consists of two documents: this General Plan Policy Document and a General Plan Background Report. This Policy Document is divided into two main parts. Part I is this General Plan Summary, which provides background about the General Plan and reviews the plan's guiding principles and major themes and proposals. The lengthier and more detailed Part II of the Policy Document presents the City of Ceres' formal statements of General Plan policy in the form of goals, policies, standards, and implementation programs expressed in both text and diagrams.
Every city and county in California must adopt a general plan. A general plan is a legal document that serves as a community's “constitution” for land use and development. The plan must be comprehensive and long-term, outlining proposals for the physical development of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's judgment bears relation to its planning (Government Code Section 65300 et seq.) The plan must be comprehensive in covering all territory within the adopting jurisdiction and it must be comprehensive in addressing all physical aspects of the community's development. While state law does not define “long-term,11 most general plans look 15 to 25 years into the future. Ceres' General Plan sets a time frame of 2015.
State law specifically requires that the general plan address seven topics or “elements.” These are land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. The general plan may also address other topics the community feels are relevant to its development. For each topic addressed, the plan must analyze the significance of the issue in the community, set forth policy in text and diagrams, and outline specific programs for implementing these policies. The format and structure of the general plan is left to local discretion, but regardless of the format or issues addressed, all substantive parts of the plan must be consistent with one another.
Preparing, adopting and maintaining a general plan serves several important purposes:
• Provides citizens with information about their community and with opportunities to participate in setting goals and determining policies and standards for the community's development;
1
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
General Plan Summary
•	Provides local decision makers and the community with a forum for resolving conflicts among competing interests and values;
•	Expands the capacity of local government to analyze local and regional conditions and needs in order to respond effectively to the problems and opportunities facing the community;
•	Defines the community's environmental, social, and economic goals;
•	Records the local government's policies and standards for the maintenance and improvement of existing development and the location and characteristics of future development; and
•	Fosters coordination of community development and environmental protection activities among local, regional, state, and federal agencies;
•	Guides and coordinates the many actions and day-to-day decisions of local government that are necessary to developing and protecting the community.
Implementing the GENERAL PLAN
Carrying out the plan following its adoption requires a multitude of individual actions and ongoing programs involving virtually every City department and many other public agencies and private organizations. The legal authority for these various actions and programs rest on two essential powers of local government: corporate and police powers. Using their “corporate power,” local governments collect money through bonds, fees, assessments, and taxes, and spend it to provide services and facilities such as police and fire protection, streets, water systems, sewage disposal facilities, drainage facilities, and parks. Using their “police power,” local governments create and regulate citizens' use of their property through zoning, subdivision, and building regulations in order “to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the public." The general plan provides the formal and legal framework for the exercise of these powers by local officials.
Revising and
AMENDING THE GENERAL PLAN
To ensure that the policies and proposals of the general plan are systematically implemented, state law since the early 1970s has increasingly insisted that the actions and decisions of each local government concerning both its own projects and the private projects it approves are consistent with its adopted general plan. The courts have supported and furthered this trend through their interpretations of state law. Zoning, local government approval of subdivisions, and local public works projects must be consistent with the general plan. The same is true for development agreements, redevelopment plans, specific plans, and many other plans and actions of cities and counties.
A general plan is a long-term document with a planning horizon of 15 to 25 years. To achieve its purposes, the plan must be sufficiently flexible to adjust to changing conditions and at the same time specific in guiding day-to-day land use and development decisions. Over the years, conditions and community needs change and new opportunities arise; the

Regional setting AND PLANNING AREAS
plan needs to keep up with these changes. Every year the Planning Commission should review the plan's implementation programs to assess the City's progress in carrying out the plan. Every five to seven years, the plan should be thoroughly reviewed and updated as necessary. From time to time, the City will entertain proposals for specific amendments to the plan. The City will initiate some of these proposals itself, but most will be initiated by property owners and developers.
State law limits gerieral plan amendments to four times per year, but each amendment can include multiple changes. Like the adoption of the general plan itself, general plan amendments are subject to environmental review, public notice, and hearing requirements and must not create inconsistencies with the rest of the plan.
Ceres is located in central Stanislaus County, adjacent to and south of Modesto, the county seat. Ceres lies approximately 75 miles south of Sacramento on State Route 99 and 100 miles east of Oakland via the 5,205, and 580 freeways. The Tuolumne River runs along the northern edge of Ceres. Figure 1 depicts Ceres general location within Stanislaus County and California.
CITY LIMITS
PLANNING AREA
URBAN GROWTH AREA
The City of Ceres encompasses approximately 6.3 square miles, or 4,060 acres, of incorporated territory, as of 1996. According to a parcel-based land use inventory assembled by the City in 1993, approximately 3,000 acres of this area is subdivided land (i.e., excluding streets, canals, easements, and other rights-of-way). Within the boundaries of its city limits, the city includes some unincorporated islands which are under the jurisdiction of Stanislaus County.
This General Plan designates land uses for and applies its policies and standards to defined as the City's Planning Area. As shown in Figure 2, the Planning Area is bounded by the Tuolumne River on the north, Carpenter Road on the east, Grayson Road on the south, and Washington Road on the west, encompassing approximately 14,700 acres. The Planning Area includes the City of Ceres' Urban Growth Area (described below), areas designated as reserve for future urban development beyond the time frame of the General Plan (2015), some territory within the city of Modesto and its sphere of influence, and the northernmost part of the unincorporated community of Keyes. The remaining area is designated for agricultural and open space uses.
Within the Planning Area, the General Plan includes an Urban Growth Area (see Figure 2). The Urban Growth Area encompasses all land envisioned for development as part of Ceres through the year 2015. This area is further divided into two phases of development to ensure orderly development and prevent premature conversion of agricultural lands.
The Planning Area also includes areas designated for Residential and Industrial Reserve. These areas are intended for future planning and development after 2015.

General Plan Summary
Ceres' historical DEVELOPMENT
The founder of Ceres, Daniel Whitmore, arrived in California in 1854 and in the Ceres area in 1867. Whitmore and his family eventually acquired 9,000 acres, which included what was later to become the town site of Ceres. By 1875, R.K. Whitmore, Daniel's brother, had surveyed the area and filed a map for the layout of the town.
The first home in Ceres, built in 1870, belonged to Daniel Whitmore and his family. This home still stands at 2928 Fifth Street and is on the National Register of Historic Places. After the town was laid out, Whitmore gave away lots, with the stipulation that the owner build on it and occupy it, and uphold a temperance clause which was inserted into the deed.
In 1872, the railroad crossed the Tuolumne River into Ceres, and the town became a flag stop. A depot was built a few years later, and Mr.
Whitmore petitioned for a post office. The first store was built in 1873, followed by a schoolhouse in 1874, a public meeting hall in 1880, a "flouring mill" in 1881, and a Baptist church in 1882. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the area's population grew along with the local economic infrastructure required to support the increasing population.
By the late 1800s, the end of the "grain era" and the necessity of irrigation was becoming evident. With the knowledge that “irrigation would make the plains a garden spot,” Whitmore proceeded to sell off 3,000 acres at $30 to $40 per acre. While the early economy was based on non-irrigated wheat farming, the founding of the Modesto and Turlock Irrigation Districts and the construction of irrigation canals diversified the agricultural base and economy. Farming included irrigated crops and dairies, and the population grew dramatically. Ceres became more urban with more services. The first library opened in 1901; the Ceres Courier began publishing in 1910; and the high school was built in 1915. In 1918, Ceres incorporated as a city of 1,000 residents.
Ceres remained a small city with an agricultural base throughout its early years. By 1950, the population was about 3,500. Memorial Hospital was built in 1951.
Construction of modem State Route 99 commenced in 1968, taking about five years to complete. Construction of the freeway with the Pine Street overpass resulted in the destruction of much of the city's central business district. The new freeway also ushered in an era of more rapid growth in Ceres.
By 1970, Ceres' population had reached approximately 6,000. Over the next decade, the population doubled, reaching over 13,000 in 1980. As this growth occurred, major City facilities were constructed in the 1970s, including the current City Hall and Smyrna Park in 1976, and the wastewater treatment plant in 1979. Growth continued during the 1980s, with the population doubling again over the decade, reaching 25,000 in 1990. A new Public Safety Building was constructed Downtown in 1988.

General Plan Summary
H ISTORY OF LAND USE PLANNING IN CERES
General planning in Ceres started as a joint project with Stanislaus County and its incorporated cities in 1957 with financing from the U. S. Housing and Home Finance Agency. The program was assigned to the Cities-County Planning Advisory Committee, made up of representatives of the participating agencies. The committee was also responsible for the standardization of subdivision and zoning ordinances, a thoroughfare plan, and a housing survey. By 1961, the Committee had completed plans for all areas of the county, including Ceres, which was covered by a general plan for the Modesto-Ceres-Empire area that was adopted in 1960.
A comprehensive revision of the 1960 plan was completed in the early 1970s. Preparation of the plan was financed in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). As part of the plan, several countywide Environmental Resource Management Elements (ERME) prepared by the Stanislaus Area Association of Governments (SAAG) were adopted. ERME sections included: soils, water, geology and seismic safety, agriculture, recreation/open space, and wildlife and vegetation.
In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of state laws concerning general plans and zoning were passed, including requirements for nine mandatory "elements" (since collapsed into seven elements). In response to these new requirements, the City began to amend and update the plan on an individual element basis. This trend continued through the early 1990s, resulting in a fragmented plan consisting of several elements adopted at various times over a 20-year period. To address this fragmentation and to comprehensively address growth issues in Ceres, in late 1993 the City initiated a comprehensive update of all its general plan elements, except the Housing Element. This General Plan is the result of that effort.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the City also undertook some specialized planning efforts focused on specific areas of the city. In 1989, the City adopted the Mitchell Road Corridor Specific Plan to address development in the area around Mitchell Road, a primary link to Modesto Airport, the Beard industrial area, and southern Modesto. This General Plan incorporates the policy content of that plan.
In 1990, the City and County jointly formed the Stanislaus-Ceres Redevelopment Commission (SCRC), which established a redevelopment project area consisting of two discontiguous subareas, one immediately north of Ceres' city limits and one immediately south, both within Ceres' sphere of influence. In 1991, the City created a City redevelopment agency, established a redevelopment project area, and prepared a redevelopment plan for the project area.
H OW THIS GENERAL PLAN WAS PREPARED
The City of Ceres initiated its general plan update program in the Fall of 1993 when it retained a multi-disciplinary consulting team headed by J. Laurence Mintier & Associates to assist the City in its comprehensive update effort. In early 1994, the City conducted a community concerns survey, the consultants interviewed City officials, and the General Plan Review Committee held a townhall meeting. The results of these efforts were summarized in the Community Concerns Summary Report, published
5
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
General Plan Summary
in June 1994. The consulting team also prepared a detailed background report describing existing conditions and trends in Ceres. The Draft General Plan Background Report, also published in June 1994, includes chapters addressing ten subject areas: land use; urban form and design; population; economic conditions and fiscal considerations; transportation; public facilities and services; recreation and cultural resources; natural and agricultural resources; safety; and noise. The Background Report provides the factual foundation for this Policy Document and also serves as the environmental setting, description for the General Plan Environmental Impact Report.
After publication of the Draft Background Report in June 1994, the next major step in the Update process was to identify key constraints, opportunities, and options for the General Plan and to summarize them for public review. The result was the Opportunities, Constraints, and Options Report, which presented the most critical policy issues to be addressed in the new General Plan. These issues were identified based on the Draft General Plan Background Report, Community Concerns Summary Report, and extensive discussion with local officials and other community and business leaders.
Following publication of the Opportunities, Constraints, and Options Report in September 1994, the General Plan Review Committee hosted two townhall meetings (one in September and one in October) to present the report to the public and receive public input. The GPRC then held three meetings during November and December 1994 to consider the report and provide recommendations to the Planning Commission and City Council concerning the issues addressed in the Opportunities, Constraints, and Options Report. In addition, the Parks and Recreation Commission held a meeting in November 1994 to consider the report and develop recommendations for the Commission and Council.
In January 1995, the City Council and Planning Commission held a joint public hearing to receive public input on the report. In January and February, the Planning Commission deliberated on the report and developed its recommendations to the City Council. In February and March 1995, the City Council in turn deliberated and provided staff and the Consultants with policy direction for preparing the Draft General Plan.
Based on the Council's direction, City staff and Consultants worked with the General Plan Review Committee in preparing the Draft General Plan Policy Document and Draft Land Use Diagram. The Draft Policy Document and the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) assessing the potential environmental implications of the draft plan were released for public review in April 1996. In June 1996, the General Plan Review Committee, the Planning Commission, and the City Council held a joint hearing on the draft plan and DEIR. The General Plan Review Committee made its recommendations on the draft plan to the Planning Commission in September 1996. The Planning Commission in turn made its recommendations to the City Council in October 1996. The City Council considered the recommendations, took further public input, and directed

General Plan Summary
o RGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN
City staff and Consultants to make a final set of revisions to the draft documents before adopting the General Plan in February 1997.
The Ceres General Plan consists of two documents: the General Plan Background Report and the General Plan Policy Document. The General Plan Background Report, which inventories and analyzes existing conditions and trends in Ceres, provides the formal supporting documentation for general plan policy. It addresses the following ten subject areas:
•	Land Use
•	Urban Form and Design
•	Population
•	Economic Conditions and Fiscal Considerations
•	Transportation
•	Public Facilities and Services
•	Recreational and Cultural Resources
•	Natural and Agricultural Resources
•	Safety
•	Noise
This General Plan Policy Document is divided into two main parts. Part I is a summary of the General Plan, describing the nature and purpose of the plan, highlighting the guiding principles of the plan, and outlining the plan's main proposals. It does not constitute formal general plan policy, but is rather a guide to understanding and interpreting Part II of the Policy Document.
Part II contains explicit statements of goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and quantified objectives that constitute the formal policy of the City of Ceres for land use, development, and environmental quality. Part II is divided into chapters that correspond roughly with the organization of issues addressed in the General Plan Background Report plus a final chapter on administration and implementation. These are as follows:
•	Chapter 1: Land Use and Community Design
•	Chapter 2: Transportation and Circulation
•	Chapter 3: Housing
•	Chapter 4: Public Facilities and Services
•	Chapter 5: Recreational and Cultural Resources
•	Chapter 6: Agricultural and Natural Resources
•	Chapter 7: Health and Safety
•	Chapter 8: Administration and Implementation
Each section includes goal statements relating to different sub-issues or different aspects of the issue addressed in the section. For each goal statement, there are several policies which amplify the goal statement. Implementation programs are listed at the end of each section and describe briefly the proposed action, the City agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, and the time frame for accomplishing the program. Chapter 1 (Land Use and Community Design) also describes the designations appearing on the
7
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
General Plan Summary
Land Use Diagram and outlines the standards of population density and building intensity for these land use designations. Chapter 2 (Transportation and Circulation) contains a diagram depicting the proposed circulation system and a description of the street classification system. The housing section also includes a statement of quantified housing objectives required by state law as part of the housing element.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in this document:
Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and immeasurable.
Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action and implying clear commitment.
Standard: A specific, often quantified guideline, incorporated in a policy or implementation program, defining the relationship between two or more variables. Standards can often translate directly into regulatory controls.
Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or technique that carries out general plan policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and a time frame for its accomplishment. These time frames are general guidelines and may be adjusted based on City staffing and budgetary issues.
Quantified Objective (Housing only): The number of housing units that the City expects to be constructed and the number of households the City expects will be assisted through Housing Element programs and based on general market conditions during the time frame of the Housing Element.
This Policy Document concludes with three appendices: the City's annexation policy, a summary of policies related to air quality, and a glossary of key terms.
In addition to the General Plan Background Report and General Plan Policy Document, an Environmental Impact Report analyzing the impacts and implications of the General Plan was prepared. The EIR, which is not formally part of the General Plan, was prepared to meet the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.
^Zeres general plan CONTEXT
The following discussions briefly describe growth projections, physical constraints, and the issues that provide the context for General Plan.
The most significant issues addressed in this Policy Document concern growth and development. Ceres has grown rapidly over the last 20 years and projected conditions favor significant growth in Ceres over the next 20

years. This section describes the major issues related to growth and development in Ceres.
The Community Concerns Summary Report summarized local concerns about future growth and development in Ceres. The most significant survey response addressed the overall character and role of Ceres in the future. The community survey questionnaire asked residents what they liked most about living in Ceres and also asked residents why they chose to live in Ceres. Over two-thirds of survey respondents said they liked Ceres' small-town character.

OPPORTUNITIES
Projected High Rates of Growth
One of the most common complaints about Ceres is the lack of economic development, including insufficient employment opportunities and commercial development, which is fairly typical of cities of Ceres' size. This Policy Document includes policies and programs intended to reconcile the potentially conflicting objectives of maintaining Ceres' small-town qualities and providing for the kinds and levels of development that provide greater convenience and economic opportunities for residents.
Ceres has substantial opportunity for growth and development, primarily because of projected high rates of growth in the area and available land to accommodate development. These opportunities are described in this section.
As described in the Background Report, population and employment growth in Stanislaus County and the entire San Joaquin Valley was rapid throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Stanislaus County's total population grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent between 1980 and 1993, adding nearly 11,000 people per year. These gains created opportunities for economic development and job formation throughout the county.
Ceres' population has doubled in each of the last two decades. Population in Ceres, Stanislaus County, and throughout the San Joaquin Valley is projected to grow at continued high rates over the next 20 years. In 1993, the Stanislaus Area Association of Governments (SAAG) projected that population in Ceres would grow from over 30,000 in 1994, to 51,200 in 2005, to 73,200 in 2015. Anticipated annexation of another 8,400 residents of the unincorporated area already living within Ceres' sphere of influence would also add to the city's population by 2015. Nonresidential growth is also expected to continue.
Growth in the 1980s and early 1990s resulted from two sources: rapid increases in the local employment base and rapid gains in commuters with jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area and San Joaquin County. Local job growth accounted for approximately two-thirds of the gains in population in Stanislaus County and commuter growth accounted for the remainder. Both of these job sources are expected to influence growth into the future.
The Central Valley fared better than the state as a whole during the economic slowdown of the first half of the 1990s, and its recovery has been more rapid. Employment in the Central Valley experienced neither the rapid annual gains of the 1980s nor the job losses seen in other areas of the

Land Availability for Expansion	One of the most important considerations in the development of this General Plan was the large supply of land surrounding Ceres to the west, east, and south. The supply of land, combined with its relatively low cost compared with the greater San Francisco Bay Area, make Stanislaus County an attractive and affordable location for development.
CONSTRAINTS	Despite obvious opportunities for growth and development in Ceres, there are also some constraints to growth. These can essentially be broken down into three broad categories: economic, physical, and policy or political. Economic conditions will ultimately determine how large Ceres is likely to become and how fast the city is likely to develop, while physical constraints will govern to a great extent the location of development. Policy variables or constraints will have a bearing on both the rate and character of growth.
State and Local Financing Problems	Prior to 1978, cities in California relied heavily on property taxes as a source of municipal revenues. With the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, however, property tax revenues declined in importance as sales tax revenues have became increasingly important. One result of the increasing reliance on sales tax for revenue has been the active pursuit by local governments in California of commercial development and its associated tax receipts to fill-in gaps left by reductions in property tax revenue. In the 1990s, the State of California has had increasing fiscal problems because of decreased sales and income taxes resulting from the recession, and it has diverted some of the property tax revenues that were typically allocated to cities and counties, exacerbating local fiscal problems. Future growth in Ceres will occur primarily by annexing areas outside the current city limits. In early 1996, the City and County negotiated a new property tax allocation agreement. After annexation, the County retains the base property tax for each parcel, and the City receives the increment of any increase resulting from increased valuation of the property. This results in less property tax funding than previously allocated to the City upon annexation. Tax sharing has become a critical issue as a result of the demands by the counties and the fiscal problems of the state during the 1990s. The State reduced the amount of property taxes distributed to California schools by 20 percent, and in the process forced counties to redirect some of the property taxes to the schools that had formerly been distributed to the cities. Ceres lost approximately 20 percent of its total property tax income during these years (the actual amounts lost varied from city to city), and those funds are not likely to return to cities any time soon, if ever. In addition, counties are increasingly asking cities to require new development to help fund not only capital facilities but also operating

costs for needed services provided by counties and mandated by the State (e.g., courts, jails).
The reductions in property taxes raise some serious questions regarding future growth for cities. While residential development typically does not provide enough property tax revenue to pay for needed services, a strong residential base is usually required to attract and retain commercial and industrial development. Commercial development in particular provides sales taxes and typically generates more revenue to cities than the costs of associated services.
Competition From Modesto and i	Stanislaus County
As the largest city in Stanislaus County, Modesto dominates commercial activity in the county, making it difficult for Ceres to compete for new retail and other commercial investment, especially given its location close to Modesto. As of 1994, Modesto accounted for 57 percent of the total retail sales in the county with only 44 percent of the countywide population, while Ceres accounted for about 6 percent of total retail sales with 7 percent of the county's population.
Ceres also competes with unincorporated areas of Stanislaus County for commercial and industrial investment, particularly automobile and farm machinery sales. In fact, most of the new industrial development in Stanislaus County over the past decade has occurred in unincorporated areas.
Agricultural Land
Air Quality
Agriculture has historically been the engine of growth in Stanislaus County. Most of the communities in the county emerged as service centers for its agricultural base. While the larger communities have diversified, agriculture still plays an important role in the industrial base and employment of these cities and for the county.
The San Joaquin Valley contains much of the best remaining farmland in the state; this General Plan recognizes the importance of preservation of this farmland. The prime agricultural land surrounding Stanislaus County's cities represents a potential constraint to continued urbanization in Stanislaus County. As in the case of most San Joaquin Valley communities, expansion of Ceres will result in the conversion of agricultural lands and displacement of farmers.
Air quality is severely degraded in the San joaquin Valley. The Valley's meteorology, combined with air pollutants transported into the air basin from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento area, and locally-generated pollutants from automobiles, factories, and agricultural operations, results in contaminant levels within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin surpassed only by the South Coast Air Basin of Los Angeles.
One of the major reasons that air quality continues to be a problem in the San Joaquin Valley and throughout California is a relatively high rate of population and economic growth. Increasing population and automobiles use, and increasing congestion on roadways will hinder improvements in the region's air quality.

Ceres General Plan Policy Document
General Plan Summary
The most efficient and cost-effective technological or "hardware" controls currently available have already been implemented (e.g., emission controls on industries, catalytic converters in automobiles) throughout California. Recently, the State has required cleaner burning gasoline and has promoted natural gas, methanol, and electric vehicles to reduce pollutant emissions. In recent years, attention has focused on the relationship of land use, community design, and modes of transportation as a means or reducing air pollutant generation.
Federal air quality and transportation regulations may act to constrain or affect future development patterns through two means: federal transportation and air quality acts. Federal transportation planning and funding changed its focus with the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). ISTEA governs the allocation of federal transportation funds to transportation projects in the states, and the Act promotes funding of alternative transportation modes (transit, rail, pedestrian, bicycling) rather than primarily emphasizing highway development. Secondly, the Federal Clean Air Act mandates states, and thus local air districts, to prepare plans to achieve attainment of federal air quality standards. Failure to prepare a plan that satisfies federal requirements could potentially result in the loss of federal transportation funds.
Geographic Constraints
While air quality is often regarded as a regional problem, local land use and growth decisions by cities and counties will profoundly affect future air quality. The San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) has prepared Air Quality Element Guidelines for the preparation of policies and programs relating to air quality in general plans. Air quality issues may act as a general constraint on growth. Air quality regulations may also require local governments to consider alternative patterns and forms of land use and transportation development as a means of reducing automobile use.
Geographic constraints or limits on growth and development include physical features or jurisdictional boundaries that limit or direct where growth can occur in and around Ceres. The most obvious physical constraint is the Tuolumne River on the north that forms a clear natural boundary between Ceres and Modesto east of Highway 99. West of State Route 99, the City of Modesto extends south of the river to Whitmore Avenue. Ceres' and Modesto's spheres are adjacent on the northwestern part of Ceres. Ceres cannot grow into land occupied by another jurisdiction, and where possible it is desirable to maintain separation to foster community identity. The community of Keyes is located about one mile to the south on SR 99.
Patterns of Existing Development
Existing land use patterns and roadway structure also dictate where and how future growth can occur. Ceres' major roadways create the structure of the city, and future development must build on and expand this system. These roadways, their locations, and capacities, will generally determine the form of future circulation system and limit or determine the locations of future development.

The locations of existing developments also influence future choices. For instance, the Modesto City-County Airport, located immediately north of Ceres, limits the types and densities of development in northeast Ceres. Similarly, existing industrial development can limit the types of adjacent uses.
Public Attitudes Towards Growth
Public Facility Financing
S UMMARY OF MAJOR GENERAL PLAN PROPOSALS
Major thoroughfares and intersections are desirable locations for future commercial areas and therefore influence decisions of future commercial development.
In two community surveys, Ceres residents were asked about growth rates is Ceres. In a 1989 survey, 57 percent responded that Ceres was growing too fast, 40 percent said the growth rate was about right, and only 3 percent felt the city was growing too slowly. This survey was conducted during the peak of Ceres' growth in the late 1980s. In 1994, the General Plan Community Concerns Survey asked the same question. The percentage responding that Ceres had grown too fast had fallen to 43 percent, while almost the same number answered that Ceres' growth rate was just right. Nearly 7 percent felt the City had grown too slow. This change in attitude probably reflects a decline in the city's growth rate in the early 1990s from the high rates of the late 1980s.
Public attitudes towards growth can vary based on the economic climate. During times of economic prosperity and rapid growth, public sentiment tends to either oppose growth or favor limited growth. During recessionary times, public opinion generally favors growth. Based on the two community surveys, Ceres residents seem to reflect this tendency, although Ceres residents' still express a concern that growth not result in a decline in their quality of life.
The physical growth of a community necessarily requires expansion of public facilities and services. Grants and tax revenues historically funded these improvements. With the changes in local financing, new development throughout California is being required to fund the facilities needed to serve itself. To address this issue, the City adopted a Public Facilities Plan in 1990 that examined the public facilities that would be required to serve development within its sphere of influence and used this as the framework for funding capital facilities to serve development of the existing sphere of influence.
To expand beyond its present city limits, the City will need to extend its public facilities and services and provide for additional facilities as part of its Public Facilities Plan; it will also need to raise the necessary capital, probably through bond issuance. The financing of public facilities is therefore both an economic constraint and a policy or political constraint.
As indicated earlier, the formal policy content of the General Plan is contained in Part II of this Policy Document. Part II is divided into eight chapters, each of which deals with a broad topic and several subissues related to the main topic. The following is a chapter-by-chapter summary of the major proposals set forth in the Ceres General Plan, including
13
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
General Plan Summary
references to show how the goals, policies, implementation programs, and diagrams in each chapter relate to the major themes described above.
Chapter 1:
Land Use and Community Design
This section is the most tangible of all of the policy sections in the General Plan. It contains the Land Use Diagram that prescribes uses for all of the Planning Area, describes standards for each of the land use designations shown on the Land Use Diagram, and articulates a series of goals, policies, and programs designed to guide decisions concerning land use, development, and environmental protection in Ceres.
Land Use Diagram
The Land Use Diagram includes 23 land use designations falling within five major categories, as shown in the following chart:
LAND USE DESIGNATIONS		
CATEGORY	LABEL	DESIGNATION
Residential	RA VLDR LDR MDR HDR	Residential Agriculture Very Low Density Residential Low Density Residential Medium Density Residential High Density Residential
Commercial	O NC cc HC SC RC DCR	Office Neighborhood Commercial Community Commercial Highway Commercial Service Commercial Regional Commercial Downtown Commercial Residential
Industrial	BP LI GI	Business Park Light Industrial General Industrial
Other	CR CF S P AU A	Commercial Recreation Community Facilities Schools Parks Adjacent Urban Agriculture
Reserve	RR IR	Residential Reserve Industrial Reserve
It is important that the users of this Policy Document understand that the goals, policies, standards and programs articulated in Part II are as important, if not more so, than the Land Use Diagram in representing the City's land use and development policy. Accordingly, any development proposals or review must consider this Policy Document as a whole, rather than focusing solely on the Land Use Diagram or on particular policies and programs.
Following are summaries of the General Plan's key land use proposals according to each of the major designation categories that appear on the Land Use Diagram.
Residential Land Use
The five residential designations that appear on the Land Use Diagram combine with a set of residential development policies to create a strong foundation for preservation and maintenance of Ceres' existing healthy

General Plan Summary
residential neighborhoods, improvement of other residential areas, and establishment of new residential development that follows principles that will create vital neighborhoods.
Existing and new residential areas are designated with a mix of designations. Residential Agriculture allows for ranchettes to buffer agricultural land on the east. Very-Low Density Residential allows for
i	larger lot housing. Low Density Residential is the primary residential
category reflecting typical single family housing. Medium Density Residential and High Density Residential are found in various pockets throughout the community, and include apartments and higher density homes, for a combination of rental and ownership opportunities.
Major new residential development will occur through future areawide plans that will precisely indicate the location and mix of housing types and densities. New residential development is to occur in distinct, identifiable neighborhoods that incorporate a range of support services essential to day-to-day living, including parks, schools, and neighborhood shopping opportunities, and that encourage walking, bicycling, and transit use.
The plan calls for the phasing of residential development to avoid the explosive growth of the late 1980s that overtaxed the City's ability to expand services. The plan identifies two geographic growth phases within the Urban Growth area and specifies that residential development not be allowed in the second phase until the first phase is largely built out.
To prevent sharp growth spikes, the plan sets a policy of 4.2 percent average annual growth (translated into five-year residential growth targets) to be implemented through areawide plans.
The plan also encourages the preservation and enhancement of the city's existing neighborhoods through maintenance and rehabilitation efforts and promotes continued infill development that maintains the character of existing neighborhoods.
The General Plan includes seven commercial designations which allow for commercial and office uses. Most commercial development is concentrated along the city's major corridors.
The Downtown Commercial Residential designation applies to the Downtown core area. This designation allows for a mix of retail, government offices, and entertainment use, and permits residential uses independently or as mixed uses with commercial businesses and offices, and provides for maintenance of historic downtown residential neighborhoods.
Commercial corridors are designated with Community Commercial uses, allowing for larger retail and office uses. Office uses are located throughout the community, providing for professional and administrative offices. Highway Commercial designations are located near SR 99 and along the Mitchell Road Corridor. Regional Commercial uses are

	designated in the area where SR 99, Mitchell Road, and Service Road meet. This area is planned for development with larger regional commercial uses, and possibly pedestrian-oriented specialty uses. Other areas in the northern part of the Planning Area close to SR 99, and along Roeding Roads are designated Service Commercial, allowing for heavier commercial uses. Neighborhood Commercial uses are intended for smaller, neighborhood-oriented shopping centers, both existing and those to be developed in new neighborhoods. In addition, the Plan promotes continued infill development and reuse of vacant and underutilized commercial centers.
Industrial Land Use and Development	The General Plan includes three industrial designations: General Industrial, Light Industrial, and Business Park. The General Industrial designation is applied primarily in the western part of the Planning Area, allowing for a wide range of industrial uses. Light Industrial areas are also located in the western and southwestern part of the Planning Area. Reflecting the City's desire to attract primary-wage-earner jobs, the area west of SR 99 and south of Service Road is designated for Business Park uses; another area on the northern part of Mitchell Road is also designated on the northern part as Business Park. The Plan also includes a policy section promoting economic development in Ceres.
Other	Public uses represent an important element in the overall fabric of a community. Accordingly, this Policy Document provides a framework for development of such public uses as government offices and facilities, schools, and parks and recreation facilities. In addition, this Policy Document includes land use policies and programs that recognize and reinforce the essential role that public uses (i.e., parks and schools) play in the development and maintenance of healthy neighborhoods. Urban areas of adjacent communities (e.g., Modesto, Keyes) within the Planning Area are designated as Adjacent Urban. Lands on the periphery are designated for Agriculture, reflecting an important open space and economic resource.
Reserve Area	Areas within the Planning Area that are not required to accommodate projected development through 2015 are designated as Residential Reserve and Industrial Reserve. The reserve designations indicate an overall intent that these areas would eventually develop with residential or industrial uses. These areas are generally located in the southwest and western parts of the Planning Area. Substantial urban development and annexation cannot occur within the Reserve areas without a General Plan amendment.

General plan Summary
Chapter 2:
Transportation and Circulation
The General Plan addresses several transportation issues that are critical to the continued development of Ceres. The Circulation Diagram depicts the proposed circulation system to support development under the Land Use Diagram. This circulation system is represented on the diagram as a set of roadway classifications that have been developed to guide Ceres' long-range planning and programming. This chapter provides for development of an expressway system consisting of Faith Home Road with a new bridge across the river, Hatch Road, and Service Road. The plan also includes policies for the City's major corridors to encourage continued mobility along these corridors as new development occurs. The plan also promotes the potential for expansion of transit systems, a bikeway system, and maintenance of goods movement (via truck and rail) and air transportation
The overall emphasis of the policies and programs under these headings is the establishment and maintenance of a well-rounded transportation network that includes fully-connected and intersecting streets, pedestrian paths, and bike paths.
Chapter 3: Housing
The Housing Element is subject to specific statutory requirements for periodic updates. The City completed a mandated update and adopted a revised Housing Element in 1993. Because the City devoted extensive recent effort to updating the Housing Element, it is was not revised as part of the 1996 General Plan Update. The element, as adopted in 1993, is included in this document as Chapter 3.
Chapter 4:
Public Facilities and Services
Chapter 5: Recreational and Cultural Resources
An important result of comprehensive planning should be the assurance that all facilities and services needed to adequately serve development will be provided in a timely fashion. While the development of detailed plans for facilities and services is beyond the purview of the General Plan, the General Plan does establish a framework for guiding planning decisions related to facility development and service provision. The general emphasis of the policies and programs in Chapter 4 of Part II is on ensuring the provision and maintenance of adequate services, while discouraging unnecessary, wasteful, or inefficient extension of existing systems or development of new facilities. Specifically, this Policy Document contains goals, policies, and programs related to water supply and delivery; wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal; stormwater drainage; solid waste collection and disposal; law enforcement; fire protection; schools; libraries; and public utilities (e.g., gas, electricity).
The policies and programs will ensure that current and future residents of and businesses in Ceres are served by a well-rounded, efficient, and environmentally-sound system of public facilities and services.
The General Plan sets the framework for an expanded park system with facilities to provide opportunities for a wide variety of recreational activities.
The goals, policies, and programs in Chapter 5 of Part II of this Policy Document articulate the City of Ceres' strong commitment to ensuring high

quality recreational opportunities for Ceres residents and visitors. The Plan envisions development of new community parks and a system of neighborhood parks. In addition, the Plan promotes the development of commercial recreation activities (e.g., a golf course, arcades) in the southern part of the Planning Area.
The General Plan also sets the framework for a program to foster historic preservation efforts in Ceres and preserve important historic and archaeological resources.
Ceres' agricultural and natural resources—agricultural lands, water, vegetation, wildlife, and open space— contribute to the city's economy and are important elements in the quality of life of Ceres' residents. These resources exist in limited quality and are at risk of destruction or degradation through continued urban development. The General Plan seeks to balance the need for growth with the need for conservation and enhancement of the area's agricultural natural resources, frequently in cooperation with other agencies. This chapter addresses preservation of the area's natural water and plant and animal habitat, and specifically addresses air quality concerns associated with new development.
This chapter contains goals, policies, programs, and standards designed to minimize the harmful effects of natural and man-made hazards, including seismic and geologic hazards, flood hazards, fire hazards, crime, aircraft crash hazards, hazardous materials, and emergency response. This chapter also addresses future noise concerns in Ceres and sets noise standards for future development.
This final chapter contains goals, policies, and programs designed to ensure that the City of Ceres maintain a high level of attention to the General Plan by providing for routine review and update of the Policy Document and Background Report and ensuring that other City regulations and ordinances are consistent with the General Plan.

NTRODUCTION
Part II of this Policy Document contains explicit statements of goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and quantified objectives that constitute the formal policy of the City of Ceres for land use, development, and environmental quality. Part II is divided into the following eight chapters:
•	Chapter 1: Land Use and Community Design
•	Chapter 2: Transportation and Circulation
•	Chapter 3: Housing
•	Chapter 4: Public Facilities and Services
•	Chapter 5: Recreational and Cultural Resources
•	Chapter 6: Agricultural and Natural Resources
•	Chapter 7: Health and Safety
•	Chapter 8: Administration and Implementation
Each chapter includes several goal statements relating to different sub-issues or different aspects of the issue addressed in the section. For each goal statement there are several policies which amplify the goal statement. Implementation programs are listed at the end of each section and describe briefly the proposed action, the City agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, and the time frame for accomplishing the program. Chapter 1 (Land Use and Community Design) also describes the designations appearing on the Land Use Diagram and outlines the standards of population density and building intensity for these land use designations. Chapter 2 (Transportation and Circulation) contains a diagram depicting the proposed circulation system and a description of the street classification system.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in this document:
Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and immeasurable.
Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action and implying clear commitment.
Standard: A specific, often quantified guideline, incorporated in a policy or implementation program, defining the relationship between two or more variables. Standards can often translate directly into regulatory controls.
Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or technique that carries out general plan policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and an estimated time frame for its accomplishment. These time frames are general guidelines and may be adjusted based on City staffing and budgetary issues.

Ceres General Plan Policy Document
Quantified Objective (Housing only): The number of housing units that the City expects to be constructed and the number of households the City expects will be assisted through Housing Element programs and based on general market conditions during the time frame of the Housing Element.
Users of this Policy Document should understand that the goals, policies, and programs articulated in Part II are as important, if not more so, than the Land Use Diagram itself in interpreting and understanding the City's overall land use and development philosophy. Accordingly, any development proposals or review thereof must consider this Policy Document as a whole, rather than focusing solely on the Land Use Diagram or on particular policies and programs.

Land use DIAGRAM AND STANDARDS
LAND USE DIAGRAM
DEVELOPMENT
STANDARDS
The most familiar part of any general plan is the land use diagram showing the types and locations of existing and future development the plan envisions. To appreciate and use the various designations shown on the diagram, the reader must first understand the purpose of each designation and the uses and standards associated with each designation. The following sections describe how the standards are expressed generally, then outline the standards for each of the designations shown on the City of Ceres' General Plan Land Use Diagram.
The Land Use Diagram designates land uses for the entire Planning Area. The Planning Area is bounded on the north by the Tuolumne River, on the east by Washington Road, on the south by Grayson Road, and on the west by Carpenter Road. Figure 1-1 shows the boundaries of the Planning Area.
The Planning Area includes the City of Ceres' Urban Growth Area (described below), areas designated as reserve for future urban development beyond the time frame of the General Plan (2015), some territory within the city of Modesto and its sphere of influence, and the northernmost part of the unincorporated community of Keyes. The remaining area is designated for agricultural and open space uses.
Ceres' Urban Growth Area encompasses all land envisioned for
development as part of Ceres through the year 2015 (see Figure 1-1). This area is further divided into two phases of development to ensure orderly development and prevent premature conversion of agricultural lands.
The Planning Area also includes areas designated for Residential and Industrial Reserve. These areas are intended for future planning and development after 2015.
Figure 1-2 shows the Land Use Diagram. A full-scale copy of the map (at one inch to 800 feet) is also available at the Ceres Planning and Community Development Department.
The Land Use Diagram employs 23 land use designations. These are defined in the following subsection. State law requires that general plans set out standards of population density and building intensity for all of the territory covered by the plan. These standards are stated differently for residential
1-1
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN, Chapter 1
and non-residential uses. Following are explanations of how these standards operate.
RESIDENTIAL USES
Standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as the allowable range of dwelling units (du) per gross acre.
Gross acreage includes all land (including streets and rights-of-way) designated for a particular residential use, while net acreage excludes streets and rights-of-way. In urban areas, net acreage is normally 20 to 25 percent less than gross acreage. In rural areas and open space areas, the difference between net and gross can be as low as five percent.
Standards of population density for residential uses can be derived by multiplying the maximum allowable number of dwelling units per gross acre by the average number of persons per dwelling unit assumed for the applicable residential designation. Typically, household sizes are larger in single-family homes than in multiple-family units, therefore assumed household sizes vary according to the types of housing and densities allowed in each residential designation.
The assumed average number of persons per dwelling unit for each residential designation has been extrapolated from population and housing unit estimates prepared by the California Department of Finance (DOF). These are summarized in Table 1-1 following the descriptions of these land use designations. It is important to note that the average person per dwelling unit figures cited under each residential designation do not represent City policy; they simply provide the basis for correlating the permitted number of dwelling units per acre with the potential residents of those units.
NON-RESIDENTIAL USES
Standards of building intensity for the non-residential designations in the General Plan are stated as maximum floor-area ratios (FARs). A floor-area ratio is the ratio of the gross building square footage on a lot to the net square footage of the lot, as indicated in the equation below.
FAR =

LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Residential
To illustrate, on a lot with 10,000 square feet of land area, a FAR of 1.00 will allow 10,000 square feet of gross square feet of building floor area to be built, regardless of the number of stories in the building (e.g., 5,000 square feet per floor on two floors or 10,000 square feet on one floor). On the same lot, a FAR of 0.50 would allow 5,000 square feet of floor area and FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 square feet. The diagram to the left illustrates conceptually how buildings of one, two, and four stories could be developed on a given lot with a FAR of 1.00.
The General Plan uses 23 residential, commercial, industrial, and other land use designations to depict the locations and types of land uses that will be allowed in the Planning Area.
Each land use designation is defined according to allowable uses and according to standards of building intensity.
Residential Agriculture (RA)
This designation provides opportunities for single family residential and agricultural uses on lots typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 acres.
Residential densities within this designation range from a minimum of 0.2 to a maximum of 0.5 du/gross acre. Housing types permitted in this designation include traditional detached single family dwellings and mobile home/manufactured homes. This designation is intended to be applied to areas on the eastern edge of the Urban Growth Area. Residential developments on properties designated RA will also be subject to special setback requirements to buffer with agricultural uses.
Very Low Density Residential (VLDR)
This designation provides opportunities for single family residential use on lots typically ranging in size from 8,000 square feet to one acre. Residential densities within this designation may not exceed 4.5 du/gross acre. Housing types permitted in this designation include traditional detached single family dwellings and mobile home/manufactured home subdivisions or mobile home parks. Residential developments on properties designated VLDR will typically consist of detached single family dwellings at estate and suburban densities.

Ceres General Plan Policy Document
LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN, Chapter 1
Commercial Land Use Designations
Low Density Residential (LDR)
This designation provides opportunities for single family residential use on lots typically ranging in size from 5,000 to 7,000 square feet. Residential densities within this designation may not exceed 7.0 du/gross acre. Housing types permitted in this designation include traditional detached single family dwellings, patio homes, zero lot line homes, attached single family homes (townhouses and condominiums), and mobile home/manufactured home subdivisions or mobile home parks. Residential developments on properties designated LDR will typically consist of detached single family dwellings at suburban to urban densities.
Medium Density Residential (MDR)
This designation provides opportunities for detached single family, attached single family, and multiple family residential uses at relatively high densities. For detached single family housing, lot sizes in this designation will typically range in size from 3,000 to 5,000 square feet. For other housing types, particularly attached single family and multiple family housing, lot size is far less important than overall density. Residential densities within this designation range from a minimum of 7.0 to a maximum of 12 du/gross acre. Housing types permitted in this designation include traditional single family dwellings, patio homes, zero lot line homes, townhouses, condominiums, duplexes, triplexes, apartments, and mobile home/manufactured home subdivisions or parks. Residential developments on properties designated MDR will typically consist of a mixture of attached and detached single family dwellings, condominiums, townhouses, and low-density garden apartments at urban densities.
High Density Residential (HDR)
This designation provides opportunities for attached single family and multiple family residential uses at relatively high densities. For attached single family and multiple family housing at these densities, lot size is far less important than overall density. Residential densities within this designation range from a minimum of 12 to a maximum of 25 du/gross acre. Housing types permitted in this designation include single family dwellings, patio homes, zero lot line homes, townhouses, condominiums, duplexes, triplexes, apartments, and mobile home/manufactured home parks. Residential developments on properties designated HDR will typically consist of a mixture of attached single family dwellings and apartments at townhouse-apartment densities.
Office (O)
This designation provides for medical, professional, administrative, general office, and limited commercial service uses such as restaurants, dry cleaners, and other similar uses that are intended to serve the employees and clientele of the office uses and the immediate surrounding areas. Residential development is permitted at densities of 5 to 25 du/gross acre, to include residential uses allowed in the LDR, MDR, and HDR designations when found to be compatible with existing and future uses.

Neighborhood Commercial (NC)
This designation provides for neighborhood retail and service uses such as supermarkets, pharmacies, dry cleaners, video stores, and other uses that generally serve nearby residential areas and carry products or offer services used by households on a regular basis. Office uses and business services may also be allowed provided that the overall character of the area retains its neighborhood retail and service orientation. Development in this designation shall not exceed an FAR of 0.5. Residential development, particularly on the second floor or back of stores, is permitted at densities consistent with the High Density Residential designation.
In older areas, these uses have been located along major streets in “strip centers." In newly developing areas, Neighborhood Commercial areas should be designed as freestanding, integrated neighborhood shopping centers with a site area of from 1 to 5 acres and anchored by a supermarket. Community Commercial (CC)
This designation provides for a full range of retail and service uses, including retail stores, food and drug stores, apparel stores, specialty shops, motor vehicle sales and service, home furnishings, durable goods, real estate offices, restaurants, entertainment uses, florists, hotels/motels, and other similar uses that serve a community wide market. Development in this designation shall not exceed an FAR of 0.5.
In older areas, many of these uses have been located along major streets in “strip centers.” In newly developing areas, many of the uses in the category tend to locate in freestanding, integrated shopping centers that can be distinguished by the scale and scope of their development.
Highway Commercial (HC)
This designation provides for uses designed to serve motorists traveling along State Route 99 at or near interchanges that are convenient and safe for such uses. This designation is also intended to provide locations for uses that depend on high visibility from the freeway. Allowable uses in this designation include service stations, hotels/motels, restaurants, and other similar uses primarily oriented toward visitors and travelers. Development in this designation shall not exceed an FAR of 0.5.
Service Commercial (SC)
This designation provides for the heavy and wholesale commercial uses that do not need highly visible locations, or in locations where noise levels or other conditions may limit the suitability for other commercial uses.

LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN, Chapter 1
Goals, policies, and implementation programs
The goals and policies of this section are organized topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to a key objective for land use and development in Ceres.
i	• Community Character and Identity
•	Citywide Growth and Development
•	Residential Development - General
•	New Residential Neighborhoods
•	Existing Residential Areas
•	Commercial Land Use
•	Industrial Land Use
•	Economic Development
•	Major Corridors
•	Mitchell/Service Regional Commercial Area
•	Service Road Business Park Area
•	Downtown
•	Reserve Areas
The overall focus of this chapter is to set the standards and policies for future development and redevelopment in Ceres focusing on high-quality, managed, orderly growth to achieve a balance of residential, commercial, and industrial development. Development should occur consistent with the City's ability to assimilate growth and provide adequate public facilities and services, while maintaining the small-town character and quality of life in Ceres.
The General Plan seeks to maintain Ceres' community character and to provide the city with a distinctive identity as it grows. Residents value Ceres' small-town qualities and agricultural setting. Policies of the plan seek to maintain those qualities while allowing for economic development and continued growth. This section seeks to create a distinctive community identity, with a major focus on the appearance and function of the City's major corridors included in a later section in this chapter. Policies in this section also seek to preserve physical separation, where possible, from nearby communities, to provide visual distinction from adjacent Modesto, and to establish gateways to the city.
Goal l.A
To maintain Ceres' small-town character and to create a distinctive city identity as the city grows.
Policies
l.A.l. The City shall strive to preserve Ceres' traditional small-town
qualities (e.g., family-oriented environment, stable neighborhoods, lack of traffic congestion, ease in traveling within the city, personal safety, community involvement), while increasing its residential and employment base.
^ZoMMUNITY CHARACTER AND IDENTITY
1-11
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN, Chapter 1
l.A.2. The City shall strive to maintain and enhance a unique community identity. To this end, where possible, the City shall maintain physical separation from nearby communities and provide visual distinction where Ceres abuts Modesto.
I.A.3. The City, in cooperation with the County, shall seek to establish a
permanent greenbelt between Ceres and Keyes. The City shall work with the County in limiting uses in this area by designating agricultural and very-low density residential land uses for this area, and shall seek long-term protection of these areas through dedication of conservation easements to agricultural land trusts and similar organizations.
I.A.4. The City shall oppose expansion of Modesto's sphere of influence south of its existing boundaries of the Tuolumne River east of the Union Pacific (formerly the Southern Pacific) Railroad tracks and Whitmore Avenue west of SR 99.
I.A.5. The City shall seek to provide visual distinction between Ceres and Modesto where the two cities abut. To this end, the City shall use signs and landscaping at entrances and along major corridors where the two communities meet.
I.A.6. The City shall create gateways to provide distinctive entrances to Ceres, particularly at key access points along the SR 99 Corridor, at the major entrances on Mitchell Road, and at transitions from Modesto and Ceres on Crows Landing Road.
I.A.7. The City shall seek to enhance the appearance of its major corridors as important structural elements in Ceres' physical identity, and as a feature to improve Ceres' image in attracting economic
development.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
1.1	The City shall commission a study addressing the location, design, and funding of gateway elements. The study shall include, but not be limited to, sign, landscaping, lighting, and maintenance. Such a study may be incorporated into studies for proposed interchange improvements.
Responsibility: Planning and Community Development Department
Time Frame: FY 99-01
1.2	The City shall work with Caltrans to formulate a landscape plan for the SR 99 Corridor to explicitly address the creation of gateways to the city at major access points (e.g., Hatch Road, Mitchell Road).

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Responsibility: Public Works Department
Planning and Community Development Department
Time Frame: FY 99-01
Due to its location along State Route 99 in central Stanislaus County, many forces are encouraging new residential and employment development in Ceres. The Stanislaus Area Association of Governments (SAAG) projects Ceres' population to increase from approximately 30,000 in 1995 to 73,100 by 2015, not accounting for the population of approximately 8,500 within the unincorporated areas immediately surrounding Ceres that already resides within the city's sphere of influence. The General Plan designates land to accommodate projected growth through 2015 and achieve a balance of residential and employment uses.
Policies in this section are intended to manage growth to avoid dramatic growth peaks. New areawide plans will be phased according to five-year increment growth guidelines. Housing units approved in adopted area plans (as of January 1,1997) will be accounted for in calculating the five-year growth allocations, but will not be subject to the phasing provisions of the General Plan.
Ceres has a history of compact growth, and has limited remaining residential infill land within the city limits, aside from approved land in the Westpointe and Brown annexation areas on the west side of the city.
Goal l.B
To grow in an orderly pattern consistent with economic, social and environmental needs, maintaining Ceres' small town character and preserving surrounding agricultural lands.
Policies
l.B.l. The City shall ensure that land is designated for development consistent with the needs of the community and to maintain a positive fiscal balance for the City.
I.B.2. The City shall promote and support the development of a healthy balance of residential, commercial, and industrial businesses within the city.
I.B.3. The City shall ensure that future development occurs in an orderly sequence based on the logical extension of public facilities and services.
I.B.4. The City shall phase future growth and development to provide for orderly growth and prevent premature conversion of agricultural lands. Two phases of growth within the Urban Growth Area are shown in Figure 1-1. Residential development will be permitted within the second phase when there is a demonstrated need for
1-13
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN, Chapter 1
additional land and there is less than a five-year supply of appropriately-designated land available within the first phase.
I.B.5. Annexations to the city shall be approved only after City approval of an appropriate areawide plan (e.g., master plan, specific plan) that addresses land use, circulation, housing, infrastructure, and public facilities and services, based on the annexation policy included as Appendix A of the Policy Document. The various areas requiring areawide plans are shown conceptually in Figure 1-3. The requirements for areawide planning and analysis of the impact on public facilities and services may be waived by the City Council for individual projects or categories of projects where these types of studies are determined to be unnecessary or impractical due to size, scale, location, or other special circumstances associated with the application to annex to the City. In general, these would include:
a.	Existing developed areas
b.	Existing or proposed public facilities
c.	Small-scale (generally less than 10 acres) infill or island areas
d.	Small-scale (generally less than 10 acres) areas located north of Hatch Road
e.	Unique economic development opportunities that offer significant community benefits (e.g., 100 or more permanent/part-time jobs, substantial sales tax revenues)
f.	Housing projects for very-low and low-income households.
I.B.6. The City shall endeavor to manage residential growth at an even and reasonable pace, so as not to exceed an overall annual average growth rate of 4.2 percent over the time frame of the plan. To this end, the City shall manage single-family residential growth through phasing provisions in new residential areawide plans. Approval of new residential areawide plans shall be based on the following general guidelines.
a.	Cumulative projected single-family housing growth within areawide plans should not exceed the following five-year housing growth increments.
New Housing Units by Five-yeat Increment				
Five-Year Period	1996-2000	2001-2005	2006-2010	2011-2015
Number of Units	2,805	3,335	3,173	3,787
b.	Areawide plans should include phasing provisions to avoid dramatic annual growth peaks.
c.	Exceptions to these general guidelines may be granted by the City under the following circumstances:
i.	If needed to provide for the City's fair share of regional housing needs

ii.	For any portion of the proposed development that is reserved for very-low- and low-income housing (as demonstrated through rental or sales limitations)
iii.	If the proposed development will provide substantial benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, the following:
1)	Provides for or assists in providing for needed infrastructure expansion that could not be accomplished without adjusting the growth parameters (e.g., wastewater treatment plant expansion, new trunk line)
2)	Provides for or assists in providing for development of needed public facilities that could not be accomplished without adjusting the growth parameters (e.g., high school, community park)
3)	Includes unique economic development opportunities (e.g., substantial number of jobs, substantial sales tax revenues) as a component of the project.
4)	Includes needed or desired community facilities (e.g., community center, golf course).
5)	Provides for substantial unmet or underserved need in the community (e.g., very-low income housing).
6)	Includes unique or special design or amenities that warrant special consideration.
Infill development, multi-family development, and areawide plans approved prior to adoption of this General Plan will be exempt from the provisions of this policy.
1.B.7 The City shall promote infill development and reuse of
underutilized parcels in the city, consistent with maintaining or enhancing the positive qualities of the surrounding neighborhoods.
1.B.8 The City shall oppose subdivision of properties in the
unincorporated sphere of influence where such development would compromise future City development.
1.B.9 The City shall promote pedestrian, bicycle, and transit access and circulation in designating and approving new development.
1.B.10 The City shall monitor technological advances that may affect planning (e.g., advances in the use of electric cars, changes in communications systems) to take the lead in planning for changes that may affect land use.
l.B.ll The City shall require development project design to reflect and consider natural features, noise exposure of residents, visibility of structures, circulation, access, and the relationship of the project to surrounding uses. Residential densities, building intensities, and lot patterns will be determined by these and other factors. As a result,
1-15

the maximum densities and intensities specified by General Plan designations or zoning for a given parcel of land may not be realized.
1.B.12 The City shall, providing reciprocal agreements are reached with
the City of Hughson and Stanislaus County, establish a permanent	.
urban growth boundary on the eastern boundary of the Urban
Growth Area to permanently limit urban development and preserve agricultural lands east of the city. This permanent urban growth boundary will also include buffers to minimize the impacts of urban development on the immediately adjacent agricultural lands.
To establish the permanent urban growth boundary, the City shall pursue agreements with Stanislaus County and the City of Hughson to guarantee that these jurisdictions would also not ultimately allow urban development in this area. In addition, to ensure the permanence of this boundary and buffering between urban and agricultural uses, the City will investigate the use of various additional techniques to identify the most appropriate combination of techniques to ensure its long-term viability. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, the following:
a.	Large ranchette lots on the periphery (e.g., to 2-5 acre lots) with setbacks to buffer with agricultural uses.
b.	Public or private recreational uses (e.g, parks, golf courses) on the periphery to buffer with agricultural uses.
c.	Purchase of conservation easements (including the use of mitigation fees on new development to address funding for this program).
d.	Sizing of infrastructure (e.g. water and sewer mains) to accommodate only growth on the east within the Urban Growth Area, to make future expansion more difficult.
e.	Design of circulation system to make eastward extension more difficult.
f.	Special provisions (i.e., a “supermajority”— four-fifths of the City Council) to allow any amendments to the boundary.
Implementation Programs
1.3	The City shall apply to the Stanislaus County Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO) for a change in its sphere of influence, based on the adopted General Plan.

Ceres' character is in large part reflected in the character of its
neighborhoods. To provide for projected population growth and associated economic development, the General Plan designates additional residential land to accommodate projected residential demand through 2015, in a mix of housing types and densities. Policies of the Plan address the overall quality and style of the new residential development. Infill, reuse, and intensification within developed areas is encouraged, as long as it reflects the character of the sur-rounding neighborhood and does not result in significant negative effects. This section addresses residential land uses generally, while the next two sections specifically address new residential develop-ment and development in existing residential areas.

LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN, Chapter 1
A IRPORT AREA DEVELOPMENT
The northeastern part of the Planning Area is close to the Modesto City-County Airport, located north of the river in Modesto. It is the oldest publicly owned airfield in the U.S., with its original dirt runway built in 1928. The airport serves the general aviation and commercial service needs of Stanislaus County. The airport has two runways for general aviation and commercial uses. The longer 5,911-foot runway serves the commercial uses, while the 3,459-foot runway is used for general aviation purposes.
In 1978, the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) adopted an Airport Land Use Plan for the Modesto City-County Airport. Under various provisions of state law, cities and counties are required to either bring their general plans and zoning and any specific plan into compliance with the adopted County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) plan for territory around designated airports or make specified findings. The purpose of the airport land use plan and the consistency requirement is to eliminate or minimize development around airports that would be subject to significant levels of aircraft noise or would pose a safety hazard to aircraft or occupants of the development in the event of a crash.
For the purposes of this General Plan, the City developed airport planning area safety zones and standards based on the guidelines in the 1993 California Division of Aeronautics Airport Planning Handbook, in consultation with the Modesto City-County Airport Manager and the California Division of Aeronautics. The City relied on the more current guidelines rather than using the standards in the 1978 ALUC Plan, since the most current guidelines represent more recent scientific and planning analysis of risks around airports, and to plan for and anticipate future changes in this area if or when ALUC updates its 1978 plan.
See also the "Aircraft Crash Hazards "section in Chapter 7, Health and Safety.
Goal l.H:
To regulate future development near the airport to provide for protection of public health and safety.
Policies
l.H.l. The City shall emphasize compatibility of land uses for both urban development and for airport facilities to ensure the availability of local air transportation services and a quality living environment.
I.H.2. The City shall allow new development within Airport Safety Zones (Figure 1-4) according to the standards in Table 1-2. At the discretion of the Ceres Director of Planning and Community Development, an applicant for a permit or other entitlement may be required to submit survey information sufficient to document the location of a property or development site in relation to the various Airport Safety Zones.

•	Building height and scale along the couplet roads should be no more than three to four stories
•	Buildings within the larger retail complex to the west of Mitchell Road should not exceed three stories in height, and should be sited in traditional shopping center
configurations, with parking surrounding the buildings
b.	Quality and character of public space:
•	Pedestrians should have priority over the automobile within the primary core area
•	Buildings within the pedestrian area should front on the property line with generous sidewalks and street trees lining and defining the public walkway
•	Buildings should front on primary street property lines at all intersections, although diagonal entrances and/or arcades are encouraged at such locations
•	A distinctive landmark should be created at the northern and southern entries into the master plan area to serve as gateways into the new pedestrian-commercial area.
I.K.5. The master plan or amended Mitchell Road Corridor Specific Plan shall contain a landscape plan that includes:
a.	A landscape concept plan for the retail area and parking lots
b.	A streetscape plan for public space (including sidewalks, street trees, benches, trash receptacles, street lighting, street and directional signs, and planted areas, information kiosks).

D OWNTOWN
Downtown Ceres is an important part of Ceres' small-town character and community heritage. Downtown is centrally located in the community with good access off SR 99, but is too small to serve a central major retail function for the city. Downtown includes many of Ceres' historic buildings and surrounding neighborhoods.
Policies of the plan seek to preserve and enhance this important resource by promoting increased retail, office, government, cultural, and entertainment uses in the Downtown, providing for some residential uses in second floors, and providing for parking, streetscape, and building facade improvements.
Goal l.M
To promote and support the development and maintenance of an economically viable and physically attractive downtown area.

Chapter 2 Transportation and Circulation
A city is both defined and constrained by the network of highways, roads, railroads, and transit services that move its residents and goods through and in and out of the city. Mobility within Ceres is relatively easy, and is an important feature of the city's small-town quality. The General Plan provides for the development of new roads and widening and improvement of existing roadways to serve new development. It also, however, promotes alternative forms of transportation to reduce air pollution, reduce the need for costly roadway improvements, and support those who cannot or do not wish to use automobiles for all trips.
This chapter addresses various transportation issues, including automobile travel and parking, transit, non-motorized transportation (e.g., bicycle and pedestrian travel), goods movement (truck and rail), and air transportation. It is divided into two major sections. The first section describes the Circulation Diagram and the roadway classification system and standards. The second section sets out goals, policies, and implementation programs related to the various forms of transportation.
The City's roadway network is designed to support 2015 development of the land uses shown on the Land Use Diagram and to reserve adequate rights-of-way for development beyond 2015. The General Plan seeks to maintain the city's relatively free-flowing traffic conditions while allowing for future growth. The City's most important policy tool for ensuring upgrading and maintenance of its roadways to provide for effective and efficient traffic movement is the Circulation Diagram and its associated standards.
Circulation
DIAGRAM AND STANDARDS
CIRCULATION DIAGRAM
ROADWAY
CLASSIFICATION
The Circulation Diagram (included as Figure 2-1) depicts the proposed circulation system to support development under the Land Use Diagram. This circulation system is represented on the diagram as a set of roadway classifications that have been developed to guide Ceres' long-range planning and programming. Roadways are systematically classified based on the linkages they provide and their function, both of which reflect their importance to the land use pattern and traveler.
Roadways serve two functions that conflict from a design standpoint: to provide mobility and to provide property access. High and constant speeds are desirable for mobility, while low speeds are more desirable for property access, particularly in residential areas. A functional classification system provides for specialization in meeting the access and mobility requirements of the development permitted under the General Plan. Local streets emphasize property access; arterials emphasize high mobility for through-traffic; and collectors attempt to achieve a balance between both functions.
2-1
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION, Chapter 2
Figure 2-1, the Circulation Diagram, presents the official functional classification of existing and proposed roadways in Ceres. The hierarchy of the functional classifications in the city consists of expressways, arterials, collectors, and local roads and streets as described below.
Freeways
Freeways are very limited access high speed travelways included in state and federal highway systems. Freeway design standards are established by the California Department of Transportation. Freeway access is limited to designated interchanges; no direct access is permitted for any use. Expressways
Expressways are limited access, moderate- to high-speed facilities that are intended to carry in excess of 25,000 vehicles a day. Expressways may have four to six travel lanes and intersect only with primary collectors, arterials, and expressways. The right-of-way for expressways will range from 100 to 158 feet. Expressways may access freeways at high volume interchanges. Limited direct access to industrial, commercial, and high density residential uses is permitted as approved through site plan review. For planning purposes, expressways are categorized into three generic classes, two of which are applied in the Ceres Planning Area. These two are defined below.
Class B expressways (Faith Home Road, Service Road, Carpenter Road) restrict access from driveways and local streets, and allow right-turn in,

right-turn out access movements from secondary collectors. Major cross street intersections are signalized with multiple turn lanes. The expressway receives 65 to 75 percent of the “green time” and therefore 65 to 75 percent of the intersection capacity. Consequently, Class B expressways have 30 to 50 percent more capacity than major arterials with the same number of lanes.
Class C expressways (Hatch Road) have right-turn only access restrictions for occasional minor streets, and allow left-turn staging in median from occasional collector streets. Major intersections are signalized, with 55 to 65 percent of green time. Class C expressways are similar to major arterial streets, but their access controls and preferential treatment at intersections give them about 20 percent more capacity than an arterial with the same number of lanes.
Arterials
Arterials are moderate-speed through streets. Average daily traffic on an arterial usually averages over 10,000 vehicles per day. Arterials will usually have four to six travel lanes with left turn pockets or lanes. The right-of-way for these streets should range from 90 to 120 feet. Access to an arterial should be primarily accomplished through primary collector and secondary collector streets. Limited direct access to industrial, commercial and high density residential uses is permitted as approved through site plan review. A driveway spacing of at least 300 feet should be maintained wherever possible. Arterials are designated throughout the Planning Area, generally creating a one-mile grid pattern.
Primary Collector Streets
Primary collector streets are intended to transfer traffic from collector and minor streets to an arterial. Average daily traffic on a primary collector will usually average less than 10,000 vehicles per day. They normally have a two-lane configuration with a right-of-way of 50 to 60 feet. Primary collector streets should provide direct linkages to neighborhood shopping areas. Primary collector intersections should be staggered to discourage their use as through access ways by-passing arterials. Direct access for low density residential, commercial, and industrial uses and developments should be permitted consistent with adopted improvement standards. Primary collector streets are designated throughout the Planning Area, generally creating a 16 to Yt mile grid pattern.
Secondary Collector Streets
Secondary collector streets are intended to carry moderate volumes of traffic from local streets to primary collectors and arterials. Average daily traffic on a secondary collector normally averages 500-4,000 vehicles per day. Secondary collector streets should have a right-of-way of 50-60 feet. Direct access should be permitted consistent with approved standards. Secondary collector streets are not delineated on the Circulation Diagram; instead they are located through the development and subdivision approval process.
2-3
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION, Chapter 2
Local Streets
Local streets are intended as low capacity streets primarily serving low density residential uses. Average daily traffic on a local street averages less than 1,000 vehicles per day, although most local streets average less than 500 vehicles per day. Local streets should have a two-lane configuration with a right-of-way of 46-60 feet, although narrower rights-of-way may be permitted in certain circumstances. The minimum right-of-way for local streets in areas designated for commercial and industrial is 60 feet. Direct access to local streets is permitted consistent with adopted improvement standards. Local streets are not delineated on the Circulation Diagram; instead, they are located through the development and subdivision approval process.
Table 2-1 summarizes the functional hierarchy of streets and street standards and Table 2-2 lists the roadways falling within each functional classification in Ceres, except for minor collectors and local streets, as shown on the Circulation Diagram.

ROADWAY SYSTEM
(j OALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This section describes the goals, policies, and implementation programs guiding the development and maintenance of the City's transportation network. The goals and policies of this section are organized topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to a particular aspect of the transportation system.
•	Street and Roadway System
•	Major Corridors
•	Residential Streets
•	Automobile Parking
•	Transit Facilities and Services
•	Non-Motorized Transportation
•	Goods Movement
•	Air Transportation
The global absence of urban traffic congestion in Ceres is an important aspect of the quality of life and small-town character of Ceres. At the same time, State Route 99 divides the city, serving as a good regional connection and offering opportunities for economic development, but also limiting east-west travel.
Future growth will require the development of new roadways and widenings and improvement of existing roadways. To maintain the city's small-town qualities and ensure smooth flowing conditions on city roadways, the General Plan establishes Level of Service D as the roadway standard for major roadways (e.g., expressways, arterials, and primary collectors), and Level of
Service C for secondary collector and local roadways, and includes provisions for the funding of new roadways to serve new development. The General Plan also
encourages improvements to the regional transportation system.
An analysis of conformance with the regional Congestion Management Plan was performed in connection with this General Plan update, which identified a multi-jurisdictional deficiency outside the Planning Area on SR 99 between Crows Landing Road and H Street in Modesto.
Goal 2. A
To provide for the long-range planning and development of the city's roadway system to ensure the safe and efficient movement of people and goods.
Policies
2.A.I. The City shall plan, design, and regulate the development of the city's street system in accordance with the functional

classification system described in this chapter and reflected in Circulation Diagram and with the City's street standards and specifications.
2.A.2. The City shall develop and manage its roadway system to
maintain Level-of-Service of at least C on secondary collectors and local streets and Level-of-Service D on primary collectors, arterials, expressways, and freeways. Exceptions to these level of service standards may be allowed in infill areas where the City finds that the improvements or other measures required to achieve the LOS standards are unacceptable because of right-of-way limitations, physical impacts on surrounding properties, and/or the visual aesthetics of the required improvement and its impact on community identity and character.
2.A.3. The City shall strive to meet the level of service standards through a balanced transportation system that provides alternatives to the automobile.
2.A.4. The City shall require an analysis of the effects of traffic from
major development projects (generally those that would generate 100 or more peak-hour trips per day). Each such project shall construct or fund improvements necessary to mitigate the effects of traffic from the project. Such improvements may include a fair share of improvements that provide benefits to others.
2.A.5. The City shall pursue financing in a timely manner for all components of the transportation system to achieve and maintain adopted level of service standards.
2.A.6. The City shall assess fees on new development sufficient to cover the fair share portion of that development's cumulative impacts on the local and regional transportation system. Exceptions may be made when new development generates significant public benefits (e.g., low income housing, primary wage earner employment) and alternative sources of funding for the improvements can be obtained to offset foregone revenues.
2.A.7. The City shall continue to support development of an
expressway system to handle regional traffic in the Modesto-Ceres urban area. In particular the City will encourage the development of Faith Home Road and Service Road as expressways to relieve truck traffic and through-traffic on Mitchell Road.
2.A.8. The City shall continue to participate in the countywide Congestion Management Plan.
2.A..9. The City shall encourage the provision of capacity-enhancing improvements to State Route 99 or improvements to other alternative routes or modes needed to accommodate increased local and regional traffic volumes and to relieve projected traffic

CORRIDORS
Responsibility: Public Works Department
Planning and Community Development Department
Time Frame: FY 97-98; 98-99
Ceres has several major corridors that serve a communitywide function, as the major routes of travel through and within the community. These major corridors include three roadways with substantial existing development and therefore limited opportunities for improvements, including Hatch Road, Mitchell Road, and Whitmore Road. These roadways are projected to carry additional regional traffic as the city grows, as well as accommodate traffic from new local development.
In addition, two new expressways (Faith Home Road and Service Road) are planned to serve projected local and regional traffic. These roadways are currently largely undeveloped with more opportunities to make necessary improvements as the city grows. These are planned to serve primarily a traffic-moving function; access to these new expressways will be very limited.
Goal 2.B
To maintain acceptable traffic flow along Ceres' major corridors.
Policies
2.B.I. The City shall seek to maintain acceptable traffic flow conditions along Ceres' major corridors while allowing for new development along these corridors. To this end, the City shall require site plans for new development along Hatch Road, Mitchell Road, and Whitmore Avenue. To this end, the City shall:
a.	Require consolidation of driveway access; if necessary, driveway improvements should include relocation of driveway access points on existing sites
b.	Require combination of parking lots and access points with joint access and parking agreements where possible
c.	Require medians where necessary to limit turning movements
d.	Require site plans to facilitate entrance and exits to avoid cars queuing in street
e.	Limit or prohibit drive-up windows where peak traffic queues cannot be accommodated on-site.
2.B.2. The City shall allow only limited direct access to industrial,
commercial, and high density residential uses along Hatch Road, Service Road, and Faith Home Road as approved through site plan review.

The General Plan seeks to protect residential neighborhoods from
excessive and high-speed traffic to maintain the quality and safety of
these neighborhoods. Policies of the Plan also encourage walking and
bicycling in existing and new neighborhoods through maintenance of
streets and sidewalks and by promoting the design of new
neighborhoods that provide for direct pedestrian/bike routes through
grid and modified street patterns, and by allowing narrower local streets
in appropriate circumstances to encourage slower traffic speeds and
create a more pedestrian-friendly environment.
Goal 2.C
To protect residential areas from high-volume and high-speed traffic and
its effects and promote bicycling and walking on residential streets.
Policies
2.C.I. The City shall consider the effects of new development on local streets in residential areas and require new development to mitigate significant impacts on residential neighborhoods.
2.C.2. The City shall promote connectivity in its residential street patterns. Where cul-de-sacs are permitted, the City shall promote pedestrian and bicycle travel by including pathways as appropriate to connect cul-de-sacs to other streets or community facilities such as parks and schools.

T RANSIT FACILITIES AND SERVICES
Good transit service provides alternatives to automobiles and is especially important for those who cannot or do not drive. Because of its size, Ceres currently relies on Dial-a-Ride; no fixed route transit system currently serves the city. As Ceres grows, opportunities for regionally-based transit will increase, particularly for areas of major employment. Policies of the General Plan support the provisions for future service by transit system, especially in connection with new development.
GOAL2.E
To promote provision of safe and efficient transit service to reduce congestion, improve the environment, and provide viable non-automotive means of transportation in and through Ceres.
Policies
2.E.I. The City shall continue to plan and implement additional transit services that are timely, cost-effective, and responsive to growth patterns and existing and future transit demand. To this end, the City will coordinate with Stanislaus County and City of Modesto transit agencies in providing and expanding intercity transit services.
2.E.2. The City shall consider the need for future transit right-of-way in reviewing and approving plans for development. Rights- of-way may either be exclusive or shared with other vehicles.
2.E.3. The City shall consider the transit needs of senior, disabled,
minority, low-income, and transit-dependent persons in making decisions regarding transit services and in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

2.E.4. The City shall continue to support efforts to provide demand-responsive service ("paratransit") and other transportation services for those unable to use conventional transit.
2.E.5. The City shall require new development to reserve space for future public transit stops, with turnouts, where sufficient population or employment concentrations will warrant an existing or future route.
2.E.6. The City shall strive to ensure that transit routes serve those
areas with the greatest need and the largest number of potential users.
2.E.7. The City shall investigate transit possibilities for the use of heavy rail right-of-way if railroads consider abandoning their rights-of-way.

N ON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION
Responsibility: City Manager
Public Works Department
Time Frame: Ongoing
Non-automotive transportation includes walking and bicycling. Improving the ability for Ceres residents and workers to walk or bike not only reduces automobile trips, with benefits for air quality, but it also promotes greater community interaction. This is one of the small-town qualities the General Plan seeks to preserve and enhance.
Policies of the General Plan seek to establish a comprehensive bike system and design new development to foster walking and bicycling.

I. INTRODUCTION
Housing is an important policy issue at the local level of government for a number a reasons. The economic well-being of a state and the well-being of its citizens depends on the adequacy of the housing stock. Both the state and federal governments have repeatedly stated that the provision of adequate shelter for all residents, one of the basic necessities of life, is a policy priority of the highest order. An adequate supply of housing affordable to a broad segment of the population is also necessary for a healthy economy.
The City of Ceres has had, historically, a satisfactory balance between the supply of housing at various costs and the number of households at various levels of income who could afford those costs. Until the 1970s, this situation was typical in most central valley communities. Land and infrastructure costs were relatively low, labor cost were substantially less than those in the San Francisco Bay area or southern California, and government fees were typically well below those of larger urban areas.
The balance between housing costs and income began to change dramatically during the late 1970s and early 1980s. During that time, many central valley communities between Modesto and Sacramento became the recipients of a tremendous immigration of people who work in the Bay Area but desired less costly housing that could be found in the central valley. At the same time, central valley communities experienced an unprecedented immigration of people from countries in south Asia and southeast Asia, most of whom were low income. These two trends resulted in a vastly different relationship between housing cost, availability, and affordability. Some of the more pronounced effects were:
•	that the average cost of new dwelling units increased substantially as home builders began to orient their products to the demand and higher income levels of Bay area workers, many of whom had realized substantial capital gains from the sale of homes in their former communities;
•	that the cost of existing housing began to increase at a more rapid pace in response to population growth, a higher level of demand for housing, and the effects that new home prices had on existing real estate values;
•	that many communities experienced an influx of immigrants, from foreign countries, increasing the demand for housing, in particular affordable rental housing for families;
•	that as small communities grew rapidly, the cost of expanding community services and infrastructure in a short period of time required that local governments charge higher development fees, thus increasing housing development costs;
•	that the increased level of demand for housing and development interest caused land prices to increase rapidly in many communities, although land costs were still well below those in most Bay area communities;
•	that the increased rate of residential development, never before experienced by many central valley communities, encouraged many communities to enact development regulations that tended to slow down the pace of growth to a more manageable level and to require more design amenities in new developments to mitigate the perceived negative impacts; and
•	that as a result of the changes described above, long- time residents and their children could no longer afford housing in their own communities.
The trends described above are amply illustrated by the tremendous population growth experienced by the City of Ceres over the past twenty years. In 1970, the City had a population of just over 6,000, a 36 percent increase from 1960. The City's population more than doubled over the following decade, to 13,300 in 1980, and doubled again
l
City of Ceres Housing Element
in 1990, to over 26,000. This rate of growth is substantially higher than in the county as a whole and is typical many small communities between Sacramento and Modesto that are within commuting distance of the San Francisco Bay Area.
Although more housing was built dining the 1980s in Ceres than during any other decade in the City's history, a widening gap was evident between the amount and cost of housing that was being provided and the ability of low-and moderate-income residents to afford this housing. For a number of reasons, the housing that the private market was able to provide was not meeting the need of many segments of the population. Among the reasons for this gap were:
The tremendous growth in young and immigrant households, many of whom are low- and moderate-income, seeking employment opportunities in the growing Stanislaus County region;
•	The increasing costs of land and land preparation, which are inevitable results of urban growth;
•	The need for the City of Ceres to charge development fees for the costs of most public facilities required to serve new development. As a consequence of Proposition 13, public facilities for new development could no longer be financed through general obligation bonds;
In order to offset increasing revenue losses from the State and County, the City‘s annexation policy adopted in 1995 requires that growth pay its own way, and that each area-wide plan is subject to a fiscal impact study that compares operating costs to the City for services provided with the revenues generated by projects to be developed under the plan. Fiscal mitigation is required when the study shows there will be an operating deficit.
•	Increases in construction labor and materials costs;
•	Community sentiment about growth, residential density, the physical appearance of new development, and the "quality of life" impacts that result from development. Community sentiment against higher density development and in favor of more amenities in new developments has placed local elected officials throughout the state, including Ceres, in the difficult position of trying to balance their constituents' legitimate concerns against the need to provide housing for a growing population;
•	Changes in federal tax laws which, for several years, severely affected the economic feasibility of constructing multifamily rental housing, the predominate type of housing affordable to low-income households;
•	High interest rates relative to average rates throughout most of the 1960s and 1970s, which plagued the housing market throughout much of the 1980s (it should be noted that interest rates for home loans are now at the lowest level in fifteen years but the availability of developer financing for residential development is in critically short supply);
•	Additional Uniform Building Code and state building standards;
•	Changes in community expectations about the minimum level of acceptability in housing design and construction (again, this is not an issue unique to Ceres); and
•	An inability of builders interested in addressing to the low- and moderate-income housing needs to construct homes affordable to that segment, mainly due to the factors listed above, and the choice of other builders to focus on the more profitable "move-up segment" of the market.
Since 1991, changes in the economy resulted in changes in the housing market. The recession triggered a deflation of land and construction costs. This drop in land and home prices, with a corresponding decrease in interest rates, had the positive effect of producing a wave of first-time homebuyers. In 1995, a survey by the
2
City of Ceres Housing Eiement
I
California Association of Realtors found that the first-time homebuyer -was responsible for 51% of the homes purchased in the state (up from 32% in 1991) - an unprecedented record. This change is evidenced within the City of Ceres by the increasing numbers of housing units built which meet the city’s quantified construction needs. From 1990-1995, 2 new homes were purchased by very-low income households, 8 bought by low-income households, and 552 new single family homes were offered at prices affordable to moderate-income households.
There remains a financial gap, however, in the ability of home builders to profitably produce multifamily housing for lower-income households. Much of this is a result of a reduction in funding at the federal and state levels for many low-moderate income housing programs. Changes in the federal tax laws have also made the construction of multiple family housing less attractive. The remaining programs that are available are therefore more competitive, and/or come with greater restrictions.
Since the majority of housing constructed in the City of Ceres since 1980 has not been affordable to low-income households, there remains a substantial unmet need among the City's existing low- income population. The City will also face housing needs from additional low-income residents who can be expected to reside in the Stanislaus County region as a consequence of employment growth in surrounding areas. Among these needs are:
•	an ongoing need for housing rehabilitation within the City's older area;
•	financial assistance to those low-income households currently residing in the City who are paying too high of a percentage of their income for housing;
•	the provision of housing suited to the lifestyle needs and physical conditions of older adults and mobility-impaired individuals;
•	the provision of housing affordable to future low-income residents of the community;
•	emergency shelter to City residents who are temporarily homeless;
•	the provision of affordable housing for low-income large families; and
•	the evaluation of current City programs that address affordable housing needs and the adoption of new programs in response to changing needs
The affordable housing dilemma facing the homebuilding industry is affecting moderate- and middle-income households as well as low- income households. In determining what these needs are, the report must evaluate all aspects of the housing market and availability of housing in general, as well as housing affordable to low-income households. A complete "picture" of the City's housing market is necessary to determine the appropriate strategies to pursue to meet low-income housing needs.
A lack of staff and local financial resources has limited the City's ability to take a pro-active position on affordable housing programs. Since 1991, two events have transpired which will provide the City with more local options to meet its affordable housing needs. In August of 1991, the Ceres Redevelopment Agency was established. The Agency estimates that, over its 40-year period of operation, redevelopment activities will generate $313 million in property tax increment, of which 20% ($62.6 million) will be set-aside for low- and moderate-income housing programs. The Redevelopment Agency is in the process of developing a plan for the use of the funds set-aside for housing programs, but has begun immediate implementation of three high priority programs. These are the use of redevelopment funds to match state grants for low-income housing rehabilitation ($64,000 was pledged toward a 1992 Community Development Block Grant Application); a program to provide up to $6,000 in assistance to low-income households for exterior home repairs; and a senior loan program to assist elderly homeowners in rehabilitating their dwelling units.
In 1993, the City created the part-time position of Housing Program Coordinator. This position has been responsible for the administration of the $500,000 1992 CDBG program, which was successful in the rehabilitation of 20 units occupied by very-low and low-income owners and renters; and administration of the
3
City of Ceres Housing Element
Ceres Redevelopment Agency’s $200,000 Home Exterior Grant Program, which assisted 31 very-low to moderate-income households.
In 1994, the Ceres Redevelopment Agency adopted a Housing Production Plan, which outlines the specific goals and objectives for the project area, the specific programs and potential projects, and estimated expenditures to be made during the 5 years covered by the plan. The Agency continues to support the Community Development Block Grant housing rehabilitation efforts through commitments of matching funds. In addition, it is anticipated the CRA will develop a housing rehabilitation program of its own for more substantial projects than previously allowed through the Home Exterior Grant Program.
In June of 1992, a joint Stanislaus-Ceres Redevelopment Commission (SCRC) was formed, covering 512 acres in two unincorporated areas: 1) the North Area consisting of the South 9th Street corridor and the Bystrum-East neighborhood, and 2) the South Area, south of the Ceres city limits, generally west of Highway 99, north and south of Service Road. Because this redevelopment area is so new, no specific programs have been identified for the use of housing set-aside funds. The Commission projects that, over 45 years, redevelopment activities will generate $155 million in property tax increment, of which $31 million would be set aside for low- and moderate-income housing programs.
In December 1994, SCRC adopted its Housing Production Plan, identifying specific goals, objectives and programs for use of its low-moderate income housing set-aside funds. The priority of SCRC during the initial 10-year period of the plan is to assist the development of new single-family residential construction and for providing assistance for first-time homebuyers. SCRC is currently participating in a first-time homebuyer program in the new Freitas Estates subdivision in the North project area.
In establishing quantified objectives for the implementation of housing programs (see page 77), the City has carefully considered the maximum effort it can put forth in light of it own local resources, regulatory incentives and mitigation measures it can adopt to overcome constraints to the housing delivery process, available state and federal financial assistance, and the ability of for-profit and non-profit housing developers to address low- and moderate-income housing needs. State law recognizes that a jurisdiction's housing needs may exceed available resources and its ability to satisfy those needs within the state's general plan requirements. Under such circumstances, the quantified objectives may be less than the jurisdictions' total housing needs. The City's quantified objectives at the end of this document are based on the following reasoning:
• That the maximum number of very low- and other low-income dwelling units which can be produced will be limited by the City's ability to entice home builders to take advantage of regulatory and financial incentives, and limited funding from state and federal programs. The City's position is that it cannot meet a larger proportion of the very low- and low-income housing need without greater state and federal assistance. In establishing its quantified objectives, the City has assumed that density bonus units, by themselves, will provide a maximum of 150 to 200 very low- and other low-income housing units each. The remainder of the very low-income housing objective will be met through the use of local redevelopment funds and state and federal subsidies, in conjunction with the City's density bonus program. The remainder of the lower-income objective will be met through a combination of local, state, and federal programs, used in conjunction with the City's density bonus program, and market- rate rental units, some of which will likely be affordable to low-income households without any governmental subsidies. In addition, a small number of dwelling units affordable to very low- and low-income households may result by encouraging existing home owners to construct secondary dwelling units.
Experience since 1990 has shown that the density bonus incentive, on its own, has not been enough of a financial incentive to encourage developers to produce very-low and low-income dwelling units. To date, there have been no projects taking advantage of the adopted density bonus program. Two separate developers applied for tax credits in the past two years to build a very-low and low-income rental housing project, but neither application was successful. Although the interest is evident, there is not enough financial assistance readily available for very-low and low-income housing projects.

• The quantified objective for moderate-income households assumes that market-rate rental units will be affordable to moderate-income households without governmental subsidies. The City does not expect that financial circumstances in the real estate market will stimulate sufficient construction of rental housing to meet 100% of the moderate-income housing need, however. A number of programs have been proposed to stimulate the production of housing for
-,	moderate-income households, therefore. These programs are still not expected to fill 100% of the
gap between what the private market, unassisted, could provide, and Ceres moderate-income housing need under the SAAG regional housing allocation plan.
History and Background
Ceres, located just south of Modesto, has experienced tremendous growth during the past decade. Many workers in the south and east Bay have settled in Stanislaus County due to the substantially lower housing costs relative to Bay area housing costs. Ceres has become part of the upper San Joaquin Valley growth trend, a trend in which communities from Stockton to Modesto have essentially evolved into an extension of the San Francisco Bay area housing market.
From a population of approximately 6,000 in 1970, Ceres has grown to a sizeable community of over 27,500 in 1991. The City has doubled in size in each of the past two decades. The 1990 Census shows that the City has 9,075 dwelling units, with several hundred more in various phases of construction. Even through over seventy percent of the housing stock was built during the past twenty years, there is still a substantial number of older units and mobilehomes, typically occupied by low-income residents. About 1,700 dwelling units are more than twenty-five years old.
The income of Ceres residents has, historically, been substantially lower than the average county-wide income. As recently as the mid-1970s, a typical Ceres household earned just 75 to 80 percent of the County-wide average. With the rapid influx of people from outside the Central Valley during the 1970s and 1980s, the income of a typical Ceres household more closely reflects the average county-wide income, and may even be somewhat higher during the 1990s. There still remains, however, a large low-income population composed mainly of original local residents and their children and migrants who moved to Ceres prior to the rapid population growth that began during the 1970s. There will be an ongoing need, therefore, for housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
During this period of rapid growth in Ceres, the housing needs of many long-time residents who cannot afford rising housing costs in the City, and of many commuters who work in lower-paying service trades, have not been met in large part. Among the reasons are the tremendous demands for single family homes by workers settling in the area, federal housing and tax policies which have reduced private incentives to build affordable housing, and the City's own inability to keep pace with the rapid changes in the local housing market and to develop affordable housing policies during these changes.
Since 1980, the median price of homes has risen from the low- to mid-$60,000 range in Ceres and surrounding Stanislaus County communities to about $130,000 in 1990. Most of the homes now under construction will sell in the low- to mid-$ 100,000 range. While these prices are low by the standards of residents and workers from the Bay area, they are nevertheless higher than the prices that long-time Stanislaus County residents can typically afford. In addition, the ability of the private market to produce affordable rental housing has been hampered by a number of local, state-wide, and national factors, including less favorable tax treatment of rental properties, a decline in government support for low-income rental housing, and the strong demand for single-family housing. About 72 percent of the City's housing stock is single-family housing, and little rental housing has been produced (about 200 dwelling units since 1986).
The City of Ceres has an opportunity to develop a workable set of programs to address its housing needs if it acts soon, before too much of the City is already developed. There are also a number of new state housing programs of which the City could take advantage if it has current information and a workable housing strategy.

The City's Housing Strategy
Collection of background data relevant to determining low-income housing needs
The City will enhance its ability to develop housing programs meeting the needs of all segments of the community if it better understands the nature of its housing needs. Background data analyzed in this Housing Element includes:
•	Determination of the number of characteristics of the City's population, including the total number of households, large families, female-headed households, elderly, and other specially identified sub-groups;
•	Determination of the cost of dwelling units by tenure and vacancy status that may be affordable to Ceres residents;
•	Estimate of the number of low-income households by tenure paying in excess of 30% of their income for housing (the prevalent standard at the time of preparation of the 1985 Housing Element was 25% of income);
•	Estimate of the incidence of overcrowding among City residents;
•	The condition of the housing stock and the proportion of dwelling units that may need rehabilitation;
•	Evaluation of how governmental, environmental, and economic factors may affect the ability of the City to implement an affordable housing strategy. Such factors include the land use policies, public facilities and service constraints, environmentally sensitive areas, interest rates, construction costs, and land cost and availability;
•	The incidence of homelessness and the present programs that are available in the City to address homeless needs;
•	The number of publicly subsidized dwelling units that are in danger of converting to market rents when federal or state loan restrictions are removed;
•	The effect that anticipated job creation in Ceres and surrounding communities may have on the need for additional housing;
Evaluation of Housing Needs
Based on the analysis above, the City assessed its housing needs. This assessment includes the following components:
A determination of current unmet needs among existing households as a result of overpayment, overcrowding, and/or substandard housing conditions. One result of this determination will be an estimate of the current affordable housing deficiency in the City of Ceres;
A determination of future housing needs by type, based on employment trends, current unmet needs, and internal population growth, and the possible conversion of affordable housing to market rate housing;
An identification of possible changes in governmental policies, market conditions, and infrastructure availability that could facilitate the provision of housing;

• A determination of special housing-related needs, such as additional services for individuals and families without permanent shelter.
, 1
Based on the evaluation of population and housing data, the City has developed a housing strategy, that is, a series of implementation measures to address the housing needs of all residents. The housing strategy consists of a set of proposed policies, programs, and activities with the purpose of providing affordable housing for all households, conserving through rehabilitation existing housing occupied by low- and moderate- income residents, and maintaining the affordability of existing housing occupied by low- and moderate-income residents. The strategy sets quantified objectives, timeframes for achieving those objectives, actions that must be undertaken to achieve the objectives, financial commitments that may be necessary and potential funding sources, and the responsible individual or organization for carrying out each program.
• 1
The City's housing strategy suggests goals and objectives for meeting low-income housing needs, identifies local regulatory actions and incentives that will encourage the construction of such housing, and identifies other specific programs which the City will adopt as part of the Housing Element.
Organization Of The Housing Element
This Housing Element will be separated into six areas as follows:
•	Evaluation Of The 1985 Housing Element
•	Community Housing Market Analysis
•	Housing Needs Assessment
•	Constraints To Housing Delivery
•	Findings And Conclusions
•	Housing Policy and Program Options
The evaluation of the previous (1985) Housing Element describes the progress and status of implementation programs adopted in the 1985 Element. The evaluation of the 1985 Housing Element provides useful information regarding the City's ability to implement a housing strategy and factors that should be considered in the future.
The community housing market and analysis gives background data on the population and housing stock of Ceres, most of which is data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau (Summary Tape File 1 - primarily population and household characteristics).
The housing needs assessment compares the number of households at various income levels with the number of dwelling units projected to be needed in Ceres by the Stanislaus Area Association of Governments. The ability of the City to meet its share of the Stanislaus County housing need is determined, in part, by constraints to housing delivery outlined in this study.
Finally, findings and conclusions presented in this study are addressed through housing goals, policies, and programs. These programs provide a method of implementation in meeting the Ceres share of the regional housing need during the duration of this study.

City of Ceres Housing Elemeni
How The Requirements Of State Law Relate To Ceres' Most Critical Affordable Housing Issues Among the provisions of California Housing Element Law are requirements that:
•	the City adopt, as a minimum goal, a share of the projected regional growth for all households as determined by the council of governments operating within the region (Stanislaus Area Association of Governments);
•	the City plan for the expansion of facilities necessary to ensure that the development of needed housing can occur over the five-year period covered by this affordable housing study, and beyond that timeframe;
•	proposed low- and moderate-income housing projects meeting City zoning standards be approved, unless the governing body makes specific findings regarding a potential health and safety threat if the project were approved;
•	adequate sites for the construction of housing affordable to all income groups be identified;
•	financial resources be identified that can make the construction of low- and moderate-income housing feasible;
•	that existing housing affordable to low- and moderate- income households be conserved, especially federally or state subsidized housing that may convert to market-rate housing within the timeframe of the housing element and beyond.
Other state laws address zoning standards, group homes, development approvals for affordable housing, and subdivision requirements as they relate to affordable housing.
To address the requirements of state law and to meet the City's affordable housing needs, while accounting for local land use policies and environmental goals, the City should investigate the following options:
•	Identifying remaining vacant sites that are zoned for residential use, and determining if any changes in density are appropriate to increase the feasibility of affordable housing;
•	Committing to the use of available state and federal programs that will work in Ceres to make the construction and conservation of affordable housing feasible;
•	Obtaining the participation of interested for-profit and non-profit housing developers in affordable housing projects.
The reader of this document should bear in mind that, although the policies contained in this study would, if adopted, require an active City role in the housing market, it is the individual decisions of private builders and developers that will primarily determine how much and what type of housing is built in the City that is affordable to low-income households. The City can act as a facilitator to the private market through its General Plan, zoning, and subdivision requirements. It can provide incentives to builders, both financial and regulatory, to encourage the private market to achieve public policy goals. The City can also have some direct impact on the "margins" of the housing market by financing housing rehabilitation programs and some new housing construction through government grants, redevelopment funds, and revenue bonds. The primary deliverer of housing remains the private homebuilder, however. The City does not desire to force builders to construct affordable housing when it is not financially feasible to do so even with regulatory and financial incentives offered by the City.

Consistency With Other General Plan Elements
The City has reviewed the other Elements of the Ceres General Plan to ensure consistency with the Housing Element. The City has identified the following issues which required special policies in the Housing Element to ensure consistency. No other policies and programs in the other General Plan Elements were found to conflict with those in the Housing Element.
Since the adoption of this Housing Element in 1992, the City initiated an update of the remainder of the General Plan, tentatively scheduled for adoption in late 1996. Because other elements of the General Plan were developed independently at various points in time, one of the main reasons for the update was to make sure that all the elements were more internally consistent and supportive. This update will provide a stronger link between the Housing Element and all other elements in the General Plan.
Land Use Densities. Residential land use densities in the Land Use Element, as implemented through the Ceres Zoning Code, provide a sufficient range of residential densities to meet the needs of all income groups. As documented in this Housing Element, there is a limited amount of developable land within the present City limits to accommodate Ceres' share of the SAAG regional housing needs. The City's strategy, therefore, is to annex land in large parcels to assure that a mix of housing types can be developed. At present, no specific residential designations are applied to land outside the City. Ceres will amend its Land Use Element as part of the General Plan update to apply the policies in this Element which call for the development of annexed land through specific plans and/or planned development permits in which a designated percentage of land will be set-aside for medium and high density residential land use to meet low- and moderate-income housing needs.
Public Facilities and Services. As explained in the chapter on constraints to housing, the City is in the process expanding its sewer treatment and water storage and supply capacity to ensure that these essential public services do not present constraints to development. Other public facilities and services—schools, parks, emergency services, streets, etc.-must also expand to meet the growing population. The potential constraint to providing these essential services is a financial one. There are no good alternatives to meeting the financial requirements of essential public facilities and services without imposing development fees, establishing special assessment districts, or both. These mechanisms add to the cost of development and increase housing costs to future residents. The City has included policies in the Housing Element to mitigate the cost impact on low-income housing of required public facilities and services.
In 1995, the City of Ceres adopted an annexation policy, which calls for the orderly and comprehensive planning of growth, and that new growth must pay its own way. The policy requires area-wide planning, including the analysis of the impact on public facilities and public services. This policy, however, recognizes that certain types of annexation applications may be excepted from providing certain impact analysis. Projects for very-low and low-income households are not required to provide these studies, recognizing that this would create an obstacle for the production of this type of needed housing.
Noise. The City has attempted to avoid noise-impacted areas in designating land for residential use. These are, primarily, lands adjacent to Highway 99, major arterial streets, and the Southern Pacific Railroad. Noise mitigation measures are included in the City's General Plan and subdivision ordinance, and will be included in development plans for lands annexed to the City. Noise policies should affect the City's ability to designate sufficient land for residential development.

Public Participation
Ceres has strongly encouraged public participation by all groups in the City through the following actions:
The Establishment of a Citizen Advisory Committee. This committee participated in the drafting of the Housing Element. Members were drawn from all segments of the ■community, including low-income housing advocacy organizations, low-income residents (which also included the Hispanic community), home builders, the real estate industry, lenders, local government officials, public housing agencies, and non-profit housing developers. The advisory committee met twice monthly between January and April.
Notices and Invitations to the General Public to Participate in Advisory Committee Meetings. The City distributed public notices to local newspapers, community groups, and public meeting places to inform the general public of the proceedings of the advisory committee and to invite any interested members of the public to attend committee meetings.
Public Workshops and Hearings. A public workshop was conducted by the Planning Commission on April 20, 1992 to review and discuss the draft Housing Element. The workshop was advertised through a notice in local newspapers, posted notices in public meeting places, and mailed notices to interested individuals and organizations. A public hearing was conducted by the Planning Commission on July 6, 1992, at which time the Commission reviewed and considered public testimony and written comments from the California Department of Housing and Community Development. Based on comments submitted to the Planning Commission and its direction, a final draft of the Housing Element was prepared and submitted to the City Council for a public hearing on August 10, 1992. The Housing Element was adopted on August 24, 1992.

II. EVALUATION OF 1985 HOUSING ELEMENT
This section evaluates the goals and programs of the 1985 City of Ceres Housing Element.
GOAL 1: CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE INVENTORY OF DEVELOPABLE VACANT LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
Program 1: Annually update the Ceres Vacant Residential Land Survey.
Status: The City of Ceres conducted a vacant land survey in 1985 as part of their Housing Element requirement. A subsequent survey was conducted in April, 1989. The table below shows the result of that survey. Because of financial and staff constraints there have no successive vacant land surveys completed since. The final totals of the 1989 survey indicate that the City has the potential capacity to accommodate 4,403 to 6,023 dwelling units on 227 acres. These acreage and unit estimates were from land within the City limits and within the Intermediate Urban Service Boundary as defined by the General Plan.

TOTAL	244-363	56.40
Source: Vacant Land Survey, 1989, City of Ceres.
Program 2: Approve zone change applications to create new residential land but only if found consistent with the Ceres General Plan.
Status: This is an ongoing process which has resulted in several zoning changes. One zone change application was approved which converted approximately 6.82 acres to residential use. The zone change applications which were approved were consistent with the General Plan or with an amendment to the General Plan. None of these zone changes, however, have been targeted for affordable housing developments. The City has traditionally taken a passive role in initiating zoning changes for specific development proposals. Ceres has not actively solicited affordable housing developments nor has it initiated zone changes specifically stimulate or encourage the production of affordable housing.
Program 3: Approve annexations within the Intermediate Urban Service Boundary that are consistent with the Ceres and Stanislaus County General Plan and annexation policies.
Status: The City of Ceres exceeded its goal of 190 acres of new residential land through annexations. Since 1986, approximately 590 acres of new residential land was added to the City's inventory through annexations.
GOAL 2: ENCOURAGE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO MEET THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS.
Program 1: Implement the goals and objectives, particularly the density standards, of the Ceres Land Use and Circulation Element adopted in 1984.
Status: The goals and objectives of the Land Use and Circulation Element continues to be implemented. The City's zoning code also conforms to the General Plan Land Use Element, which is evaluated in this study.
Program 2: Allow second dwelling units on corner lots located in the R-l, Single-Family Residential Zoning District.
Status: The City of Ceres allows duplexes on comer lots with a minimum of 9,000 square feet in an R-l Zone.
12
City of Ceres Housing Element
Program 3: Review the development application process to determine if the processing time can be reduced.
Status: The City's development review process was reviewed in 1988. It was found to be consistent with the minimum requirements of state law. To the extent possible, the City utilizes previously adopted environmental review documents in order to reduce processing time. Between 1987 and 1991, the City of Ceres added 2,540 new housing units to the City's existing housing stock. This exceeded the City's 1987-1992 Regional Housing needs of 1,425 units of new housing.
Program 4: Utilize the various residential zoning districts as provided in the Ceres Zoning Ordinance to encourage the development of a variety of housing types and tenure.
Status: The General Plan and zoning code allow for regulating residential development in a variety of housing types, as analyzed later in this study.
Between 1987 and 1991, the City added 2,347 units of single- family housing; 177 units of multifamily housing, and 16 mobilehomes to its housing stock. This more than met the City's Regional Housing Needs for single-family housing but only accounted for 30 percent of the City's Regional Housing Needs for multifamily housing.
Assuming that historically approximately 70-80% of the single- family housing was owner-occupied and the remaining multifamily housing (excluding mobilehomes) was renter-occupied, the City met its ownership objective but did not achieve its objective for rental housing established in conjunction with its Regional Housing Needs.
While no data was collected on the sales price or initial rents, it is reasonable to assume that the housing constructed during this period in Ceres, met the needs of all of the above moderate- income households and may have met some of the moderate-income households needs established as a part of its Regional Housing Needs. Without the appropriate data there is simply no way to definitively determine if any of the lower-income housing needs were met. However, since most lower-income households lacked the income to purchase new housing and probably paid more than 30 percent of their gross income for rent, it is unlikely that much of any of the housing built during this period addressed the affordability needs of lower-income households.
Program 5: Allow mobilehome units to be located in any residential zoning districts subject to specific conditions.
Status: The City's Zoning Ordinance was amended in 1988 to permit the placement of a mobilehome on a residential lot consistent with state law. This implementation program was also intended to meet a portion of the low- and moderate-income housing need (271 new units for households with moderate-incomes and 575 new units for households with lower-incomes). According to the 1990 Census, there were 860 mobilehomes in Ceres, an increase of 336 over the number reported by the City in its 1985 Housing Element.
GOAL 3: PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH LOWER INCOMES.
Program 1: Support programs that will provide financial assistance for the development of housing for lower-income households.
Status: The City of Ceres continues to support programs for the development of housing for lower income households provided by the Stanislaus County Housing Authority. In 1989, the City adopted a policy regarding density bonuses to encourage the construction of housing for lower-income households.
13
City of Ceres Housing Element
The City coordinates its assisted housing program through the Stanislaus County Housing Authority. The Housing Authority currently operates the following units:
•	104 farm labor units
•	30 unit HUD-assisted project
•	18 unit HUD-assisted project
•	138 Section 8 units
In addition to these Housing Authority units, there are approximately 75 HUD-fmanced Section 215 units that are privately administered. These projects contribute toward the regional need for lower-income households in the City of Ceres.
Program 2: Support programs that will provide rental assistance to lower-income households.
Status: This implementation program was intended to provide 212 new rental units and 114 new owner units during the time period of the Housing Element. The City did not issue or participate in the issuance of any mortgage revenue bonds during this period that would have affected the ability of lower-income households to purchase new or existing homes. During the period between 1987 and 1991, the Stanislaus County Housing Authority issued 23 new Section 8 and/or rental vouchers for lower-income households in Ceres. This did not meet the states quantitative objectives.
The small staff of the Ceres Planning and Community Development Department was occupied with processing numerous development applications and involved with other planning projects, such as the Mitchell Road Corridor Specific Plan, North Ceres Annexation, and West Ceres Annexation, that commanded a higher priority from a City-wide perspective. It is fair to say that when allocating the City's limited resources, that the City believes that the provision of affordable housing for lower-income households is a responsibility of local government.
Program 3: Implement Section 65915 of the California State Government Code which allows the City to grant a density bonus to projects that will reserve at least 25% of the total units to households with low- and moderate-incomes.
Status: The City maintained a passive role in encouraging the production of affordable housing and did not actively solicit affordable housing development proposals. One project was granted a density bonus between the years 1986 and 1992. This project was never completed. This falls short of the 55 units anticipated in this timeframe. During the period covered by this evaluation, developers found a ready market for their product without using the density bonus provision. The revised density bonus provision of the Government Code should be added to the Ceres Municipal Code.
Program 4: Require all new residential units to comply with state energy requirements.
Status: This implementation program was intended to ensure that 1,425 new units built during the time period of the Element will comply with energy requirements. The Ceres Public Works Department/Building Division requires that all new residential units comply with energy conservation standards by requiring energy conservation standards by requiring energy calculations by an engineering consultant. Therefore, all residential development approved between 1986 and 1991 complied with minimum energy conservation standards as required by the State of California.
Program 5: Encourage and support programs that educate the public about saving energy.
Status: The City of Ceres does provide printed information to the public about saving energy. All residential development complies with state energy conservation standards.
14
City of Ceres Housing Element
GOAL 4: PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY HOUSING BY MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE "SPECIAL" HOUSING GROUPS.
Program 1: Implement Section 5116 of the California State Government Code which requires residential care homes providing care to six or fewer mentally and physically handicapped persons to be located in any residential zoning district
Status: The City of Ceres approved one conditional use permit for expansion of a care facility. The Zoning Ordinance contains no provisions presently which address group homes and needs to be amended to clarify the status of residential care homes.
Program 2: Allow the operation of a residential care home providing care to seven or more handicapped persons to be located in any residential zoning district subject to a conditional use permit approval.
Status: See status of Program 1 above. The Zoning Ordinance needs to be amended to clarify the status of residential care homes.
Program 3: Support the development of housing projects for the elderly.
Status: There were two housing projects for the elderly that have been approved for a total of over 250 units. However, to date, neither project has been built, due to the inability of the project applicants to obtain sufficient financial commitments and a change in financial feasibility. Neither of these factors were within the City's control. While the opportunities were available to construct more than the Element's stated objective for elderly housing, other factors associated with the overall housing market apparently prevented them from being built. To the extent it was responsible, the City exceeded its objective for elderly housing. No proposals were submitted for handicapped housing. The City would encourage the applicants to resubmit their proposals should market conditions increase their financial feasibility. The City would be willing to work with interested applicants to identify financing alternative that could improve the financial feasibility of elderly housing proposals in the future, but has no control over the demand for such housing.
Program 4: Require new residential units to comply to applicable handicapped requirements as set forth in the Uniform Building Code.
Status: This implementation program was intended to ensure 57 new units for handicapped and elderly households during the time period of the Element. The City checks residential development plans for compliance with UBC and state standards for handicapped accessibility. Residential projects consisting of four or more units are required to comply with applicable handicap requirements of the Uniform Building Code.
Program 5: Inform the public about discrimination laws.
Status: This implementation program was intended to inform 56 new large family households and 85 new female households with children during the time period of the Element. The City has no active program to educate the public about anti-discrimination laws, but does provide a referral service to the appropriate County or state agency for those with discrimination complaints.
GOAL 5: PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLEASANT, SAFE, AND HEALTHY LIVING ENVIRONMENT.
Program 1: Expand the Wastewater Treatment Plant and the sewer system to provide adequate sewer service to all new dwelling units.
15
City of Ceres Housing Element
Status: The City's wastewater treatment and sewer system capacity have been expanded periodically to keep pace with development needs through the charging of development fees to pay for needed improvements. Because expansion of the capacity of the wastewater treatment must occur in minimum increments, the City must be assured that a minimum level of new development will occur to financially support the plant's expansion.
The Ceres Wastewater Treatment Plan and the sewer system have recently expanded to two new percolation ponds, and plans now are to hire a consultant for a major expansion of the Treatment Plant. Financing the next increment of sewage treatment capacity is a significant constraint to the production of additional housing.
Program 2: Install new water wells and expand the water system when necessary to provide adequate water service to all new dwelling units.
Status: Several new wells have been drilled; one is currently on-line. A new 1.2 million gallon reservoir was completed in 1991.
Program 3: Provide additional equipment, personnel, and buildings to the Police and Fire Departments as necessary to ensure that adequate police and fire services will be provided to all new housing units.
Status: This implementation program was intended to affect 1,425 new units during the time period of the Element. The City has hired additional police and fire personnel as needed to maintain General Plan standards for emergency service personnel as the population growth in the City increased. A new police station was constructed in 1988; no new substations were built for either police or fire during this period. The City has imposed development fees to finance the construction of fire and police facilities and to pay for additional equipment as required to serve new development.
Program 4: Continue to notify utility companies and the school district serving Ceres about new residential developments.
Status: All utility companies and the school district are notified on any projects of new residential development. All necessary public facilities and other services were made available to the 2,540 new housing units constructed between 1987 and 1991. The City has coordinated its review of new development proposals with the school district and private utility providers so that necessary educational and utility services can be expanded to keep pace with new development. The school district charges a development fee to help pay for the cost of new school facilities.
Program 5: Require the installation of necessary street improvements for new housing construction and expansion of existing housing projects.
Status: All new residential projects for new housing or expansion of existing housing include requirements for street improvements, including, but not limited to the installations of street paving, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street lights, and fire hydrants.
Program 6: Require all new housing projects and the expansion of existing housing projects to install on-site improvements consistent with City Standards.
Status: All new housing projects and expansion of existing housing are required to install on-site improvements consistent with City Standards. This includes, but is not limited to the installation of off-street parking spaces, landscaping, security lighting, fences, and open space recreation areas.
Program 7: Require all new housing projects and the expansion of exiting housing projects to comply with all applicable Building, Fire, and Health Code requirements.
16
City of ceres Housing Element
Status: All new housing projects and expansions are required to comply with all applicable building, fire, and health code requirements. Some of the improvements include the installation of fire hydrants, fire sprinklers, adequate access, structurally sound buildings, and proper trash storage. All of the 2,540 new housing units constructed between 1987 and 1991 included the appropriate street and other improvements required by City Code, and were all built to meet the Uniform Building Codes in effect at the time they were constructed.
Program 8: Require necessary and appropriate conditions during the review of a project to minimize any potential land use conflicts.
Status: This implementation program was intended to affect 1,425 new units during the time period of the Element. The mitigation of land use impacts is accomplished through the City's General Plan, the zoning code, and site-specific development requirements which can reduce potential conflicts between adjacent land uses. Such site specific requirements address issues such as noise, lack of privacy, smoke, dust, lighting, visual conflicts, signs, and parking. Land use conflicts may occur when commercial or industrial uses are located adjacent to residential zones or when high density residential zones or when high density residential projects are located next to low density projects. To reduce conflicts, the City routinely requires walls and fencing, screening of visually unattractive accessory land uses, special lighting, landscaping, and imposes restrictions on the operations of certain noise- generating equipment.
Program 9: Utilize available funds to install needed street improvements in older residential areas.
Status: Most of the land in older residential areas are zoned for medium and medium high density to encourage development. New construction will require street improvements. The State Local Transportation Fund is presently used to improve the streets. In 1991, the City of Ceres established a redevelopment agency. Funds from this agency will be used for improvements to streets located mainly in older areas of the City. Proposed street improvements: widening, overlay, curb, gutter and sidewalk construction of several streets in older residential areas.
Program 10: Require dilapidated and unsafe buildings to be demolished or removed as required by the latest adopted Uniform Building Code.
Status: The City only condemns substandard residential structures when there is no feasible alternative. Such dwelling units are likely to be occupied by low-income households, and the City does not encourage their removal since the stock of affordable housing for low-income households is limited. Dilapidated and unsafe buildings were demolished by the latest adopted Uniform Building Code. Approximately 22 buildings were demolished or removed, many of which were subsequently replaced, during the time period of the Element.
Program 11: Encourage medium and high density residential development in older and predominantly single family residential areas.
Status: A General Plan Amendment was approved in 1991 which changed the designation from single-family low density to multiple family medium density to encourage medium density development in an older, predominantly single-family residential area between Ninth and Tenth Streets.
Program 12: Establish a housing rehabilitation program.
Status: This implementation program was intended to achieve the following objectives during the time period of the Element:
15 units to be demolished and replaced, 120 new units in older residential areas, 154 units to be rehabilitated. Community Development Block Grant funds were obtained and utilized to rehabilitate 4 single-family residences in the identified target area. A revolving fund has been established so that program income may be utilized for additional rehabilitation projects.
17
City of Ceres Housing Element
A revolving fund has been established so that program income may be utilized for additional rehabilitation projects. A newly formed redevelopment agency is anticipated to provide future funding for housing rehabilitation. During this period, over twenty-two dilapidated and unsafe buildings were demolished. Nearly all were replaced in conjunction with new developments. An estimated 177 units of in-fill housing was constructed in older areas of the City. Additional units would have been rehabilitated had the City been successful at obtaining a second CDBG rehabilitation grant. The State Departments of Housing and Community Development found the City's grant application was not competitive with other applications but helped fund an Affordable Housing Study to improve future chances of obtaining funding.
GOAL 6: MAINTAIN A BALANCED AND HEALTHY CITY-WIDE HOUSING STOCK THAT WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE HOUSING CHOICE.
Program 1: Discourage the development of multiple family units with similar characteristics when the vacancy rate is 7% or greater after the regional housing need of 641 multiple family units are provided.
Status. This program was not applicable since the City did not approve more than 641 new multifamily dwelling units and the vacancy rate is below 7 percent. Federal tax law, coupled with the high demand for single-family housing, did not favor the production of multiple family housing.
Program 2: Conduct a vacancy rate survey for multiple family detached units twice a year.
Status: The City maintains current information on vacancy rates through surveys conducted by the Housing Authority. Due to understaffing, however, a vacancy rate survey for multiple family detached units was not accomplished twice a year.
Program 3: Maintain a City-wide housing type ratio of 70% single- family dwelling units and 30% multiple family dwelling units.
Status: The City of Ceres did not maintain the 70% to 30% single-family to multiple family dwelling units, because 641 new multiple family dwellings were not constructed. Market conditions and federal tax code provisions favored single-family housing over multiple family housing. As a result, 92% of the new housing constructed in Ceres between 1987 and 1991 consisted of single-family housing, most of which was detached.
Evaluation of the Results of City Programs
The City has been highly successful in planning for, accommodating, and even exceeding its regional share of housing overall. The City designated adequate land to accommodate a variety of housing types at a range of densities to meet the housing needs of all income levels. Ceres also took the necessary steps to ensure that adequate infrastructure capacity and public and private utility services were available to accommodate new development.
The City has fallen short of its low-income housing objectives for both new construction and for the preservation and conservation of existing affordable housing. The City's inability to meet its affordable housing objectives has a number of causes:
The City has reduced barriers to the production of housing for low-income and special population groups by offering density bonuses, zoning land for multifamily use, allowing group homes, allowing mobilehomes on single family lots, and permitting second units in single family neighborhoods. The dynamics of the local housing market between 1985 and 1990 were such that these incentives were insufficient to entice home builders to construct housing affordable to low-income households.
18
City of Ceres Housing Element
The City has depended on the Housing Authority as the primary agency for developing, operating, or rehabilitating affordable housing. The City has not actively sought cooperative or joint-partnership relationships with private for-profit or non- profit housing developers to construct and operate affordable housing because of the lack of technical ability and staff resources.
•	The City has had limited staff and financial resources to undertake housing programs. The City's redevelopment project was not adopted by the City until August 1991. It will be several years before a substantial amount of housing set-aside funds are generate to provide financial resources for affordable housing developments. The City did not have the staffing capacity to apply for and implement most of the programs for which Ceres might be eligible.
•	Homebuilders during the 1980s oriented their production primarily to the demand by Bay area workers for single family homes. This is understandable since the demand for single family homes in the low- to mid-$ 100,000s range was extremely high between 1983 and 1990. As previously explained, the City's strategy emphasizes the use of planning processes and incentives to accommodate affordable housing but does not actively require home builders to produce a certain type of housing.
•	Changes in federal tax laws, high interest rates for the financing of multifamily developments, the relationship between market rents in Ceres and rental housing development costs, and the City's inability to take advantage of state and federal programs that can provide low-cost financing for multifamily rental housing development.
Therefore, many of the programs included in the 1986 Housing Element were not fully realized. There is likely to be less federal funding for housing programs, and state funding will also decrease over the next five years unless voters approve additional housing bonds in 1992. The success of City efforts to accomplish affordable housing strategies will have to depend on the more effective use of these limited resources and on other actions that do not require state and federal assistance. The City's ability to achieve its regional housing share for lower-income households is directly related to the amount of state and federal subsidies available. The City can probably rely on zoning and other regulatory incentives and financial incentives from redevelopment funds to meet moderate and a portion of its lower- income housing needs.
The City is in a better position, administratively, to achieve more of its affordable housing objectives than in 1985. Based on its experience over that past five years, affordable housing programs most likely to be successful in Ceres are those that do not require a substantial City commitment of financial resources (as the City has little money to allocate for affordable housing programs), that rely heavily on cooperative relationships with private homebuilders, which can use City as an eligible entity to apply for state or federal funding on behalf of non-profit or for- profit housing developers, and that can succeed in inducing private actions with regulatory incentives rather than with large commitments of public financing.
In developing an affordable housing strategy, the City has taken into account limitations which prevented it from fully accomplishing its 1986 objectives for affordable housing and has set new objectives at more realistic level based on the limitation that still remain. The objectives for affordable housing in this study are based on the following assumptions:
•	That the City will have annual funding for affordable housing from its redevelopment low-income housing set-aside fund, established in 1991;
•	That the City will take a somewhat more active role in promoting affordable housing production by seeking out non-profit and for-profit housing developers interested in affordable housing projects within Ceres and by setting negotiated, affordable housing goals for new residential development in exchange for the provision of regulatory and financial incentives;

That, homebuilders will devote more of their product to the entry level market and provide more housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households by Stanislaus County standards (this trend is already evident as more jobs are created in the County and homebuilders will have to respond to needs based more on local income rather than Bay area incomes); and
That the financial feasibility of producing multifamily rental housing will increase during the early 1990s, particularly if interest rates remain relatively low.
That the needs of moderate- and above moderate-income households can be met through City polices designed to promote homeownership.
That the needs of most very low- and low-income households will have to be met through City policies designed to encourage the production of rental housing.

STATISTICAL SUMMARY
Population: The population reported by the 1990 Census for the City of Ceres was 26,314. This compared with 6,029 persons in 1970 and 13,281 persons in 1980. The Department of Finance estimated the City's population at 27,524 as of January 1, 1991, and 31,243 as of January 1, 1995. The City's population doubled in the ten year span from 1970 to 1980 (120.3% increase) and almost double^ again (98.1% increase) during the last decade. If the growth rate between 1990 and 1995 is sustained over the remainder of the decade, it would lead to more than a 37 percent increase in the City's population.
The population reported by the Census for Stanislaus County was 195,790 in 1970 and 265,900 in 1980. The 1990 Census reported the County's population at 370,522, a 39 percent increase from 1980. The table below shows population totals for the City and County from 1970 to 1990.

POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS
During the past twenty years, there have been some changes in the composition of the City's population as a consequence of its growth. While all age groups have increased in total numbers since 1970, the relative composition by age group has changed. In the ten year period between 1970 and 1980, the percentage of the population in age groups 18-64 (from 52.9% to 58.9%) and 65+ (from 7.7% to 9.7%) rose, while the percentage of persons in the age group 0-17 declined (from 39.3% to 31.4%). This trend, a decrease in the children population and an increase in the adult and elderly population was not continued through the decade of the 1980/s. As the table below shows, the percentage of the population 0-17 increased slightly to 33.1%, and the adult (18-64) and elderly (65+) age groups both decreased slightly to 58.5% and 8.5% respectively. Since the population almost doubled in size while the elderly population was decreasing slightly indicates that many of the new residents were families with children.

HOUSING UNIT AND POPULATION PROJECTIONS
The City of Ceres has doubled in population in each of the last two decades. In the five-year period from 1990 to 1995 the population of Ceres, and the County of Stanislaus, is expected to continue to grow, even by moderate estimates. The Stanislaus Area Association of Governments regional housing allocation plan contained a 1995 household projection of 10,983 and a 1997 household projection of 12,209 (July of 1997). The SAAG projection for the County are 146,685 and 157,207 respectively. The projections for the City are based on a annual growth rate of 4.31%.
The following table shows SAAG household statistics and projections for the City of Ceres from 1990 to 1997.

As will be shown later in this study, a household population of 12,209 in 1997 will translate into a demand for housing in the City of over 12,630 units. To satisfy this demand for housing, the City of Ceres has either or approved or is reviewing a number of development projects. Several of these projects are currently under construction. Proposed projects or projects under construction in the City include the following:

EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
As was indicated in the 1985 City of Ceres Housing Element, Ceres is primarily a "bedroom" community which provides very little employment within the City. In 1980, the Census reported that of a total City labor force of 4,906, there were 4,029 or 82% of the employed population that worked outside of the City. In 1990, the Census reported that of a total labor force of 10,194, there were 8,432 or 83% of the employed population working outside the city. Therefore, a housing/jobs imbalance existed and still exists in the City. The majority of Ceres resident workers commute to Modesto (40.5%) and other destinations in Stanislaus County (19.5%), San Joaquin County (2.3%), and Merced County (.85%). Only a small percentage (2.6%) commute to the San Jose area, which substantiates that Ceres does not have a predominance of Bay Area commuters.
In 1980, jobs held by residents of Stanislaus County were concentrated in four areas: wholesale & retail trade
(21.2%), manufacturing (20.1%), government (16.1%), and services (15.9%). By the start of 1990, these four areas were still the primary areas of concentration in the County with the following percentages: manufacturing (19.4%), retail trade (now separated from wholesale trade - 18.2%), services (18.0%), and government (14.4%). The table below shows the employment totals for the County of Stanislaus in 1989 and 1996 reported by the California Employment Development Department [EDD],

The 1989 County-wide labor-force, although significantly stronger than in 1988, still left over 18,000 persons without jobs that translated into an unemployment rate of 11.2%. In 1990, employment declined by 1,500 persons, and thus the unemployment rate in the County increased one-tenth of a percentage point in 1990, to 11.3%. In May, 1996, there were 29,800 persons without jobs in the County, for an unemployment rate of 15.4%. EDD forecasted employment figures by industry through 1996. The table below shows the trend of employment in the County in 1996 based on EDD's projections, and now compares those to actual figures released by EDD in May, 1996.
According to this projection, the services sector will show the most substantial increase. The sector will rely on growth in health, business, personal, and hospitality services to increase by 7,300 jobs and 31.1%. It's share of the total County economy will grow from 18.0% in 1989 to 22.0% in 1996. Actual figures indicate that the services sector did show the most substantial increase between 1989 and 1996, growing from 18.0% to 20.6%.
Retail trade will also show significant gains, providing 5,100 new jobs by 1996, an increase of 21.4%. EDD attributes growth to "...increasing numbers of eating and drinking establishments, food stores, and general merchandise businesses...to meet the needs of newly established and growing communities." The retail sector will provide 19.0% of the jobs in the County in 1996, up from 18.2% in 1989. Actual 1996figures match the projected increase in the retail sector.
Other sectors showing growth are the sectors of government (17.6% increase), construction and mining, and manufacturing. The most notable decrease is shown in the agricultural sector, which is projected to decline by 1,100 jobs during the period 1989-1996. This trend is expected to increase as the central valley continues to urbanize and as the available water supply becomes further constrained for agriculture uses. Actual 1996 figures reveal that the government sector had the second greatest increase, from 14.4°% to 16.5%. A smaller increase was noted in transportation/utilities. Although employment in agriculture declined as anticipated, the rate was not as steep as anticipated. More notable decreases were seen in the construction and manufacturing sectors, with decreases also in wholesale trade, and finance, insurance and real estate.

In addition to annual employment projections, EDD records and estimates the outlook for specific occupations based on wages earned and training required for entry into the field. This information is "...intended to aid employment training planners, governmental policy makers, educators, and counselors in planning and evaluating training programs and in counseling clients." This information is also intended to help persons entering the Stanislaus County workforce prepare and plan for their future.
EDD projects the outlook and wages through 1992 in the following occupations. Entry wage is based on no prior experience.
Accounting Clerk. Entry wage - $5.00-$8.50/hr. Fully qualified/experienced - $8.50-$11.00/hr. Minimum education of high school or equivalent required.

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Race
Racial diversity in the City of Ceres was, historically, minimal. At the time of the 1990 Census, the majority of City residents were still of persons of white origin (77.9% of total), although this percentage was substantially lower than in previous decades. This is a typical pattern throughout most suburban communities in urban-rural counties in California. Since 1970, there has been a steady but slow change in the City's racial composition. In 1970, 98.1% of the population were of white origin. In 1980, this percentage of persons of white origin had decreased to 81.3%. The tables below shows race in the City in 1990 and the characteristics of persons of hispanic background (5,960 persons in the City in 1990).

Household And Family Characteristics
There were 4,672 households in Ceres in 1980, an increase of 1,810 households from 1970. During this ten year period the average household size decreased from 3.30 persons in 1970 to 2.82 persons in 1980.
During the ten-year span from 1980 to 1990, the number of households in the City increased from 4,672 to 8,581, or 83.7%. Of the 8,581 households in 1990, 6,851 (79.8%) were family households. The percentage of family households is high compared to other urban areas of the state but is consistent with smaller suburban communities in the Central Valley, which tend to have more and larger families in their populations than do coastal urban

HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY INCOME CHARACTERISTICS
Household Income
The median household income for the City of Ceres was $15,623 in 1980, and $30,876 in 1990 (U.S. Census). The median family income in the City of Ceres increased from $15,623 in 1980 to $33,684 in 1990 (U.S. Census). Household income includes all occupied housing units in the City, while family income includes only those households with two or more persons related by kinship, marriage, or legal arrangements (such as adoption).
Table 12 shows Income Eligibility Limits for various state housing programs as published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in 1991. While these income limits do not represent actual household incomes based on a survey, they do provide a relative reference for defining "low" and "moderate" income by household size. The definition of "median" income for a family of three (the approximate average family size in Ceres) was $33,750 throughout Stanislaus County in 1991.
The HCD income eligibility limits are based on a family of four for the entire Stanislaus County statistical area. HCD provided income limits for the following divisions that are 50% (very low-income), 80% (lower- income),
28

and 120% (moderate-income) of the median income for a family of four. The income divisions for families from one to four persons for 1991 are shown in the table below.

Household Overpayment
At the time of the 1980 Census, the prevalent governmental standard of "overpayment" for housing was more than 25% of income for housing expenses (rent or mortgage, property taxes, insurance, utilities, etc.). The standard since then has been to use 30% of income-to-housing- expenses. In 1980, 1,562 households paid more than 25% of their income for housing or one third of all households in the City. In 1990, 2,956 households paid more than 30% of their income on home costs, again approximately one third of all households in the city.
The highest percentage of overpaying households was among renters, 47.6%. Approximately 27% of the owners paid more than 30% of their income for housing expenses. The table below shows the tenure of overpaying households in the City of Ceres in 1990.

HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
Housing Type
In 1980 the total number of housing units in the City of Ceres was 5,238. This total consisted of 3,928 single-family dwelling units (75%), 800 multifamily dwelling units (15%), and 510 mobilehomes (10%). These percentages were similar to totals by dwelling unit type reported in 1975, which were 71%, 21%, and 8% respectively (1975 Special Census for Stanislaus County).
In 1990 the total number of units in the City had increased to 9,075. This total included 6,520 single-family units (71.7%), 1,642 multifamily units (18.0%), and 860 mobilehome units (9.6%). Again, these percentages of dwelling units by type are similar to the 1975 and 1980 totals. The table below shows the total number of housing units by type in 1990 in the City.

There were 6,851 family households, or 79.8% of the total households, in the City in 1990. The majority of these households, 63.5% of total households, were two- to four-person households. Renter households, which accounted for 20.2% of the total households, were concentrated primarily in one-persons households (15.7%). The table below shows the household type and household size in the City in 1990.

The number of housing units constructed over the last several years has dropped off dramatically from previous years. In 1988 the total number of housing units built in the City was 803. Two years later, in 1990, the City only approved the construction of 393 housing units, and this figure dropped to only 128 units in 1991. From 1992-1995, the number of housing units constructed averaged 169 per year. Based on the supply of residential land

available in the City, these decreasing numbers seem to indicate the slow housing market many communities are facing during this recession.

Housing Tenure
Housing tenure is the condition of occupancy of the housing unit, rental or owner. Housing tenure in the City of Ceres over the last ten years has shifted slightly, with the percentage of owners increasing and the percentage of renters decreasing. Of the total 5,238 housing units in l'98O, 62% were owner-occupied units and 38% were renter-occupied units. In 1990, 66% of householders in the City of Ceres were homeowners and 34% were renters. The table below shows the tenure by housing type in the City in 1990. Not surprisingly, the majority of rental units are in multifamily structures of five or more dwelling units. Although a substantial number of single family dwelling units are rented, the percentage is lower than in larger urban communities, where 20% to 30% rental rates for single-family dwelling units is not uncommon.

In 1990, the majority of households in the City of Ceres, 31.8% of total households, in the age-group 25-44 years were homeowners. The percentage of renters in this same group were also high, 20.2%. Therefore, over 50% of the households were headed by persons 25 to 44 years of age. The table below shows the tenure of households in the City by age of householder in 1990.

Vacancy Rates
According to Census data, the number of vacant housing units in the City of Ceres have fluctuated over the last decade and a half from around 6% to over 10% and back toward 6%. Much of this increased vacancy rate, especially during 1980, can be attributed to the considerable amount of new construction in the City. During the early 1980s, in particular, a large number of newly constructed units remained vacant for a considerable period of time due to high mortgage interest rates.
The 1990 Census count shows a vacancy rate of 5.4%. The Census counts those units under construction or recently completed but not yet ready for occupancy as "vacant", which means that the effective vacancy rate is lower. The table below shows the vacancy rates reported in residential areas in 1990.

Vacancy rates provide indicators for the vitality of the housing market. High or low vacancy rates also have a different significance for owner-occupied and renter-occupied units. For example, a higher vacancy rate (perhaps 5%-6%) is not uncommon in rental units as householders are more mobile with short-term leases, and for the same reason lower vacancy rates are expected in for-sale homes as the market turnover is not as high. As indicated above, the high vacancy rate in 1980 may be mainly attributed to housing units under construction but not yet occupied, as the market absorbed them by 1990. The table below shows the vacancy status by housing unit type in the City of Ceres in 1990.

Housing Condition
In 1990, a "windshield" housing conditions survey was conducted for the City of Ceres, which determined that there were 276 dwelling units in need of rehabilitation, and one unit in need of replacement because it was dilapidated. These housing units were located in the older, central core of the City. The survey categorized each housing unit in the target area by its condition. The categories are as follows:
•	Sound: no repairs are required or, at most, only deferred maintenance is required. Deferred maintenance includes painting and patching.
•	Minor: requires deferred maintenance repairs of several components of the replacement or siding, windows, or doors.
•	Moderate: involves the repair or replacement of two or more exterior components of a dwelling unit, such as roof replacement, foundation repair, window repair, or the replacement of siding.
•	Substantial: requires the repair or replacement of most structural components.
•	Dilapidated: requires the replacement of all exterior components, and is not financially feasible to repair.

Most of the City's housing stock (80%), for example, was constructed over the past twenty years and is most likely in good condition. Although the housing conditions survey found only about two percent of the City's dwelling units in need of immediate rehabilitation, another one percent of the City's dwelling units (104) require deferred maintenance repairs (minor deficiencies such as painting or roof patching only) that, if left unattended will result in the need for rehabilitation within the next one to three years.
Two percent of the City's housing stock may not seem substantial compared to the other 98% without obvious and immediate exterior repair needs. Another 15% of the housing stock is over 25 years of age, however, a time at which substantial repairs may become necessary to maintain the soundness and functional adequacy of a residence. Although the City could not find obvious exterior deficiencies in the conditions of these dwelling units, it is likely that many of these older residences have interior repair needs or functionally obsolete plumbing, electrical systems and/or insulation and weatherization. Without proper maintenance and upgrading, these older dwelling units could become functionally obsolete.
Many of the dwelling units in need of rehabilitation and many of the older homes in Ceres are occupied by low-income households, who typically do not have the financial means to properly maintain their dwelling units. Low-income households do not typically have the financial resources to undertake major home improvements, and they are often unable to qualify for or afford home improvement loans. Without some type of financial assistance to reduce the cost of maintaining their homes, low- income households face the prospect of either allowing continued deterioration of their homes or of having to sell their homes.

Housing Prices
The median home price in Ceres has steadily increased over the last 10 years. In 1980 the average cost of a new singel-family dwelling units in Stanislaus County was $66,110. In 1984, the average cost of a new home had increased to $78,149. By 1991, the average cost of a new home ranged from $87,500 for a two- bedroom unit to $167,500 for a four-bedroom unit (Modesto Board of Realtors). The table below shows reported home costs through June of 1991 in the City of Ceres.
TABLE 21
PRICE OF A NEW HOME - CITY OF CERES - 1991

4 Bedroom	$167,500	$213,400	38
Source: Modesto Board of Realtors, 1991.
The cost of a new single-family home, nearly doubled in the City of Ceres between 1980 and 1990, from $66,110 to $119,000. The impact of this continual increase in home costs, however, has not had a significant effect on the tenure of housing in the City as homeownership actually increased dining the last ten years as a percentage of total homes. This paradox is explained by the large number of Bay area workers with higher incomes who immigrated to Ceres and other Stanislaus County communities during the last decade.
As homeownership for low-income households becomes less of a possibility, they will increase the demand for rental housing units.
Rental rates in the City varied from $675 a month for 3-bedroom apartment units to $800 a month for a 3-bedroom homes. Home rental rates also varied from $385 a month for a 2-bedroom unit to $800 and up for a 4-bedroom unit.
SPECIAL POPULATION GROUPS
Handicapped
The 1990 census indicated that approximately 2.6 percent of the population age 16-64 and 18.6 percent of the population age 65 and over has a mobility impairment that would limit or prohibit their use of public transit. A total of 3.2 percent of the labor force has such mobility impairments. The number of persons with physical disabilities that prevent them from using public transit provide a useful measure of the number of persons with mobility impairments that would also require special housing design.
There several special considerations in addressing the housing needs of mobility-impaired persons:
•	The majority of such persons are older adults (over the age of 65),
•	As heads of households, they tend have lower-income than the general population, and
•	Their ability to function independently requires design modifications to a typical dwelling units.
34
City of Ceres Housing Element
Specific design considerations for accessible housing include entrances that are wheelchair accessible, wider door jambs and hallways, adequate turning space in all rooms for wheelchairs, special plumbing fixtures and appliances, cabinets that do not require a high reach, and elevated electrical outlets.
To address the housing needs of mobility-impaired individuals, the City would need to adopt programs that increase the availability of handicapped accessible housing affordable to lower-income households. A portion of these affordable and accessible units would also need to address the specific lifestyle, social, and physical needs of handicapped households.
One method of increasing the number of handicap accessible housing units is through the use of federal financing -Section 811: Housing for Persons with Disabilities. Direct low-interest loans finance the construction or rehabilitation or rental or cooperative detached, semi-detached, row, walk-up or elevator type structures. Beneficiaries of housing developed under this program are persons with disabilities.
Another federal program, Section 106(b), provides financial assistance through its nonprofit sponsor assistance program. HUD assists and encourages nonprofit private sponsors/borrowers interested in developing sound housing for the elderly or handicapped, by offering them zero percent interest seed money loans. The loans cover 80 percent of the pre-construction expenses. The remaining 20 percent must be contributed by the borrower before federal funds are disbursed. Current HUD regulations limit these loans to nonprofit sponsors of Section 202 housing for the elderly or handicapped. The maximum loan amount for each project is $50,000.
Elderly
In 1980, about 10% of the population, or 1,291 individuals, in the City of Ceres were elderly. By 1990, the total population 65 years and over increased to 2,239, although the percentage declined to nine percent. Households with older individuals have several types of special needs: they may require financial and/or technical assistance in maintaining or repairing their homes, they may need a change in living arrangement more suited to their physical condition, or they may need financial assistance in meeting monthly housing costs. The 1980 Census also indicated that 89 households were low-income, and these households pose affordability problems to the existing housing stock. The 1990 Census reported 1,059 owner-occupant householders 65 years of age or more (75%), and 346 elderly renter households (25%). This is a typical ratio of homeowners-to-renters among households 65 years of age or more.
Elderly residents have many different housing needs, depending on their age, level of income, current tenure status, cultural background, and health status. The public policy response to elderly housing needs would focus on those subgroups of the elderly population whose housing and related lifestyle service needs are not or cannot be met within the present housing market. Some of the potential elderly housing needs that may require a specific governmental response include:
•	Low-income elderly renters requiring affordable rental units.
•	Low-income elderly homeowners requiring assistance in maintaining their homes in sound condition or rehabilitating their homes to eliminate threats to health and safety.
•	Elderly residents in need of housing with congregate care facilities.
•	Housing with medical/health services.
•	Elderly residents needing assistance in relocating to a dwelling that better suits their space and income needs.
Mobility-impaired elderly residents requiring special accessibility features in their dwelling units.
35
City of Ceres Housing Element
There are several programs the City can pursue in order to insure increasing or improving the existing elderly and low-income elderly housing units.
Shared housing. A shared housing program assists special needs groups (i.e. elderly persons) to find others with whom they can share existing housing units. The results are fuller utilization of existing housing stock, reduction in the demand for new housing units, reduction in housing costs, and increased security and companionship. Local social service organizations can assist seniors in finding a shared housing match through their contacts with senior groups, local landlords, vacancy listings, and other social service agencies.
Second units - "granny flats". A second unit is an attached or detached residential unit on the same parcel (or parcels) as the primary units, which provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. Second units can be created by converting existing floor space within a structure or by addition of an accessory structure. A second unit can provide additional income to homeowners, and provide rental housing at lower costs (savings in land costs).
One method of financing elderly housing has been the State's Senior Citizens Shared Housing Program. This HCD program provides grants to assist senior citizens obtain affordable housing. Unfortunately, based on the condition of the State's budget, this program will most likely be discontinued.
In July, 1996, HCD verified that this program is no longer in existence.
Another financial mechanism is through the use of aforementioned federal financing - Section 202: Housing for the elderly or handicapped. This program provides for rental or co-operative housing and related facilities for the elderly and handicapped. Direct low-interest loans finance the construction or rehabilitation or rental or cooperative detached, semi-detached, row, walk-up or elevator type structures. Beneficiaries of housing developed under this program must be elderly (62 years or older), physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, or chronically mentally ill.
Large Households and Overcrowding
Large Households
Although overcrowding is not confined to large families, the incidence of overcrowding is encountered most frequently among large families, families of five or more persons. Low-income large families, in particular, have difficulty in locating affordable three and four bedroom dwelling units which meet their space needs. The 1990 Census counted 1,410 large households in Ceres (approximately 16.4% of all households in the City), 1,398 of which were large families.
The issue of large family housing needs appears to be one of affordability rather than availability. Insufficient information exists to directly compare large family incomes with the cost of larger dwelling units. However, the incidence of overcrowding, primarily among households of five or more persons, suggests that a substantial number of large families cannot find suitable housing that is also affordable.
The policy response to meet this need would be to encourage the production and preservation of three-, four-, and five-bedroom dwellings that are affordable to low- and moderate-income large families in particular. There is no shortage of three- or more- bedroom dwelling units, but most of these dwelling units are single family homes which are not affordable to low-income large families. The City would need to develop policies that encourage the production of affordable rental housing with three or more bedrooms.
Although most large households are owner-occupied, there are substantially more large renter households experiencing problems in finding affordable housing with the appropriate number of bedrooms. This makes sense intuitively because large homeowner households are generally able to purchase homes of sufficient size or they would not be owners. The tables below shows the number of persons per housing unit and housing unit tenure in the City of Ceres in 1990.

Overcrowding
Overcrowded households are defined by the state as households that average more than one person per room. There were 299 overcrowded households in 1980 in the City of Ceres. By 1990, this number had increased to 920 overcrowded housing units. Of these units, 605 were renter-occupied and the remaining 315 were owner-occupied. Interestingly, this tenure percentage is almost reversed from that of large households, as there are almost twice as many renter-occupied as owner-occupied overcrowded units.
The large increase in overcrowding is testimony to the problems that lower-income larger households have in finding affordable housing. Since 1980, there have been few homeownership opportunities for low-income families, and even fewer three-bedroom rental units that are affordable to low-income families. The table below shows the distribution of overcrowded units by tenure.

Farmworkers
According to the 1985 Ceres Housing Element, there were 88 farmworker households in 1985, and this number would decrease to 82 households in 1989. These projections were based on the State Employment Development Department data which showed decreasing agricultural employment in Stanislaus County. In the 1990 Employment Development Department projections, the total agricultural employment in the County will remain constant through 1991.
Existing farmworker housing in the City of Ceres are provided by the Stanislaus County Housing Authority. In 1990, the Housing Authority administered 103 total units in the City, all of which are year-round housing units. The Stanislaus Area Association of Governments projects that there will remain a need for farmworker housing because of two factors:
•	The demand for housing has always exceeded the supply.
•	Housing units have been demolished without being replaced.
The SAAG, aware that agriculture employment may be decreasing, includes its farmworker total construction needs as a percentage of the basic construction needs for very low-income residents in the City. The total farmworker construction needs, therefore, for the City during the time period 1990-1997 is 74 units. These are year-round units for permanent residents of the community who happen to be employed in agriculture. Because of the declining importance of seasonal agriculture in Ceres, there is no additional need for migrant farmworker housing within the City.
The EDD June 1991 Annual Planning Information for the Modesto MSA reiterates the decreasing agricultural demand throughout the Modesto (Ceres) area.
38
City of Ceres Housing Element

The Modesto Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) will continue to experience economic expansion during the 1989-1996 period. An estimated 21,800 additional wage and salary jobs are anticipated to be added by 1996 as employment gains in the nonagricultural sector substantially exceed projected losses in agriculture.
. 1
Agriculture employment is expected to decline by approximately 1,100 jobs during the projection period [1991-1996] as more land becomes urbanized to support residential, commercial, and industrial growth. This trend is expected to be compounded by the unpredictable future of California's water supply. Stanislaus County growers are likely to encounter increasing competition for this most sought after resource, as the State continues to wrestle with such issues as: drought, growth, and environmental concerns.
If the City or Housing Authority does however seek to increase the number of farmworker housing, there are financial programs specifically directed toward this cause. FmHA Section 514/516, for example, is one such mechanism of improving and constructing farm labor housing. This program is a combination of loans and grants that are available to help finance the construction, rehabilitation or purchase rental housing for farmworkers. The loans and grants may be used to finance infrastructure such as water supply systems and wastewater facilities as well as to develop support facilities such as central cooking and dining facilities, laundry facilities, and day care centers.
Families with Female Head
Analyzing the population for families headed by females is important because many of these households are on fixed incomes and often encounter problems in obtaining affordable housing. Female-headed families also increase the demand on day care centers, public transportation, and affordable housing. Single mothers have lower levels of income for a variety of reasons: the lower earning potential of many women relative to men; the loss of financial support from fathers; the young age at which many unmarried women become mothers, often resulting in dependency on public assistance; and the lack of adequate child care that would allow single mothers to seek a better education or career training, and therefore increase their earning potential. These are but a few of the contributing factors to the special needs of female-headed families. In addition, single mothers often face discrimination in rental housing even though state law prohibits rental property owners from discriminating against families with children.
Because of these problems, single mothers need rental family housing affordable to low- and very-low income households in a non- discriminatory environment in which access to child care services is either provided on-site or nearby.
In 1980, there were a total of 416 households in the City of Ceres that were headed by a female with no husband. Of these female-headed households, 278 were families with children (single mothers) and earned a median family income of less than $8,300. By 1990, this total had increased to 1,005. Of these female-headed households, 725 were families with related children.
The increase in single mothers households is testimony to the social changes that Ceres has experienced during the 1980s, changes that affected communities throughout the nation. The increase is also a function of the doubling of the City's population during the last decade. One could expect an increase of most types of households with such a large increase in the total population.
Meeting the demands of female-headed households produces a theme that is repeated throughout the analysis of special needs population - the need for affordable housing. There are many financial programs available at both the local level (density bonuses, inclusionary zoning, trust funds, use of manufactured housing, mortgage credits and bonds, and Housing Development Corporation housing), state level (Rental Housing Construction Program, California Housing Finance Agency funds, and Rental Housing Mortgage Loan Program), and federal level (Community Development Block Grant Program, HUD funds, and Section 8 housing assistance).

Homeless
In 1985, the Stanislaus County Department of Social Services estimated that there were approximately 350 homeless persons in Stanislaus County. It is difficult to estimate what percentage of this estimate are actually in the City of Ceres because the nearest homeless shelters are in the City of Modesto.
Efforts to find shelters for the homeless, although mainly originating from the City of Modesto, have taken on a county-wide approach. The City of Ceres has not played a major role in the county-wide homeless problem because Ceres is a suburban, low density city with very little of the aggregation and commercial districts that provide and attract homeless persons.
In the City of Modesto there are several facilities that provide shelter for the homeless. The Community Temporary Shelter Service Coalition operates under the Salvation Army and provides temporary shelter and meals for single parents with children (mainly female householders with children) and mentally ill persons. The programs provides three to seven days of shelter and may also supplement this with cooperation of the County of Social Services. The County, under it AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) Homeless Assistance Program (HAP), provides up to an additional 28 days of shelter.
In fiscal year 1990-1991 the County assisted 6,314 persons, 5,226 of which were assisted with permanent shelter. The majority of these persons, 80% of the total, that were assisted with permanent shelter were single or disabled parents with children (average persons per household - 2.8). The remaining 20% were unemployed parents with children (average persons per household - 4.7).
Other services in the City of Modesto are provided by the Mens Gospel Mission and the Women's Gospel Mission.
The Mens Mission provides shelter to 80 single male adults a year, with a total shelter time of 7 bed nights and 2 meals a day for a week. In 1990, there were 93,700 meals provided. This is up from 63,000 meals in 1989 and 32,000 meals in 1984. The Women's Mission, which is seeking to expand, provides 15 beds for single women for up to 14 days. Both of these programs also require participation in Christian programs.
A final source of shelter in the City of Modesto is the Sunshine Place, which provides shelter for up to 100 people a day and meals are provided at the Salvation Army.
Together, these shelters are to provide beds and meals for a homeless population that the Census (1990) estimated at totaling only 238. The homeless population estimate for the City of Ceres was only 4 persons (1990 Census). Both of these estimates, based on the figures reported from shelters in Modesto, may be a little conservative in estimating homeless persons in the region. In terms of the City of Ceres, however, the homeless has not historically been a major problem in the City and based on the visual and Census reports, may not become a problem in the near future.
Factors contributing to the increase in homeless persons and families, and those in need of transitional housing include:
•	The lack of housing affordable to very-low and low-income persons
•	Increases in unemployment or underemployment
•	Reductions in government subsidies
•	Deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill
•	Domestic violence
•	Drug and alcohol addiction
•	Dysfunctional families

The needs of the homeless depend on the economic or personal reasons for their homelessness. Because of the characteristics of these groups vary, their needs will also vary. Some individuals or families are temporarily without shelter because of a job loss, the demolition or conversion of their dwelling unit, or because of some other economic circumstance. In such cases, the solution is to provide temporary economic assistance (first and last month's rent, temporary rental assistance, security deposit, relocation assistance, etc.). Their long-term need is for affordable housing, but the lack of housing is symptomatic of their economic circumstance. Employment counseling may be helpful in conjunction with housing assistance.
Another group of homeless persons could be called the "working poor". These are individuals or families with at least one part- time or full-time worker who do not earn a sufficient income to afford suitable housing. Such persons or families do not have physical problems that prevent them from working, but are simply unable to locate housing within their economic means. This group requires some type of subsidized housing or on-going monthly rental housing assistance, possibly in conjunction with educational and/or work training that would allow them to improve their economic circumstances. A sub-group in this category are individuals and families, such as migrant farmworkers, that need affordable housing on a seasonable basis but are unable to locate such housing within their economic means.
Other homeless individuals lead unstable lives because of substance abuse, and are unable to maintain a permanent shelter or job. The homeless problems of such persons cannot be resolved until their substance abuse problems are resolved. These individuals need a program which can provide temporary or transitional housing while they are undergoing medical treatment for their substance abuse. "Half-way houses" or group homes are frequently established to meet the needs of such individuals. Once the substance abuse problem is resolved, these individuals may need temporary financial assistance in establishing a permanent residence and employment.
Another category of homeless persons are women (often with children) escaping domestic violence. Such women need temporary shelter until they can arrange for a separate residence. Because such women often have no other place to stay and no job, they often need temporary financial assistance. For these individuals, homelessness is a symptom but not a cause of their personal and economic problems. Personal counseling and job training may also be necessary to resolve their long-term personal and economic problems.
Other homeless persons have mental illnesses that either require institutional or out-patient treatment. These individuals are mentally incapable of maintaining an independent household and employment, either because they are not receiving proper medical treatment or because the nature of their condition is so severe that no level of treatment would be adequate to allow for an independent lifestyle. Many of the mentally ill are homeless because of efforts to allow these individuals to exercise their rights to refuse medical treatment or because medical treatment is unavailable. As with other homeless groups, their homelessness is a by-product, not the cause of their housing problems. Those who can function independently with out-patient medical treatment can be assisted initially in establishing a household and employment so that they will be productive members of society. This scenario assumes, of course, that persons with less severe mental illnesses can receive the appropriate medical treatment on an out-patient basis and will actually follow through with such treatment. Those individuals with more severe mental illnesses must either be placed in a setting that will guarantee 24-hour supervision and medical care or in a group home setting that will ensure partial-supervision and medical attention.
The final group of homeless individuals are the "drifters". These are primarily single adult males with no substantial physical or mental illnesses that would prevent them for working and establishing a permanent household. For whatever reason, individuals in this group have made a conscious decision to travel from place to place, seeking part-time and seasonal work, but never establishing a permanent household. They often shun governmental programs and public attempts at assistance, and would prefer to live in temporary shelters of their own making rather than in homeless shelters. Unless governmental agencies are willing to force such persons into homeless shelters, the best that public officials can do to meet the housing needs of these persons is to offer seasonal shelter dining periods of severe weather conditions and places where such persons can shower or bathe.

Residents Occupying Apartments Subsidized By Federal Government Which May Convert To Market Rate
Status.
Of growing concern over the past five years has been the number of government subsidized rental housing developments that were constructed during the past ten to twenty years and in which the owner has the option of pre-paying the government loan and dropping out of the program. Pre-payment of governmental assistance end any rental restrictions. Low-income households could face rent increases if the owner attempts to charge market rents for projects in which rent restrictions have been removed. Statewide, thousands of low-income households face the prospect rent increases each year as a consequence of prepayment options on government assisted loans.
In the City of Ceres, there are three subsidized rental housing developments: Willow Apartments (100 units), Almond Terrace (46 units), and Ceres Christian Terrace (67 units). According to the "Inventory of Federally Subsidized Low-Income Rental Units at- Risk of Conversion" (1991 Update), prepared by the California Coalition for Rural Housing, none of these three development are eligible to convert to market-rate housing within the next ten years. The owner of the Willow Apartments would ordinarily be eligible to pre-pay its loan after 20 years (1993), but the loan is a flexible subsidy-type loan, which requires that the affordability of the dwelling units be maintained for the full 40 years of the loan. This information was confirmed by contacting HUD. Because none of these developments are eligible to convert, no analysis of preservation costs, replacements costs, resources available for preservation or replacement, or entities interested in acquiring and preserving these units as low-income housing is necessary.

IV. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
i
i


The local housing needs determinations established by the Stanislaus Area Association of Governments (SAAG) set forth housing goals for cities and counties in the SAAG region. The housing tables were prepared from a combination of sources including SAAG's Stanislaus County Projections, Population, Housing and Employment. November, 1989, and the Department of Finance's, Stanislaus County Population and Housing Estimates, January 1, 1990 Report E-5.
The 1990-1997 housing determinations are based on the following data. Table A is SAAG's estimated cumulative annual household growth for the City of Ceres from 1990 through 1997.
TABLE 25
ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD GROWTH RATE FOR CERES 1990-1997

The following table combines several of the housing needs tables in the SAAG regional housing allocation plan to show the components of the housing allocation for the City of Ceres between 1990 and 1997. The total housing construction need estimated by SAAG for the City of Ceres is 3,619 dwelling units between 1990 and 1997, or approximately 517 dwelling units per year. Over the past 4 1/2 years, the City has approved an average of 545 dwelling units per year. The peak of the City's building activity occurred between 1987 and 1989, during which an average of 670 dwelling units were approved per year. The real estate recession, which began in mid-1990, forced many home builders to scale back their building plans, reducing the number of dwelling units approved by permit to about 521 in 1990 and 1991, approximately 39 percent of the annual average of the prior three years. Between 1992-95, an annual average of 169 dwelling units was approved (676 total), representing only 25% of the 1987-89 boom.

V. CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING DELIVERY
j	GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
■	|	This section of the affordable housing study evaluates actual and potential City government constraints upon the
development of housing for all income levels. Government constraints may include land use controls; codes and enforcement; on or off-site improvements; fees, exactions and processing; and permit procedures.
■	j
Government actions affecting the housing market are, in large part, a reflection of the values of the residents of Ceres. If there is a community sentiment and a community will to address housing problems, this will typically evidence itself in on local government policies. Elected officials who make decisions affecting housing development do not act in a policy vacuum, but must represent the views of their constituents. It is important to remember, therefore, in evaluating what the City of Ceres can do to affect the production of housing, that elected officials have limits on how far they can "lead" a community in a certain policy direction, especially if that policy direction is at odds with residents' strongly held perceptions about residential growth and development.
Land Use Controls
Much of the development in Ceres has been under the zoning regulations allowed under sixteen different zoning districts. The Ceres PC [Planned Community] zone, which is far more flexible than other zoning regulations, can allow up to as many as 25 units per acre, depending on the General Plan designation of a given property. The number could increase with state law that allows for another 25% increase per acre if the dwelling units are built for low- and moderate-income households.
Fourteen of the zoning districts are shown below:
R-A Residential Agriculture Zone
R-l Single-Family Residential Zone
R-2 Two Family Residential Zone (Low Density)
R-3 Medium Density Multiple family Residential Zone
R-4 Medium-High Density Multiple family Residential Zone
C-l Neighborhood Commercial Zone
C-2 Community Commercial Zone
C-3 Wholesale Commercial Zone
H-l Highway Commercial Zone
A-P Administrative Professional Zone
C-F Community Facilities Zone
P-C Planned Community Zone
M-l Light Industrial Zone
M-2 General Industrial Zone
The six residential zones (R-A, R-l, R-2, R-3, R-4, P-C) are discussed in more detail in Appendix HE-3.
In conjunction with density bonuses, the City believes there is sufficient flexibility to permit a variety of housing on infill sites within the City. The zoning standards bear little relevance to the City's ability to meet its housing needs, however. Most of the residential development to be approved between 1992 and 1997 will occur under planned development agreements or specific plans with their own development standards. Policies are included in this Housing Element which will require that specific plans and planned developments contain sufficient land at higher residential densities to meet the City's housing needs. These policies will be incorporated into the City's Land Use and Community Design element.
45
City of Ceres Housing Element
a.	Density. Increasing the density of housing units within the City has been offered as one solution to reduce housing costs. The City has offered a number of options to developers, including density bonus programs, cluster development, the zero lot line approach, and multi-family incentives. The demand in the construction industry is, however, relatively low for projects in excess of 15 or 25 units per acre.
b.	Adequate Supply of Residential Land. The City has an adequate supply of residential land (see table 1) including a total of over 277 acres that translate into a potential of up to 6,023 units. There is also potential for an additional 244 to 363 units outside the City limits. Most of this land is not pre- zoned but does have a General Plan designation (land outside City Limits).
c.	Building Codes and Enforcement. The Uniform Building Code is the standard of construction used by the City of Ceres, which must, by state law, use the UBC as its building standards code, and the City does not require additional building standards to the UBC code. This does not create a specific constraint on the construction of housing units for one income level, as the City is using the same regulations and guidelines that are used throughout the state.
The City does not have an active building code enforcement program, but will inspect dwelling units for compliance with uniform codes on a complaint basis. The City is not overly restrictive, but seeks to work with property owners to bring their dwelling units up to an acceptable standard of habitability. Condemnation and/or demolition of affordable housing units would be a last resort action, to be pursued only after all other reasonable alternatives have failed.
Since this Housing Element was adopted, the City has taken a more active role in terms of code enforcement. The City has hired a part-time Code Enforcement Officer, and in 1996 has adopted a property maintenance and public nuisance ordinance which provides for the abatement of a wide variety ofpublic nuisances.
d.	Processing Time. Processing time is an important factor for all housing unit construction, but specifically for projects being developed under volatile financial conditions. The City has become accustomed to processing a large volume of projects throughout the year, however, the average processing time per project can increase significantly depending on the complexity of the project in question.
The following are average processing times for various types of land use approvals:
•	Subdivision Maps - 8 weeks
•	Zone Change - 20 weeks
•	Conditional Use Permit - 8 weeks
•	Architectural Site Plan Review - 6 weeks
•	Planned Community Master Plan - 20 weeks
•	Planned Community Development Plan - 8 weeks
•	General Plan Amendment (No EIR) - 20 weeks
•	General Plan Amendment (With EIR) - 56 weeks
These typical processing times are substantially shorter than state-mandated timeframes for development review. The City believes these are reasonable timeframes that do not pose a constraint to meeting the City's housing needs. To reduce the overall development review time for complicated proposals and proposals requiring multiple approvals, the City encourages pre- application conferences with the City and conducts concurrent reviews of multiple-approval projects.
Site Improvements Requirements
Site Improvement Requirements as found in the City of Ceres Subdivision Ordinance, Title 17, Chapter 17.26, are located in Appendix HE-1 of this document.
46
City of Ceres Housing Element
' 1
Improvements made in the City must conform to the specifications and standards adopted by the City Council. Off-site requirements are discussed in the next section on fees and exactions. Specifications for lot line adjustments as found in Chapter 17.36 of the Title 17, Subdivisions Code, are identified in Appendix D.
. i
Fees, Exactions and Processing
' 1
The City of Ceres Public Facilities Fees identifies the fee basis and structure as applied to new construction.
A public facilities’ fee will be charged and paid at the time of issuance of a building permit for development. If a Mello-Roos District, assessment district, or other arrangement of such a nature has been made, only the portion of the fee applicable to the project may be adjusted by staff. The fee will determined by the fee schedule in effect on the date the permit is issued.
The amount of the public facility fee will be adjusted from time to time. The availability of other funds, such as Mello-Roos and direct developer payments to construct projects included in the City of Ceres Public Facility Plan may also affect the amount of fees to be paid.
Exemptions: The public facilities' fees shall not be imposed on any of the following:
• Any alteration or addition to a residential structure, except to the extent that additional dwelling units are created.
•	Any alteration or addition to a specific nonresidential structure if the square footage of the structure is increased less than ten percent, unless the alteration or addition changes the use of the structure to a higher density category or will result in the generation of additional peak hour trip ends.
•	Any replacement or reconstruction of any residential, commercial or industrial development project that is damage or destroyed as a result of a natural disaster as declared by the Governor.
•	Any replacement of existing structures, in kind, if the applicant can prove that the structure or facility legally existed before the ordinance was effective.
•	Any replacement, in kind, or structures damaged by fire, flooding, earthquake, etc.
The fee schedule for the City and County can be found in Appendix HE-2.
The fees described in Appendix HE-2 to pay for off-site improvements do not present an impediment to the production of housing, per se, but definitely impact the cost of housing. These fees can easily add $10,000 or more to the cost of a single family dwelling unit and $7,000 or more to the cost of a multifamily dwelling unit. These fees represent 10% or more of the cost of a dwelling units (see also page 51). While the public facilities for which these fees are charged are necessary to support new development, there are methods available to mitigate the impact of these fees on housing for low- and moderate-income households (see the housing program section of this document).

NONGOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
This section of the affordable housing study addresses nongovernment constraints that can effect the trends of housing sales and constructions, for example, financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
Availability of Financing
An important consideration in the assessment of the housing need in the City of Ceres is the availability of financing. There are several concerns regarding the availability of financing: the ability of home builders to obtain construction financing, the ability of rental investors to obtain financing for the purchase of apartments, the ability’ of households to obtain single family home loans, and the opportunity for all households of similar economic characteristics to have equal access to financing. Since the collapse of many lending institutions, the federal government has imposed greater restrictions on lending practices. In addition, many lenders have adopted more conservative underwriting standards over the past several years. As a result, the ability of home builders to obtain construction financing, particularly rental apartment developers, has declined dramatically. The lack of construction financing has forced smaller home builders out of business and caused larger homebuilders to seek out foreign sources of capital. If lending practices are not loosened, however, the ability of homebuilders to respond to an improving economy in 1992 will be severely hampered.
At the same time that construction financing has become scarce, money for single family home loans, in particular refinances, has become plentiful. Home loan interest rates have declined from nearly 11% at the end of the 1980s to about 8% in early 1996 for a thirty-year, fully amortized, fixed-rate loan. These home loan rates were at their lowest level since the late 1970s.
Even though money for home loans was plentiful, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported in late 1991 that home loans were not available on an equal basis to all applicants. Although lesser of a problem in California, the Bank Board concluded that there is a tendency for minority loan applicants, particularly black loan applicants, at all income levels to be rejected for home loans at a significantly higher rate than white loan applicants. While low-income households have difficulty in qualifying for home loans because of their financial conditions and credit history, minority low-income loan applicants, in particular, face problems in obtaining home loans.
The table below illustrates the effect of various interest rates on different loan values and the corresponding monthly payment required by the borrower.

Using the monthly payments required for each loan in the table above, the affordability of each loan can be determined for different income levels. The table below combines the income limits as stated by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, 1991, and the respective affordability possible by household size. Household affordability, as mentioned below, is based on 30% of monthly household income.

Constraints to Water Supply and Disposal
There is the potential that water will become a major constraint in future housing in the City. As mentioned previously in the document, the City has recently increased the wastewater potential of the sewage system and a major expansion of the existing system is currently being discussed. One of the major concerns that may slow this process is not if an expansion of the sewage system is physically possible but instead how such an expansion will be financed.
Currently the City has a development on the West side (off Morgan Road) that includes approximately 700 residential units and some retail that will push the existing wastewater treatment system to maximum capacity. As of 1996, the consultant for the treatment expansion has completed 95% of the design documents. Both design and construction are on hold until issues regarding disposal options are resolved. This would place January 199S as an optimistic time line for breaking ground, with build- out any time from 5 to 6 years afterward.
49
City of Ceres Housing Element
The capacity of the wastewater treatment plant can thus have a significant impact on the number of housing units built during the time of this Element. And the biggest question to be answered in the treatment expansion process is how the project will be financed. One estimate (City of Ceres Public Works) placed a $6-9 million price on the plant expansion with no easy methods of financing it.
The water supply is less constrained as a 1.5 million gallon reservoir was completed in 1991 and many wells drilled during the last year are currently coming on line. The City is involved in a project that would convert the City's water source from wells to surface water by 1998. The City is seeking to take water from the Tuolumne River, with the possibility of two reservoirs (1.5 million gallons) to be built in the future to insure surface water pressure. Regardless of the time line for conversion though, the water supply is not a constraint to future housing development, except that new wells may be required to serve new development.
Price of Land
With the average new home prices (3 bedroom units) in the City of Ceres selling for just over $100,000 and increasing, the price of land has become a very important consideration. Like many urbanizing rural communities, the value of land prices has been steadily increasing throughout the City. The Building Industry Association of Central California (BIACC) estimates that land costs for a standard 6,000 square foot construction ready lot in 1992 is $35,000. This includes the cost of land acquisition and average land improvements. The availability of financing for sewage treatment may significantly influence the price of land and ultimately the cost of a new home as the number of sites decrease.
Cost of Construction
With increasing land prices and uncertainty over the long term capacity of the wastewater treatment system, the cost of construction is one of the variables in the development process that may have to come down. The City's location along Highway 99, its proximity to both the Sacramento and Bay Area housing markets, and the continued growth in the San Joaquin Valley have all combined to increase the number of developers in the valley. This, in turn, increases the demand for workers and supplies, both of which should have the final effect of reducing the construction cost as a total percentage of the finished home.
The BIACC estimates that 1992 construction costs represent 41% of the total home costs - 38% in Mello-Roos districts. The construction costs for an average 1,500 square foot home are approximately $34/square foot. This translates into a total cost of $51,000 for the construction component of the total unit cost. The BIACC estimates the following unit costs for a 1,500 square foot single-family unit in a non Mello-Roos district:
so

• 1
•	House Building Costs (41 % of total) $51,000
•	Improved Lot Costs (28% of total): $35,000

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Over the past twenty years, the City of Ceres has changed from a small, suburban agricultural community with a predominantly older, affordable housing stock, to a rapidly growing community with increasingly more expensive housing. With this tremendous growth, however, has come substantial changes in the population characteristics of the City. The environment in the City has been especially attractive to residents seeldng single family homes, and home builders have focused on this segment of the market because of the high demand for single family housing.
Based on the population and housing information presented above, the following conclusions have been reached regarding affordable housing needs in Ceres:
•	Employment growth in the region will require the construction of additional housing affordable to low-income households in the region (low-income by Stanislaus County standards);
•	Most of the remaining vacant land is in large tracts, providing an opportunity for the City to negotiate with home builders for the creation of affordable housing;
•	According to the Stanislaus Area Association of Governments, the City of Ceres should plan for nearly 1,500 additional low- and very low-income households between 1991 and 1997.
•	Land and site development costs in the City may deter some home builders interested in creating affordable housing. Development fees are needed to pay for infrastructure required to serve new development.
•	The number of special needs groups has grown along with the general population; the number of single mothers, overcrowded households, and large families have increased. Much of the increase in populations with special needs can be attributed to population growth in the City. But the increasing cost of housing relative to local income levels undoubtedly compounds housing affordability problems for low- income households.
•	Although the 1990 Census did not count any homeless persons in the City at the time of the Census, there is a regional need for homeless shelters, which Ceres acknowledges.
•	Although only a small percentage of the City's housing stock is presently deteriorated, there is still a need for rehabilitating and preserving older structures, especially those occupied by low-income households, to maintain the city's stock of affordable housing. There will likely be a growing need for City attention to housing preservation as homes constructed during the late 1960s and through mid-1970s reach an age at which substantial repair become necessary.
•	The 1990 Census counted a moderate vacancy rate in the City overall, but the overall rate does not reflect the availability of affordable housing for low-income households.
The City's minimum estimated new housing need between 1990 and 1997 is 3,619 dwelling units, of which approximately 17 percent (615 dwelling units) should be affordable to very low-income households and 24 percent (869) should be affordable to low-income households. Therefore the City should focus on strategies that can increase the supply of rental housing and provide some ownership opportunities in mobilehome, condominium- or townhouse- type development. It is economically unrealistic to expect that a significant number of single family dwelling units can be constructed that are affordable to low-income households without deep government subsidies. The most difficult needs to address will be those households earning less 50 percent of median income, very low-income households. While it is likely that market rate rental housing can be constructed in Ceres that is affordable to some low-income households, it is unlikely that rental housing affordable to very low-income households can be constructed without substantial initial and ongoing subsidies.
52
City of Ceres Housing Element
Decreases in home prices and interest rates since the original adoption of this Housing Element have permitted more low- and moderate-income households to purchase homes, as mortgage payments are becoming more competitive with rental costs. It is therefore projected that more of the affordable housing needs will be accomplished through the construction of single family homes, perhaps coupled with first-time homebuyer programs and/or smaller lot standards. Some single family housing types and programs may even provide ownership opportunities for very-low income households. Prior to this trend in lowered housing prices and interest rates, it was assumed that affordable housing for low- and very-low income households would be provided predominantly through multiple-family rental projects.
Based on these findings, the City has the following affordable housing options are described to assist the City in addressing its affordable housing needs.

City of Ceres Housing Element
POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The housing strategy presented below is divided into a series of goals, policies, and programs. Each program includes an implementation timeframe, sources of funding (if applicable) to implement the program, responsible agencies for program implementation, and expected quantified results. The majority of these policies are directly or indirectly related to meeting the needs of low and moderate-income households. Other policies and programs address the potential relationship between affordable housing policies, programs for lower-income households, and the City's overall housing strategy which must address the housing needs of all segments of the City.
Policies and programs are numbered sequentially under each goal. Seven broad goals have been developed to define the proposed housing strategy:
•	To designate sufficient land at appropriate densities and establish development permit procedures to accommodate the City's regional share of housing for all income groups,
•	To address special housing needs as defined by state law and local needs,
•	To meet a reasonable share of the City's low- and moderate-income housing needs,
•	To preserve the existing housing stock and conserve existing affordable housing opportunities,
•	To assure that all present and future residents have equal access to housing, commensurate with their financial capacity, without discrimination,
•	To promote the preservation of historic residential buildings, and
•	To promote energy conservation in the construction of new housing and within the existing housing stock.
The success of the programs described below is based on certain assumption regarding the roles and responsibilities of various entities. The assumed roles and responsibilities are as follows:
City of Ceres. The City's primary role will be as a facilitator of private action. As such, neither the City nor the Ceres Redevelopment Agency will be directly responsible for constructing housing. The City's role will be to establish a favorable regulatory environment, to provide assistance to developers in using available housing financing and subsidy programs, and to provide incentives to developers to encourage the production of affordable housing.
Ceres Redevelopment Agency. The role of the Ceres Redevelopment Agency would be to provide financing for various low- and moderate-income housing programs, not necessarily as the sole source, but as one of several sources of funding.
Stanislaus County Housing Authority. The role of the Housing Authority would be to continue to seek additional Section 8 and other funding commitments for low-income housing that could be used in Ceres.
Private, For-Profit Developers. The City will expect private developers to be receptive to proposing a mixture of housing types in large development projects and to using state and federal programs for affordable housing in exchange for regulatory and financial concessions on the part of the City.
Non-Profit Housing Developers. The City will expect non-profit housing developers to take the lead in proposing affordable housing developments and applying for state and federal funding.
54
City of Ceres Housing Element
Realtors. The City will expect the local real estate industry to assist the City in promoting affordable housing programs, in particular mortgage revenue bond and mortgage credit certificate programs, and seek interested income-eligible homebuyers.
Lenders. The City will expect local lenders to participate in financing affordable housing developments as part of their Community Reinvestment Act responsibility.
State of California. The State of California has adopted numerous laws establishing local responsibilities for housing its citizens. Local governments are highly dependent on the State to provide the necessary financial resources and fiscal capacity to implement these housing mandates. The City's success in implementing programs (described below) which involve state funding, redevelopment agency funding, or general fund support for program administration will depend heavily on the State budget and fiscal policy, and how these affect the availability of state funding for housing programs, local financial resources, and the revenue generating capacity of local governments.
GOAL A
TO DESIGN A TE SUFFICIENT LAND A T APPROPRIA TE DENSITIES AND ESTABLISH DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCEDURES TO ACCOMMODATE THE CITY'S REGIONAL SHARE OF HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME GROUPS.
POLICY 1: The City will maintain an adequate supply of residential land in appropriate land use designations and zoning categories to accommodate projected household growth and to meet its regional share of housing
POLICY 2: The City will establish flexible land use regulations through a planned development process for large tracts of land that allows for a range of housing types and densities within a single development.
POLICY 3: The City will encourage the use of specific plans and development agreements on large tracts of land to improve the site planning/development process and increase the predictability of the development process.
POLICY 4: The City will expeditiously process residential development proposals that conform to General Plan policies and City regulatory requirements.
POLICY 5: The City will allow the installation of mobilehomes and factory- built housing on permanent foundations in accordance with residential design standards administered by the City. These standards will not distinguish between site-built and factory-built homes.
POLICY 6: The City will plan for a full range of housing types in relation to employment centers in Ceres, transportation, and commercial services.
POLICY 7: Higher density housing should be located in areas served by the full range of urban services and near existing or potential public transit routes and employment centers.
POLICY 8: New residential projects should be designed to facilitate non-automobile modes of travel as described in the Transportation and Circulation Element.
POLICY 9: The City will prepare a capital improvement plan for necessary public facilities and services for new residential projects. The plan will provide for a schedule for completion of capital facilities, depending on when they will be needed in conjunction with development.
POLICY 10: The City will promote infill residential development within the Redevelopment Area and other older parts of the City where adequate public facilities and services are already in place in small projects that can be integrated with existing neighborhoods.
55
City of Ceres Housing Element
POLICY 11: The City will encourage a mix of housing types throughout the city in order to increase residential choices. Not every neighborhood will include every type of housing, however. The specific mix of housing for any particular neighborhood should depend on existing land uses within and surrounding the neighborhood, the environmental characteristics of undeveloped land within the neighborhood, the capacity of public services and facilities within the neighborhood, and other factors.
GOALB
TO ADDRESS SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS AS DEFINED BYSTA TE LA WAND LOCAL NEEDS.
POLICY 1: The City will implement state law which allows for the establishment of group homes in any residential zone.
POLICY 2: The City will ensure that its land use regulations do not present barriers to the location of child care facilities within new residential developments or within reasonable proximity to where such facilities are needed.
POLICY 3: The City will encourage the development of rental units for large families in roughly the same proportion as the percentage of large family renter households within the total renter population.
POLICY 4: The City will ensure that its land use regulations do not present barriers to the development of housing oriented to the needs of elderly residents, including housing that includes food and health care services, congregate housing, and other forms of housing for older adults.
POLICY 5: The City will designate zoning categories that are appropriate for the location of facilities serving homeless individuals and families.
POLICY 6: The City will ensure that its land use regulations and affordable housing policies do not discriminate against year-round housing for large families, particularly farmworker families.
POLICY 7: The City will implement state and federal requirements for handicapped access in new residential developments. Any housing developments in which the City acts as a developer, provides financing, or assists a developer in applying for state or federal funds must address the needs of mobility impaired individuals.
POLICY 8: The City will pursue land use policies that allow small residential developments and individual housing units meeting special needs to be integrated into existing neighborhoods and new residential developments. Examples include second dwelling units, duplexes on comer lots, and scattered-site housing developments on in-fill lots.
POLICY 9: The City will work with surrounding jurisdictions to address the needs of the transient homeless persons on a regional basis.
GOALC
TO MEET A REASONABLE SHARE OF THE CITY'S LOW- AND MODERA TE-INCOME HOUSING NEEDS.
POLICY 1: While promoting the provision of housing for all economic segments of the community, the City will seek to ensure design quality in all new residential development.
POLICY 2: The City will pursue state and federal funding assistance that is appropriate to Ceres's needs to develop housing that is affordable to low- and-moderate-income households.
56
City of Ceres Housing Element
1
POLICY 3: The City will use available local financing techniques, such as mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage credit certificates, other mortgage backed securities, or other feasible financial assistance techniques to assist home builders in developing affordable housing.
. i
POLICY 4: Where government-assisted residential units which are required to sell or rent at below-market-rates are included within a housing development, such units shall be interspersed within the development and shall be outwardly indistinguishable from market-rate units.
POLICY 5: In accordance with provisions of state law, the City will grant density bonuses of at least twenty-five (25) percent over the maximum density allowed by the General Plan, and at least one other specified incentive, for qualifying projects to promote the inclusion of low- and moderate-income and senior citizen housing.
POLICY 6: If below-market-rate units are included within a rental project pursuant to the density bonus program or other local, state, or federal requirements, the City will require buyer/renter eligibility screening and resale/rent controls to maintain affordability of the units to originally-targeted income groups. Where allowed by law, preference will be given to existing Ceres residents.
POLICY 7: The City will continue to work with the Stanislaus County Housing Authority in the administration of affordable housing programs.
POLICY 8: The City will provide for the development of secondary residential units, as required by state law, while protecting the single-family character of neighborhoods.
POLICY 9: The City will actively explore the feasibility of assisting the Housing Authority or qualified non-profit housing developers in using surplus government lands within the City for the development of affordable housing.
POLICY 10: The City work with private and/or non-profit housing developers to develop one or more ownership housing projects for lower-income households.
POLICY 11: The City will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, whether fee waivers, reductions, or deferrals are appropriate in exchange for the provision of affordable housing. The City will prepare guidelines which specify the conditions under which fee waivers, reductions, or deferrals are appropriate.
GOALD
TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND CONSERVE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES.
POLICY 1: The City will encourage private reinvestment in older residential neighborhoods and private rehabilitation of housing.
POLICY 2: The City will pursue state and federal funding assistance that is appropriate to Ceres's needs to rehabilitate housing. The City will also contribute redevelopment tax increment funds to support the rehabilitation of the existing housing stock.
POLICY 3: The City will work with interested individuals and non-profit housing corporations to acquire rental housing in need of rehabilitation and to maintain the affordability of the units to low-income households, should such action be the only feasible method of preserving an affordable rental housing development. In no case will the City use its police powers to condemn private property in order to force a sale to a non-profit housing corporation.
57
City of Ceres Housing Element
POLICY 4: The City will identify non-profit housing corporations with an interest in acquiring government-assisted, privately owned rental housing at risk of converting to market-rate housing. The City will assist such entities in applying for state and federal funding to preserve the affordability of "at-risk" rental housing and consider the use of redevelopment tax increment funds if state and federal funding is insufficient.
POLICY 5: The City will continue to make code-enforcement inspections upon a complaint basis to assure that rental housing is maintained in habitable condition according to County Health Department standards.
POLICY 6: The City will work with the Stanislaus County Housing Authority to preserve Section 8 and other rent public and private subsidy units in the City.
POLICY 7: The City will establish regulations which govern the conversion of apartments to condominiums when vacancy rates are below 5 percent for more than one year. This will require a revision of the City's Subdivision Ordinance.
POLICY 8: The City will provide assistance to mobilehome park owners and residents in applying for state or federal assistance to rehabilitate a mobilehome park or convert the park to resident ownership. The City will also consider providing low-interest loans from redevelopment tax increment funding for such assistance.
GOALE
TO ASSURE THAT ALL PRESENT AND FUTURE RESIDENTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO HOUSING, COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR FINANCIAL CAPACITY, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION.
POLICY 1: The City will provide public information on the state and federal fair housing laws.
POLICY 2: The City will refer discrimination complaints to the State Fair Employment and Housing Commission. A person will be designated at the City as the information contact for housing discrimination referrals.
POLICY 3: The City will cooperate with community-based organizations which provide services or information to victims of housing discrimination.
POLICY 4: The City will seek joint sponsorship with local homebuilders, real estate agents, and lenders of a periodic fair- housing public information campaign.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
Unless otherwise stated, the Ceres Community Development Department will be the lead coordinating agency responsible for all programs that address development review and approval, applications for state or federal funding in which the City is the applicant, and the administration of programs which involve financial participation by the Ceres Redevelopment Agency. The Ceres Planning Commission will be responsible for reviewing all development applications and providing recommendations to the City Council. The City Council is responsible for local approval of development applications. For the sake of brevity, these responsibilities are not reiterated for each individual program. For programs in which funding sources are listed, these are possible funding sources only. Not all funding sources listed in association with each program will necessarily be used. The City will have to assess, on case-by-case basis, the appropriateness of the funding sources and their availability.
PROGRAM 1: Designate for Sufficient Land. The City will designate sufficient land at various densities to allow for the construction of sufficient housing to meet its SAAG regional housing allocation between 1992 and 1997. The City will review, as needed, the amount of land designated for various residential uses in conjunction with the amount and types of housing produced in the previous year to determine if any changes in the General
58
City of Ceres Housing Element
Plan may be needed to meet City housing needs. A review of the supply of vacant land and development patterns over the preceding year will be incorporated into each annual evaluation of the City's implementation of its Housing Element programs. Since much of the land needed to meet the City's housing needs between 1992 and 1997 is outside the present City limits, the City will have to annex this land before it can be developed.
The Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission is concerned about the premature conversion of agricultural and open space lands. As a result, LAFCO is reluctant to approve annexations that do not have shortterm prospects for development. This means that the inventory of land zoned for residential development expands in response to market conditions rather than some static predetermined -inventory. The city also prefers this process since the area-wide planning required in conjunction with annexation (Ceres Annexation Policy Res. 95-112) insures that needed public facilities and services are planned and will be available at the time of development.
While it is true that at any given time the residentially zoned land within the City may not have the capacity to accommodate all of its Regional Housing Needs for new construction, the land within the City’s Sphere of Influence that is designated for residential development by the General Plan and approved for residential development through annexation, represents a more than adequate supply. It should be noted that the City of Ceres has, during the past five years, never turned down a residential development. Thus, the City believes that it has fully accommodated the market demand for housing. In fact, the large undeveloped inventory of single-family lots has caused the developers of previously approved projects to ask the City Council to phase in future residential development to insure a better balance between supply and demand.
It is impossible for the City meet the literal interpretation of state law [Section 65583(c)(1) of the California Government Code], which requires local governments to provide sufficient sites with zoning that permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential use by right. This particular wording of state law does not recognize the common circumstance in which a nearly built-out, but growing, community will meet its regional housing needs through the annexation of land that is not, at present, zoned. The City will ensure that land to be annexed includes sufficient medium and high density residential designations to meet Ceres' regional share of housing for all income groups.
Timeframe: Begin annexation proceedings during 1992 and ongoing thereafter.
Responsible Entities: Land owners and developers to initiate annexations with City concurrence; Community Development Department to process annexation requests, subject to Planning Commission review and City Council approval, Local Agency Formation Commission to approve annexation.
Funding Sources: Cost of annexation proceedings to be paid by applicants.
Objective: General objective is to cooperate with land owners to assure that sufficient land is annexed to the City to meet Ceres SAAG regional housing allocation of 3,619 dwelling units between January 1, 1990 and July 1, 1997. Between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1991, the City approved 519 dwelling units be permit, leaving 3,100 dwelling units as its remaining regional housing share between January 1, 1992 and July 1,1997.
Two applications adding 41.22 acres of single family residential land were approved in 1993. No residential annexations were approved in 1994 or 1995. The Brown annexation, approved in 1996, includes 150 acres of land with the potential to add 580 single family residential units and 100 multiple family residential units. The mixture of residential densities was the result of discussions between staff and the developer to specifically meet this program of the Housing Element.
Resolution 95-112, adopted by the City Council on August 28, 1995, formalized the City's annexation policy. This policy requires that all annexation applications (with some limited exceptions) shall be accompanied by an area-wide plan. In the case of area-wide plans for residential developments, the plan is specifically required to incorporate opportunities for a range of housing types and densities consistent with the latest Housing Element of the General Plan.
59
City of Ceres Housing Element
PROGRAM 2: Specific Plans and Planned Developments. The City will require that large tracts of vacant land to develop under a comprehensive site plan, either through a specific plan process or a planned development process, that provides for a mixture of housing types and a range of housing densities. The purpose of this requirement will be to ensure that each undeveloped area within the City's and the Sphere of Influence contains a percentage of land at various densities that correspond to the proportion of the City's regional housing needs for each income group.
To correlate land use categories with income groups, the following assumption is made: that very low- and lower-income housing needs can be met with land designated for high density residential use, that moderate-income housing needs can be met with land zoned for low and medium density residential use, and that above moderate-income housing needs can be met with land zoned for either low or medium density residential use. Under this assumption, the City should designate sufficient land for high density residential use to accommodate approximately 40% of its new construction housing need (very low- and low-income), designate sufficient land for medium density residential use to accommodate approximately 20% of its new construction housing need, and designate the remaining land for either low or medium density residential use to meet the City's above moderate-income housing need.
Timeframe: Ongoing as large developments proposals are submitted to City.
Responsible Entities: Developers, to propose projects with a mixture of housing types, and City, to approve large-scale development proposals with a mixture of housing types.
Funding Sources: Costs of application processing to be paid from application fees.
Objective: Ensure that development proposals contain a sufficient diversity of land use types to meet the City's SAAG regional housing share for all income groups (See Program 1).
In 1993, the City approved the Westpointe Master Plan, Development Agreement, and Assessment Bond for the development of approximately 160 acres. The plan contains provisions for 15.5 acres for a multiple-family residential senior complex, and a first-time homebuyer program for the single family portion of the project, which occupies a total of 87 acres. In 1994, the first two residential Planned Developments within Westpointe were approved, which collectively contain 300 single family units, and are currently under construction. The 150 acre Brown annexation, discussed in Program 1 above, is being developed with a master plan, and provides a mixture of residential densities and housing types.
In September 1995, an update of the Mitchell Road Corridor Specific Plan was adopted. As part of that update, approximately 16.3 acres of land north of Don Pedro Road was redesignated from Quasi-Regional Commercial to RL-7 (Low Density Residential, max. 7 dwelling units per acre), and approximately 7.7 acres was redesignated from Quasi-Regional Commercial to RH-25 (High Density Residential, max. 25 dwelling units per acre). This change will provide additional land at varying densities in order to meet Ceres ’ regional housing share.
As stated in Program 1 above, Resolution 95-112 was adopted, which formalized the policy of requiring area-wide plans with annexation applications. Residential developments are required to incorporate opportunities for a range of housing types and densities consistent with the Housing Element.
PROGRAM 3: Density Bonus. The City will provide a minimum density bonus and other incentives to encourage new construction affordable to low-and very-low income persons. The 25% density bonus will be offered whenever a developer proposed to provide at least 10% of the dwelling units in a project at costs affordable to very low-income households or at least 20% of units at costs affordable to low-income households. In addition, the City will consider providing a density bonus of 25% if at least 50% of the dwelling units in project will be affordable to moderate-income households. To ensure that the moderate-income density bonus does not conflict with state law and detract from the use of the low-income density bonus program, moderate-income density bonuses will be offered only for those types of housing which would not typically be affordable to low-income households (condominiums, townhouses, single family attached housing, etc.), or in conjunction with development proposals which also incorporate low-income housing. 1
60
City of Ceres Housing Element
The City will publicize the availability of the density bonus program through the local building industry association, by contacting home builders active in Ceres, and by information available at the Community Development Department.
In addition to the density bonus, the City will offer at least one other regulatory or financial incentive for the production of very low- or low-income housing. Other incentives the City will consider on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with density bonuses include, but are not limited to: fee reductions or deferrals, expedited permit processing, contributions of redevelopment tax increment housing set-aside funds, applying for or providing technical assistance in applying for state or federal funds, the issuance of tax-exempt bonds or mortgage credit certificates, and the consideration of alternative development standards to reduce development costs. The City will determine, on a case-by-case basis, the appropriate incentive(s) to oflFer to make a proposed affordable housing development financially feasible.
For rental housing developments, the City will require, in exchange for the density bonus, that restrictions be imposed on the affordable units through a suitable legal instrument that ensures the affordability of those units for a minimum period of time and at a maximum cost as established by Section 65915 of California Government Code. As of January 1, 1992, this maximum cost is 30% of 60% of the median income for Stanislaus County.
For ownership projects, the City will require, in exchange for the density bonus, that purchasers meet established income guidelines and intend to occupy the affordable units as their primary residence. Purchasers will be required to reside in their units for a minimum period of time (as an anti-speculation mechanism) to avoid resale restrictions. If this minimum time period is not met, the City will reserve the right to recapture a portion of the profit on the sale of a dwelling unit.
The City will adopt an ordinance to implement the density bonus program. The ordinance will include income eligibility guidelines, provisions for applicant screening, a procedure for monitoring the continued affordability of affordable units, and a procedure for administering the requirements for ownership housing.
Timeframe: City to adopt implementing guidelines by January 1, 1993 and implement thereafter.
Responsible entities: Developers/rental property owners to cooperate with City in establishing and implementing income screening mechanism. Community Development Department to draft program guidelines, subject to approval of the Planning Commission and City Council. City may contract with Stanislaus County Housing Authority to implement program screening.
Funding Sources: City administrative costs to be paid from Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside funds.
Objective: 360 very low-income and 360 low-income dwelling units.
A density bonus ordinance was adopted by the City Council on March 22, 1993. Experience since then has shown that the density bonus incentive, on its own, has not been enough of a financial incentive to encourage developers to produce very-low and low-income dwelling units. Although interest by both for-profit and non-profit developers has been evident, there have been no projects taking advantage of the adopted density bonus program to date.
PROGRAM 4: Affordable Housing Requirements of Redevelopment Law. The City will adopt an ordinance implementing the affordable housing provisions of redevelopment law, which requires that 15% of any privately constructed or rehabilitated dwelling units within the Redevelopment Area, and 30% of any dwelling units constructed or rehabilitated by the Redevelopment Agency anywhere in the City, be affordable to very low- and low-income households.
Timeframe: City to adopt guidelines implementing state law by January 1, 1993, and implement thereafter.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department to implement guidelines in cooperation with developers.
61
City of Ceres Housing Element
Funding Sources: RDA Housing Set-Aside Funds, state funds, or federal funds (see Program 6) for projects involving lower-income housing.
Objective: None at this time for new construction, as there are no plans for the construction of housing by the RDA or within the Redevelopment Area. See Program 13 for rehabilitation objective.
The Ceres Redevelopment Agency adopted its Housing Production Plan implementing state law regarding affordable housing provisions of redevelopment law in December, 1994.
PROGRAM 5: Second Dwelling Units. The City will revise the Zoning Ordinance to allow secondary dwelling units by right in single-family residential zones subject to specific criteria concerning floor area, relationship to principal residence, required parking, and other features. These standards will be in compliance with state law regarding second units. The City will promote the ability to construct second dwelling units through its permit process.
Timeframe: Revise Zoning Ordinance by July 1, 1993, implement thereafter.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council.
Funding Sources: Application fees.
Objective: Depends on level of interest by single family homeowners. City projects that no more than 20 applications will be received between July 1993 and July 1997. Ten units are anticipated to be affordable to very low-income households and ten to low-income households.
One such unit has been approved using Government Code provisions. This program is pending completion of the General Plan update.
PROGRAM 6: Pursue State and Federal Funding. The City will pursue available and appropriate state and federal funding sources in cooperation with private developers, non-profit housing corporations, the Stanislaus County Housing Authority, and other interested entities to support efforts to meet the new construction needs of low- and moderate-income households and to assist persons with rent payments required for existing units. Whether the City applies for funding individually, as part of a consortium of public agencies, or through a formal Joint Powers Agreement with other public agencies will depend on the type of program and the benefits to City of joint versus singular application.
Following are currently-funded (1991) state and federal programs the City specifically intends to pursue:
Section 202- Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped. This federal program provides low interest loans to finance the construction or rehabilitation of rental housing.
Rental Housing Construction Program (RHCP). This program, funding for which has been re-established under Proposition 84 (1988), provides for the development of rental units by private, non-profit, or public agencies subject to the reservation 30 percent of the units for very-low and low-income households (two- thirds of which must be very-low). Funds can be used for long- term financing or a combination of long-term and construction loan financing.
If other programs become available, the City will evaluate the eligibility and feasibility of City use of funds from those programs.
Family Housing Demonstration Program. This is a state demonstration program that provides funding for the construction or rehabilitation of low-income rental housing projects that also provide support services and job training programs. The City would pursue an application under this program only if a non- profit housing corporation is interested in sponsoring such a project and can identify an eligible target population for the project.
62
City of Ceres Housing Element
1	Predevelopment Loan Program. This program provides low-interest loans to governmental and non-profit housing
agencies for land, engineering, architectural design, application and development fee, and other costs prior to the development of a low-income housing project.
i
HOME/HOPE Programs. These are new programs from the federal government expected to begin in 1992. These i	programs will provide funding for low-income housing construction, rehabilitation, and home ownership for
low-income households and may eventually replace some current federal programs. The City will explore the feasibility of establishing a county-wide consortium in conjunction with other Stanislaus County jurisdictions to
become an entitlement entity under the HOME Program.
i	Community Reinvestment Act Programs (CRAY Sponsored by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the
Federal Reserve Bank Board, participating lending institutions provide funds at below-market interest rates for
’	affordable housing developments.
State Farmworker Housing Program. This program provides grants to non-profit housing developers to construct permanent family housing for year round very-low income residents who are employed in agriculture.
There are a number of other state and federal programs that provide grants, loans, or mortgage insurance for affordable housing development and in which eligible applicants are for-profit or non-profit home builders. The City would lend its support to such applications through favorable land use policies should eligible and financially feasible projects be submitted to the City.
Timeframe: City to assess annually feasibility of applying for funding under various programs and to work with other responsible entities to submit funding applications each year for programs considered feasible.
Responsible Entities: Private developers, non-profit housing corporations. City of Ceres (Community Development Department to be lead agency), and Housing Authority.
Funding Sources: RDA Housing Set-Aside Funds, state housing funds, federal housing funds, private capital from lending institutions, and contributions from interested developer-applicants.
Objective: See Program 3, as many of the above programs will work in conjunction with density bonus program. In addition to Program 3 objective, 100 moderate-income units from projects funded by private lending institutions under CRA.
The City has provided preliminary support of two low-income housing tax credit applications submitted by private developers to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. Unfortunately, both applications were not funded. One of those developers is currently seeking Federal tax credits. The City has also had some initial discussions with a non-profit developer desiring to build affordable rental units for seniors under the Section 202 program. A potential site has been located, and application awards will be made in late 1996.
PROGRAM 7: Use of Tax Increment Funds for Affordable Housing. The Redevelopment Agency may use tax increment revenues to subsidize on- and off-site infrastructure improvements that will directly benefit a lower-income housing development or to provide lower-income financing for lower-income housing projects. Tax increment funding will be one of several financial incentives the Redevelopment Agency will offer to developers to make the provision of low-income housing financially feasible. The Redevelopment Agency will develop guidelines for the use of tax increment funds for the development of affordable housing.
Timeframe: Guidelines to be adopted by July 1, 1993 and implemented thereafter to direct use of RDA Housing Set-Aside funds.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency. Funding Source: RDA Housing Set-Aside funds. Objective: See Programs 2,6,8,13, and 14.
63
City of Ceres Housing Element
The Ceres Redevelopment Agency adopted a low- to moderate-income housing production plan in December, 1994. To date, the Ceres Redevelopment Agency has used $200,000 of its housing set-aside fund to operate the Home Exterior Grant Program, which over a 2-year period assisted 32 very-low to moderate-income households in improving the exterior appearance of their homes. In addition, the CRA leveraged $64,000 towards the 1992 CDBG housing rehabilitation program, which assisted 20 very-low and low-income households. The CRA has also pledged another $44,000 towards a 1996 CDBG application, to be utilized for the rehabilitation of targeted income households if funding is awarded.
PROGRAM 8: Mortgage Revenue Bonds. The City will apply for an allocation from the state to issue mortgage revenue bonds or other mortgage backed securities, to assist in the development of affordable ownership and rental housing. The City will apply for at least one allocation. The financial feasibility of issuing bonds will depend on the ability of the Redevelopment Agency to raise the required 1/2% deposit (either from tax increment funds or developer contributions, or both), the size of the bond issue relative to the costs of issuing the bond, and the interest rate at which the bonds can be sold. The use of tax-exempt bond financing can be one of the financial incentives to implement Program 1, but additional units are expected to be produced, as well.
Mortgage Revenue Bonds can also be used through various California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) in which the City or Redevelopment Agency supports a developer's application for multi-family or single-family housing for low- and moderate-income households. MRBs allow the Redevelopment Agency to offer the low-interest mortgage loans to those experiencing difficulty in obtaining financing.
MRBs for single family housing are issued to finance the purchase or rehabilitation of owner-occupied homes. Proceeds from the bonds sales are used to make mortgage or rehabilitation loans to qualified low- or moderate-income home buyers. The bonds are serviced and repaid from the mortgage payments made by the property owners.
MRBs for multi-family housing are used to finance construction and mortgage loans as well as capital improvements for multi-family housing. Federal law requires that 20 percent of the total units in an assisted project be reserved for lower-income households. State legislation approved in 1985 requires that one half of the reserved units be set aside for very low-income households (50 percent of median income or below).
Timeframe: Apply for allocation in 1993, if financially feasible. Depending on success of first allocation, apply for second allocation in 1995 or 1996.
Responsible Entities: Redevelopment Agency (Community Development Department), private developers, or non-profit housing corporations.
Funding Sources: Contribution from participating developers or RDA Housing Set-Aside funds for required 1/2% deposit.

City of Ceres Housing Element
PROGRAM 9: Manufactured Housing on Single Family Lots and in Mobilehome Parks. The City will implement the requirements of state law regarding manufactured housing on foundations on single family lots and mobilehome parks in single family neighborhoods. The City will permit manufactured housing on the same basis as site-built housing. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended.
Timeframe: Amend Zoning Code by July 1, 1993.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, and City Council.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: The City expects a maximum of 10 applications for mobilehomes on single family lots between July 1, 1992 and July 1, 1997. Five homes are expected to be affordable to low-income households and five to moderate-income households.
The Zoning Ordinance was amended in 1981 to permit mobile homes on permanent foundations which utilize exterior materials customary to conventionally constructed single-family detached dwellings in the vicinity. However, mobile home parks in residential districts were not accomodated. Although the Zoning Ordinance process has not begun, the City would consider such an application based on the provisions of the Government Code.
Program 10: Preservation of Mobilehome Parks. The City will identify those mobilehome parks in properly zoned locations in which the park infrastructure and the majority of the units can be preserved. If requested for parks in need of preservation, the City will assist park owners in applying for state assistance to rehabilitate park infrastructure, assist the residents in applying for state aid to purchase the park, and/or provide tax increment funding to rehabilitate the park infrastructure and units that are feasible to repair.
Timeframe: Identify mobilehome parks which should be preserved by December 1992. Provide technical assistance, if requested, thereafter.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Mobilehome Park Owners, Mobilehome Park residents.
Funding Sources: RDA Housing Set-Aside Funds, state and federal housing program funds.
Objective: Preservation of existing mobilehome parks. (There are 860 mobilehomes in the City of Ceres.)
A survey of all mobile home parks in Ceres was conducted in late summer, 1992. The City deferred fees for the Westward Ho on-site sewer connection project. An agreement exists for further Ceres Redevelopment Agency assistance, if desired.
PROGRAM 11: Weatherization and Energy Conservation for Existing Dwelling Units. The City will post and distribute information on currently available weatherization and energy conservation programs in conjunction with housing rehabilitation.
Timeframe: 1993 and ongoing.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Pacific Gas and Electric, Central Valley Opportunity Center, Stanislaus County Department of Social Services.
Funding Sources: RDA Housing Set-Aside Funds, Pacific Gas & Electric, Special Circumstances Grants, and state Office of Economic Opportunities.
65
City of Ceres Housing Element
Objective: Weatherize 50 dwelling units per year, 200 dwelling units total between 1992 and 1997.
T
Although a weatherization program sponsored by the Central Valley Opportunity Center was offered in
conjunction with the CDBG housing rehabilitation program, none of the applicants were eligible due to the
restrictive income guidelines.
PROGRAM 12: Energy Conservation for New Construction. The City will enforce state requirements,
including Title 24 requirements, for energy conservation in new residential projects and will encourage residential
developers to employ additional energy conservation measures with respect to the siding of buildings, landscaping,
and solar access. Any landscaping and development design guidelines prepared by the City will include
consideration of energy and resource conservation.
Timeframe: Current and ongoing.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Increased energy conservation for all new dwelling units.
The Building Department continues to enforce Title 24 requirements for energy conservation, as required by State
law. The Planning Department and Public Works Department now enforce Water Efficent Landscape Guidelines
and Standards, published in 1993, which requires water conservation features in the landscapes of new residential
projects.
PROGRAM 13: Housing Rehabilitation Programs. The City will continue to apply to the State for hinds for
housing rehabilitation. Three programs for which the City would be eligible are:
State Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). The state-administered non-entitlement CDBG
program provides funding for three eligible activity areas: housing, public facilities, and economic development.
Activities must address one of the following three objectives: serve lower-income people, eliminate slums or
blight, or resolve urgent community development needs. State regulations require that at least 70 percent of the
funds be used to benefit lower- income households and that no activity exclude low-income households. (CDBG
funds can also be used to support public facilities and community services programs for low-income households)
Rental Rehabilitation Program. This program provides partial funding for low-income housing rehabilitation.
California Housing Rehabilitation Program. The owner-occupant component of this program provides funding to
local governments for rehabilitation loans to low-income homeowners. The rental component of this program
provides funding directly to eligible rental property owners.
Timeframe: The City would annually evaluate the feasibility of applying for funds from these programs.
Responsible Entity: Community Development Department
Funding Sources: See above.
Objective: Rehabilitate 30 dwelling units per year, 150 dwelling units between 1992 and 1997.
In January, 1993, the City of Ceres was awarded $500,000 in State Community Development Block Grant funds to
rehabilitate homes in an identified target area to qualifying very-low and low income households. This grant,
which expired on September 30, 1995, assisted in the rehabilitation of 10 owner-occupied and 10 rental units.
Loan payments from this program are placed into a revolving loan fund to be utilized for continuing rehabilitation
activities. In 1995, the revolving loan fund was used to reroof the homes of 3 very-low income senior citizens, and
66
City of Ceres Housing Element
pay for the preparation of the City’s 1995 CDBG housing rehabilitation application. Although CDBG applications were submitted in 1995 and 1996, neither were funded due to the competitive nature of the program.
The Ceres Redevelopment Agency funded the Home Exterior Grant Program, a housing rehabilitation program designed to assist very-low to moderate income households, which is described in Program 7.
PROGRAM 14: Mortgage Credit Certificates. The City will cooperate with the Modesto Board of Realtors, and the Stanislaus County Housing Authority in implementing a county-wide mortgage credit certificate (MCC) program to assist first-time home buyers.
Timeframe: See Program 8.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, interested developers, interested real estate agents. Funding Source: See Program 8.
Objective: Assistance to 75 moderate-income households.
In January, 1994, the City Council approved a cooperative agreement between the City of Ceres and Housing Authority to allow the Housing Authority to implement a Mortgage Credit Certificate Program within Ceres. After all of the allocated funding had been expended, a total of 25 MCC’s had been issued to first-time homebuyers in Ceres. In 1995, the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee substantially reduced the allocation for local MCC programs, and none was subsequently made available to Stanislaus County.
PROGRAM 15: Community Reinvestment Act The City will contact financial institutions serving Ceres to solicit interest in providing financing to for low- and moderate-income housing as part of their responsibility under the federal Community Reinvestment Act. The City will seek specific lending commitments to be used in conjunction with Redevelopment Agency funds and state and federal funds.
The City will seek participation by lenders using three financing mechanisms: The Saving Association Mortgage Company (SAMCO), the Affordable Housing Program (12th District Federal Home Loan Bank), and the California Community Reinvestment Corporation. SAMCO is a non-profit financing corporation established by participating savings institutions to provide financing for affordable housing developments. CCRC is the commercial banking equivalent. The Affordable Housing Program offers financing through participating 12th District savings institutions for community development activities benefitting low- and moderate- income households.
The City will contact financial institutions with which it regularly conducts business to solicit their participation in one of these three or other CRA-related activities benefitting Ceres.
Timeframe: See Program 6.
Responsible Entities: Ongoing-in conjunction with development proposals for specific plans or large-scale housing developments. (See also Program 6.)
Funding Source: See Program 6.
Objective: Included in Program 6.
Staff has had several discussions with a local lender who is in the process of developing a housing rehabilitation program similar to the City’s previous CDBG program, as part of their Community Reinvestment Act responsibilities.
PROGRAM 16: Relocation of Low-Income Households Occupying Dilapidated Housing. The City will establish policies and procedures for evaluating applications for demolition of more than one residential structure. This evaluation shall consider the implications of the demolition with respect to the retention of affordable
67

* I
housing. If demolitions are deemed to result in a reduction of the amount of affordable housing in Ceres, the City
shall require the proponent of the demolition to provide relocation assistance to displaced low-income residents.
1
Within one year following the adoption of the Housing Element, the City will develop replacement housing
guidelines to address the removal of low-income housing by private owners. Among the options the City will
consider are the payment of relocation benefits to displaced households, rehabilitation of existing dwelling units to
be occupied by low-income households, and the construction of replacement housing.
The City will require owners of units which are vacated for violation of housing and building codes to pay all or a
portion of the costs necessary to relocate displaced residents.
The demolition of dwelling units occupied by low-income households in the Redevelopment Area as part of a
redevelopment project must comply with the requirements of state redevelopment law for replacement housing.
Timeframe: City to adopt procedures by July 1, 1993.
Responsible Entities: Redevelopment Agency (Community Development Department) and applicant for
demolition.
Funding Sources: RDA Housing Set-Aside funds, contribution by applicant for demolition.
Objective: Defray relocation expenses of all low-income households displaced by housing demolition. At present, the City has identified only one dwelling unit in need of replacement (excluding mobilehomes constructed prior to 1974 HUD standards).
The Housing Production Plan adopted by the Ceres Redevelopment Agency in December, 1994, calls for the provision of relocation assistance where Agency activities result in displacement.
PROGRAM 17: Annual Housing Element Monitoring Report. The Community Development Department will annually evaluate and report to the City Council on the City's progress in meeting its Housing Element objectives. The report to the City Council will include recommendations regarding for changes in Housing Element programs. The report will also include the following information, only to the extent applicable and in as much detail as appears warranted each year:
•	Progress made toward achieving the City's fair-share housing allocation as determined by SAAG.
•	An inventory of housing conditions, including the identification of areas to be targeted for rehabilitation efforts.
A summary of efforts taken to improve the condition of the City's housing stock (e.g., CDBG-supported rehabilitation loans).
An inventory of sites suitable for the development of low-income housing projects.
A summary of efforts undertaken to relocate residents displaced by redevelopment and to replace affordable units lost as a result of redevelopment.
Up-to-date information on the homeless population of Ceres and a summary of services available locally to address the needs of the homeless, based on information provided by homeless shelter and service providers.
An analysis of measures that the City might pursue to assist in the development of affordable housing (e.g. reduction of parking and landscaping requirements for seniors projects, reduction of residential street development standards, and reduction of open space and park dedication requirements).
68
City of Ceres Housing Element
• An examination of development in multifamily-designated land versus General Plan densities to determine if minimum desirable densities are being achieved to meet City housing needs.
The City Council will decide, based on this annual evaluation of the its progress, whether or not to adjust its program actions or to adopt new program actions.
Timeframe: Submit report to City Council by January 31 of each year.
Responsible Entity: Community Development Department.
Funding Source: RDA Housing Set-Aside funds.
Objective: Not applicable.
Since the adoption of this Housing Element, both the Ceres City Council and State Department of Housing and Community Development have been provided with an annual report in compliance with this program.
PROGRAM 18: Section 8 Program. The City will continue to cooperate with the Stanislaus County Housing Authority in its administration of the Section 8 rental assistance program and to increase the availability of Section 8 vouchers and certificates in Ceres. The City's role will be to provide necessary documentation to the Housing Authority to apply for additional Section 8 commitments.
Timeframe: Current and ongoing.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Housing Authority.
Funding Source: Federal Section 8 program.
Objective: Increase available Section 8 certificates/vouchers for 25 very low-income households.
Although Section 8 certificates are utilized within Ceres, limitations in the method employed by the Housing Authority to track Section 8 certificate holders may prevent the quantitative evaluation of this program. Potential cutbacks in the Section 8 program would make it difficult to achieve the goal of increasing the availability of vouchers and certificates in Ceres.
PROGRAM 19: Zoning for Homeless Facilities. The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to designate specific zones in which homeless facilities are appropriate.
Timeframe: Amend Zoning Code by July 1, 1993.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
At the time the need for such a facility is demonstrated, this program will be implemented.
PROGRAM 20: Use of Redevelopment Funds for Homeless/Transitional Housing. The City will consider the use of redevelopment tax increment funds to construct or expand a homeless or transitional housing facility should the City determine that such a facility is necessary to meet its the needs homeless Ceres residents.
Timeframe: Ongoing-depends on requests for funding.
Responsible Entity: Redevelopment Agency.
69
City of Ceres Housing Element
Funding Source: RDA Housing Set-Aside funds.
Objective: Not applicable.
At the time the need for such a facility is demonstrated, this program will be implemented.
PROGRAM 21: Development of Plan for the Use of Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Funds. The
Redevelopment Agency will establish and annually update a set of policies and procedures to guide the implementation of the low- and moderate-income housing requirements for redevelopment tax increment revenues. This should include establishing a discrete Housing Fund and outlining priorities for the expenditure of Housing Fund monies. Potential activities which can legally be supported by the Housing Fund include the following:
•	Acquisition of land for the development of affordable housing.
•	Acquisition of existing housing for retention as affordable units.
•	Provision of short- and long-term development financing assistance to developers of low- and moderate-income units.
•	Provision of grants or low-interest loans for housing rehabilitation.
•	Provision of grants or low-interest loans for low- or moderate-income homebuyers.
•	Advancement of funds to developers of affordable units who are eligible for other federal or state funding assistance which is not immediately available; repayment of advanced funds can be conditioned on receipt by the developer of other assistance funds.
•	Provision of rental subsidies to low- and moderate-income individuals.
•	Planning, designing, and construction of low- and moderate-income housing.
•	Payment of predevelopment costs for developers of affordable housing.
•	Payment of administrative expenses for nonprofit housing development corporations.
•	Construction of on- and off-site improvements necessary to support the private development of low- and moderate-income housing.
Timeframe: Adopt policies and first plan for use of funds by July 1, 1993, amend and implement annually thereafter.
Responsible Entity: Redevelopment Agency (Community Development Department to provide staffing).
Funding Source: RDA Housing Set-Aside funds, plus state, federal, and private funding sources to leverage use of RDA funds to implement plan.
Objective: See Programs 2, 6, 8, and 13.
The Ceres Redevelopment Agency adopted the low- to moderate-income housing production plan in December, 1994. This plan includes such priorities as 1) A first-time homebuyer program, 2) Acquisition , construction, or rehabilitation of housing for low and moderate-income families, seniors, and handicapped individuals, 3) Making capital improvements to support the creation of new affordable housing, and 4) Upgrading or establishing housing-related recreational facilities.

PROGRAM 22: Fair Housing Program. The City will continue to promote equal housing opportunity for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, nation origin, or color by supporting efforts of community groups which provide counseling, investigatory, legal, or referral to victims of discrimination. Specifically, the City will:
•	Maintain information on state and federal fair housing laws at the Community Development Department for public distribution,
»
•	Designate an individual at the City to refer victims of housing discrimination to the appropriate local organization or to the State Fair Employment and Housing Commission,
•	Seek the cooperation of the local homebuilders association, Realtor association, and lenders in disseminating fair housing information, and
Timeframe: Establish information procedures and contact person by January 1, 1993, implement thereafter. Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, real estate agents, home builders, local lenders. Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
?ls part of the 1992 CDBG application, the City Council adopted Resolution 92-48, -which established a Fair Housing Plan for the City of Ceres. The Housing Program Coordinator is the contact person to refer victims of housing discrimination to the appropriate agency.
PROGRAM 23: Housing for Elderly Residents. The City will prepare guidelines for the location and development of housing projects specifically designed for older residents with special housing needs. Included in this category would be various types of apartment projects with recreational and food service facilities designed especially for senior citizens and congregate care facilities.
Timeframe: Develop guidelines by July 1, 1993. Implement thereafter.
Responsible Entity: Community Development Department.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
No specific guidelines have been established as of yet. The Westpointe project, however, contains 15.5 acres specifically set aside for a senior housing project through the development agreement.
PROGRAM 24: Design of Affordable Housing. The City will require that affordable housing projects be designed so that there is no discernable exterior difference between such projects and market- rate housing projects. The City will also require that developers of affordable rental housing projects provide information showing how such project will be managed to maintain units in sound condition.
Timeframe: Current and ongoing.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council, and developers.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
71
City of Ceres Housing Element
The Density Bonus ordinance adopted by the City Council on March 8, 1993 contains language requiring that affordable units have the external appearance of the entire housing development. This program will be reviewed on a project-by-project basis.
PROGRAM 25: Handicapped Accessibility. The City will implement state standards for accessibility in new housing by handicapped individuals. The City will encourage developers of affordable housing to incorporate mobility-impaired accessibility in their project design, and require such design considerations in any development projects in which the City provides funding, financial or regulatory incentives, or acts as on behalf of the developer as an applicant for state or federal funding.
72
City of Ceres Housing Element

Timeframe: Implementation of state and federal access requirements is current and ongoing. Implementation of any additional local requirements for projects in which the City is a participant will commence upon adoption of the Housing Element.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, developers.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: To assure that accessible units are available fdr the estimated 3 to 4 percent of the City's population with mobility impairments.
The Building Department has, and continues to implement handicapped accessibility standards for new housing, despite some opposition from the building industry in enforcing these requirements. No affordable housing projects have been submitted to date, but this program will be considered as part of the project review should an application be submitted.
PROGRAM 26: Streamlining Permit Process. The City undertake a thorough review of its development review and permit processes to determine if there are time-saving changes that can be made to the process without sacrificing the quality of the review.
Timeframe: Complete review and adopt changes, if any, by July 1, 1993.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Department, City Council.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
Fees for various permits have been completely reviewed and adjusted as necessary. Permit processing was also considered at the same time, and streamlining took place where appropriate. The City utilizes a free predevelopment application process which can significantly lessen the actual permit processing timeframe.
PROGRAM 27: Self-Help Housing Program. The City will allocate redevelopment housing set-aside funds to provide for a local funding match for a Self-Help Housing demonstration project. Such a project would have to be initiated by a non-profit housing sponsor and use state or federal funds as the primary governmental financing source.
Since sufficient funding from the Redevelopment Agency may not be immediately available, the City would assist an interested non-profit housing sponsor in applying for state or federal funding and provide assistance in identifying appropriate sites for such a demonstration project.
Timeframe: Depends on request for assistance.
Responsible Entities: Redevelopment Agency, non-profit housing corporation.
Funding Source: RDA Housing Set-Aside funds.
Objective: Depends on whether non-profit housing corporation requests assistance from City. No specific project has been identified at the time of adoption of the Housing Element.
The City has had several discussions with Desarollo Latino Americano, a non-profit housing corporation, on this matter. No specific project has been proposed to date, but DLA has been reviewing sites for a potential project. The City is also exploring the potential of assisting DLA in obtaining CDBG funds.
73

PROGRAM 28: Mixed Use Developments. The City will encourage mixed commercial/housing developments through its planned development process when such a development approach can contribute to the City's balance of housing in relation to jobs or provide affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. Encouragement of this type of development would occur primarily through a flexible regulatory approach as part of the planned development process.
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
Although no planned developments have been submitted which propose a mixture of uses on the same site, the Westpointe development was approved with an overall mixture of residential and commercial land use designations, with a focus on first-time homebuyers and the jobs/housing balance. The 1996 update of the General Plan contains a Downtown Commercial Residential designation in the Land Use and Community Design Element, which permits and encourages residential development as a mixed use in conjunction with nonresidential development consistent with the High Density Residential designation.
PROGRAM 29: Advocate Additional State and Federal Financial Commitments to Housing. The City of Ceres will contact its state and federal legislative and congressional representative to advocate for higher state and federal financial commitments to low- and moderate-income housing programs to allow provide local governments with greater financial resources to meet federal and state housing mandates.
Timeframe: Current and ongoing.
Responsible Agency: City Council, Redevelopment Agency.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
Staff has contacted local legislators regarding its opposition to those proposals to reform Housing Element requirements in ways that impose greater burdens on the city without the financial resources to implement these new programs. Staff has also advocated the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, due to its success in Ceres, to the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee.
PROGRAM 30: Subsidized Housing Requiring Voter Authorization. The California Constitution (Article XXXIV) requires local voter authorization to use public funds for certain types of low-income rental housing in any community. Developments which will be publicly owned or managed, or developments which receive public subsidies and contain 50% or more low-income housing, must have authorization from local voters. Voter approval of specific developments is not necessary. The California Constitution does require, however, that local voters authorize a specific number of dwelling units which can be publicly owned, managed, or subsidized; that the expected, general location of these units be identified, and that the general types of rental housing anticipated be identified.
To ensure that the City will can take advantage of all potential sources of state and federal subsidies, and that it can exercise maximum flexibility in the use of redevelopment funds to support low-income housing development, the City will submit to Ceres voters a proposal for authorization to expend public funds for low-income rental housing. The timing of the ballot measure, the contents of the proposal, and the number of units to be proposed for voter approval will be determined by the City Council with the assistance of a citizen advisory committee.

PROGRAM 31: Continued Participation in STANCO. The City will continue its participation in the Stanislaus County Affordable Housing Corporation (STANCO) as a vehicle for using state and federal funds in support of low-income housing and as a non-profit developer of low-income housing.
Timeframe: Current andongoing.
Responsible Entity: Community Development Director to act as City representative to STANCO.
Funding Source: Not applicable.
Objective: Not applicable.
The City is continuing its ongoing participation in STANCO.
PROGRAM 32: Encourage Minimum Density of Development on Multifamily Land. The City will increase the probability of meeting the quantified objectives in this Housing Element by establishing a policy in the Land Use Element to assure that land to be annexed to the City and to be designated for multifamily development is, in fact, developed at minimum densities for multifamily use, unless such land is not needed to meet the City's share of the region's low- and moderate-income housing needs.
Timeframe: Policy to be adopted at the next amendment of the Land Use Element-timing depends on when annexation occurs and General Plan amendment takes place.
Responsible Entities: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council.
Funding Source: Not applicable.

Chapter 4 Public Facilities and Services
l	_______________ -	_________________
City development is dependent on a complicated network of public facilities and services. Each type of service has a unique set of constraints and must adapt to growth and change differently. This chapter focuses on water, sewer collection and treatment, storm drainage, solid waste collection and disposal, fire protection, law enforcement, schools, and other utilities such as gas, electricity, and communications.
Transportation facilities are discussed separately in Chapter 2, and parks are addressed in Chapter 5.
i	____
(j OALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, and implementation programs that establish the framework for the provision of public facilities and services to meet the demand created by existing and future development in Ceres. The goals and policies of this section are organized topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to a particular type of facility or service.
•	General Public Facilities and Services
•	Public Facilities and Services Funding
•	Water Supply and Delivery
•	Wastewater Collection, Treatment, and Disposal
•	Stormwater Drainage
•	Solid Waste Collection and Disposal
•	Law Enforcement
•	Fire Protection
•	Schools
•	Public Utilities
Modern development requires a wide range of publicly-provided services, such as water, sewer, storm drainage, and garbage collection. The City of Ceres directly provides or contracts for most of these services. The General Plan seeks to provide for the logical and efficient extension of these services as new development occurs.
Goal 4. A
To ensure the timely development of public facilities and the maintenance of adequate service levels for these facilities to meet the needs of existing and future city residents.
Policies
4.A.I. Where new development requires the construction of new public facilities, the new development shall fund its fair share of the construction of those facilities. The City shall require dedication of
G ENERAL PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES, Chapter 4
land within newly developing areas for required public facilities, as allowed by law.
4.A.2. The City shall ensure through the development review process that adequate public facilities and services are available to serve new development. The City shall not approve new development where existing facilities are inadequate unless the following conditions are met:
a.	The applicant can demonstrate that all necessary public facilities will be installed or adequately financed (through fees or other means); and
b.	The facilities improvements are consistent with the City's Public Facilities Plan and/or other functional plans for infrastructure or public facilities. Where oversized or out-of-sequence public facilities are required, reimbursement from the City or future developers, depending on the circumstances, may be arranged in accordance with the City of Ceres' Public Facilities Fees Administrative Procedures.
4.A.3. The City shall require areawide plan proposals to include plans for development and financing of public facilities and services.
4.A.4. The City shall update the Public Facilities Plan and other functional plans for infrastructure or public facilities on a regular basis to ensure compliance with appropriate state and federal laws; incorporation of state of the art technology, and compatibility with changing land use policy.
4.A.5. The City shall provide for expansion of general government
services (e.g., City administrative services) in connection with new development.
Implementation Programs
4.1.	The City shall update the Public Facilities Plan based on the updated General Plan.
Responsibility: City Council
Planning Commission Public Works Department
Time Frame: FY 97-98
P UBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES FUNDING
In the past, federal and state grants paid for some improvements and expansions of City facilities, but the availability of these funds has dwindled. New development is therefore generally responsible for providing for the extensions of the services it requires.
Facilities not only have to be constructed, but they require ongoing maintenance and operation. The policies in this section seek to provide for
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
4-2
I
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES, Chapter 4
funding of new facilities and services as new development occurs, and to consider how the ongoing maintenance and operations of these facilities will be funded to ensure that operational levels do not decline.
Goal 4.B
To ensure that adequate facility and service standards are achieved and maintained through the use of equitable funding methods.
Policies
4.B.I. The City shall require, to the extent legally possible, that new
development pays the cost of providing new public facilities and services and/or the costs for upgrading of all existing facilities that it uses, based on the demand for these facilities attributable to the new development; exceptions may be made when new development generates significant public benefits (e.g., low-income housing, significant primary wage earner employment) and/or when alternative sources of funding can be identified to offset foregone revenues.
4.B.2. The City shall seek broad-based funding sources for public facilities and services that benefit both current and future residents of the City.
4.B.3. The City shall require preparation of a fiscal impact analysis for all areawide plans or significant general plan land use amendments.
The analysis will examine the fiscal impacts on the City and other service providers that result from large-scale development. Where the fiscal impact study shows that the development enabled by an areawide plan will create an operating deficits, the City shall require a mechanism to fully mitigate the funding deficit, except as provided in Policy 4.B.I.
Implementation Programs
4.2.	The City will update the Public Facilities Plan based on the updated General Plan and updated infrastructure master plans.

w ASTEWATER COLLECTION, TREATMENT, AND DISPOSAL
The City provides sewer collection, treatment, and disposal services. The wastewater treatment plant is located in the southwest part of the city south of Service Road and east of Morgan Road, and is designed to serve domestic flows rather than heavy industrial wastewater. New development will require expansion of the plant and new trunk lines. Figure 4-2 shows the general layout of the future wastewater system.
The policies in this section seek to provide for the logical expansion and extension of the wastewater system to serve new development. Water conservation efforts also reduce the amount of wastewater that must ultimately be disposed. Industrial waste source control and pretreatment of industrial wastewater can relieve the burden on the City's treatment plant.
Goal 4.D
To ensure adequate wastewater collection and treatment and the safe disposal of wastes.
Policies
4.D.I. The City shall promote reduced wastewater system demand through efficient water use by:
a.	Requiring water-conserving design and equipment in new construction;
b.	Encouraging retrofitting with water-conserving devices; and
c.	Designing wastewater systems to minimize inflow and infiltration to the extent economically feasible.
4.D.2. The City shall prohibit on-site treatment and disposal facilities within its service area, except where such systems are deemed appropriate and will not pose health risks or risks to groundwater.
4.D.3. The City will review development proposals in the vicinity of the wastewater treatment plant site to ensure their safety and compatibility.
4.D.4. The City will investigate options for the reuse of treated wastewater.
See also Policy l.G.5. regarding accommodation of wet industries.
Implementation Programs
4.8.	The City shall update the Wastewater Master Plan based on the updated General Plan and begin expansion of the wastewater treatment plant.

Stormwater
DRAINAGE
The City's storm drainage system consists of collection, conveyance, detention, and pumping facilities. Future development will require extensions of the storm drainage system; in addition, additional federal and state water quality standards will require examination of the quality of stormwater released into public waterways. Policies of this section require the expansion of the storm drainage system in the safest and most efficient manner.
Policies in this section address the future storm drainage. These policies encourage joint use of storm drainage facilities with park, although the drainage function should be subsidiary to their park function.
Goal 4.E
To collect and dispose of stormwater in a manner that minimizes inconvenience to the public, minimizes potential water-related damage, and enhances the environment.
Policies
4.E.I. The City shall require new development to adequately mitigate increases in stormwater peak flows and/or volume. Mitigation measures should take into consideration impacts on adjoining lands in the city and immediately adjacent to the city in unincorporated Stanislaus County.
4.E.2. All drainage designs shall be in accordance with the accepted principles of civil engineering, the Stanislaus County Storm Drainage Design Manual, and City improvement standards.
4.E.3. New development shall have surface drainage disposal accommodated in one of the following ways:
a.	Positive drainage - positive drainage to a river, stream, creek, or other natural water course.
b.	Irrigation facility - drainage into an irrigation district facility, either by gravity or pumping, pursuant to the City - Turlock Irrigation District agreement.
c.	Drainage ponds - ponds, either in individual lots within a subdivision or in the case of larger developments, within a depressed portion of a common area.
4-7
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES, Chapter 4
d.	Drainage unit - use of french drains within depressed areas of the street right-of-way for those subdivisions or portions of subdivisions of such size that one of the solutions in subsections a, b, or c is not feasible, as determined by the City Engineer
e.	On-site drainage - drainage retained on-site within the development.
Commercial development shall accommodate drainage on-site unless a method described in subsections a or b above is available and the development participates in a system to address on-site drainage as approved by the City Engineer. All on-site industrial drainage shall remain on-site. The City shall encourage commercial and industrial development to integrate on-site storm drainage facilities with landscaping.
4.E.4. The City shall encourage project designs that minimize drainage concentrations and impervious coverage.
4.E.5. The City shall require appropriate mitigation for grading activities during the rainy season to avoid sedimentation of storm drainage facilities.
4.E.6. The City shall require projects that have significant impacts on the quality of surface water runoff to incorporate mitigation measures for water quality impacts related to urban runoff.
4.E.7. Future drainage system requirements shall comply with applicable state and federal pollutant discharge requirements.
4.E.8. The City shall seek to minimize operational complexities and maintenance requirements of the storm drainage system.
4.E.9. The City shall allow stormwater detention facilities to mitigate
drainage impacts and reduce storm drainage system costs. To the extent practical, stormwater detention facilities should be designed for multiple purposes, including recreational and/or stormwater quality improvement.
4.E.10. The City shall consider using stormwater of adequate quality to replenish the local groundwater basin, restore wetlands and riparian habitat, and irrigate agricultural lands, or as open space or recreational enhancements.
4.E.11. The City shall, when necessary to meet federal stormwater quality requirements, establish a storm drain utility to address these requirements on a citywide basis.

Responsibility: City Council
Planning Commission
, Public Works Department Time Frame: FY 97-98
Also see programs 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.
Solid waste collection and disposal in Ceres is provided by a franchise agreement, with disposal at the Stanislaus County Fink Road landfill and waste-to-energy (WTE) facility. New residential, commercial, and industrial development will generate additional waste and will hasten the rate at which the landfill is filled. Policies in this section seek to reduce the amount of waste produced through source reduction, reuse, and recycling, and to ensure safe disposal of waste. Solid waste management policy is specifically addressed in the City's Source Reduction and Recycling Element and the County Integrated Waste Management Plan. The goal of this Plan is to reduce the total amount of waste generated and disposed of through source reduction, recycling and composting, and safe transformation and land disposal of solid wastes. State law requires that a minimum of 25 percent of the total wastes generated are diverted from landfills by 1995 and a minimum of 50 percent by the year 2000.
GOAL4.F
To ensure the safe and efficient disposal or recycling of solid waste generated in Ceres.
Policies
4.F.I. The City shall require waste collection in all new development.
4.F.2. The City shall promote maximum use of solid waste source reduction, recycling, composting, and environmentally-safe transformation of wastes.
4.F.3. The City shall require that all new development complies with applicable provisions of the City of Ceres Source Reduction and Recycling Element and the Stanislaus County Integrated Waste Management Plan.
4.F.4. The City shall encourage development of regional and
community-based recycling facilities in heavy commercial and industrial areas.
4.F.5. The City shall require screening of waste and recycling containers in commercial, industrial, and multi-family residential areas.

Responsibility: Public Works Department Time Frame: Ongoing
Law
ENFORCEMENT
A sense of public safety is one of the most important features of small-town quality and enjoyment of a community. In recognition of this importance, public safety expenditures typically represent two-thirds of the City's General Fund expenditures. The policies in this section address public safety by setting standards for police service. Public safety can also be addressed through other public safety programs and design of new development and public facilities such as parks and schools.
The City's central public safety center (law enforcement and fire
protection/emergency response )is located in Downtown Ceres, with opportunity for expansion to serve future development. In addition, as future fire stations are required to serve new development, these facilities will serve a joint-use function with community policing presence. (See also Figure 4-3 and the following section on Fire Protection/Emergency Medical Service).
See also the 'Public Safety "section in Chapter 7, Health and Safety.
Goal 4.G
To provide adequate police services to deter crime and to meet the growing demand for services associated with increasing population and commercial/industrial development in the city.
Policies
4.G.I. The City shall, through adequate staffing and patrol arrangements, endeavor to maintain the minimum feasible response times for police calls. The City shall strive to achieve a maximum four minute response time for life-threatening events.
4.G.2. The City shall strive to maintain conditions so that officers have a minimum 40 percent patrol time to ensure that law enforcement can play a proactive, rather them reactive, role.

FIRE PROTECTION/ EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
Fire protection is a critical component of public safety. The adequacy of fire protection depends on several factors: personnel and equipment, available water supply and pressure, quickness of response, and reducing potential fire hazards. Buildings can also be constructed with fire resistant materials, smoke alarms, or sprinkler systems that can reduce fire potential.
Figure 4-3 shows the generalized locations of future public safety facilities to meet adequate response times.
See also the “Fire Hazards” section in Chapter 7, Health and Safety.

The availability and quality of education in Ceres is an important factor in quality of life, and is also important in terms of the attractiveness of Ceres for economic development. The largest provider of primary and secondary education in Ceres is the Ceres Unified School District. The Modesto City School District and Modesto High School District (“Modesto City Schools”) also provides service to two areas within the Planning Area: the central part of the city north of Hatch Road immediately east of SR 99, and the westernmost part of the Planning Area west of Crows Landing and south of Whitmore Avenue. Figure 4-4 shows the school districts' boundaries within the Planning Area. The Stanislaus County Office of Education provides specialized training and education services. California State University at Turlock offers graduate and post-graduate education in nearby Turlock. Policies of the General Plan encourage high quality educational resources for all Ceres residents.
Goal 4.1
To provide for educational needs for all Ceres residents.

4.1.2.	The City and the school districts should work together in using existing school facilities for non-school-related and child care activities.
4.1.3.	The City shall support the development of appropriately-located private school facilities to provide additional educational facilities in Ceres.
School siting AND FINANCING
Growth in Ceres will necessitate development of additional public schools. The Ceres Unified School District is responsible for providing public education to most of Ceres; the Modesto City Schools provide service to the northcentral and southwest parts of the Planning Area. Funding for new schools has become a complicated matter, with scarce state funding resources, and questions about the legality and equity of various local funding options. Policies of the plan seek to promote high quality education facilities in Ceres and assist school district in planning for and funding the development of needed new school facilities.
The specific sites of new schools will depend upon the decisions by the School Board and availability of appropriate land. The Ceres Unified School District is researching the best location for a second high school. Additional elementary schools and a junior high school will also be required in connection with projected growth. Figure 4-4 shows school district boundaries. General locations of elementary schools are shown on the Land Use Diagram (Figure 1-2).
Goal 4. J
To ensure that adequate school facilities are available and appropriately located to meet the needs of Ceres residents.
Policies
4.J.I. The City shall work cooperatively with the school districts in
monitoring housing, population, and school enrollment trends and in planning for future school facility needs, and shall assist the districts in locating appropriate sites for new schools in the Planning Area.
4.J.2. The City's land use planning should be coordinated with the planning of school facilities. The City and the school districts should work together in the early stages of the areawide planning and school site selection processes. As needed, the City should reserve school sites in areawide plans to accommodate school district needs.
4.J.3. The City should plan and approve residential uses in those areas that are most accessible to school sites in order to enhance neighborhoods, minimize transportation requirements and costs, and minimize safety problems.

Policies
4.L.I. The City shall communicate its major development plans with utility companies and coordinate planning of extension of these facilities.
4.L.2. The City shall require undergrounding of utility lines in new
development and as areas are redeveloped, except where infeasible for operational or financial reasons.
4.L.3. The City shall promote technological improvements and upgrading of utility services in Ceres.
The City of Ceres will make a concerted effort to foster the use of emerging information technology. Increased use of information technology can increase interaction and cooperation among the community, government, industry, and education. Use of this technology can improve the lives of Ceres residents by increasing mobility (while lessening the burden on the physical transportation structure and reducing related environmental pollutants). Residents can also increase control over the demands placed upon their lives through the convenience offered by a communitywide information infrastructure.

Chapter 5 Recreational and Cultural Resources
Ceres' quality of life and diversity is reflected in its recreational and cultural services. The City provides and maintains public parks, but this is only part of the city's recreation and entertainment. The needs for parks facilities and services span all age and income groups. The General Plan sets the framework for an expanded park system with physical recreational facilities to provide the opportunity for a variety of recreational activities.
This chapter also provides for preservation of Ceres' important historic and archaeological resources.
(j OALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, and implementation programs that establish the framework for the provision of recreational facilities and services and the protection and enhancement of cultural resources for Ceres residents and visitors. The goals and policies of this chapter are organized topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to specific topic.
•	Parks and Recreation
•	Historic Preservation
•	Archaeological Resources
PARKS AND RECREATION
Parks and recreational activities foster community interaction and a sense of community involvement. Ceres' diverse population has varied parks and recreational interests. The high proportion of families with children creates a significant demand for organized sports facilities (e.g., softball, baseball, soccer fields). The City seeks to provide opportunities for all segments of the population to enjoy passive and active recreational facilities.
Ceres currently has one community park—Smyrna Park—along with many neighborhood parks. As of 1995, the City owned and operated 68.5 acres of park land. Ceres also participates in the development of the Tuolumne River Regional Park with the City of Modesto and Stanislaus County.
Ceres has relied on school grounds for recreational uses, and in the past, used school acreage as credit toward meeting City park standards. The City's 1995 ratio was approximately 2.5 acres of City-owned parkland per 1,000 residents. When open space at school grounds is considered as available parkland, the ratio is about 4.6 acres per 1,000 residents. The addition of portable classrooms and move toward year-round schools has limited the use of school grounds for recreational use. Although the City will continue joint use agreements with the school district and promote joint development and use of facilities, the General Plan establishes a
5-1
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
RECREATIONAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES, Chapter 5
i
standard for City park development that no longer allows deductions for school acreage.
l
The General Plan sets standards and seeks to provide for the development of new parks and recreational facilities, including new community parks in the Planning Area, new neighborhood parks, and expanded recreational activities.
1
The precise location of future park sites will be determined by the City in conjunction with new development and based upon available and appropriate land. Figure 5-1 shows the general possible locations for community parks; the Land Lise Diagram (Figure 1-2) shows conceptual locations for future neighborhood parks. Specific locations will be determined through the areawide planning process and City park planning efforts.
j
The section on “Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources" in Chapter 7 also addresses the use of parks for open space.
Goal 5. A
To establish and maintain a public park system and recreational facilities suited to the needs of Ceres residents, employees, and visitors.
Policies
5.A.I. The City shall continue to develop and expand its park system, to include a balance of passive and active recreational opportunities.
5.A.2. The City shall strive to achieve the following standards for the development of park facilities:
Facility Type	Size	Standard
Neighborhood Park	5 to 10 acres	1.4 acres/ 1,000 population
Community Park	40 to 60 acres	2.6 acres/ 1,000 population
Joint use of City parks as drainage detention basins will be permitted, with the park as the primary use. Joint use of parks with and adjacent to schools will also be encouraged.
5.A.3. Neighborhood parks should serve as the recreational and social focus of the neighborhood, and should include facilities for both active and passive recreation activities. Neighborhood parks should be easily accessible to the neighborhood via trails, bikeways, sidewalks, or low-volume residential streets. A prototype neighborhood park is illustrated below.

Natural Resources	
Ceres' natural resources, water, vegetation, wildlife, and air, and the surrounding agricultural resources contribute to the city's economy and are important elements in the quality of life of Ceres' residents. These natural resources exist in limited quality and are at risk of destruction or degradation through continued urban development. The General Plan seeks to balance the need for growth while encouraging the conservation and enhancement of the area's agricultural and natural resources, frequently in cooperation with other agencies.
Cj oals, policies, and implementation programs
This chapter contains goals, policies, and implementation programs that establish the framework for the protection of valuable natural resources in the Ceres area. The goals and policies are organized topically according to the following categories, each of which relates to a key objective for protection of Ceres' environmental resources.
•	Agricultural Land
•	Water Resources
•	Fish and Wildlife Habitat
•	Vegetation
•	Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
•	Air Quality—General
•	Air Quality—Transportation
A GRI CULTURAL LAND
Ceres' agricultural surroundings play an important role in its history and character, and agriculture is an important part of Ceres' and Stanislaus County's economy.
Most of Ceres was developed on prime agricultural land, as the properties of prime soil are also those properties that are ideal for urban development. Growth in Ceres will result in conversion of some agricultural uses to urban development. Policies of the Plan, however, seek to maintain agricultural use as long as possible and to protect adjacent agricultural lands from negative effects of adjacent urban development.
Policies in Chapter 1, Land Use and Community Design, also discuss the relationship between urban and agricultural uses and establishment of a permanent growth boundary on the eastern side of the city.
Goal 6. A
To promote the productivity of agricultural lands surrounding Ceres and the continued viability of Stanislaus County agriculture.

Water
RESOURCES
The quantity, quality, and availability of water is vital to natural processes and human activities within any urban area. Water is essential to the development of housing, commerce, industry, and agriculture, to recreation, and to the maintenance of high quality fish and wildlife habitats.
The Tuolumne River forms the northernmost Planning Area boundary. A groundwater aquifer underlies the city, and serves as its municipal water supply. These resources are regional in nature and require a cooperative effort to ensure protection of water quality in these bodies. Other potential sources of water for the city include reclaimed water, reuse, and recharge of the groundwater basin. Policies in this section seek to protect these resources and maintain the highest quality for human and natural use.
See also 'Water Supply and Delivery "section in Chapter 4.
Goal 6.B
To protect and enhance the natural qualities of the Ceres area's rivers, creeks, and groundwater.
Policies
6.B.I. The City shall cooperate with other agencies in the conservation of the Tuolumne River for the protection of its water resources and its open space qualities.
6.B.2. The City shall cooperate with other jurisdictions to jointly study the potential for using surface water sources to balance the ground-water supply to protect against aquifer overdrafts and water quality degradation.
6.B.3. The City shall help protect groundwater resources from overdraft by promoting water conservation and groundwater recharge efforts.
6.B.4. The City shall continue to require the use of feasible and practical best management practices (BMPs) to protect receiving waters from the adverse effects of construction activities and urban runoff.
6.B.5. The City shall encourage the protection of floodplain lands (See
“Flood Hazards and Protection "section of Chapter 7, Health and Safety).

AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES, Chapter 6
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
Fish and wildlife in the Ceres area are found in both natural and altered habitats. Habitats altered either by agricultural cultivation or by urban development make up most of the Planning Area. Although altered by human activities, some of these areas are still valuable for wildlife, such as the wastewater treatment plant site. The California Department of Fish and Game, in their comments on the General Plan Update process, indicated that there was no fish or wildlife habitat of major concern, and concluded that development in the Urban Growth Area should not have significant impacts on fish and wildlife habitat, except for the area adjacent to the Tuolumne River.
Natural habitats in and around Ceres consist primarily of riparian areas in the northernmost part of the Planning Area, although most of this area is already developed. Policies in this section encourage the protection of the important habitat in this area and are generally applicable only to those areas in the northernmost Planning Area, adjacent to the Tuolumne River.
Goal 6.C
To protect, restore, and enhance habitats that support fish and wildlife species so as to maintain populations at viable levels.
Policies
6.C.I. The City shall support preservation of habitats of rare, threatened, endangered, and/or other special status species. The City shall require development in areas known to have particular value for wildlife to be carefully planned and, where possible, located so that the reasonable value of the habitat for wildlife is maintained.
6.C.2. The City shall encourage the control of residual pesticides to
prevent potential damage to water quality, vegetation, and wildlife.
6.C.3. Prior to approval of discretionary development permits involving parcels within a significant ecological resource area, the City shall require, as part of the environmental review process, a biotic resources evaluation of the site by a wildlife biologist. Such evaluation will consider the potential for significant impact on these resources, and will identify feasible measures to mitigate such impacts or indicate why mitigation is not feasible. In approving any such discretionary development permit, the City shall determine the feasibility of the identified mitigation measures.
Significant ecological resource areas shall, at a minimum, include the following:
a.	Any habitat for rare, threatened or endangered animals or plants.
b.	Riparian and wetland habitats associated with the Tuolumne River

AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES, Chapter 6
V EGETATION
6.C.4. The City shall support and cooperate with efforts of other local, state, and federal agencies and private entities engaged in the preservation and protection of significant biological resources from incompatible land uses and development. Significant biological resources include endangered, threatened, or rare species and their habitats, wetland habitats, wildlife migration corridors, and locally-important species/communities.
6.C.5. The City shall' support the management efforts of the California Department of Fish and Game to maintain and enhance the productivity of fisheries in the Tuolumne River.
Like fish and wildlife habitat, the diverse stands of vegetation in Ceres include both native and non-native species, although the only known area of special habitat is the riparian vegetation along the Tuolumne River. Policies of this section support the preservation of important plant species, and promote the use of native species where possible in new development and landscaping.
Goal 6.D:
To preserve and protect the valuable vegetation resources of the Ceres area.
Policies
6.D.I. The City shall encourage landowners and developers to preserve
natural vegetation along the Tuolumne River and to use native and compatible non-native species in landscaping in these areas.
6.D.2. The City shall support the preservation of outstanding areas of natural riparian vegetation.
6.D.3. The City shall establish procedures for identifying and preserving rare, threatened, and endangered plant species and their habitats that may be adversely affected by public or private development projects. A biotic resources evaluation, as outlined under Policy 6.C.3, shall be conducted by a qualified plant biologist for these species and shall include a review of lists maintained by various resource agencies which identify known occurrences of rare, threatened, and endangered plants in the Ceres area.
6.D.4. If possible, the City shall support the management of wetland and riparian plant communities for passive recreation, groundwater recharge, nutrient catchment, and wildlife habitats.
6.D.5. The City shall encourage the planting of native trees, shrubs, and
grasslands in order to preserve the visual integrity of the landscape, provide habitat conditions suitable for native wildlife, and ensure that a maximum number and variety of well-adapted plants are maintained.

Ceres is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, in which the air
quality does not meet some state and federal health standards, particularly for ozone and small particulates (PM10). While emission control requirements on motor vehicles and industrial operations have substantially reduced air pollution from these sources, increased development and the associated increase in emissions from automobiles threatens to offset these gains. The San Joaquin Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) monitors and regulates air quality in the

Chapter 7 Health and Safety
The process of planning for future urban growth and development requires the thorough consideration a wide range of public safety issues. Safety hazards are naturally-induced, such as seismic and geologic, flood, and wildland fire hazards; some hazards are the result of natural hazards which are exacerbated by human activity and alteration of the natural environment, such as dam failure, urban fire, and development in sensitive areas such as floodplains and areas subject to erosion and landsliding; and some hazards are manmade, including airport crash hazards, hazardous materials, and crime. In addition to safety issues related to hazardous conditions, the planning process should account for other issues related to community health and safety, including crime and noise exposure.
Many of the health and safety risks associated with development can be avoided through locational decisions made at the planning stages of development, while others may be lessened through the use of mitigation measures in the planning and land use regulation process. This chapter outlines the City's strategy for ensuring the maintenance of a healthy and safe physical environment in Ceres.
(j OALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This chapter contains goals, policies, programs, and standards intended to protect Ceres residents, businesses, and visitors from the harmful effects of natural and man-made hazards. This information is organized under the following topics, each of which relates to specific conditions and concerns relevant to Ceres.
•	Seismic and Geologic Hazards
•	Flood Hazards and Protection
•	Fire Hazards
•	Public Safety
•	Aircraft Crash Hazards
•	Hazardous Materials
•	Emergency Response
•	Noise
Seismic and
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The primary seismic and geologic hazards affecting development in Ceres is earthquakes. Generally flat in topography, Ceres does not face risks from landsliding or seiches.
Earthquakes occur infrequently, but can inflict major damage. Generally, the city has experienced groundshaking from earthquakes in the region, but no major damage. The earthquakes affecting Ceres most recently include the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, the 1983 Coalinga quake, and the 1952 Tehachapi quake. Ceres is within Uniform Building Code seismic zone 3, indicating moderate potential for groundshaking. Modern building construction codes require that buildings be designed to resist stresses produced by lateral forces causes by wind and earthquakes.
7-1
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
HEALTH AND SAFETY, Chapter 7
All soils have properties and characteristics such as erosion potential, shrink-swell behavior, and permeability, that determine their suitability and constraints for building sites, grading, infrastructure, and drainage systems. Because of its topography and water table, soils in Ceres do not typically exhibit any unusual qualities that require special foundations or engineering.
The policies in this section seek to ensure that new buildings and facilities are designed to withstand Seismic and geologic hazards.
Goal 7. A
To minimize the loss of life, injury, and property damage due to seismic and geological hazards
Policies
7.A.I. The City shall require that new structures intended for human occupancy be designed and constructed according to Uniform Building Code Zone 3 requirements to minimize risk to the safety of occupants due to groundshaking.
7.A.2. City shall continue to support scientific geologic investigations which refine, enlarge, and improve the body of knowledge on active fault zones, unstable areas, severe groundshaking, and other hazardous conditions in the Ceres area.
7.A.3. The City shall require that new structures and alterations to
existing structures comply with the current edition of the Uniform Building Code.
7.A.4. The City shall support ways to improve the structural safety and
stability of older structures of designated historic significance while maintaining their historical character through the use of the State
Historic Building Code.
7.A.5. The City shall continue to implement the Dangerous Building Code to address older buildings that may at risk for seismic or geologic hazards.
7.A.6. The City shall avoid siting of structures across soil materials of substantially different expansive properties.
FLOOD HAZARDS AND PROTECTION
Areas within the 100-year floodplain within the Planning Area are limited to the northern part adjacent to Tuolumne River.
The policies of this section seek to protect new development in this area from damage, and to require new development within identified floodplains to be designed to avoid flood damage.
Ceres General Plan Polio/ Document
7-2
HEALTH AND SAFETY, Chapter 7
GOAL7.B
To protect the lives and property of the citizens of Ceres from hazards associated with development in floodplains and to manage floodplains for their natural resource values.
Policies
7.B.I. The City shall implement floodplain zoning and undertake other actions required to comply with state floodplain requirements, upon annexation of areas within the floodplain.
7.B.2. The City shall require evaluation of potential flood hazards prior to approval of development projects. The City shall require proponents of new development to submit accurate topographic and flow characteristics information. This will include depiction of the 100-year floodplain boundaries under fully-developed, unmitigated runoff conditions.
7.B.3. The City shall require flood-proofing of structures in areas subject to flooding (upon annexation of an area within the floodplain).
7.B.4. The City shall continue to work closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Reclamation Board in defining existing and potential flood problem areas and solutions.
7.B.5. The City shall recognize floodplains as a potential public resource to be managed and maintained for the public's benefit and, where possible, shall view flood waters as a resource to be used for waterfowl habitat, aquifer recharge, fishery enhancement, agricultural water supply, and other suitable uses.
IRE HAZARDS
Structural and wildland fire hazards can threaten life and property in Ceres. Wildland fires resulting from either natural on manmade causes occur in forest, brush, or grasslands, so the threat is minimal in Ceres, although vacant lots and fallow agricultural areas with weeds can be fire hazards. Structural fires usually result from manmade causes and can spread easily. Structural fire hazards are highest from those structures built before building and fire codes were established.
The policies of this section seek to ensure that new development is constructed to minimize potential fire hazards, and to provide public education concerning fire prevention. The “Fire Protection” section in Chapter 4 addresses the service levels and maintenance of the City's Public Safety Department.
Goal 7.C
To prevent and minimize the risk of loss of life, injury, and damage to property and watershed resources resulting from unwanted fires.

Policies
7.G.I. The City shall periodically update the City of Ceres Emergency Plan, as necessary, to ensure that an adequate plan and program can be activated in the event of an emergency.
7.G.2. The City shall continue to coordinate emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation activities with Stanislaus County, special districts, service agencies, voluntary organizations, other cities within the county, surrounding cities and counties, and state and federal agencies.
7.G.3. The City shall consider a promotional program to inform the
general public of emergency preparedness and disaster response procedures.
7.G.4. The City shall maintain the capability to effectively respond to emergency incidents.
7.G.5. The City shall maintain an emergency operations center to coordinate emergency response, management, and recovery activities.
7.G.6. The City shall ensure that the siting of critical emergency response facilities such as hospitals, public safety facilities, dispatch centers, emergency operations centers, and other emergency service facilities and utilities have minimal exposure to flooding, seismic and geological effects, fire, and explosions.
A feature of Ceres' small-town character and quality of life is its relatively quiet atmosphere. Noise results from many sources, including traffic on freeways and other roads, railroad operations, aircraft, and industrial activities. Exposure to excessive noise has often been cited as a health problem, not so much in terms of actual physiological damage, such as hearing impairment, but more in terms of general well-being and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. These policies seek to protect noise-sensitive uses (residential areas, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, theaters, auditoriums, music halls, churches, meeting halls, offices, schools, libraries, museums, playgrounds, and parks) from excessive noise. New development must be designed and located so as not to result in excessive noise on adjacent properties, and development of new noise-sensitive uses in areas projected to have high noise levels must be constructed so as to reduce interior noise levels.
Figures 7-1 and 7-2 show future noise contours in Ceres. A full-scale map is also available for review at the City of Ceres Planning and Community Development Department.
Goal 7.H
To protect Ceres residents from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to excessive noise.
7-9
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
HEALTH AND SAFETY, Chapter 7
Policies
7.H.I. The City shall prohibit new development of noise-sensitive uses where the interior noise level due to non-transportation noise sources will exceed the noise level standards of Table 7-1 as measured at the property line of the new development, unless effective noise mitigation measures have been incorporated into the development design to achieve the standards specified in Table 7-1.
7.H.2. The City shall require that noise created by new proposed
non-transportation sources be mitigated so as not to exceed the noise level standards of Table 7-1 as measured at the property line of lands designated for noise-sensitive uses.
TABLE 7-1 NOISE LEVEL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS New Projects Affected by or Including Non-transportation Sources

Hourly Leq, dB	55	45
Maximum level, dB	75	65
Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by five dB for simple tone noises, noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises. These noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with industrial or commercial		
uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).		
7.H.3. The City shall not subject existing dwellings and new dwellings to the standards presented in Table 7-1 if feasible mitigation measures are not available to meet the requirements in Table 7-1. As a consequence, such dwellings may be located in areas where noise levels exceed the standards and it shall not be the responsibility of City to ensure that such dwellings meet the standards of this section of the General Plan or the noise standards imposed by lending agencies such as HUD, FHA and Cal Vet. In conjunction with approval of new residential projects, the City shall require recordation of notice that the noise levels may exceed these standards. If homes are located and constructed in accordance with these policies and standards, it is expected that the resulting exterior and interior noise levels will conform to the
HUD/FHA/Cal Vet noise standards.
7.H.4. Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely to produce noise levels exceeding the performance standards of Table 7-1 at existing or planned noise-sensitive uses, the City shall require an acoustical analysis as part of the environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project design. The acoustical analysis shall meet the following requirements:

accommodate development permitted according to the Land Use Diagram. As a result, existing noise-sensitive uses may be exposed to increased noise levels due to increased roadway capacity and increases in travel speeds, making it impractical to achieve the noise level standards contained Table 7-2, As an alternative to the standards in Table 7-2, the City will apply the following criteria to determine the significance of increases in noise related to improvement projects:
a.	Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB at the outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to a roadway improvement project will be considered significant; and

APPENDIX A
CITY OF CERES ANNEXATION POLICY
(Resolution No. 95-112)
1.	AREAWIDE PLANNING REQUIRED FOR ANNEXATION TO THE CITY OF CERES
All applications for annexation to the City of Ceres, except for those listed in number six below, shall be accompanied by, and based on, an appropriate areawide plan (e.g., master plan, specific plan, etc.) That addresses land use, circulation, housing, infrastructure, public facilities, and public services. The geographic scope of the areawide plan shall reflect a reasonable and logical unit taking into consideration such factors as existing and proposed land uses and natural and man-made features (e.g., rivers, major streets and roads, railroads, canals, power lines, etc.).
In the case of areawide plans prepared for areas that are planned for predominantly residential development, the areawide plan shall emphasize the creation of residential neighborhoods, including when appropriate, schools, parks, and conveniently located neighborhood-serving commercial, and shall incorporate opportunities for a range of housing types and densities consistent with the latest Housing Element of the City's General Plan.
2.	INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY-PUBLIC FACILITIES FEES AND ADDITIONAL MITIGATION WHERE NECESSARY
All areawide plans shall provide an analysis of the public facilities and infrastructure (streets, traffic signals, water supply system, waste water treatment system, parks, public safety facilities, etc.) needed to accommodate the proposed development described in the areawide plan. This analysis shall also identify the funding source of any needed public facilities, including any proposals for the creation of districts to fund any such facilities.
The infrastructure or public facilities planned in conjunction with an areawide plan shall be consistent with the city's Public Facilities Plan and/or other functional plans for infrastructure or public facilities.
It shall be the responsibility of project sponsors to insure that adequate infrastructure and public facilities are available to serve the development described in the areawide plan. The City may require project sponsors and/or future developers to fund or install public facilities, for which it collects Public Facilities Fees, if necessary, to have the public facilities available to serve the development anticipated in the areawide plan at the time it becomes needed. The City may also require the oversizing of infrastructure or public facilities where such facilities will be needed to serve future development consistent with the city's General Plan. Where oversized or out-of-sequence public facilities are required, reimbursement from either the City or future developers, depending on the circumstances, may be arranged by agreement with the city.
Pursuant to the City Council's policy regarding school mitigation (described in more detail in Resolution 94-111), the payment of School Mitigation Fees for residential development approved in conjunction with areawide plans shall be required as set forth in City Council Resolution 94-111. All other proposed land uses shall mitigate school impacts in accordance with state law and Resolution 94-111.
3.	FISCAL IMPACT STUDY AND MITIGATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES COSTS-GROWTH PAYS ITS OWN WAY
All areawide plans shall be subject to fiscal impact study that compares the ongoing operating costs
(maintenance and operations) to the city for the delivery of public services with the revenues generated by the projects that will be developed under the areawide plan. In order to insure that the study is objective and consistent over time, the City will make arrangements for the completion of the fiscal impact study. However,
A-l
Ceres General Plan Policy Document
CITY OF CERES ANNEXATION POLICY, Appendix A
project sponsors and/or future developers will be responsible for paying for this study either up front or in conjunction with the approval of individual projects.
Where the fiscal impact study shows that the development enabled by an areawide plan will generate a surplus of revenue (more revenue than cost), no fiscal mitigation shall be required. Where the fiscal impact study shows that the development enabled by an areawide plan will create an operating deficit (greater cost than revenue), project sponsors, future developers, and future property owners shall be required to mitigate 100% of any operating deficits.
The operating deficits not associated with the maintenance of parks and landscaped areas shall be addressed by the payment of a one-time Services Mitigation Fee. The fee shall be determined by capitalizing the projected annual deficit for a period of 15 years adjusted to reflect an annual inflation rate of 6 percent for this period. This fee may be collected in conjunction with either the subdivision phase or the building permit phase of a project. Like the School Mitigation Fees discussed above, the payment of this fee may be deferred to the final building inspection when appropriately secured as a lien against the property.
While the specific means of mitigation will vary on a case-by-case basis, the City's policy is to address all of those operating costs associated with park maintenance and landscaping maintenance by providing funds for these services through its Landscape and Lighting District. Operating costs associated with park maintenance shall be addressed through a Mello-Roos district, or the inclusion of such costs in a one-time Services Mitigation Fee.1
4.	COST SHARING PREFERRED—"FIRST-IN” PAYS IF NECESSARY
It is the preference of the Ceres City Council that all of the property owners, namely those whose property is included with the proposed master plan area and/or who will at some point in time benefit from the preparation of a master plan and subsequent annexation, ultimately and equitably share the costs associated with the preparation and processing of the various applications and studies associated with the areawide planning of a particular area. The City Council encourages the affected parties to voluntarily arrive at cost-sharing arrangements prior to or during the processing of areawide plan and application for annexation. However, where prior agreement to share the costs associated with the master planning process cannot be reached among the various property owners involved, it shall be the responsibility of the initiating party or parties who seek the approvals and entitlements to pay for all of the costs associated with the preparation of the areawide plan and application for annexation.
Where no prior voluntary agreement to share the costs associated with the areawide plan and application for annexation has been reached with the other benefiting property owners, reimbursement for a pro rata share of these costs from future developers of these properties may be arranged by agreement with the city.
5.	CITY RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLICATION TO ANNEX
The City Council of the City of Ceres shall have the sole discretion to determine whether an application to annex property to the City of Ceres shall be made to the Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). No application to annex property to the City of Ceres shall be made without the Planning Commission holding a public hearing to make a recommendation to the City Council on the area and extent of the annexation, and the City Council holding a public hearing to approve the annexation and to submit an application for annexation to LAFCO. An areawide plan shall be the basis for evaluating a proposed annexation. It shall be the responsibility of the project sponsor to pay all costs associated with the annexation application including LAFCO annexation fees, State Board of Equalization fees, and any special election costs, if necessary. The City Council may waive, defer or pay for the costs associated with an annexation application where it determines that it is in the public interest to do so.
'Policy modified to reflect changes in the law brought about by the passage of Proposition 218 in November 1996.

CITY OF CERES ANNEXATION POLICY, Appendix A
6. EXCEPTIONS
The requirements for areawide planning, analysis of the impact on public facilities and public services described above may be waived by the City Council, individually or as a whole, for certain types of annexation applications where these types of studies are unnecessary or impractical due to the size, scale, location, or other special circumstances associated with the application to annex to the City of Ceres. In general, these types of annexation applications include:
•	existing developed area;
•	existing or proposed public facilities;
•	small scale (generally less than 10 acres) infill or island areas;
•	unique economic development opportunities that offer significant community benefits (e.g., 100 permanent/part time jobs, substantial sales tax revenues, etc.);
•	housing projects for very low and low income households.

Affordable housing - Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with very low, low, or moderate income. Housing is considered affordable when a household pays less than 30 percent of its gross monthly income (GMI) for housing, including utilities.
Areawide plan - A master plan or specific plan for area proposed for development that addresses land use, circulation, housing, infrastructure, public facilities, and public services, pursuant to the City of Ceres Annexation Policy (Appendix A).
Best management practices (BMPs) - Any program, technology, process, siting criteria, operating method,
measure, or device which controls, prevents, removes, or reduces storm water pollution. The most effective, or "best" techniques are applied to each specific circumstance depending on the pollution problem and physical and geopolitical setting.
Buffer - Areas or bands of land that serve to separate inherently or potentially incompatible land uses, such as residential areas and areas of intensive agriculture.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) - A state law requiring state and local agencies to regulate activities with consideration for environmental protection. If a proposed activity has the potential for a significant adverse environmental impact, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be prepared and certified as to its adequacy before taking action on the proposed project.
Capital Improvement Program (CIP) - A plan, adopted by a city or county, that schedules physical
improvements, usually for a minimum of five years in the future, to fit the projected fiscal capability of the jurisdiction. The program generally should be reviewed annually for consistency with the general plan.
CNEL - Community Noise Equivalent Level; 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from a variety of singlenoise events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7 PM to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) periods, respectively, to allow for the greater sensitivity to noise during these hours.
Db - Decibel; a unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human ear.
Development - The physical alteration of land by humans. Development includes: subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities, and other facilities; installation of septic systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris, or fill materials; and clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception of agricultural activities).
