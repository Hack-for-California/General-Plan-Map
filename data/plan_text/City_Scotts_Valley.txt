                                                                         Chapter
                                   INTRODUCTION                             1
 The Housing Element addresses how Scotts Valley plans to meet the
 community’s housing needs, particularly the availability, affordability, and
 adequacy of housing. The Housing Element defines strategies and programs for
 all economic and social groups. To these ends, the Housing Element:
 1)   Identifies adequate sites for a range of housing opportunities;
 2)   Provides guidance for developing adequate and affordable housing;
 3)   Addresses constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs;
 4)   Defines approaches to conserve and improve housing conditions; and
 5)   Promotes housing opportunities for all persons.
 The following discusses the context for housing policy in Scotts Valley, the
 organization of the Housing Element, relationship to other chapters of the
 General Plan, and the public participation process involved in the preparation and
 adoption of the housing element.
    A. Community Context
The City of Scotts Valley is located in Northern Santa Cruz County in the
redwoods of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Located south of Silicon Valley, Scotts
Valley is approximately 6 miles north of Santa Cruz, 30 miles southwest of San
Jose, and 68 miles south of San Francisco. Scotts Valley is known throughout
the Santa Cruz County for its natural beauty, proximity to the Silicon Valley, and
small-town character – making it an excellent place to live.
Since its incorporation in 1966, Scotts Valley has witnessed considerable
changes, as local and regional employment opportunities have attracted many
new residents to the community. Between 1970 and 2010, Scotts Valley has
grown from a small town of 3,621 persons to a community of 11,580 persons in
2010. The Association of Monterey County Governments (AMBAG) 2014
Regional Growth Forecast estimates Scotts Valley’s population will grow from
11,580 in 2010 to a population of 11,813 in 2035.
The age distribution of residents has shifted over the past decade. The median
age in the City increased from 38.3 years to 39.5 years between the years 2000
through 2010, with an increasing proportion of the population comprised of
middle- aged adults ages 45 to 64. This is largely attributable to an influx of
persons and families who live in the community and commute to other areas,
as well as work locally in the technology-dependent firms in Scotts Valley.

As part of the Silicon Valley boom, many high technology firms located to the City
of Scotts Valley during the late 1990s, providing many higher-paying employment
opportunities. Scotts Valley’s natural setting and excellent schools and new high
school have made the community an attractive place to live. The rental vacancy
rate in Scotts Valley increased from 3.4 percent in 2000 to 3.5 percent, as estimated
by the 2009-2013 American Community Survey. Due to the housing crisis in 2008
and subsequent recovery, along with moderate population growth, ownership
vacancy rates have increased from 0.7 percent in 2000 to 1.2 percent, as estimated
by the 2009-2013 American Community Survey. According to the 2009-2013
American Community Survey the median value for homes in Scotts Valley is
$586,100, while the median rental rate is $1,948 for a two-bedroom unit in the City.
The Santa Cruz Association of Realtors reports that the median sale price of single-
family homes in Santa Cruz County increased between 2009 and 2010 before
falling 10 percent in 2011.
Scotts Valley is faced with important issues: balancing employment and housing
opportunities; matching the supply of and demand for housing; enhancing the
affordability of housing for all segments of the population; preserving the quality of
the housing stock; and preserving the environmental amenities that distinguish
Scotts Valley. The 2015-2023 Housing Element sets forth a strategy to address
these issues and provide guidance for local government decision-making in all
matters relating to housing.
  B. Organization of the Housing Element
Scotts Valley's Housing Element was updated in 2010 for the 2009-2014 cycle.
This Housing Element is an eight-year plan for the period 2015 to 2023. The 2015-
2023 Housing Element consists of the following major components:
        1) Introduction to the Housing Element, including the planning context
            and process of updating the Housing Element (Chapter 1);
        2) An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and
            trends (Chapter 2);
        3) Review of potential market, governmental, and environmental
            constraints which impact the City’s ability to address its housing needs
            (Chapter 3);
        4) An evaluation of land and financial resources available to address
            Scotts
            Valley’s housing goals (Chapter 4); and
        5) A Housing Plan to address the City’s identified housing
            needs, including housing goals, policies and programs
            (Chapter 5).
                                    1-3

  C. Relationships to General Plan Elements
California Government Code Section 65300.5 requires that a general plan be
internally consistent, so that no conflicts exist among the elements of the plan. The
most important aspect of consistency among general plan elements is that policies
and implementation measures in the general plan elements support one another
to achieve the goals and vision of the general plan.
The Scotts Valley’s General Plan consists of the following eight elements: 1) Land
Use; 2) Circulation; 3) Housing; 4) Open Space, and Conservation; 5) Noise; 6)
Safety; 7) Public Services and Utilities; and 8) Parks and Recreation. In preparing
the 2015-2023 Housing Element, the City reviewed goals and policies of the eight
elements of the Scotts Valley General Plan and concluded that the Housing
Element is consistent with other General Plan elements through the adoption of
complementary policies shown below.
This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is
consistent with the goals and policies set forth therein. For example, residential
development capacities established in the Land Use Element are incorporated in
the Housing Element; environmental constraints in the Housing Element are
consistent with the Open Space/Conservation and Public Services/Utilities
elements. The City will continue to maintain consistency between General Plan
elements by ensuring that proposed changes in one element will be reflected in
other elements.
                                    1-4

  D. Public Participation
Section 65583 (c) (5) of the Government Code requires local governments to
“make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall
describe this effort." To that end, the City has provided opportunities for residents
and interested parties to recommend housing strategies and comment on the
Scotts Valley Housing Element.
The Draft Housing Element was posted on the City’s website and hard copies
provided at City Hall and the library prior to submittal to the California Department
of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review. A notice about its
availability was advertised in the Scotts Valley Banner-Valley Press and various
housing advocacy stakeholder groups were notified and are listed below:

In addition, City staff has conducted face-to-face meetings and conference calls
with representatives of a local housing advocacy group, Affordable Housing Now.
This group’s mission is to work towards preserving and increasing affordable
housing for moderate- to low-income individuals and families in Santa Cruz
County. Representatives provided their input on current housing issues and ways
for the City of Scotts Valley to increase affordable housing opportunities in the
community. Before submittal of the draft Housing Element to HCD, the City of
Scotts Valley held two public hearings before the Planning Commission on August
13, 2015, and the City Council on October 7, 2015. Each public hearing provided
an opportunity for public officials, residents and other stakeholders to comment on
the Housing Element draft.
The City received comments on the following topics: preservation of mobile home
parks and manufactured homes; supporting the development of accessory
dwelling units; and expressing concern over the effect of vacation rentals on the
supply of housing in the community. The City determined that vacation rental
housing is not currently affecting the supply of housing. These comments were
                                       1-5

incorporated into the Housing Element by adding additional programs into the
Housing Plan to address accessory dwelling units, mobile homes, and
manufactured housing.
After HCD reviews the Draft Housing Element, public hearings will be held before
the Planning Commission and City Council for adoption. Notification of these
hearings will be posted in advance of each public hearing. The Final Housing
Element will be posted on the City’s website and hard copies will be provided at
City Hall and the library prior to these public hearings.

           This chapter discusses the characteristics of residents, summarizes housing
           opportunities available to residents, and outlines Scotts Valley’s housing needs.
           Programs to address these needs are set forth in Chapter 5.
             A. Population Characteristics
           Population characteristics affect the housing need in a community. These
           include population growth, the age and race/ethnicity of residents, household
           type, employment and income. This section details trends in population
           characteristics that affect housing need in Scotts Valley.
           1. Population Trends
           Incorporated in 1966, Scotts Valley has grown from a small town of 3,621
           persons in 1970 to a community of 11,580 persons in 2010. Over the next
           decade, the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG)
           forecasts that population in Scotts Valley overall will increase to 11,638 by
           2020. Chart 2-1 below shows the overall growth in Santa Cruz County from
           2000 to 2010.

              2. Age Characteristics
              Scotts Valley’s housing needs are determined in part by age characteristics of
              residents in that each group often has a different lifestyle, family type, income
              level, and housing preference. As people move through each stage of life,
              housing needs change. Traditional assumptions are that the young adult
              population (20 to 34 years old) has a propensity for choosing apartments, low to
              moderate priced condominiums, and smaller single-family units. In comparison,
              the adult population (35 to 65 years old) is the primary market for moderate to
              high-end apartments, condominiums, and larger single-family homes. This age
              group traditionally has higher incomes and larger household sizes. The senior
              population (65 years and older) generates demand for low to moderate cost
              apartments and condominiums, group quarters, and mobile homes. Chart 2-2
              shows the age distribution of the population of the City of Scotts Valley and the
              change in age distribution over the past decade.
              According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, middle-age residents
              are the largest segment in the community, comprising nearly 31 percent of
              residents in Scotts Valley. Middle-age residents (45 to 64 years) have increased
              by 34 percent while young adults (25 to 44 years) have decreased by 26 percent.
              Unlike other age groups, middle-age residents are at the peak of their earning
              power, seeking larger homes, and are more likely to be homeowners. The
              median age in Scotts Valley also increased by 3 percent.
              School age children make up the second largest age group in Scotts Valley with
              nearly 23 percent of the population falling between the ages of 5 to 19 years old,
              while young adults, age 25 to 44 years, make up 22 percent of the population.
              Given the high home prices in Scotts Valley, housing options for young adults are
              likely to be limited to the rental market. The decrease in young adults is
              accompanied by a 24 percent decrease in the number of preschool-age children,
              and a 10 percent increase in school-age children.

             3. Race and Ethnicity
             The racial and ethnic composition of a community affects housing needs due to
             the particular household characteristics of different groups. Chart 2-3 shows
             the changes in the racial/ethnic composition of Scotts Valley residents.
             In Scotts Valley, White residents are the largest racial group, making up
             approximately 78 percent of the City’s total population, according to the 2009-
             2013 American Community Survey. Between 2000 and 2013 there was a six
             percent decrease in the White population of Scotts Valley. The second largest
             population group is Hispanic/Latino residents comprising approximately 10
             percent of the population. From 2000 to 2013, this population group
             experienced growth at over 69 percent.
             In addition to the increase in Hispanic residents, demographic trends show that
             the Black (African-American) population increased from less than 1 percent of
             the population to nearly 3 percent of the population, and the Asian population
             increased by 53 percent. Generally, the racial/ethnic make-up of the City has
             remained the same over the last decade. Compared to Santa Cruz County,
             Scotts Valley had a similar racial/ethnic distribution, with a higher percentage of
             White residents.

  B. Economic Characteristics
                                 Located in northern Santa Cruz County, Scotts
                                 Valley developed in part as a bedroom
                                 community of Silicon Valley. Many County
                                 employers have relocated to the City providing
                                 higher paying jobs to the area. Changes in
                                 Silicon Valley and the general technology
                                 industry will continue to affect the economy of
                                 the City.
1. Employment Market
The 2009-2013 American Community Survey estimates that there were 6,314
people, aged 16 years and older, in the Scotts Valley labor force. There were
5,774 Scotts Valley residents employed, indicating an unemployment rate of
approximately 5.7 percent. This is lower than Santa Cruz County’s
unemployment rate of 6.14 percent.
Silicon Valley has grown to 1.5 million jobs over the past 50 years. The 1950-
1960s saw expansion into the defense-related industries. This was followed by an
expansion into integrated circuits from the 1960-1980s. Application of these
technologies led to the personal computer industry, which dominated the 1980- to
mid-1990s, and the internet industries of the 1990s. Scotts Valley’s employment
base has followed these patterns since the early 1970s.
Over 230,000 jobs were created in the Silicon Valley during the late 1990s, mostly
in the high technology sector. However, since 2000, as the region lost 92,000 of
those jobs due to regional, national and global factors, changes occurred in Scotts
Valley. For instance, the previous headquarters for Borland Software is now called
Enterprise Technology Center and is leased to multiple small businesses.
According to the Scotts Valley Chamber of Commerce, major employers in the City
include:
         Bay Photo Lab
         Central California Alliance for Health
         Comcast of Ca/MA/Mi/Utah, Inc.
         Digital Dynamics
         Easton-Bell Sports, Inc.
         Embarcadero Technologies, Inc.
         Fox Racing Shox
         Hilton Scotts Valley
         Innerstep, Bse.
         Nob Hill Foods #620
         Oak Tree Villa
         Oxford/X-Ray Technology Group
         Safeway
                                    2-6

              Seagate Technologies
              Threshold Enterprises, Ltd.
              Universal Audio
              Zero Technologies
        According to the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG)
        2014 Regional Growth Forecast, between the years 2004 and 2010, the
        number of jobs in Scotts Valley decreased from 5,399 to 5,164 jobs, while the
        number of housing units increased from 4,565 to 4,610. The job to housing ratio
        has thus declined from 1.18 in 2004 to 1.12 in 2010. This means that the
        number of jobs is declining in relation to the number of housing units in the City.
        AMBAG considers that 1.50 is an appropriate balance between jobs and
        housing.
         2. Occupational Profile
        Scotts Valley’s higher median household income is reflective of the type of
        occupations held by residents. Of the occupational categories listed in Chart
        2-7, the most prominent industry was educational services, and health care
        and social assistance occupations with approximately 26 percent of all
        residents employed in this sector. The next highest category, at 13 percent,
        is manufacturing followed by professional, scientific, and management, and
        administrative and waste management service at 11 percent. Generally, pay
        compensation for managerial, professional and related occupations are
        significantly higher than all of the other occupation categories. However,
        because the categories listed below are broad, it is difficult to draw more
        specific conclusions. The education, health and social services industry,
        however, has been growing and is expected to continue to grow as long as
        the State population continues to grow and the aging “baby boomer”
        population continues to grow.

3. Household Income
Many City residents work in education, services, health care, social assistance,
manufacturing, and other high-paying industries. According to the 2009-2013
American Community Survey, the median household income in Scotts Valley was
$101,837. This is higher than the neighboring cities of Capitola, Santa Cruz, and
Watsonville. Furthermore, over the past decade, Scotts Valley’s median household
income also rose faster than all other cities in the county. Chart 2-8 shows the
change in median household income for four cities in Santa Cruz County.
Chart 2-9 summarizes the household income trends in Scotts Valley. While the
number of households in income groups below $75,000 decreased, those
earning more than $75,000 increased. Households earning between $100,000
and $150,000 increased nearly 12 percent, while the number of households
earning more than $150,000 increased by 93 percent. While part of this change is
presumably due to inflation, the primary reason is that many of Scotts Valley
residents work in increasingly higher paying jobs.

Median household income varies depending upon household characteristics.
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, married couple
families earned a median income of $124,806 – more than double than that
earned by nonfamily households.
Households are often grouped into different income categories and types to
facilitate assessment of needs and prioritizing assistance for housing. For state
housing programs and for the Regional Housing Needs Assessment, discussed
later, households are grouped into four income categories.
Assessing income groups is a major component of evaluating housing
affordability. According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, the
annual median household income in Scotts Valley is $101,837. The State
Department of Housing and Community Development developed the following
income categories based on the Median Family Income (MFI) of a Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development:
        Very Low income: 0-50% of MFI
        Low income: 51-80% of MFI
        Moderate income: 81-120% of MFI
        Upper income: Above 120% of MFI
The 2014 MFI for the Santa Cruz-Watsonville metropolitan area of $77,900 was
used to interpolate the City’s income distribution from the Census according to
the above categories. Based on the 2009-2013 American Community Survey,
the income distribution of the City of Scotts Valley is presented in Chart 2-10. It
is estimated that approximately 17 percent of households earned less than
$34,999 annually; approximately 16 percent earned between $35,000 and
$74,999 annually; 15 percent earned between $75,000 and $99,999 annually;
and the remaining 52 percent earned over $100,000 annually.

  C. Special Needs Groups
                                      Scotts Valley, like many communities is
                                      home to a range of residents with special
           What are special           needs that affect their ability to afford or find
           housing needs?             suitable housing. State law defines special
                                      needs households to include seniors,
        California housing law
           considers certain          persons with disabilities, persons with
        households as having          developmental disabilities, female headed
        special needs due to          households, large households, homeless
          income, household           people, and farmworkers.
           size, disability, or
       employment status that
         affect their ability to      1. Senior Households
        find suitable housing.
                                      The special housing needs of the elderly are
                                      an important concern in Scotts Valley. Many
                                      of the elderly residents in the City are retired
and living on a fixed income, which puts them at greater risk for housing
overpayment. In addition, the elderly may have special needs related to housing
construction and location. The elderly often requires ramps, handrails, lower
cupboards and counters to allow greater access and mobility. In terms of
location, because of limited mobility, senior households typically need access to
public facilities (i.e., medical and shopping) and public transit facilities.
For Housing Element purposes, a senior householder is defined as one who is
65 years or older. As estimated in the 2009-2013 American Community Survey,
12 percent of the total population were 65 years or older in Scotts Valley. In
terms of housing tenure, 26 percent of owner-occupied and 18 percent of renter-
occupied units were headed by occupants 65 years old or older.
While many seniors live in conventional single-family housing, mobile homes
also provide lower cost rental and ownership housing options. According to the
Department of Finance, there were 763 mobile homes in Scotts Valley as of
January 2013. Apartments also provide rental housing for seniors and, for those
earning very low incomes, the Housing Authority provides rental subsidies. For
more specialized care, the City is also home to a large congregate care facility,
Oak Tree Villa, which provides a more supportive living environment for senior
adults. Of the 204 units in this complex, 10 percent have been reserved for low-
income households.
2. Persons with Disabilities
Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to traditionally designed
housing units as well as potentially limit the ability to earn adequate income. As
shown in Chart 2-11, the 2009-2013 American Community Survey estimates
that 5 percent of Scotts Valley’s population age 18 years and older has some
form of disability. In comparison, 33 percent of the City’s population age 65
years and over has one or more disabilities.
                                  2-10

     Although no current comparisons of disability with income or household size are
     available, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial portion of persons with
     disabilities would have annual incomes within Federal Section 8 income limits,
     especially those households not in the labor force. Furthermore, many lower-
     income persons with disabilities are likely to require housing assistance. Their
     housing needs are further compounded by design issues and location
     requirements, which can often be costly. For example, special needs of
     households with wheelchair-bound or semi-ambulatory individuals may require
     ramps, holding bars, special bathroom designs, wider doorways, lower
     cabinets, elevators, and other interior and exterior design features.

     Many persons with disabilities live in an independent fashion in conventional
     housing or with other family members in their homes. To maintain independent
     living, persons with disabilities may need special assistance. Central Coast
     Center for Independent Living in Capitola provides advocacy, workshops,
     disability awareness training, peer support, housing assistance, and
     independent living training. Persons with disabilities can also benefit from
     special housing design features, income support for those unable to work, and
     in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions.
     For persons with disabilities requiring a supportive environment, residential care
     facilities provide another option. Scotts Valley allows State-authorized, certified
     or licensed family day care homes, foster homes, or group homes serving six
     or fewer disabled persons in the community. Scotts Valley currently has two
     such facilities providing approximately 250 beds for the elderly and persons with
     disabilities. As noted earlier, the Oak Tree Apartments reserves 10 percent of
     their units as affordable to lower-income households.
     3. Persons with Developmental Disabilities
     According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a
     “developmental disability” means a disability that originates before an individual
     attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely,
     and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental
     retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
     disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
     require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation,
                                      2-11

but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many persons with developmental disabilities can live and work independently
within a conventional housing environment. Individuals with more severe
developmental disabilities require a group living environment where supervision
is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided.
Because developmental disability exists before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for persons with developmental disabilities is the transition
from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
community based services to approximately 243,000 persons with
developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21
regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based
facilities. The San Andreas Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers
throughout California serving individuals and their families who reside within
Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties. The San
Andreas Regional Center is a community-based, private nonprofit corporation
that is funded by the State of California to serve people with developmental
disabilities. According to information provided by the San Andreas Regional
Center in Watsonville, the Regional Center serves 133 individuals, age 3 to 80
years, diagnosed with a cognitive or developmental disability in the City of
Scotts Valley.
There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a
development disability, including rent subsidized homes, licensed and
unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers,
special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The
design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and
transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the
types of considerations that are important in serving this group. Incorporating
“barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing (as required by California
and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest
range of choices for residents with disabilities. Special consideration should
also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be
living on a fixed income.
4. Large Households and Female-Headed Households
Large households with five or more members comprise a special need group
because of their need for larger units, which are often in limited supply. Female-
headed households, comprised largely of female, single-parents with children,
also have a greater need of child care and affordable housing.
Large families have difficulty finding housing, particularly rental housing.
Difficulties in securing housing are more challenging for renters because multi-
family rental units are typically smaller than single-family ownership units. While
apartment complexes offering two and three bedrooms are common,
                                  2-12

apartments with four or more bedroom units are rare. Additionally, throughout
the region, larger single-family homes, whether to rent or own, are generally not
affordable to the majority of lower income households. To save on living
expenses, lower-income large households often reside in small or too-
expensive units, resulting in overcrowding and overpayment. According to the
2009-2013 American Community Survey, approximately 26 percent of total
households in the City are large households of four or more persons. Of renter-
occupied households, 15 percent are large households. Scotts Valley has a
significant stock of large homes for families and affordable projects (e.g.,
Emerald Hill), but fewer market rate larger apartments that are affordable.
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance
due to their greater need for affordable and accessible day care, health care,
and other supportive services. In particular, many female-headed households
with children are susceptible to having lower incomes than similar two-parent
households. Single, female mothers also face social marginalization pressures
that often limit their occupational choices, housing options and access to
supportive services. The 2009-2013 American Community Survey, estimates
that 11 percent of households in Scotts Valley are female-headed households,
with children under 18 years of age.
5. College Students
College students have special housing needs due to limited income. Many
students who attend community college on a part time basis have full-time
jobs, while full-time students often work less. In the latter case, students
often earn low incomes, and pay more than half their income for housing.
Scotts Valley is located near several colleges; University of California-
Santa Cruz (UCSC) has 16,000 students and Cabrillo College has 17,000
students. Although UCSC provides a substantial number of student units,
UCSC has had to contract with several motels to address the high demand for
housing. With the closure of Bethany College (enrollment of approximately 500
students) in Scotts Valley in 2011, the demand for college student housing has
decreased.
6. Farming, Forestry, and Fishing Jobs
Scotts Valley’s location in the Santa Cruz Mountains and nearby agricultural
setting means that some residents may work in the farming, forestry, and
mining industries. While the 2009-2013 American Community Survey does not
include an estimate of the number of individuals working in the agriculture, forestry,
fishing and hunting, and mining industry, there is a +/- 20 margin of error indicated,
which means that some residents in the City may work in the industry. In Scotts
Valley, these jobs are primarily attributable to mining and forestry work.
Forestry workers are employed by the Department of Forestry/Fire Protection.
Contrary to popular opinion, forestry jobs pay some of the lowest incomes.
This is because the forestry industry hires part-time workers. The federal
government sets wages that are not adequately adjusted for regional and
local differences in the cost-of-living. According to the Employment
                                 2-13

Development Department, the mean wage for farming and forestry industry
ranges from $19,000 for farm workers to approximately $21,000 for forestry
workers. Thus, farming and forestry workers are often in need of subsidized or
affordable housing.
7. Homeless Persons
According to the 2015 Santa Cruz County Homeless Point-in-Time Census &
Survey, 1,964 homeless individuals were counted in Santa Cruz County. Sixty-
nine percent of the homeless population was unsheltered, living on the streets,
in parks, encampments, vehicles, or other places not meant for human
habitation. The remaining 31 percent were sheltered, which includes
emergency shelters and transitional housing. Of the 1,964 homeless individuals
counted, 14 were located in the City of Scotts Valley and were unsheltered.
To meet the estimated homeless needs in the community, the City permits
homeless shelters by-right in the C-S, C-SC, and P zoning districts; and permits
them with a conditional use permit in the I-L zoning district. Currently, there is
over 150 total acres in the C-S zone; approximately 40 total acres in the C-SC
zone; over 170 total acres in the P zone; and approximately 141 acres in the I-
L zone. These zoning districts provide multiple vacant and underutilized
properties with more than sufficient capacity for at least one emergency shelter
to meet the identified homeless need in Scotts Valley. The City identified these
zoning districts because the majority of services are located within these areas,
including retail and commercial, public facilities, and employment areas. These
zoning districts are also located along the City’s main thoroughfares, including
Scotts Valley Drive and Mt. Hermon Road, which is currently served by Santa
Cruz Metropolitan Transit District. Additionally, Transitional and supportive
housing are permitted by-right in all residential zones. The City has one
residential treatment facility for persons recovering from substance abuse. The
sober living environment (SLE), the Evolving Door, provides a clean and sober
home for alcoholics, addicts, and others in recovery.
In North County, Valley Churches United Mission provides emergency food
services. The Homeless Garden Project provides job-training. The Homeless
Community Resource Center offers free meals, bathing, laundry, mail, phone
facilities, referrals, and job counseling. The Shelter Project (TSP) provides
motel vouchers to homeless persons and provides emergency short-term rent
assistance for persons at risk of eviction. St. Phillip the Apostle Episcopal
Church and ReGeneration Church/Calvary Chapel also offer services that focus
on the community’s lower income populations.
8. Extremely Low-Income Households
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development periodically receives
custom tabulations of data from the U.S. Census Bureau that are largely not
available through standard Census products. These data, known as the
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, demonstrate the
extent of housing problems and housing needs, particularly for low-income
households. According to 2007-2011 CHAS data generated for the City there
were approximately 840 very low-income households living in Scotts Valley.
                                  2-14

Very low-income households are those households that earn 50 percent or less
of the median family income (MFI) for the statistical region in which they are
located. Extremely low-income households are those households which earn
less than 30 percent of the MFI. There are approximately 500 extremely low-
income households in Scotts Valley (renters and owners).
There are opportunities to address the housing needs of extremely low-income
households in Scotts Valley through the City’s overall programs for housing
affordability and through development regulations. The City has taken into
account the number of extremely low-income households reported by the CHAS
data available and assumes that their projected need will be approximately 50
percent of the very low income RHNA allocation.
                              2-15

D. Housing Characteristics
                                        Housing characteristics also determine
                                        how the housing stock fits the needs of
                                        residents. This section analyzes housing
                                        characteristics, including the type of
                                        housing units available, the ownership
                                        and vacancy rates, age and condition,
                                        and the price and affordability of housing.
1. Housing Types
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, Scotts Valley had
4,341 housing units. As shown below, the majority of units in Scotts Valley are
single-family detached homes, which increased in number and proportion from
55 percent in 2000 to 59 percent of the housing stock by 2013. Mobile homes
continue to provide a relatively large proportion of the City’s housing at nearly
15 percent. Chart 2-12 provides a summary of key housing characteristics in
Scotts Valley.

     2. Housing Tenure and Vacancies
     During the 2000s, the tenure distribution of housing in the City remained stable
     with 4,307 total occupied housing units. According to the 2009-2013 American
     Community Survey, Scotts Valley had an estimated 4,227 occupied units,
     comprised of 3,229 owner-occupied and 998 renter-occupied households.
     Including vacant units, Scotts Valley has a total of 4,341 housing units. For the
     years 2009-2013, Scotts Valley had a high homeownership rate of over 76
     percent, which is well above the county average of 59 percent. Vacancy rates
     in the City are low, at 3.5 percent for rentals and 1 . 2 percent for ownership
     housing. Chart 2-13 provides a summary of housing tenure in Scotts Valley.

     3. Housing Conditions
     Chart 2-14 shows the age of the housing stock in Scotts Valley. In general,
     housing over 30 years old is usually in need of some rehabilitation, such as a new
     roof, plumbing, paint, etc. As indicated in Chart 2-14, approximately 45 percent
     of Scotts Valley’s housing units were constructed prior to 1980. Typically, units
     that are more than 30 years old, require preventative maintenance to avoid major
     housing deterioration.

The City continues to implement code enforcement activities in Scotts Valley, and
from 2009 through 2014, code enforcement staff responded to 105 residential-
related cases, resulting in an average of 18 cases per year. The City has not
completed an extensive survey of housing conditions in the community. However,
per data from the U.S. Census, the City estimates that units built between 1950-
1960 (approximately 7.8 percent of the City’s housing stock) are in need of minor
rehabilitation, which may include interior and exterior paint job, weather-stripping,
and minor roofing repairs. The City estimates that housing units built prior to 1950
(approximately 1.7 percent of the City’s housing stock) are in need of major
rehabilitation, which may include plumbing and electrical repairs, installing a new
roof, or addressing structural damage.

4. Housing Prices
The 2009-2013 American Community Survey estimates a median housing unit
value of $586,100 in Scotts Valley. The Santa Cruz County Association of
Realtors (SCAOR) reports that the median price of a single-family home
increased slightly between 2009 and 2010 before falling 10 percent in 2011 in
Santa Cruz County. The median sale price of single-family homes increased
slightly in 2012, and then increased nearly 24 percent in 2013. Shown in Chart
2-15 the median sales price for a single-family home in Santa Cruz County was
about $617,500 in 2013. The fluctuations of the median price of homes are due
to the housing crisis and subsequent recovery.

approximately 56 properties for sale in the City. Of the 56 homes (single-family
residences and condominiums/townhouses) for sale, Zillow indicated that 54
percent of the listings had three-bedrooms. One and two-bedroom housing
units accounted for 24 percent of the listings. And four-bedroom and five-
bedroom homes made up approximately 22 percent of the total housing units
for sale. For comparison, Chart 2-16 indicates that three-bedroom housing units
make up 35 percent of the City’s housing stock. Two-bedroom housing units
are 29 percent of the total housing stock and four- or more-bedroom units are
approximately 29 percent of the total housing stock in the City.

 5. Housing Affordability
 Affordability is determined by comparing the cost of housing to the income of
 local households. HUD defines affordable housing costs as contract rents or
 mortgage payments, including taxes and insurance, but not utilities, that are
 equal to or less than 30 percent of the gross income of very low-, low-, and
 moderate-income households.
 Households spending more than 30 percent of gross annual income on housing
 experience a housing cost burden, which occurs when housing costs increase
 faster than household income. When a household spends more than 30
 percent of its income on housing costs, it has less disposable income for other
 necessities such as health care. Lower income households with a burdensome
 housing cost are more likely to become homeless or experience overcrowding.
 Homeowners with a housing cost burden have the option of selling their home
 and becoming renters. Renters, however, are vulnerable and subject to
 constant changes in the housing market.
 According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), 21 percent of
 the homes sold in the Santa Cruz-Watsonville metropolitan area are affordable
 to households with the area’s median family income of $77,900. The U.S.
 Department of Housing and Urban Development periodically receives custom
 tabulations of data from the U.S. Census Bureau that are largely not available
                                 2-20

          through standard Census products. These data, known as the Comprehensive
          Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, demonstrate the extent of housing
          problems and housing needs, particularly for low-income households.
          According to the 2007-2011 CHAS data generated for the City, there were
          approximately 340 very low-income households living in Scotts Valley. Very
          low-income households are those households that earn 50 percent or less of
          the median family income for the statistical region in which they are located.
          Extremely low-income households are those households which earn less than
          30 percent of the median family income. There are approximately 500
          extremely low- income households in Scotts Valley (renters and owners).

          problems for Scotts Valley for various income groups.

          The costs of renting or owning a home can be compared to a household’s ability
          to pay for housing. Housing affordability is defined as paying no more than 30
          percent of household income towards housing costs.
          Chart 2-19 provides a summary of the ability of households to afford a home.
          Based on the housing prices mentioned earlier, except for mobile homes,
          single-family homes are affordable to above-moderate income households and
          condominiums are affordable to moderate income households unless the
          project is highly subsidized.
          Moderate-income residents typically live in multiple-family dwellings, in
          particular apartments, and can afford up to $2,337 in rent. Moderate income
                                        2-21

                    households may also be able to afford older mobile home units. Lower income
                    households have fewer housing choices. Low-income households can afford to
                    pay up to $1,558 per month and very low-income households could only afford
                    up to $974. In practical terms, lower-income households cannot afford an
                    adequately-sized apartment without doubling up.

                    6. Housing Problems
                    The federal government defines “housing problems” as households that pay
                    too much for housing, live in overcrowded housing conditions, or live in
                    homes with physical problems.
                    A continuing priority of all communities in the Santa Cruz area is maintaining,
                    preserving, and enhancing the quality of life. A key measure of quality of life
                    used in Scotts Valley is the prevalence and extent of documented “housing
                    problems,” or housing overcrowding and overpayment. The following text and
                    Chart 2-20 describe housing problems in Scotts Valley.
                    The federal government defines an overcrowded household as one with more
                    than one occupant per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and
                    porches. A severely overcrowded household is defined as a household with
                    more than 1.5 occupants per room. An overcrowded household results from
                    either a lack of affordable housing (which forces more than one household to
                    live together) and/or a lack of available housing units of adequate size.

                 households in Scotts Valley were overcrowded. Of this total approximately 100
                 percent were renter households, representing 3.5 percent of all renter
                 households. In comparison, 6 percent of all households in Santa Cruz County
                 lived in overcrowded homes, with 11 percent of rental properties having
                 overcrowded conditions.
                 State and Federal standards indicate that a household paying more than 30
                 percent of its income for housing is overpaying. Overpayment for housing can
                 cause an imbalance on the remainder of a household’s budget. According to the
                 2009-2013 American Community Survey there were 4,227 occupied housing
                 units, of those households approximately 37 percent were overpaying for
                 housing. Of these overpaying households, 1,116 were households with a
                 mortgage, while the remaining 461 households were renter-occupied units.

                 Housing overpayment continues to be an important issue for Scotts Valley.
                 According to CHAS data summarized in Chart 2-22, housing overpayment
                 affects approximately 70 percent of extremely-low, very-low and low income
                 renters and nearly 50 percent of extremely-low, very-low, low and moderate-
                 income homeowners. Housing overpayment adversely affects the ability of
                 lower income seniors and families to afford housing. Diminished housing
                 affordability also precludes public employees serving the community (e.g.,
                 police and fire personnel, nurses, and teachers) from living in Scotts Valley.

               7. Affordable Housing Opportunities
               Existing housing that receives governmental assistance is often a significant
               source of affordable housing in many communities. Because of its
               significance, State law requires the Housing Element to identify any publicly
               assisted rental housing that receives government subsidies, evaluate the
               potential of these units to lose their affordability between 2015 and 2025, and
               analyze the cost of preserving or replacing these units. Chart 2-23
               summarizes affordable projects in Scotts Valley.
               None of the affordable projects in Scotts Valley is at-risk of converting to
               market rate during the 10-year period of 2015-2025.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS                                                    3
                     State law requires the housing element to analyze potential
                     and actual governmental and non-governmental constraints
                     to housing. This section analyzes market factors that increase
                     housing costs, governmental factors that regulate
                     development, and environmental factors that limit the type
                     and amount of development as well as mitigating actions.
A. Market Constraints
1. Development Costs
Development costs for housing can vary significantly, depending on the type of
housing and amenities. According to local developers, the average cost of
construction in Scotts Valley is $150 per square foot for single-family development
and $135 per square foot for multi-family development. Construction costs are not
anticipated to be higher in Scotts Valley than in other jurisdictions within Santa
Cruz County. The City adopted the latest 2013 version of the California Building
Codes. Scotts Valley also participated in the Silicon Valley Uniform Building Code
Program to standardize building codes, streamline unnecessary technical or time
processes, and eliminate wide variations in local modifications.
Market constraints to the development of residential buildings have become more
prominent as the economy and residential construction industry have slowed
down toward the end of the last decade. Cost of materials, lands costs, lending
policies, and local government fees have all been credited as factors influencing
the cost of construction and the ability of households to purchase new housing.
Land and construction costs, in conjunction with projected rents and sale prices
of housing, affect the feasibility of building market rate and affordable housing.
2. Labor Costs
Similar to the cost of construction materials, labor costs are relatively stable
throughout a metropolitan area and beyond the control of local governments.
Thus, labor costs become a fixed cost in comparison to other more site- specific
costs, such as the cost of land. In 2002, legislation changed this context. SB 975
requires payment of prevailing wages for most private projects built under an
agreement with a public agency providing assistance to the project. Senate Bill
972 provided some relief by exempting a self-help housing project, transitional
housing, and an affordable housing project funded by below-market interest rate.
Scotts Valley’s labor costs are lower than other communities (e.g., Watsonville
and Santa Cruz), which have a local hire or living wage ordinance that raises
wage rates.
                                    3-1

Recent data indicate that construction costs can constitute 43 to 48 percent of the
cost of a single-family detached home. Labor costs are usually two to three times
the cost of materials, representing 17 to 20 percent of the total cost of a new
home. Labor costs are based on a number of factors, including housing demand,
the number of contractors in the area, and union status of workers.
3. Fees and Exactions
To help finance the high costs associated with providing needed public services
and facilities, Scotts Valley charges various development and impact fees.
Infrastructure fees currently required by Scotts Valley include: general facilities
and equipment, law enforcement, library, parks and recreation, storm drainage,
streets and thoroughfares, and wastewater treatment. Scotts Valley Water
District’s water fees and the City’s transportation fees are higher than other
communities due exclusively to the need to provide water infrastructure.
4. Land Costs
Another key component is the price of raw land and any necessary improvements.
Limited supply combined with a high demand keeps land costs relatively high
throughout the Monterey Bay Area. According to prices on Zillow.com and
LandWatch.com in July 2015, land prices in Scotts Valley are $2 to $29 per
square foot for vacant lots zoned for single-family homes. Available land in
commercial districts sells for $23 to $29 per square foot. However, land costs in
Scotts Valley are generally lower than in Santa Cruz and Watsonville and did not
change significantly with the 2008 economic downturn in housing prices. There is
so little land available for development it appears to be holding its value. Chart 3-
1 summarizes land costs, construction costs and fees charged for new
development in Scotts Valley.

5. Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing.
Increases in interest rates decrease the number of persons able to afford a home
purchase. Decreases in interest rates result in more potential homebuyers
introduced into the market.
National policies and economic conditions determine interest rates, and there is
little that local governments can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can,
however, “leverage” funds by offering interest rate write-downs to extend home
purchase opportunities to lower income households. In addition, government
insured loan programs may be available to reduce mortgage down payment
requirements.
First time homebuyers are the most impacted by financing requirements.
Mortgage interest rates for new home purchases ranged from 3.5 percent to 5
percent for a fixed rate, 30-year loan in 2013. Lower initial rates may be available
with Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPMs), Adjustable Rate Mortgages
(ARMs), and Buy-Down Mortgages. However, variable interest rate mortgages on
affordable homes may increase to the point that interest rates exceed the cost of
living adjustments, which is a constraint on affordability. Although interest rates
are currently considered low, they can change significantly and substantially
impact the affordability of the housing stock.
Stricter lending standards can pose a constraint to affordable housing. An
increase in one percentage point can make a monthly payment out of reach for
many lower income households.
A more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of
the housing stock and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment
requirements. Typically, conventional home loans will require 80 percent loan-to-
value and represents the largest constraint to homebuyers. Other programs, such
as those for first-time homebuyers, can find down payment requirements between
5 and 20 percent. However, more recent events in the housing market have made
it more difficult for prospective home buyers to secure a home loan.
One of the greatest impediments to homeownership, however, is credit
worthiness. According to the Federal Housing Authority, lenders consider a
person’s debt-to-income ratio, cash available for down payment, and credit
history, when determining a maximum loan amount. Many financial institutions
are willing to significantly decrease down payment requirements and increase
loan amounts to persons with good credit rating. Persons with poor credit ratings
may be forced to accept a higher interest rate or a loan amount insufficient to
purchase a house. Poor credit rating can be especially damaging to lower-income
residents, who have fewer financial resources with which to qualify for a loan. The
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is generally more flexible than
conventional lenders in its qualifying guidelines and allows many residents to re-
establish a good credit history.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are
required to report lending activity by census tract. Chart 3-2 below presents the
disposition of home purchase loan applications in 2013 by income of the
applicants.

The data shown in Chart 3-2 is for the Santa Cruz – Watsonville MSA, which
includes the City of Scotts Valley. The data includes purchases of one to four
unit homes and manufactured homes. Over 80 percent of the loan applications
were received from middle to upper income households based on median family
income (MFI) standards.

    B. Governmental Constraints
 Local policies and regulations can affect the price and availability of housing
 and in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls,
 development regulations, permit processing procedures, building codes, and
 various other issues may affect the maintenance, development and
 improvement of housing in Scotts Valley. This section discusses potential
 governmental constraints in Scotts Valley and efforts to address them.
 1. Land Use Controls
 Scotts Valley’s General Plan sets forth policies for guiding local development.
 These policies, together with zoning regulations, designate the amount of land
 for different uses in the City. The City’s land use plan is intended to protect the
 environmental features that distinguish the character of Scotts Valley and
 develop the urban core near major transportation corridors. Chart 3-3 describes
 General Land Use designations that allow housing.

                  2. Provisions for a Variety of Housing
                  Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites
                  that will be made available, through appropriate zoning and development
                  standards, to encourage the development of various types of housing for all
                  economic and social segments. Chart 3-4 summarizes housing permitted in
                  Scotts Valley’s residential, commercial, and institutional zones. Residential
                  uses are designated as permitted by right (P) or conditionally permitted (C).

                  Conventional Residential
                  The City allows single- and multi-family residential units at a variety of densities,
                  including apartments, townhomes, and condominiums. In 2003, the City’s Zoning
                  Code was amended to comply with State law, and included revisions to permit
                  secondary dwelling units in all residential zones provided that development is
                  consistent with standards per State law.
                  Mixed Residential-Commercial Use
                  The General Plan and Zoning Code were revised in 2007 to allow mixed
                  residential and commercial uses in the C-S and C-SC zone as a permitted use on
                  sites listed in the 2002-2007 Housing Element with a density of 15 – 20 units per
                  acre. The multi-family dwelling units should be located either above the ground-
                  level commercial use or at ground level at the rear of the commercial space.
                  Although the Zoning Code specifies minimum development standards, in
                  particular lot size, coverage, and height for all uses, it does not indicate desired
                  design aspects or specific standards tailored to mixed-use projects. The Housing
                  Plan will provide guidance for mixed-use projects.
                  Housing for People with Disabilities
                  The Community Care Facilities Act requires that community care facilities serving
                  six or fewer persons be permitted by right in all residential zones and that facilities
                  cannot be subject to requirements that are more stringent than those imposed on
                  single-family residences in the same district. The City’s Zoning Code was
                  changed to be consistent with state law in 2007.
                  Housing for People who are Homeless
                  Housing element law requires that jurisdictions designate a zone in which
                  emergency shelters are permitted as a matter of right. Additionally, Senate Bill 2
                  (SB 2) also requires local jurisdictions to consider transitional and supportive
                  housing as a residential use, only subject to those restrictions that apply to other
                  residential uses of the same type in the same zoning district. The City’s Zoning
                  Code allows emergency shelters in the C-S and C- SC zones (both of which are
                  along major service and transit corridors) as well as the P and I-L zones. The
                  Zoning Code allows transitional and supportive housing as a matter of right in all
                  residential zoning districts.
                  Housing for Students
                  Student housing, such as dormitories or college apartments, is considered an
                  institutional facility and is conditionally permitted in the P zoning district. Formerly,
                  the City was home to Bethany College, which enrolled approximately 500 full-time
                  students. However, Bethany College closed in 2011 and there are no other similar
                  institutional facilities located in the City which have a demand for student housing.

                   3. Development Standards
                   The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential
                   development primarily through the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations are designed
                   to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well
                   as implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Code also helps
                   preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods. Charts 3-5, 3-6, and 3-7
                   details the City’s development standards in residential zones.

      Development Standards
      The City’s lot coverage standards in higher density zones (C-SC, C-S, and R-H)
      ranges from 45 percent to 55 percent, which is higher than in Watsonville (50
      percent) but less than in Santa Cruz (70 percent). The City’s maximum building
      height of 35 feet is comparable to other cities, except that it is lower than in the
      City of Santa Cruz. The City’s parking standard of two spaces per dwelling unit is
      equivalent to Watsonville but slightly higher than in Santa Cruz. However, in
      commercial zones, the City’s lot coverage and density requirements are generally
      lower when compared to nearby cities.
      Density Standards
      Density is often equated with housing affordability in that lower land costs can
      result in lower development costs and housing prices. The City has created a very
      high density residential zone that allows 15.1 to 20 units per gross acre by right,
      which will satisfy the prerequisite density necessary to facilitate quality affordable
      housing.
      Minimum Lot Sizes
      Minimum lot sizes are important because they allow for a certain threshold of units
      to meet economies of scale, grant funding requirements, and provide on-site
      management. Scotts Valley’s minimum lot sizes do not constrain the production
      of affordable housing. The minimum lot size for lots that could accommodate
      affordable housing ranges from 3,000 to 10,000 square feet in size. Sites chosen
      for potential affordable housing, as discussed in Chapter 4, exceed these
      standards and are actually one to three acres in size, which are sufficient to
      facilitate affordable housing.
                                                     3-9

4. Development Review Process
The City requires different levels of review for housing projects depending on the
type of project and size. These reviews are designed to ensure that the proposed
project meets applicable City and State regulations. The development review
process is described below and shown in Chart 3-8.
City Staff Review
For conventional single-family homes on existing lots of record, City staff will
approve the project over-the-counter unless the development requires an
exception or modification. The scope of review is primarily to ensure that
applicable local, state and federal regulations are met. No design review is
required unless the development proposes grading on slopes exceeding 30
percent grade. Depending on the location, size, and type of new development,
additional reviews may be required as described below.
Design Review
Residential neighborhoods situated among hillsides and in steeply sloped areas
and multi-family projects require a noticed public hearing and design review.
Projects are reviewed by the Planning Commission. To facilitate quality projects
and timely approval, the City provides design review guidelines that illustrate
preferred construction techniques with objective guidelines. These guidelines
reduce the uncertainty, time, and costs and thus facilitate timely review and
approval of projects.
Conditional Use
Conditional use permits are required for residential care facilities which have more
than 6 residents, large family day care homes, congregate senior housing,
condominiums and mixed-use projects in specific zoning districts. The Planning
Commission may grant the permit when the proposed use is in accordance with
the General Plan and the Zoning Code and appropriate conditions are met.
                                  3-10
Cultural Resource Review
Scotts Valley’s location adjacent to perennial streams and on an ancient seabed
contributes to a wealth of historical, archaeological and paleontological resources.
The General Plan designates areas as moderate or high cultural resource
sensitivity zones. In these areas, development proposals must have appropriate
environmental clearance, which is reviewed by the City’s Cultural Resource
Commission. The Commission’s procedures and scope of authority is set by
Municipal Code, Section 17.44.
Historically, reviews were conducted by the Design Review Board, the Planning
Commission, and Cultural Resource Commission – each staffed by different
members. In 1996, the City consolidated and streamlined development review.
The Planning Commission replaced the Design Review Board and staff
developed design guidelines to help developers and policy- makers address
design issues. The Planning Commission also appointed two ad-hoc members
with expertise in archaeology and historical resources to assist in reviewing
projects for potential impacts on cultural resources. These steps allow project
review in their entirety on one evening.

5. Building Codes and Site Improvements
Building codes and site improvements affect the cost of housing. Every three
years, the State adopts new codes that contain the latest advances in
construction practices and engineering concepts. The California Building
Standards Commission adopted the California Building Codes in 2013, largely
based upon “model” codes produced by professional organizations. Local
agencies are required to adopt these codes, but may amend them to address
local geological, climatic, or topographical conditions provided the modifications
are no less restrictive than the state standards.
Scotts Valley participated in the Silicon Valley Uniform Code Program, a historical
effort spearheaded by the Joint Venture, Silicon Valley Network. Through an
unprecedented cooperative effort, 27 cities and two counties agreed on a
standardized building code, reducing over 400 different local amendments to the
state building code to only 11 amendments needed to address particular local
conditions. Most of the amendments address seismic design or construction
issues not addressed in the adopted State codes, because the City is located in
one of the most active seismic zones.
The City of Scotts Valley’s on-site and off-site improvements for residential
development are modest compared to standards in other Santa Cruz jurisdictions.
For instance, local streets are required to have at least a 24-foot right-of-way. If
parking is desired on any one street side, the City requires an additional six feet
of right of way plus an additional four feet for sidewalks. The City does not require
street trees, parkways, or landscaped medians, but does require the developer to
install street lights, but only at intersections. Lastly, the Fire District requires
developers to install fire hydrants.
6. Analysis of Housing for Persons with Disabilities
California law requires localities to analyze potential and actual constraints upon
housing for persons with disabilities, demonstrate efforts to remove government
constraints, and include programs to accommodate housing designed for persons
with disabilities. As part of the Housing Element process, the Zoning Code,
Municipal Code, permitting procedures, development standards, and building
codes were analyzed to identify potential impediments. The following summarizes
findings from this analysis.
With respect to land uses, State and federal housing laws encourage an inclusive
environment, where persons of all walks of life have the opportunity to find
housing suited to their needs. As such, State law has pre-empted local
governments from regulating the siting of group homes, child care facilities,
secondary dwelling units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. Although
the City conditionally allows large residential care facilities in all zones (with
hearing only by the Planning Commission), a thorough review of City practices
revealed the need to update the Zoning Code to comply with State law affecting
special needs housing. The City’s Zoning Ordinance currently permits small
residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons by-right in all residential
zones. The City also updated family day care home provisions to reflect State law
with respect to number of occupants, fencing requirements, and other factors. To
meet the requirements of State law, the City has amended the Zoning Ordinance
to permit transitional and supportive housing as a matter of right in all residential
                                   3-12

zoning districts.
For new construction, the City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations, which regulates the access and adaptability of buildings to
accommodate persons with disabilities. The City’s building code requires
compliance with the 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act, which requires a
minimum percentage of dwelling units in new developments to be fully accessible
to residents with disabilities. The City does not require accessibility or visibility
standards beyond state and federal law but established an ADA Advisory
Committee to work on making new residential development accessible.
Per state law, cities must develop reasonable accommodation procedures to
provide relief to Code regulations and permitting procedures that have a
discriminatory effect on housing for individuals with disabilities. The City has
amended the Zoning Code to incorporate a Reasonable Accommodation
Ordinance that conforms to State requirements. The process for reasonable
accommodation includes submittal of an application form to the City’s Planning
Department, an administrative review by City staff, and a decision within 30 days
after the application is submitted. An application for a reasonable accommodation
is granted if all of the following findings are made:
        1. The housing or housing related facilities will be used by an individual
           with a disability under the Acts;
        2. The requested accommodation is necessary to make specific housing
           available to an individual with a disability under the Act;
        3. The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial
           or administrative burden on the city; and
        4. The requested accommodation does not negatively affect the
           character of the zoning district and intent of adopted city, policies,
           regulations, programs or laws.
                                     3-13

  C. Environmental/Infrastructure Constraints
Scotts Valley has environmental issues that affect the development of housing.
These include geology, topography, sensitive habitats, plants and animals, and
cultural resources. These factors affect the location and scale of new
development. Adequacy of water, sewer, and roads must also be considered.
This section discusses potential environmental constraints in Scotts Valley,
summarized in Chart 3-9.
1. Environmental Concerns
The majority of undeveloped land in Scotts
Valley is inside the City’s urbanized areas and
must accommodate a variety of natural
hazards and environmental constraints that
impact housing project costs. The following
describes the most pertinent hazards and how
they are addressed. The General Plan EIR
and environmental clearance for the Housing Element provides greater detail on
each of these issues.
Seismic Hazards
Scotts Valley is next to four major active or potentially active fault zones: San
Andreas, Zayante, Butano, and Ben Lomond. The Zayante Fault Zone is located
approximately 1.5 miles north of the City of Scotts Valley, and is the closest major
fault to the City. The Zayante Fault is tied to the San Andreas Fault system and
capable of producing earthquakes of magnitude 7.4 on the Richter scale. The
Butano Fault Zone is located approximately four miles to the north and is capable
of producing major earthquakes of magnitude 6.4 on the Richter Scale.
Earthquakes and accompanying ground shaking are considerable hazards for
housing, because much of the present development has taken place on alluvium
soils. Alluvium is highly responsive to ground shaking. The alluvial deposits of the
area have a moderately low potential for liquefaction except for the younger
alluvium found predominately along creeks and other water courses; these have
moderate potential for liquefaction.
Ground shaking is likely to cause landslides on slopes of 15 percent or greater as
well as liquefaction in areas with shallow ground water. In 1989, the 7.1 Richter
Loma Prieta Earthquake damaged more than 500 structures. The City now
requires detailed engineering and geologic studies when new development is
proposed in areas subject to earthquake hazards. Development is prohibited on
slopes in excess of 40 percent grade.
Flood Hazards
Scotts Valley is principally drained by Carbonera Creek, which runs through the
community parallel to State Highway 17. The creek has two major tributaries in
Scotts Valley. Camp Evers Creek runs south of Mt. Hermon Road; the West
Branch of Carbonera Creek runs east of Glenwood Drive. The Scotts Valley area
is subject to flooding, with the most recent flooding occurring in January 1982,
                                  3-14

particularly along Carbonera Creek and its tributaries. To reduce potential
hazards, the City’s floodplain management ordinance requires flood proofing or
elevation of structures above flood heights in federally-designated flood plains.
The City regulates development in flood hazard areas in accordance with the
ordinance.
Fire Hazards
Scotts Valley is surrounded by forests; much of it is heavily wooded and contains
steep slopes. Residential development is centered around Scotts Valley Drive,
but a significant amount is situated in heavily forested areas. Fire hazards have
a greater potential in hillside developments, where roads have minimal widths
and many have dead ends. Despite this unique setting, structural fires have been
more common than forest fires. To minimize potential fire dangers, the City’s
Safety Element sets forth policies to ensure adequate water flow and road width
requirements to meet fire-fighting needs. The Safety Element also sets forth an
approach to reduce fire hazards in the design and location of development in the
hillsides.
Slopes and Topography
Scotts Valley is a hillside community; most uplands have slopes exceeding 40
percent grade that are unsuitable for development. Limited areas of moderately
steep slopes (25 percent to 40 percent) exist within the City and could be
developed under certain circumstances. Hillside development is regulated as part
of the “HR Hillside Residential Combining District.” For instance, developers must
typically submit soils and geology reports for lots in excess of 25 percent grade,
topographic and grading information, and site plans. Developments must also
conform to hillside regulations and no new lots with an average slope exceeding
40 percent are permitted. Lastly, the City has policies in place to protect scenic
corridors and view sheds.
Sensitive Species and Habitats
The City’s riparian woodland along rivers and Ponderosa Pines provides habitat
for rare and endangered plant species. Scotts Valley is also home to a unique soil
type called “Zayante Soil” and the Carbonera Creek, which is a habitat for
steelhead trout. In Scotts Valley, 20 to 50 locally rare plant species exist and are
concentrated in the Santa Margarita sand deposits, marshy habitats, grassland
areas, and others. Five examples of rare and endangered species are present.
The City is also a potential habitat for the Mt. Hermon June Beetle and the Ohlone
Tiger Beetle, listed as Endangered Species by the Federal Government. The City
requires development proposals in sensitive areas to provide biotic surveys and
Habitat Conservation Plans to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species
Acts.
                                   3-15

  Cultural Resources
  Scotts Valley’s location adjacent to perennial streams and on an ancient seabed
  has contributed to a wealth of archaeological and paleontological resources in the
  community today. Additional sites, some of which are included in the land
  inventory, are known to have contained tools and other implements from Native
  Americans. Finally, fossils are also known to exist in the community. In Scotts
  Valley, the General Plan designates areas that have or are known to have cultural
  resources as moderate or high cultural sensitivity zones. In these areas,
  development proposals must have appropriate environmental clearance pursuant
  to state and federal laws.
  Groundwater Recharge
  Scotts Valley derives water entirely from aquifers so groundwater recharge is
  critical. Scotts Valley lies wholly within the San Lorenzo River watershed. Scotts
  Valley depends solely on groundwater, so development activity over the past
  several decades has raised significant concerns over groundwater recharge. To
  ensure that groundwater can be replenished with rainfall, the General Plan
  designates most of the city in a High Protection Recharge or High Management
  Recharge Zone. In these areas, the Municipal Code requires all new housing
  projects to incorporate storm water detention to mitigate concerns over
  groundwater recharge.

2. Water Services
The Scotts Valley Water District (SVWD) relies on groundwater sources from
the regional Santa Margarita Basin. The SVWD provides the majority of water
to the city through six production wells. Wells 3A and 7B serve the SVWD’s
Orchard Run Treatment Plant (located north of the Polo Ranch site) and
pump water primarily from the Butano Formation. Wells 11A and 11B serve
the El Pueblo Water Treatment Plant (located in the central area of town) and
pump water solely from the Lompico Formation. Wells 9 and 10A (located in
the Camp Evers area the south end of town) pump water from the Santa
Margarita, Monterey, and Lompico Formations. Potable water is distributed
through 55 miles of mains, seven storage tanks, and nine booster pump
stations.
In 2010, the SVWD prepared a Revised Urban Water Management Plan
(UWMP) to govern its long-range water plans. This plan concluded that water
could meet growth in the SVWD service area projected by AMBAG. The plan
indicated the following: increase of 632 customers from 3,898 in 2010 to
4,530 customers in 2015; increase to 4,619 customers by 2020; increase to
4,684 customers by 2025; increase to 4,800 customers by 2030; and increase
to 4,896 by 2035. The SVWD’s UWMP will be updated in 2020.
Like many areas in Santa Cruz County, Scotts Valley is faced with water
supply challenges. To assure a reliable water supply, the SVWD has
implemented many water management measures over the past decade.
These measures include the construction of a Water Recycling Facility
Project (a million-gallon storage facility), and collection of water impact fees
for funding additional water development projects. The SVWD joined the
California Urban Water Conservation Council in 2005, formalizing its
commitment to implementing water conservation best management
practices.
In 2006, the SVWD completed a Groundwater Modeling Study, which
documented the long-term loss of groundwater in storage due to well
pumping by the SVWD and others in excess of natural recharge. This study
also documented that the current level of groundwater in storage can be
maintained or increased by expanding the Water Recycling Project,
constructing one or more new municipal supply wells to better distribute the
location of well pumping across aquifer systems, enhancing water
conservation programs, and implementing water management measures.
Scotts Valley was the first recycled water system in Santa Cruz County. The
recycled water is produced in a tertiary treatment plant operated by the City’s
Wastewater Treatment staff. The treated water is then distributed by the
SVWD through a dedicated system consisting of 5.5 miles of mains, one
625,000-gallon storage tank, and two booster stations. The project affords a
mechanism to accommodate finite growth without further impact on
groundwater storage levels. The tertiary water-filter system has the capacity
to treat up to 1 mgd of effluent at a level that allows for the direct irrigation at
City parks, schools, and commercial and residential landscaping increased
from 19 acre feet in 2003 to 161 acre feet in 2008. Further project expansion
occurred in 2009 - 2010 as the SVWD constructed three new recycled main
                                3-18

extensions with $705,000 in state grant funding as part of the Northern Santa
Cruz County Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP). SVWD
anticipates submitting future grant proposals to fund additional extensions of
recycled water pipelines into other key areas within the SVWD service area.
Funding for this construction will be sought through Supplemental Proposition
50 and Proposition 84 solicitations under the IRWMP. Through the
continuous efforts to expand the district’s Recycled Water Program, SWVD
anticipates to increase recycled water delivery from 149 AFY in 2010 to 330
AFY by 2030.
The SVWD is planning to construct two new deep municipal supply wells to
shift a portion of its pumping from the Lompico to the Butano aquifer. The
2006 Groundwater Modeling Study shows this management measure would
help offset current impacts on groundwater storage. In 2008 the District was
awarded a $250,000 grant from the Department of Water Resources for a
Butano test well project. In 2010, efforts were focused on planning for the
installation of the deep monitoring wells in the Butano, which provided
important data for evaluating the potential for siting a production well in the
Butano. However, no specific production well location has been identified.
Additional possible well site locations have been investigated at the Green
Valley Site and the Well 9 Site.
Rehabilitation of old wells and construction of new wells are needed to
replace lost capacity and are part of SVWD’s capital improvement program
and maintenance budgeting. Although the need for an additional well has
been reduced as a result of decreasing water demand which has resulted in
lower groundwater production, ongoing evaluations are occurring to identify
the most viable location for the installation of a new groundwater production
well. One method to help mitigate potential future service disruptions is to
have additional redundancy in the system so that SVWD can continue to meet
water demand, even in high-demand periods, with at least one high-capacity
well offline. Therefore, the installation of a new groundwater production well
is considered a prudent step to maintain system reliability. The construction
of a new well will most likely increase supply capacity and accommodate
anticipated growth, although the main purpose is to redistribute pumping and
increase the reliability of supply.
According to the SVWD’s 2010 UWMP, although there have been significant
years of drought, the overall storage in the basin is apparently sufficient to
provide adequate resources for the SVWD given the past, current, and
anticipated future demand. The long-term adequacy of the supply will rely on
improving direct and in-lieu recharge, and reduction in groundwater pumping
through improved water use efficiency, and recycled water production.
Additionally, the SVWD will not deny or condition approval of water services,
or reduce the amount of services applied for by a proposed development that
includes housing units affordable to lower income households.
3. Wastewater Capacity and Treatment
Scotts Valley owns and operates a municipal wastewater treatment plant,
seven lift stations, and approximately 40 miles of pipeline. The Scotts Valley
Wastewater Recycling Facility (WRF) is owned and operated by the City of
                                 3-19

Scotts Valley to provide residents with efficient, reliable wastewater treatment
services and high-quality recycled water for landscape irrigation and other
potential beneficial uses. The WRF has the capacity to treat 1.5 million
gallons per day (mgd), enough to see the City through planned build-out.
Thus, the City’s wastewater treatment plant has adequate capacity to
accommodate future development anticipated by the Housing Element in
Scotts Valley.
4. Energy Conservation
Recent events underscore the importance of energy conservation to reduce
the overall life cycle costs of housing and also housing affordability. Despite
recent stabilization of the energy crisis, the state’s electrical system continues
to be vulnerable to increasing electricity demand, generation supply
shortages, transmission constraints, and high wholesale electricity costs
caused by an unstable market.
The Warren-Alquist Act requires that all new buildings in California must meet
energy efficiency standards codified in Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code
of Regulations. All new residential construction must comply with the
standards in effect on the date a building permit application is made. The
California Energy Commission adopted new standards as mandated by the
California Energy and Reliability Act of 2000, which were incorporated into
model building codes adopted by each local agency.
Scotts Valley enforces Title 24 to ensure that new residential construction
incorporates the latest in energy efficient technologies. Under Title 24,
developers can comply with such regulations by either: 1) adopting a
prescriptive package whereby each component of the proposed building must
meet a prescribed minimum energy requirement; or 2) adopting a
performance method which evaluates the building as a whole to determine
whether energy conservation targets are achievable. In addition, both
approaches require certain mandatory energy conservation technologies.
In 2007 the City adopted a Green Building ordinance to encourage the
development of energy efficient residential units. In 2008 the City adopted the
Town Center Specific Plan which will guide the development of 254 remaining
new residential units in the City (46 units have been constructed in Town
Center Collection). This plan requires that the units be designed to reduce
their energy demand by at least 10 percent.

                                   preservation of housing in Scotts Valley. This
                                   includes an evaluation of the City’s regional
                                   housing need, availability of land for new
                                   housing, the availability of financial resources
                                   to support housing activities, and the
                                   availability of administrative resources to assist
                                   the City in implementing housing programs.
A. Regional Housing Needs
1. Regional Housing Needs
State law requires each jurisdiction when preparing its State-mandated Housing
Element, to develop housing programs to meet its “fair share” of housing needs
for all income groups. This “fair share” concept seeks to ensure that each
jurisdiction, to the extent feasible and appropriate, provides housing for its
resident population, and those households who might reasonably be expected to
reside within the jurisdiction, with a variety of housing accommodations
appropriate to their needs.
Senate Bill (SB) 375, passed into law in 2008, requires the coordination of housing
planning with regional transportation planning through the region’s Regional
Transportation Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy (MTP/SCS). This in effect
entails consistency in growth forecasts for land use, housing, and transportation
purposes. SB 375 requires that the RHNA and MTP/SCS process be undertaken
together in order to integrate housing, land use, and transportation planning to
ensure that the state’s housing goals are met. Prior to SB 375, RHNA was
updated every five years and the MTP was updated every four years. Because
SB 375 requires better coordination between transportation planning with land
use and housing planning, the RHNA process is now tied to the adoption of every
two cycles of the regional MTP/SCS. As a result, each local jurisdiction is required
to update its housing element every eight years instead of every five years.
The regional fair share determination process begins with the State Department
of Finance’s population projections for the State of California and the many
regions throughout the state. The State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) use these projections to determine the amount and
composition of housing need in different regions of California. The region’s
housing need projections are determined in consultation with the Council of
Governments, which are designated public agencies which address regional
planning in each region of the State.
Once the regional housing need for Santa Cruz County and Monterey County is
determined, the Council of Governments allocates a share of the region’s housing
                                  4-1

need to each jurisdiction. In the Monterey County and Santa Cruz County area,
the agency responsible for assigning “fair share” housing targets to each
community is the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG).
Local jurisdictions are then required, as part of the Housing Element process, to
develop local programs to accommodate their share of housing need.
Based upon Statewide population projections, HCD determined that 10,430
housing units would address the region’s housing needs for the 2015-2023
planning period due to population and employment growth.
Once basic housing need is calculated for the region, AMBAG is required to
allocate the region’s total to each community within the AMBAG region. In doing
so, AMBAG must take into account various planning factors. These factors were
used as justification for reductions or increases to the baseline distribution based
on AMBAG’s adopted methodology. According to Section 65584 of the
Government Code, these considerations are:
     Existing and projected jobs and housing relationship;
     Opportunities and constraints to development of additional housing;
     Distribution of household growth assumed for a comparable period in the
      regional transportation plan and opportunities to maximize the use of public
      transportation and existing transportation infrastructure;
     Market demand for housing;
     Agreements between counties and cities to direct growth toward
      incorporated areas;
     Loss of units contained in assisted housing developments;
     High housing cost burdens;
     Housing needs of farmworkers;
     Housing needs generated by the presence of a private university or a campus
      of the of the California State University or the University of California; and
     Any other factors, as determined by AMBAG.
The RHNA methodology was approved by the Board of Directors and reviewed
by the Planning Directors Forum. The adopted RHNA methodology distributes the
regional figure on a jurisdiction’s proportional share of housing and jobs.
2. Scotts Valley’s Housing Need
Once the region’s housing need was allocated to Santa Cruz and Monterey
counties, each jurisdiction was allocated a share of the County’s need. To make
this allocation, AMBAG determined the amount of household growth projected for
each jurisdiction. The ratio of a jurisdiction’s household growth versus the
County’s projected household growth was then applied to the County’s total
housing need.
State law requires that AMBAG allocate housing unit goals in such a manner as
to avoid and reduce the disproportionate concentration of lower income
households in any one jurisdiction. To that end, AMBAG compared the existing
household income distribution of each jurisdiction to the County, based on the
assumption that all cities should eventually provide the same affordability levels
of housing.

              The City is required to facilitate and encourage the production of new housing
              affordable to various household income levels. A survey of online rental listings
              conducted in July 2015 indicate that in Scotts Valley apartments rent
              between$850 to $1,350 for a one-bedroom unit, $1,200 to $2,010 for a two-
              bedroom unit, and $1,660 to $2,850 for a three-bedroom unit. According to
              Zillow’s Rental Index through July 2015, the average rent list price in the County
              of Santa Cruz is $2.08 per square feet. A 400-square foot secondary dwelling unit
              can therefore rent for approximately $832 per month, which may be affordable to
              lower income households.
              3. Housing Production
              During the time frame of 2009 to 2015, a total of 201 new housing units have been
              built in Scotts Valley as shown on Chart 4-2.

Woodside (formally the Old Quarry Site)
In January 2011, the City approved a mixed-use development with approximately
16,500 square feet of commercial space along the street frontage and 49 small
lots for detached single-family houses. Since 2014, 49 total housing units have
been built on the project site. Of the total housing units, one unit is affordable to
low-income households and six units are affordable to moderate-income
households.
                                   4-4
 B. Housing Opportunity Sites
This section analyzes the remaining housing need and where the City will
designate sites that will have zoning and development standards, infrastructure
and public facilities in place to accommodate the construction of new housing
during the planning period.
 1. Housing Sites Planned for Residential Uses
Based on the City’s land inventory, the City Council has proposed the following
sites to meet the remainder of the 2015-2023 RHNA. Chart 4-4 lists each site,
the Assessor’s parcel number, acreage, density assumption, and affordability
level.
Each site has specific lot sizes, general plan land use and zoning designations,
allowable density, and other attributes. The site criteria and ability to facilitate and
encourage the construction of affordable housing are outlined below:
        Above-Moderate income. Residential sites which allow for single-family
         homes (e.g., such as R-R, R-1, etc.) are considered affordable to above-
         moderate income housing based on earlier sales prices.
        Moderate income. Sites smaller than 1.5 acres, zoned for high density (9
         to 15 units/acre), typically could have apartments that would facilitate
         moderate-income housing or sites with confirmed affordability restrictions.
        Lower income. Sites 1.5 acres and larger, either individually or through
         consolidation, with a land use designation allowing up to 20 units per acre,
         or sites with confirmed affordability restrictions.
Town Center Specific Plan
The City of Scotts Valley approved a specific plan and programmatic
Environmental Impact Report for the development of a town center on
approximately 15 acres along Mt. Hermon Road which was previously the old
Skypark Airport. The Programmatic Environmental Impact Report and Specific
Plan anticipate a total of 300 new housing units within the Specific Plan area.
Forty-six of the units of the Town Center have been constructed, including 5
affordable units, with an additional 254 new housing units planned. When
completed, the Town Center will have 100 stand-alone housing units and 200
units will be part of the mixed-use development in the Town Center core area.
This project falls within the City’s Inclusionary Housing Program, in which each
new housing project over six units must generate affordable housing units. Under
the program, each new housing development must include 15 percent of the units
as affordable housing units. The Town Center will accommodate 45 lower income
units, five of which have been constructed.
In addition to the 15 percent required affordable units, the nature of the housing
in the mixed use core of the Town Center should result in additional affordable
housing opportunities being provided.
                                    4-5

Secondary Dwelling Units
The City has facilitated the development of secondary dwelling units over the
planning period by the following: 1) reducing development standards; and 2)
permitting them by right. Since 2009, the City has approved four secondary
dwelling units in the community. The City also updated its secondary dwelling unit
ordinance for consistency with California Government Code Section 65852.2,
which requires local governments with a local second-unit ordinance to
ministerially consider second-unit applications. According to rental index
published by Zillow.com, the average rental price per square foot in Santa Cruz
County is $2.08. Assuming a 400-square foot secondary dwelling unit, the
average rental price for a second unit in Scotts Valley would be $832 per month.
Secondary dwelling units are anticipated to be affordable to lower income
households.
Gateway South Specific Plan
The Gateway South Specific Plan is an adopted plan for the area located at the
southern main entrance to the City at Highway 17 and Mt. Hermon Road. Specific
Plan policies encourage a range of housing types and development
configurations. This Specific Plan area is occupied by a new 180-room hotel, 41
apartments (including nine affordable units), and 20 townhomes. The Plan
anticipates 136 total units with a minimum of 21 affordable units.
Scotts Valley Drive, North of Dunslee
Two other sites along Scotts Valley Drive were selected for new housing. North
of Dunslee, this 9.5-acre vacant site slopes up to the west, and is a candidate for
a density transfer. Of the 9.5 acres, two acres are considered developable –one
acre is zoned C-S and one acre is zoned R-R. The site has been rezoned C-S
and allows up to 20 units per acre, yielding 40 units for this site.
Scotts Valley Drive, North of Mt. Hermon
Additional sites for housing are available along Scotts Valley Drive. North of the
Shell station on the east side of Scotts Valley Drive are four vacant parcels
totaling 4.19 acres, of which 2.8 acres are developable. These four sites are all
contiguous to one another and the City is actively encouraging their consolidation
to provide the preconditions for a quality residential product. The sites were
rezoned to R-M in 2007. Together, this site could yield 33 housing units.
Oak Creek Park (formerly Glen Canyon)
The City has identified 3.6 acres at the corner of Glen Canyon/Mt. Hermon Road
and rezoned the property to C-S with high density residential permitted as part of
a mixed use project. This particular site was previously approved for office
buildings, which are no longer desired. The site is vacant and located between
Oak Creek Boulevard and the Shell Gas Station and backs up to residential uses.
There are no environmental or topographical constraints. This site could yield an
estimated total of 10 dwelling units.
Chart 4-3 summarizes these sites and their credit toward the 2015-2023 Regional
Housing Needs Allocation. Taken together, these sites accommodate 79 lower
income units, 77 moderate income units, and 333 above moderate-income units,
meeting the City’s entire RHNA need for the planning period.

             C. Resources for Addressing Housing Needs
             The City of Scotts Valley has access to a variety of existing and potential funding
             sources available for affordable housing activities. They include programs from
             local, state, federal and private resources. In addition, various public and nonprofit
             agencies are available to assist the City in implementing its housing policies and
             programs.
             In previous years, the primary source of funds for affordable housing activities in
             Scotts Valley was the Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside fund. On
             December 29, 2011, the California Supreme Court ruled to uphold ABx1 26, which
             dissolved all redevelopment agencies (RDAs) in the State. A companion bill,
             ABx1 27, which would have allowed the RDAs to continue to exist, was declared
             invalid by the court. The court’s decision required that all RDAs within California
             be eliminated no later than February 1, 2012. The City of Scotts Valley
             Redevelopment Agency was dissolved as of February 1, 2012 and the City of
             Scotts Valley was selected to be the Successor Agency responsible for all
             enforceable obligations owed.
             1. Financing Resources
             Chart 4-5 lists the potential funding sources that are available for housing activities.
             They are divided into five categories: federal, State, county, local, and private
             resources.

                                HOUSING PLAN
                                         Providing housing that fulfills the diverse
                                         needs of Scotts Valley is a fundamental
                                         priority. This section is the City’s
                                         Housing Plan to achieve that goal. The
                                         goals and policies contained in this
                                         chapter     address Scotts Valley’s
                                         identified housing needs, which are
                                         implemented by a series of housing
                                         programs. Housing programs include
                                         current City efforts and new initiatives
  that address the City’s unmet housing needs. This section provides the goals
  and policies for addressing the City’s housing needs as well as specific
  actions to implement the housing goals and policies.
  A. Housing Production
Situated in north Santa Cruz County, Scotts Valley is located between major
employment markets in the Silicon Valley and northern Monterey County. As a
desirable community, Scotts Valley is sought for its high quality of life. At the
same time, the City must balance a number of concerns to provide sufficient
housing opportunities for present and future residents. These include the
preservation of the City’s unique environment, the provision of community
services and public facilities, the balance of housing with employment
opportunities, and the mitigation of traffic impacts along arterials.
Providing housing along major corridors presents the most optimal opportunity
to meet the City’s diverse housing needs given the topography of the city. The
major opportunity will be as part of the development of a Town Center Project
along Mt. Hermon Road. Housing located along major arterials will be near
transit, employment opportunities, and water and sewer services. Areas outside
the urban core require a different housing strategy, because the City has
determined that the preservation of its unique hillside character and sensitive
habitats is of utmost importance. In these more rural areas of Scotts Valley,
residential development must be sensitively integrated and clustered into the
natural environment.
Ensuring an appropriate quantity, diversity, and price of new housing in Scotts
Valley presents a challenge in today’s housing market.
The following housing goal and guiding policies are designed to facilitate and
encourage a balanced mix and variety of housing types and prices in Scotts
Valley to meet existing and future housing needs of the community.
                                 5-2

GOAL #1:
It is the goal of the City of Scotts Valley to promote a balanced mix
of housing types, prices, and opportunities by increasing the
number of housing units to accommodate population and
employment growth.
Policies
1.1    Encourage the production of new residential development which
       provides a choice of housing type, density, and cost to meet the housing
       needs of all segments of the community.
1.2    Ensure that new residential sites have appropriate community services
       and public facilities, including streets and roadways, water, sewer, and
       other needed infrastructure.
1.3    Facilitate and encourage the development of mixed-use residential and
       commercial projects at appropriate locations along major corridors,
       within established design guidelines.
1.4    Offer regulatory incentives and concessions for affordable housing, such
       as modified development standards, density bonuses, or fee waivers
       where deemed to be appropriate.
1.5    Encourage establishment of child care facilities as an amenity at major
       transportation hubs and multi-modal stations, and in major housing and
       employment developments (including mixed-use projects).
1.6    Continue to support the development of a new Town Center that will
       provide a range of housing types, retail, commercial uses, public
       facilities and open space that will serve as the future focal point for the
       community.
1.7    Encourage density levels and incentives, for affordable housing,
       sufficient to facilitate the production of quality affordable housing.
                                   5-3
Housing Programs
 1. Sites Inventory Monitoring Program
 The City Council rezoned 11 acres of residential and commercial land to
 very high density residential, allowing densities from 15 to 20 units per
 acre during the 2009-2014 planning period including an additional 12 acres
 was rezoned for mixed residential and commercial uses along major
 corridors. The City has determined that the sites inventory previously
 identified has remaining capacity to meet the 2015-2023 RHNA. As
 discussed in Chapter 4 and outlined in Chart 4-4, these sites are located
 along Scotts Valley Drive, Mt. Hermon Road, and specific plan locations,
 such as the Gateway Specific Plan. To ensure sufficient residential capacity
 to accommodate the identified regional need for lower income households
 is maintained, the City will develop and implement a formal monitoring
 program. The program will track development approvals on identified sites
 and ensure that no net loss occurs. This means that if any of the identified
 sites are not developed in accordance with the development requirements
 outlined in the Zoning Code, an alternative site or sites must be identified
 and rezoned to maintain overall affordable unit capacity.
 Eight-year Action(s):
         Report on the progress of development in the identified sites
          inventory in the Annual Progress Report to HCD as required
          pursuant to Government Code Section 65400 and due April 1 of
          each year.
         Monitor development approvals on identified sites and ensure that
          no net loss occurs.
         Continue to implement the City’s 15% inclusionary housing
          requirement and Title 14 Affordable Housing Production
          requirements.
 2. Planned Unit Development
 The Planned Development District (PD) is designed to enable projects to
 create specific development standards for a site that facilitate quality
 development and responds to unique site or environmental conditions. For
 example, a PD district allows smaller lots than normally allowed under the
 Zoning Code to preserve trees and sloped areas. In these cases, the
 Planned Development district provides a means of flexibility other than a
 variance in order to secure modifications to otherwise set development
 standards. A Planned Development district is approved by the Planning
 Commission and City Council. The City has successfully used PD districts
 in recent years to facilitate affordable projects including the Baytree
 Apartments, Bluebonnet Condominiums, and Windward single-family
 homes.
                              5-4

Eight-year Action(s):
        Continue providing flexible design through the PD zoning district.
3. Secondary Dwelling Unit Program
The City of Scotts Valley could also accommodate a significant number of
secondary dwelling units and guest houses. Since 2000, the City has
facilitated the development of secondary dwelling units by reducing
development standards, permitting them by right in residential zoning
districts, and providing a means to address illegal conversions. In 2003 the
City amended the Zoning Code to allow secondary dwelling units by right
in single-family residential zones to bring the City’s regulations up to date
with state law.
Eight-year Action(s)
        Continue to publicize its secondary dwelling unit program by
         developing brochures, updating its web site, and making available
         brochures available at the public counter.
        Periodically review program and make adjustments as feasible to
         facilitate the development of secondary dwelling units.
4. Emergency Shelters
In compliance with Senate Bill 2, the City of Scotts Valley amended the
Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters by-right in the Service
Commercial (C-S), Shopping Center Commercial (C-SC), and
Public/Quasi-Public (P) zoning districts. These zoning districts were
selected due to multiple opportunities of underutilized and vacant sites for
the development of new emergency shelters.
  Eight-year Action(s)
        Continue to monitor the inventory of sites appropriate to
         accommodate emergency shelters and work with the appropriate
         organizations to ensure the needs of homeless and extremely low-
         income residents are met.
        Prioritize available funding and other available incentives for
         projects that provide housing for homeless and extremely low-
         income residents whenever possible.
5. Transitional and Supportive Housing
In compliance with Senate Bill 2, the City of Scotts Valley amended the
Zoning Code to allow transitional and supportive housing by-right in all
residential zones, subject to only those regulations that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone. These types of housing
provide important housing opportunities for the City’s homeless and
extremely low-income households.
                              5-5

  Eight-year Action(s)
       Continue to monitor the inventory of sites appropriate to
        accommodate transitional and supportive housing and work with
        the appropriate organizations to ensure the needs of homeless and
        extremely low-income residents are met.
       Prioritize available funding and other available incentives for
        projects that provide housing for homeless and extremely low-
        income residents whenever possible.
6. Density Bonus Program
To facilitate development, the City offers developers the opportunity to
participate in a Density Bonus Program which provides a density increase
of 35 percent plus development incentives for qualified affordable projects
To be eligible for the program, the affordable project must contain: (1) at
least 10 percent of the units reserved for low-income households; (2) at
least 5 percent reserved for very low-income households; or (3) an entire
development reserved for senior households. The unit must remain
affordable for at least 55 years if the density bonus is granted.
  Eight-year Action(s)
       Provide information on the Density Bonus Program at City Hall and

   B. Housing and Neighborhood Quality
                                           The City of Scotts Valley is known
                                           for its well-defined residential
                                           neighborhoods,                 each
                                           distinguished by topography,
                                           housing types/ products, and
                                           natural conditions. Residential
                                           neighborhoods        are        well
                                           maintained, distinguished by high
                                           quality architecture and pleasing
                                           beautiful amenities, making them
                                           highly desired places to live.
                                           Scotts Valley is surrounded by
forests, heavily wooded, and contains steep slopes that exceed 40
percent grade and are unsuitable for development. Limited areas of
moderately steep slopes (25 percent to 40 percent) also exist within the
Planning Area. These areas contain single-family homes and
development is regulated by the “Hillside Residential Combining District.”
In these areas, sensitively integrating development into the natural
environment is of utmost concern.
Higher density projects are located on the valley floor, and along major
                            5-6

     roads, such as Scotts Valley, Mt. Hermon, Lockwood, Glenwood, Green
     Hills, and others. Neighborhood quality in these areas is ensured when
     housing is compatible with the character, scale, and design of surrounding
     land uses, when the proposed developments do not create environmental
     impacts (e.g., such as traffic) that cannot be appropriately mitigated, and
     appropriate recreational opportunities are provided on site or within close
     proximity to neighborhoods. Areas with higher concentrations of multiple-
     family housing also require attention to infrastructure, housing conditions,
     and services.
 GOAL #2:
 It is the goal of the City of Scotts Valley to foster high-quality,
 safe and livable housing and residential neighborhoods through
 the preservation of Scotts Valley’s current housing stock that
 meets the needs of all income segments of Scotts Valley’s
 community and through the preservation of the City’s
 supporting services and programs that are intended to maintain
 and preserve the quality, the continued availability and the
 affordability of that housing and the City’s residential
 neighborhoods, as deemed appropriate by the City.
  Policies
  2.1      Maintain the quality of ownership and rental housing through the
  adoption, periodic revision, and enforcement of housing and property
  maintenance standards.
  2.2      Continue to support the repair and upgrade of infrastructure,
  services, and public facilities in existing neighborhoods.
  2.3      Ensure that residential projects are of high quality and thoughtful
  design through the implementation of architectural and design standards
  and design review.
  2.4      Preserve the supply of affordable rental housing, including mobile
  home parks, subsidized rental housing, and special needs housing.
  2.5      Protect established residential neighborhoods from the transition
  and intensification that detract from the character of the neighborhood.
Housing Programs
7. Code Enforcement
  Zoning and building codes are designed to preserve housing in good
  condition and maintain the quality of neighborhoods. The City’s Code
  Enforcement staff enforces City ordinances related to property
  maintenance, building conditions, and other issues. Code Enforcement staff
  inform property owners of code violations and refer them to available
  financial resources and programs offered by the City, including the
  Redevelopment Agency. Code Enforcement staff seek to work
  cooperatively with residents and businesses to achieve compliance with
                                 5-7

 City building and property maintenance codes. In certain cases, the City
 may red-tag, fine and prosecute owners of substandard housing. Although
 the City’s housing is in good condition, proactive code enforcement is a key
 to maintaining the quality of life in neighborhoods.
   Eight-year Action(s):
          Continue to implement a proactive code enforcement program
           through the Building Department and inform residents of
           rehabilitation assistance grants when available at City Hall and on
           the City’s website.
8.     Design Review
 Design review ensures that new housing projects are designed to blend in
 with the character of the neighborhood, respect topographical and
 environmental features in Scotts Valley, and ensure compatibility with
 surrounding land uses. Design review is required for projects at the tentative
 map stage and for apartment projects and for projects in hillside-combining
 districts and other sensitive areas. The City has streamlined the design
 review process in recent years. Design review is presently conducted by City
 staff and reviewed by the Planning Commission, rather than separate
 commissions in the community. City staff assists developers by providing a
 booklet with design guidelines.
   Eight-year Action(s):
          Continue to review projects to ensure consistency with the General
           Plan, Zoning Ordinance and area Design Guidelines. The City will
           give processing priority to affordable housing projects.
9. Monitor and Preserve Affordable Housing
   The City will inventory and gather information to proactively monitor publicly
   assisted housing units that have the potential to convert to market rate.
   This will include an annual review of the conversion status of all subsidized
   housing. Although no affordable project is at-risk of conversion during
   the planning period, the City will continue to monitor the status of projects
   and provide technical and financial assistance as feasible to ensure the
   projects remain affordable for the long-term.
   Eight-year Action(s):
          Develop and maintain an AB 987 database to include detailed
           information on all subsidized units, including those that have
           affordability covenants.
          Explore funding sources such as HUD Section 208/811 loans,
           HOPE II and II Homeownership Program funds, HOME funds,
           CDBG funds, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Programs, California
           Housing Finance Agency single-family and multi-family programs,
           and other programs to stimulate private developer and non-profit
                               5-8

            entity efforts in the development and financing of housing for lower
            and moderate-income households.
           Continue to monitor at-risk developments throughout the planning
            period and pursue partnership opportunities with non-profits to
            preserve and expand affordable housing in the City.
10.     Mobile Home Park Conversion Ordinance
The City’s Mobile Home Park Conversion Ordinance recognizes that the
unrestricted conversion of mobile home parks to other uses can further
diminish the availability of mobile home parks and rental space, and can
subject tenants to the costs and inconvenience of relocation. The ordinance
provides a formal application procedure for mobile home park conversion and
requires approval by the Planning Commission or City Council. The City will
continue to implement the ordinance in an effort to protect the community’s
existing mobile home parks.
    Eight-year Action(s):
       Continue to implement the mobile home park conversion ordinance in
        an effort to protect existing mobile home parks and the supply of
        affordable housing.
       Provide information on the mobile home park conversion ordinance
        and other fair housing information on the City’s website and at City
        Hall.
11. Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization
        Ordinance
The Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization Ordinance recognizes the need to
protect the residents of mobile homes from unreasonable space rent
increases, while at the same time recognizing the need for mobile home park
owners to receive a reasonable income and return on investment. The City
receives, investigates, and holds hearings on requests for rent adjustments
through the City’s Rent Review Commission. To ensure that conditions are
preserved to promote and enhance fairness in the economic relationship
between mobile home park owners and mobile home owners the City will
continue to implement the Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization Ordinance.
Eight-year Action(s):
     Continue to implement the mobile home park rent stabilization
        ordinance to ensure that mobile home owners and residents are
        protected from unreasonable space rental increases while recognizing
        the need of mobile home park owners to receive a just and
        reasonable return on their investment.
     Provide information on the mobile home park rent stabilization
        ordinance and other fair housing information on the City’s website and
        at City Hall.
                                  5-9

     C. Housing Assistance
                                             As a desirable community, Scotts
                                             Valley will continue to experience
                                             a relatively high demand and price
                                             for    housing. These market
                                             conditions       have     long-term
                                             implications for providing suitable
                                             housing opportunities in Scotts
                                             Valley. Presently, many lower
                                             income      seniors    reside     in
                                             subsidized units or mobile homes
                                             and have limited choices to move
                                             elsewhere.         Moderate-income
    families with children and young professionals can only afford
    apartments and may need to move to other communities to buy a
    home. Providing adequate homeownership and rental opportunities thus
    remains a priority. In addition, certain residents in Scotts Valley have
    greater difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing due to special
    needs. These circumstances include employment and income, household
    size and type, and the need for health/child care. Special needs groups
    may include lower income households, the elderly, college students, people
    with a disability, people with developmental disabilities, large or single
    parent families, forestry workers, and people who are homeless.
    Facilitating and encouraging housing opportunities for these and other
    special needs groups can help allow all residents to find a home in Scotts
    Valley.
GOAL #3:
It is the goal of the City of Scotts Valley to expand and protect a
range of housing opportunities for all demographic, economic,
and special needs groups in the community.
Policies
      .
3.1   Encourage the provision of support and housing services for special
      needs groups, including seniors, large families, disabled persons,
      persons with developmental disabilities, single parents, college
      students, homeless people and others.
3.2   Work with nonprofit housing and service providers to ensure that
      housing and supportive service needs of residents are met.
3.3   Promote equal housing opportunities and discourage discrimination in the
      sale, rental, or occupancy of housing.
                                 5-10
Housing Programs
 12. Housing Voucher Program
 The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program extends rental subsidies to very
 low-income households. The program offers a voucher that pays the
 difference between the current fair market rent established by the Housing
 Authority and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e. 30 percent of
 household income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that
 costs above the payment standard, provided the tenant pays the extra
 rent above the payment standard.
 The Housing Choice Voucher Program has recently been expanded to
 include a homeownership opportunity. Under the new program, renters
 who have participated in the Housing Choice Voucher program for a
 minimum of one year are ready to buy a house, and have pre- qualified
 for a mortgage loan from a participating lender, may have their monthly
 housing assistance payment applied to a mortgage payment rather than
 rent. A three percent down-payment is required to be paid by the
 prospective homebuyer. As the City has little control over how the County’s
 programs are administered, the City will be responsible for providing
 information to residents.
 Eight-year Action(s):
        Continue to participate with the Housing Authority of Santa
         Cruz County Section 8 Certificate/Voucher Rental Assistance
         Program.
        Continue to refer residents to the County program and provide
         information at City Hall and on the City’s website.
 13. Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
 Since 1992, Scotts Valley has participated in the Mortgage Credit
 Certificate (MCC) program through the Housing Authority of the County
 Santa Cruz. The MCC program provides a tax credit of up to 20 percent
 of the annual interest paid on the applicant’s mortgage, reducing the
 amount of Federal income tax the homeowner pays and freeing more
 income to qualify and pay for a loan. The Housing Authority also offers a
 specialized MCC program for teachers and principals of eligible schools.
 Currently the schools located in Scotts Valley are not eligible for the
 program. As the City has little control over how the County’s programs are
 administered, the City will be responsible for providing information to
 residents.
 Eight-year Action(s):
        Continue to refer residents to the County program and provide
         information at City Hall and on the City’s website.
                            5-11

14. Fair Housing
Fair housing is a broad topic that covers topics ranging from fair housing
services to providing sufficient housing opportunities. For fair housing
services, the City currently refers fair housing discrimination activities to
the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).
The mission of the DFEH it to protect Californians from employment,
housing, and public accommodation discrimination.
Eight-year Action(s):
       Continue to provide informational and educational materials on fair
        housing services for property owners, apartment managers, and
        tenants at City Hall and on the City’s website.
       Continue to monitor and respond, as appropriate, to complaints of
        discrimination, and continue to refer tenants to the California
        Department of Fair Employment and Housing for proper intake,
        investigation, and resolution of fair housing complaints.
15.         Child Care and Day Care Facilities
Scotts Valley recognizes that children represent our future community, but
also recognizes that existing childcare services and facilities may not be
adequate to meet today’s demand and that this demand is increasing.
To ignore this fact jeopardizes the long-term quality of the City’s social,
physical, and economic well-being. Thus, the City is committed to making
high quality childcare services available, affordable, and accessible to
those persons who either live or work in the City and who desire or need
such services.
Eight-year Action(s):
       Continue to work with child care providers and the County to
        promote adequate child care facilities within the community.
       Provide information at City Hall and on the City’s website on current
        zoning regulations that apply to child care and day care facilities.
       Continue to encourage new development to provide child care and
        day care facilities through a variety of activities, including
        outreaching to developers; providing financial or in-kind technical
        assistance, when available; providing expedited processing;
        identifying grant and funding opportunities; and providing
        information on the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance.
16. Reasonable Accommodation
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583, the City of Scotts Valley is
obligated to remove potential and actual governmental constraints upon
the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income
levels and for persons with disabilities. The Fair Housing Act, as amended
in 1988, requires that cities and counties provide reasonable
accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and procedures where such
                            5-12

accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities
equal housing opportunities. Reasonable accommodation provides a basis
for residents with disabilities to request flexibility in the application of land
use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain
restrictions or requirements from the local government to ensure equal
access to housing opportunities. The ADA Committee continues as a City
Commission that identifies opportunities to increase ADA accessibility
throughout the City. In general, City Staff takes into consideration the
provisions of the California Americans with Disabilities Act (Cal ADA) in the
review and approval of housing projects and grants modifications and
deviations from the Municipal Code to accommodate the needs of persons
with disabilities. In 2014, the City adopted a reasonable accommodation
ordinance per requirements of State law.
Eight-year Action(s):
        Provide informational handouts and information at City Hall and on
         the City’s website about reasonable accommodation procedures.
        Continue to work with developers and individual home owners to
         encourage design and construction of projects that include features
         to make the units usable for persons with disabilities.
17. Housing for Persons with Development
Disabilities
The housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities are typically
not addressed by Title 24 Regulations, and requires, in addition to basic
affordability, slight modifications to existing units, and in some instances, a
varying range of supportive housing facilities. The design of housing-
accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the
availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of
considerations that are important in serving this need group. Incorporating
“barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing (as required by
California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide
the widest range of choices for residents with disabilities.
Eight-year Action(s):
        Seek State and Federal monies, as funding becomes available, in
         support of housing construction and rehabilitation targeted for
         persons with developmental disabilities.
        Provide regulatory incentives, such as expedited permit processing,
         and fee waivers and deferrals, to projects targeted for persons with
         developmental disabilities.
        Work with the San Andreas Regional Center to implement an
         outreach program informing households within the City of housing
         and services available for persons with developmental disabilities.
        Provide information on housing and services available for persons
                             5-13

         with developmental disabilities at City Hall and on the City’s
         website.
18. Housing for Lower Income Households
Extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households have limited
housing options in Scotts Valley. Housing types appropriate for these
groups include: emergency shelters, and transitional and supportive
housing. To accommodate this population group the City amended the
Zoning Code to address these housing types per requirements of Senate
Bill 2. The City has amended the City’s Zoning Code to allow emergency
shelters by-right in at least one zoning district, and to permit transitional
and supportive housing in all residential zones by-right without any
discretionary action, subject only to those regulations that apply to other
residential dwelling units of the same type in the same zone.
Eight-year Action(s):
        Encourage the development of housing for lower income
         households, including extremely low-, very low-, and low-income,
         through a variety of activities, such as outreaching to housing
         developers; providing financial or in-kind technical assistance,
         when available; providing expedited processing; identifying grant
         and funding opportunities; and offering additional incentives beyond
         density bonus provisions.
19. Definition of “Family”
The City’s Municipal Code currently defines a family as “a person or
persons related by blood, marriage or adoption or a group of not more than
five persons, excluding servants, not related by blood, marriage or
adoption, living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit.”
The City evaluated the current definition and found that revisions are
necessary to be consistent with State and federal fair housing laws.
Eight-year Action(s):
        Amend, as appropriate, the definition of “family” to be consistent
         with State and federal fair housing laws.
20.      Agricultural Employee Housing
Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the State Health and Safety Code are
within part of the Employee Housing Act. The act sets standards for the
construction, maintenance, use, and occupancy of living quarters called
“employee housing” as defined in Section 17008 of the Health and Safety
Code. The intent of these two sections is to broaden opportunities for
agricultural employee housing in single-family residential districts and
agricultural districts. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to meet the
requirements of Health and Safety Codes Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 as
it relates to agricultural employee housing.
                             5-14

Eight-year Action(s):
     Amend the Zoning Ordinance to meet the requirements of Health
      and Safety Codes Section 17021.5 and 17021.6 as it relates to
      agricultural employee housing.
                        5-15

        D. Environmental Preservation
                                                 Scotts Valley is a mountain/
                                                 alluvial   environment;      the
                                                 alluvian valleys of Cabonera
                                                 Creek and Camp Evers Creek
                                                 form the historic and modern
                                                 core of the urban area and
                                                 mountains that border the
                                                 city. As a hillside community,
                                                 most uplands have steep
                                                 slopes exceeding 40% grade
                                                 and       have       forestland,
                                                 providing for stunning views
                                                 and vistas.
    Streams crossing the Valley provide riparian habitat for sensitive and
    protected plant and animal species. Riparian woodland along rivers and
    Ponderosa Pines provides habitat for locally rare plant species, including
    state and federally endangered species, are concentrated in sand deposits,
    marshy habitats, grassland areas, and other areas. Scotts Valley was also
    once an ancient seabed, and is home to archaeological and paleontological
    resources. Housing in these areas is sensitively integrated into the natural
    environment.
    As the case with communities in Santa Cruz County, the local water supply
    is derived entirely from surface waters and underground aquifers. Ensuring
    groundwater resources, aquifer replenishment, and water quality remains
    an important issue for the community. Thus, Scotts Valley remains
    committed to fostering environmental preservation in the city.
GOAL #4:
It is the goal of the City of Scotts Valley to protect its unique
sensitive environmental, archaeological, and paleontological
assets and encourage resource conservation measures in all new
housing developments.
Policies
4.1   Work with other local, State and federal agencies, public utilities, and
       community organizations to implement resource conservation programs
       and ensure that adequate water remains available.
4.2   Ensure that new development proposals are adequately evaluated for
       their impact upon cultural resources, sensitive habitats and species,
       environmental features, and other such factors.
4.3   Require that all residential developments be thoughtfully integrated into

    21. Hillside Development and Design
    The City’s Zoning Code enforces certain regulations and development
    standards to ensure that its environmental resources are protected. For
    instance, the Code prohibits development on slopes with an average grade
    of more than 40 percent. For slopes where development is permitted, the
    City provides design guidelines to the project applicant(s) to ensure that
    hillsides are preserved. For slopes greater than 10 percent, the City has
    established a Hillside Residential Combining District, which requires a
    variety of development and design standards to help preserve and
    conserve natural vegetative and topographic features and open space.
    City staff and the Design Review Board (Planning Commission) are
    responsible to review the project to ensure that applicable standards have
    been fully addressed.
    Eight-year Action(s):
            Continue to enforce the setback, height, and density standards
             identified in the Hillside Residential Combining District.
    22. Resource Conservation
    The City encourages the conservation of resources in the development
    and improvement of new housing throughout the City. Buildings should
    be designed to minimize mechanical heating and cooling. Sunlight
    should be used for direct heating and illumination wherever possible.
    Natural ventilation and shading should be used to cool a building. Active
    and passive solar heating is encouraged. Solar access shall be planned
    into the site design where possible. Solar access shall be reserved,
    where appropriate, through recorded easements or other devices or
    instruments. Climatic factors such as prevailing winds, shade trees,
    window and door orientation and the positioning of buildings on the site
    shall all be coordinated to maximize energy conservation.
    Eight-year Action(s):
            Encourage energy conservation measures and devices to be
             incorporated in the development and improvement of housing.
             Review such requirements through the Design Review and
             Building Permit process.
                                  5-17

23. Water and Sewer Service Providers
Pursuant to Chapter 727, Statutes of 2005 (SB 1087), the City of Scotts
Valley is required to deliver its adopted Housing Element and any
amendments thereto to local water and sewer service providers. This
legislation allows for coordination between the City, water, and sewer
providers when considering approval of new residential projects, and to
ensure that the providers have an opportunity to provide input on the
Element. Additionally review of the Housing Element ensures that priority
for water and sewer services is granted to projects that include units
affordable to lower-income households.
Eight-year Action(s):
        Submit the adopted Housing Element, and any subsequent
         amendments, to local water and sewer providers for their
         review and input.
24. Cultural Resources
Scotts Valley’s location on an ancient seabed has contributed to a
wealth of archaeological and paleontological resources in the community
today. In fact, the present City Hall site contains a 10,000- to 15,000-year-
old archaeological site. The General Plan designates various areas
throughout the community as moderate or high cultural resource sensitivity
zones. In these areas, development proposals must have appropriate
environmental clearance pursuant to state and federal laws, which is
reviewed by the City’s Cultural Resource Commission. Procedures and
scope of authority of the Commission is set forth in Chapter 17.44 of the
Scotts Valley Municipal Code.
Eight-year Action(s):
        Continue to review proposals for new housing to ensure that the
         City’s cultural resources are adequately protected.

                     Housing Accomplishments
                     As part of the Housing Element, cities must periodically review the
                     progress, effectiveness, and continued appropriateness of the housing
                     goals, policies, and programs in addressing the housing needs of the
                     community. These results should be quantified wherever possible and
                     qualitative where necessary. This section and Chart A-1 evaluates
                     past accomplishments of the City’s housing programs in meeting
                     objectives for the prior Housing Element.

subsidy is linked to a particular house or apartment, housing subsidy is
“project” or “unit” based. In Section 8 rental assistance programs the
subsidy is linked to the family and assistance provided to any number
of families accepted by willing private landlords. This type of subsidy is
said to be “tenant based.”
Housing Unit: A room or group of rooms used by one or more
individuals living separately from others in the structure, with direct

the State of California. The City of Scotts Valley was selected to be the
Successor Agency responsible for all enforcement obligations owed.
Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP): The Regional Housing Needs
Plan (RHNP) is based on State of California projections of population
growth and housing unit demand and assigns a share of the region’s

emergency shelters. A jurisdiction may also choose to consider
additional special needs groups in the Housing Element, such as
students, military households, other groups present in their community.
Subdivision: The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land in accordance
with the Subdivision Map Act (California Government Code Section
66410 et seq.).
Substandard Housing: Housing which does not meet the minimum

are structurally sound and where the cost of rehabilitation is
economically warranted.
Substandard, Needs Replacement: Substandard units which are
structurally unsound and for which the cost of rehabilitation is
considered infeasible, such as instances where the majority of a unit
has been damaged by fire.
Supportive Housing: Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is

ability to live and, when possible, work in the community; as defined by
Section 50675 of the California Health and Safety Code.
Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive
housing for the purpose of facilitating the independence of residents.
Some examples are case management, medical or psychological
counseling and supervision, child care, transportation, and job training.

Zone or zoning district: A portion of territory of the City within certain
uniform regulations and requirements or various combinations thereof,
apply.
Zoning: A land use regulatory measure enacted by local government.
Zoning district regulations governing lot size, building bulk, placement,
and other development standards vary from district to district, but must
be uniform within the same district. Each city and county adopts a
zoning ordinance specifying these regulations.
Zoning Code: Regulations governing the use of land, including the
construction, alteration, movement, replacement, or maintenance of
buildings, the conduct and density of residential, commercial, industrial,
and public service activities; the areas and dimensions of sites; the
appearance, design, height, bulk and placement of structures on each
site; the provision of open space, amenities, off-street parking and
loading; the relationships between buildings and uses on adjoining sites
                                                                        B- 9

                                          LAND USE
The land use analysis examines the pattern of existing development; that is, it examines the
extent and location of land developed with various uses. Existing zoning is the implementation
tool for land use. Zoning law regulates the permitted uses and densities of all land in the City.
The current holding capacity analysis examines the availability of vacant land for various
development uses and estimated total development potential under existing zoning.
The land use plan is intended to protect the hillside forests which provide the essential character
of the Valley, develop the urban core near major transportation corridors, foster a healthy
business community which can provide most of the goods and services for the City and ensure a
broadly based housing supply.
                        Recommended by Task Force November 19, 1992
               Recommended by Planning Commission to Council January 14, 1993
                    Accepted by City Council at Public Hearing, April 21, 1993
                                                                                   LAND USE-1
                                                  1
The Land use Element contains text, policies and a map indicating the planned location, amount
and intensity of residential, commercial, industrial, public and open space lands. The stated land
use policies need to be considered together with the land use map to assess the City's intentions
for future development and conservation within the community. The land use map implements
the goals and policies contained throughout the Scotts Valley Plan.
EXISTING AND FUTURE CONDITIONS
As of 1992, Scotts Valley was well on its was to achieving its goal of a balanced community per
the 1986 general plan. The urban forest environment and convenient access to the Silicon Valley
created a growth in jobs, shops and services, parks and recreation programs, and housing
developments - the basic ingredients of a balanced community. An analysis of Scotts Valley's
existing land uses provides an insight into those elements of the community which should be
preserved and those elements which could be improved to meet the city's goals and policies. The
following summarizes existing conditions and future plans for various land uses within the
planning area.
Residential Neighborhoods
Residential uses include both single and multiple-family residences, apartments and
condominiums and mobile home parks. These lands total 968.9 acres or about 36% of the city
area. The development of the densities in the neighborhoods has been guided by the topography,
geology, vegetative cover, access to transportation and service facilities. Larger lots with low
densities have been developed in the hillsides with single family detached homes such as in the
Whispering Pines, Granite Creek and Hacienda/Cadillac neighborhoods. Higher densities are
located on the valley floor close to local shopping, public services and transportation facilities
such as the Blake-Jolley-Trammel Way neighborhood, and projects along Bean Creek Road.
Several mobile home parks with medium densities exist in the community such as Montevalle,
Spring Lakes, Vista Del Lago, and Mountain Brook. These parks provide for a variety in
housing type and cost: Montevalle, Spring Lakes and Mountain Brook are for seniors; Vista Del
Lago has recently been converted to a family park.
In 1990, Scotts Valley had 8615 residents, with 3513 dwelling units and a projected population
of 15,000 at buildout of the General Plan in the year 2015. With the adoption of a 40 year city
redevelopment agency in 1990 and the AMBAG housing needs assessment showing that Scotts
Valley needs to have 4883 dwelling units by 1996, the city will re-examine the land use policies
and densities as described in the housing element. This re-examination should not adversely
affect the single family residential neighborhoods and mobile home parks which are essentially
built-out. Additional housing and increased densities would occur in the commercial areas with
mixed use projects, rehabilitation of existing commercial businesses to include residential uses,
infill projects on vacant residential parcels, or through general plan amendments to the land use
map.
In 1991, the city adopted a planned development zone district which allows projects to be
individually designed to meet the needs of the property zoned "PD". This flexibility allows a
                                                                                  LAND USE-2
                                                    2
project to be constructed at the maximum allowable density while taking into account the
topography, vegetation, and other constraints to development.
The street network plays an important role in the development of the residential neighborhoods.
In the hillside neighborhoods, streets are typically narrow to preserve the existing topography and
vegetation. These narrow streets, however, prevent residents from using the street for guest
parking since emergency vehicles must be able to pass at all times. The absence of streets and
adequate access can also prevent neighborhoods from accessing shopping and service areas or
other residential areas without traveling with the congestion of the work force. The
neighborhoods west of Scotts Valley Drive are an example of this; residents have only one
access through the city (Scotts Valley Drive). There is no local street solely for residential
traffic; most of the residences are located on narrow, dead-end streets off Scotts Valley Drive.
Consequently, there is no defined neighborhood west of Scotts Valley Drive, merely disjointed
developments. The circulation element of the general plan addresses this issue. The lack of
access also limits development east of Highway 17 along Green Hills Road. The land use
designations in this area should retain large lots to limit densities until the mid-town interchange
is completed, allowing motorists to access Highway 17 directly. Currently, the only access to
Scotts Valley or Highway 17 is at the intersection of Glen Canyon Road and Mt. Hermon Road,
which is near capacity.
Residential land uses in the unincorporated areas total approximately 1,449 acres, about 51% of
the unincorporated land in the planning area. This land acreage is all single-family residential,
with the majority of the residences located on large lots.
Industrial, Commercial and Office Developments
Scotts Valley developed significantly in the 1980's towards a balanced community, providing
retail and service facilities as well as a job base. Approximately 140 acres or about 5% of the
city land is designated for commercial uses including shopping centers, service commercial and
professional offices. An additional 144 acres (5%) of the total City lands is designated
industrial. In the unincorporated area, approximately 240 acres or 8% of the total unincorporated
area is designated industrial.
The largest single industrial operation in the planning area is the Kaiser Quarry, located at the
western edge of the Planning area, south of Mt. Hermon Road.
The industrial areas include Watkins-Johnson, north of Mt. Hermon Road, Borland
International, east of highway 17 and north of Granite Creek Road, Technology Circle/Janis
Way/El Pueblo between Scotts Valley Drive and Highway 17 along Carbonero Creek. The
primary light industrial uses are high tech, computer oriented. Scarborough lumber, garden
nursery, and home improvement center is also located in the light industrial area on Janis Way
and El Pueblo, along with other building construction and supply facilities and various
contractor's facilities. Borland International, a computer software company, is currently the only
facility located in the Research and Development land use designation. Borland specializes in
                                                                                     LAND USE-3
                                                    3
writing software for personal computers. The city's sewer treatment plant and corporation yard,
located off Lundy Lane is also designated light industrial.
Scotts Village, Scotts Valley Square and Graham Plaza, community commercial shopping
centers, were developed along Mt. Hermon Road at the southern end of the city. Scotts Valley
Junction, also serving the entire community, developed at the northern end of Scotts Valley
Drive. The remaining areas zoned for a shopping center in Scotts Valley are located adjacent to
Kings Village Shopping Center north and south of Blue Bonnet Lane and portions of the former
Skypark airport property.
Service commercial zones have been designated near the highway interchanges and along Mt.
Hermon Road and Scotts Valley Drive where the uses can benefit from the access. These
commercial areas were intended to rely on customers making trips by car, rather than from being
in high volume pedestrian areas such as shopping centers. Along Mt. Hermon Road, Pinnacle
Pass, a portion of Camp Evers and a portion of the former Skypark airport have yet to redevelop;
most of the remaining commercial areas are developed. The service commercial zones along
Scotts Valley Drive, however, have not developed as expected. The condition of the pavement
has deteriorated, lots tend to be small which restricts development possibilities, landscaping and
frontage improvements are sporadic and largely nonexistent; redevelopment has yet to occur.
Professional-Administrative offices are designated in the land use plan to provide local
employment opportunities for planning area residents. These areas are for administrative,
business, and professional offices in which merchandise is not manufactured or sold. Examples
of uses in this category are insurance offices; tax consulting services, real estate agencies, banks
and other financial and investments services, architects other design professionals, doctors and
dentists, attorneys, and similar business and professional offices.
According to city business licenses, in the 1980-81 fiscal year, there were 405 businesses,
employing 1540 persons. By July, 1992, there were approximately 580 businesses in Scotts
Valley with over 6,300 full and part-time workers. Based upon the 1990 census, an estimated
16% of these workers live in Scotts Valley, 47% lived in the Monterey-San Benito-Santa Cruz
tri-county area, and the remainder commuted from outside the Santa Cruz area. The location of
one's place of work compared with their place of residence plays a crucial role in traffic patterns,
commuting time, energy consumption, noise and air pollution.
In the future, Scotts Valley is expected to grow to support an employment base of about 12,000,
assuming buildout of all lands on the General Plan at maximum densities (Table LU-1, LU-2,
and LU-3). These workers will represent a wide range of professional, managerial, clerical and
other jobs in a variety of industries.
The street network currently limits development of the service facilities and possible job base
along Scotts Valley Drive. The Drive is the only access to the industrial areas and commercial
properties along the strip. There are few public improvements and the pavement is deteriorated.
New businesses are not attracted to the area and commuters must access the industrial area from
the north or south part of the city. A mid-town interchange and completion of the Scotts Valley
                                                                                    LAND USE-4
                                                  4
Drive improvements would stimulate development of projects and contribute to the job base.
The proposed street system is described in the circulation element of the General Plan.
Public/Quasi-Public Facilities and Open Space Areas
The public/quasi public category includes both public and private educational facilities,
emergency services, health care facilities, religious facilities, governmental buildings, cultural
facilities, and parks. The senior center, city hall, post office, fire department and water district
office are some of the public land uses. These uses total 128 acres within the city, or about 5%
of the lands, of which schools make up the majority of the land use. Public and quasi-public uses
outside the city limits total approximately 71 acres or about 2.5% of the unincorporated lands.
Open space lands are generally described under one of four categories: areas used for outdoor
recreation; areas designated for preservation of natural resources (wildlife habitat, rivers,
watershed lands, etc.); areas of managed production of resources (mineral resources, forest
lands); and areas where public health and safety hazards exist, such as steep slopes and unstable
soil areas. The open space element of the General Plan describes these areas in detail.
Scotts Valley's parks are described in the Parks Master Plan, adopted by the City Council in
1990, and in the parks and recreation element of this general plan. The goal of the city is to have
3 acres of active park land per 1,000 population. This would total 45 acres at buildout. The
Parks and Recreation Commission continue to analyze the various neighborhoods by surveying
the residents, examining vacant lands, and recommending amendments to the Parks Master Plan
in order to provide an adequate system of parks for each neighborhood as well as community
parks throughout the city. The city will continue to acquire and improve its parks through its
park dedication ordinance as well as requiring the provision of private open space within
residential developments to serve the needs of the residents of specific projects.
Wildlife habitat, rivers, and watershed lands designated for preservation of natural resources as
well as the forest lands and mineral resource areas are described in the Open Space and
conservation element of this general plan. The Safety element shows areas where public health
and safety hazards exist due to unstable soil areas, fault zones, floods, etc. These areas will be
designated open space during the development review process. The ridgelines along the east and
west sides of the valley are characterized by scattered low density, single family residential
development of mostly steep and wooded hillsides. These ridges are of special concern to valley
residents because of their prominence, steep terrain and wooded vegetation, all visible from the
valley floor.
Agricultural land uses in the unincorporated planning area of Scotts Valley represent the second
largest land use. In 1986, 469.3 acres (about 16.5% of the unincorporated area) were devoted to
grazing, farming, animal husbandry, and other related agricultural uses. The major agricultural
land use areas were located on the east side of Highway 17, along the northern boundary of the
Planning area, and north of the former Skypark Airport.
                                                                                    LAND USE-5
                                                   5
GENERAL PLAN LAND USES
The General Plan establishes seventeen land use categories with which development must be
consistent. The General Plan Land Use Map indicates the general location of these land uses
within the Planning Area. If a project is proposed which is inconsistent with the General Plan
Land Use Map, the owner of the property may apply for a General Plan Amendment. The City
Council must be able to make a specific finding that the proposed amendment to the General
Plan is in the public's interest or deny the amendment. Amendments to each required General
Plan element are allowed up to four times per year.
The zoning process consists of the rezoning of lands within the incorporated City limits (or the
prezoning of property proposed for annexation) from one zoning district to another. The
rezoning of property directly implements the land use designations as shown on the Land Use
Map since, by state law, the rezoning of property must be consistent with the General Plan.
Zoning applications are reviewed by various City departments for consistency with City Council
and General Plan policy, as well as to identify specific public improvements and requirements
such as streets, storm and sanitary sewer and street lights. Review by other public agencies is
also incorporated in the zoning process as appropriate.
Zoning changes take two forms: conventional zoning and Planned Development overlay zoning.
Conventional zoning districts contained in the City's Zoning Ordinance include a range of
allowed land uses, development intensities and standards within the major land use categories:
residential, commercial and industrial, together with zoning districts for other land uses such as
Public/Quasi-Public and Open Space. The various ranges of allowed use and development
intensity correspond generally to the respective General Plan land use designations, thereby
allowing the application of a zoning district to a property which implements the land use
intended by the General Plan.
Planned Development zoning reflected in a General Development Plan and adopted by the City
Council provides the means to tailor zoning regulations and to apply specific standards for the
development of a particular site. This process enables the City Council to consider the unique
characteristics of a site and its surroundings to better implement the citywide objectives, goals
and policies of the General Plan and to provide site-specific development standards. Anytime
Planned Development zoning is utilized, the standards established for the zoning district which
reflects the General Plan designation are tailored as part of a General Development Plan.
Tailored zoning regulations include, but are not limited to, site intensities, location, height,
coverage and appearance of structures.
The second phase of a Planned Development zoning process, the Planned Development permit,
is a site/architectural permit which implements the approved Planned Development overlay
zoning of the property.
There are eight residential categories in the land use plan, with various population and dwelling
unit densities as shown in table LU-1. Development at the designated densities will achieve the
                                                                                     LAND USE-6
                                                   6
buildout population of 15,000 while preserving the hillsides and open spaces discussed in the
other elements of the general plan. The population density figures are based on the 1990 census
information of 2.5 persons per household average in Scotts Valley.

The following description of various land use designations will be further refined in the zoning
ordinance and through implementation of the policies and actions of the general plan.
Professional Commercial - administrative, business, and professional offices in which
merchandise is not manufactured or sold. Examples of uses in this category include insurance
offices; tax consulting services, real estate agencies, banks and other financial and investment
services, architects and other design professional, doctors and dentists, attorneys, and similar
business and professional offices.
                                                                                    LAND USE-7
                                                   7
Service Commercial - retail stores and shops, food and motel/hotel establishments, services such
as printing shops and electrical repair shops, heating and ventilating shops. Very high density
mixed use residential is permitted, providing adjacent uses are compatible and the residential use
is secondary to the retail use.
Shopping Center Commercial - retail and service establishments for the development of
community and/or regional shopping centers. Examples of uses in this category would include
stores, shops, and offices included in the professional office and service commercial categories,
providing adjacent uses are compatible. Very high density mixed use (residential/commercial) is
permitted providing adjacent uses are compatible and the residential use is secondary to the retail
use.
Light Industrial - industrial and industrial related land uses are neither commercial/retail nor
residential, but may create noise, odor, dust, glare, traffic, or impacts on the aquifer and/or air
quality. Planning review shall assure that activities conducted on property do not unreasonably
interfere with the character of adjoining land uses. There are two kinds of light industrial uses:
Class 1 and Class 2.
     Class 1 - land uses allowed in Class 1 shall be those that, because of their benign nature, do
     not expose the environment to hazard. This category could include research and
     development, building construction and supplies, warehousing of non-toxic materials,
     mechanical assembly of electronic or mechanical goods, testing, occasional "touch-up" and
     repair soldering, machining of wood or metals without toxic cleaners, and processing and
     packaging of components and finished materials. This list of examples is not inclusive of all
     types of industrial in Class 1. The key element is that neither toxic materials are used in
     manufacturing a product, nor does any process involve a change of phase/state of any
     material in significant quantities.
     Class 2 - when the light industrial land user requires the use of toxins or involves a change
     of phase/state of any material in their processing, the user must obtain a Conditional Use
     Permit to ensure that the health, safety and welfare of adjoining land uses and the City are
     protected. Examples of these uses include the production of printed wiring boards, most
     semi-conductor processes, and wave or re-flow soldering. Under the conditional use permit
     process, any impact normally addressed by this process may be examined, as well as
     methods of handling hazardous materials and protection of the aquifer and air quality.
Heavy Industrial - industrial and industrial related uses which, because of their operations, may
not be compatible with residential and commercial categories. Because of their potential to
create traffic impacts, undesirable noise, odor, vibration, glare, and/or heat, land uses in this
category may require special mitigation measures such as buffering from adjacent land uses.
Examples of land uses include but are not limited to lumber processing; production of food and
kindred products; milling of wood, heavy machinery and equipment; manufacturing of
chemicals; mining and quarrying of minerals.
                                                                                     LAND USE-8
                                                    8
Public/Quasi-Public - public and private educational facilities, emergency services, health care
facilities, religious facilities, governmental buildings, and cultural facilities.
Open Space - areas for the conservation of the community's natural or scenic resources.
Appropriate open space areas include wetlands and open water, plant and wildlife habitats,
timber production zones, farmlands and grazing areas, and park and recreational areas.
Special Treatment Areas - The Special Treatment Area ("STA") overlay designation is
established for areas where planned developments or some form of special treatment is required
to allow future development. Bethany College ("BCSTA"), the mid-town interchange
("MTISTA"), Camp Evers ("CESTA") area and Mt. Hermon Road near Highway 17
("MHRSTA") are designated special treatment areas.
The BCSTA is approximately 80 acres in size with approximately 26 acres of buildable area.
The area is located at the northern portion of the City, west of Highway 17. The area is bordered
on the west by Bethany Drive/Bethany Way and on the east by Scotts Valley Drive. The center
portion of the BCSTA includes parcels around Gaston Circle. Buildable areas are those areas
where the slopes are generally less than 10%. Development has already occurred to some extent
in the buildable areas. The sole access to the Bethany area is via Bethany Drive. Most of the
built and buildable areas of the existing college lie in the narrow valleys between the hills at
elevations of 800 to 850 feet. Development includes single family dwellings, student housing, a
new 15,000 square foot office building, child daycare center, church, gymnasium, and other
college related buildings and uses. Approximately 16 lots are developed with single family
homes under separate ownership from the college. These single family homes under separate
ownership from the college will be permitted additions or modifications to the existing structures
based upon zoning regulations applicable to the R-1-10 zoning district. The remaining properties
in the BCSTA will be developed under the Planned Development zoning regulations. The land
use for these properties in the BCSTA will reflect a mix of commercial, residential, park, and
open space designations similar to the existing campus in order to minimize traffic impacts and
disruption to the surrounding residential neighborhood.
The MTISTA includes properties east and west of State Highway 17, located half way between
the Granite Creek and Mt. Hermon Road overpasses. The Circulation element proposes a new
interchange to be developed in this area within the next 5-15 years to provide direct access to
Green Hills Road and alleviate congestion on Mt. Hermon Road and Scotts Valley Drive. The
current access to properties on Green Hills Road is from Mt. Hermon Road to Glen Canyon Road
to Green Hills Road. Access from the north is barricaded for emergency access only. Future
development of the vacant properties on Green Hills Road must include design and development
of an alternative access to alleviate the congestion on Mt. Hermon Road and Glen Canyon Road.
Land use designations for the properties in the MTISTA will not be changed until the mid-town
interchange is ensured.
The MHRSTA includes properties fronting Mt. Hermon Road on the east between State
Highway 17 and Glen Canyon Road. The purpose of the MHRSTA is to develop a plan
coordinating circulation and land uses for all the properties to limit ingress and egress along Mt.
                                                                                    LAND USE-9
                                                    9
Hermon Road. The plan should consider construction of an access road to reduce vehicular
conflict; the plan should provide rear access across a bridge from Glen Canyon Road to provide
properties in the MHRSTA with access to Glen Canyon Road.
One new land use designation is proposed in the General Plan. This is a Residential - Very high
(15.1 - 20 units/acre). This district is being added to accommodate housing needs established in
the Housing Element. The lowest residential densities are maintained in the hillsides by
designating the land rural and mountain residential. The highest residential densities are located
along transportation corridors where services are available. Almost all of the industrial areas are
developed; no new areas are being proposed for industrial designation. Areas designated Open
Space have been expanded to include the parks described in the Parks Master Plan.
HOLDING CAPACITY
Holding capacity is the maximum development of a community that can be accommodated if all
land uses shown on the General Plan Map were to be built. Any amendments to the General Plan
Map will, in turn, affect Scotts Valley's holding capacity. Capacity is expressed in terms of
population, housing units, square footage and jobs at buildout, in the year 2015 or beyond.
If all the residential land shown on the General Plan Map were built out, Scotts Valley would
contain approximately 6,500 housing units which would support a residential population of about
15,000 persons.
This holding capacity estimate assumes that residential land uses are built to maximum densities,
and household size will remain at 2.5 persons per household. Adding the dwellings in the
unincorporated planning area, the population in the planning area in the year 2005 would be
approximately 16,000.
If all the industrial, commercial, office and other employment generating land in the incorporated
areas were built out, Scotts Valley would contain approximately 6.2 million square feet of
building floor area - enough to support about 12,000 jobs. This holding capacity estimate
assumes that employment generating uses are built at maximum densities, and employment
growth will continue at approximate current rates. Table LU - 3 summarizes the number of
acres of each land use designated within the Scotts Valley city limits.

Another source of potential residential development is the vacant service commercial zones.
With the emphasis on providing housing along transportation corridors, the increasing scarcity of
vacant land and the zoning regulations which allow mixed uses, the City expects to see multi
family units developed in the service commercial zones. The most recent developments have
averaged 9 dwelling units per acre. With approximately 42.5 acres of vacant service commercial
land, an estimated 382 dwelling units could be constructed.
POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS
Residential growth in Scotts Valley has averaged 3.11% between 1960-1990. Assuming this rate
of growth will be sustained, projections of population growth can be made to buildout of the
General Plan. A population of 13,639 will be reached by the year 2005 and 15,000 holding
capacity by the year 2008. However, the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments
October 9, 2002, population projections for Scotts Valley show a population of 13,182 in 2005,
13,667 in 2010 and 13,864 in 2015. The average growth rate in Scotts Valley is currently less
than the 3.11% growth rate which was in place before 1990.
Employment growth in Scotts Valley has been estimated based upon past growth in city business
licenses. Based upon a 7.7% annual employment growth between 1982 and 1990, Scotts Valley
will have a projected job base of 8916 by the year 2000. At buildout, the projected job base
would be approximately 12,000 employees. Table LU-5 shows this calculation.

THE RELATIONSHIP OF JOBS AND HOUSING
The relationship between jobs and housing is a complex and often misunderstood issue which
affects all communities. Workers choose jobs and residential locations based on a variety of
personal, financial and locational factors, not simply on the basis of commute area. A certain
percentage of workers will choose to live great distances away from their place of employment.
The essence of the jobs/housing issue is to recognize these different types of commute behavior and
provide adequate housing opportunities within the commute area desired by each group of workers.
Planning to accommodate this diversity of commute patterns involves identifying and providing for
employment generated housing needs. From a practical perspective, fulfillment of this
responsibility is a regional concern which must allow for locational differences and varying needs
among communities within the larger commute distance. To date, the balance of
jobs/housing/employment throughout the region has not been analyzed. The Draft Congestion
Management Program of the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission and LAFCO
have alluded to such an analysis but neither has progressed with developing region-wide
information. Scotts Valley will continue to assess land use patterns based upon reducing single
occupancy vehicles, providing its fair share of regional housing and providing jobs, housing, and
services for its residents.

LO-2        To designate a variety of residential uses.
                   Policy
LP-3               The City shall promote the availability of adequate sites for a variety of
                   housing types and densities consistent with Housing Element goals and
                   environmental constraints.
                           Actions
LA-4                       The Planning Director shall maintain a map of available residential
                           land uses and shall provide an annual report to the City Council on the
                           availability of housing sites to meet all City needs.
LA-5                       The City shall re-designate, as appropriate, non-residential land uses
                           for residential use to meet the identified housing demand if the report
                           of the Planning Director so justifies it.
LA-6                       When identifying and zoning available housing sites, utilize AMBAG,
                           State Department of Finance, and any other agency housing data base
                           information as reference to help to determine short-term and
                           long-term housing type and density needs.
LA-7                       Zone vacant infill sites at densities sufficiently high to encourage
                           development, while respecting the character of surrounding uses.
LA-8                       Zone highest densities along transportation corridors.
LA-9                       Retain Planned Development zone in the municipal code to allow
                           flexibility in residential development.
LA-10
LA-11                      Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow residential mixed use projects
                           such as daycare, neighborhood retail, and businesses as long as the
                           uses are compatible with residential use.
                                                                                   LAND USE-15

LA-12                  The Bethany College area shall be designated as a special treatment
                       area. All future development of the Bethany College area shall be
                       reviewed and considered under the Planned Development zoning
                       regulations.
LA-13                  Implement the land use policies and site design solutions embodied in
                       the Glenwood and Skypark specific plans through rezoning,
                       discretionary permits and approvals. Nothing contained in the
                       General Plan shall be interpreted as inconsistent with the Glenwood or
                       Skypark specific plans as they may be amended from time to time or
                       readopted in an amended form.
        Objective
LO-13.1 Ensure that residential developments maintain the City’s aesthetics.
               Policy
LP-13.2        Public art, consistent with the urban forest concept or adopted design
               guidelines, should be incorporated into residential projects where feasible.
                       Action
LA-13.3                Subdivisions or multiple family development of greater than four
                       residential units should incorporate artistic elements and/or treatments
                       into structures, landscaping, common areas, or open space, as
                       approved by the City.
               Policy
LP-14          In areas where the existing lot pattern or size makes development difficult,
               the City shall encourage lot consolidation to provide larger sites or alternative
               patterns for residential development.
                       Action
LA-15                  Identify those areas where lot consolidation would provide sites more
                       suitable for residential development. Acting as the Redevelopment
                       Agency, develop a program to encourage lot consolidation in
                       identified areas in order to promote planned development.
        Objective
LO-16   Provide for residential densities consistent with slope conditions.
               Policy
LP-17          Land use densities should decrease with increasing land slope.
                                                                             LAND USE-16

                     Actions
LA-18                The City shall amend the zoning ordinance to encourage construction
                     on the flat or gently sloped areas of a parcel and discourage
                     construction on steeper slopes:
LA-19                Those areas of a parcel with slopes of less than 25% could be
                     considered for construction consistent with sound development and
                     planning principles.
LA-20                Land sloped 25% or greater may be considered for a "density transfer"
                     requiring the steeper slopes to be preserved with no disruption and
                     "transferring" the units that would be allowed on the slopes of 25% or
                     greater for construction on the more level portions of the parcel, if
                     these portions are otherwise suitable for higher densities.
LA-21                Land over 40% slope shall be preserved as open space, with no
                     construction of any kind with the exception of quarry reclamation.
                     During the development of the site the density for the 40% slopes may
                     be transferred for construction into the areas with a slope of less than
                     25% if these areas are otherwise suitable for higher densities.
LA-22                Any density transfer developments may be pursued under the planned
                     development ordinance.
LA-23                Tree covered slopes, no matter what the percent of slopes, should be
                     preserved to the maximum extent possible.
      Objective
LO-24 Ensure compatibility between residential development and surrounding land uses.
             Policy
LP-25        The City shall prohibit new land use activities within and in close proximity
             to residential zones that generate undesirable impacts which cannot be
             mitigated.
                     Action
LA-26                Through the environmental and permit review process, the City shall
                     identify projects which could impact residential zones in a negative
                     manner, and if such impacts cannot be mitigated, the City shall deny
                     the project.
      Objective
LO-27 Provide sufficient acreage to promote planned commercial development.
                                                                            LAND USE-17
                                          17
             Policy
LP-28        The City shall promote availability of commercial sites to accommodate a
             mix of professional office, service commercial, and shopping center
             developments consistent with the environmental, service, and economic goals
             of the City.
                     Actions
LA-29                Maintain a map of vacant land and land that could be redeveloped that
                     is available for commercial development. Update the map once per
                     year and make it available to developers.
             Policy
LP-30        In areas where the existing lot pattern or size makes development difficult,
             the City shall encourage lot consolidation in order to promote planned
             commercial development.
                     Action
LA-31                Identify those areas where lot consolidation would provide sites more
                     suitable for commercial development. Acting as the Redevelopment
                     Agency, develop a program to encourage lot consolidation in
                     identified areas in order to promote planned development.
      Objective
LO-32 Ensure that commercial developments maintain the City's aesthetics.
             Policy
LP-33        Commercial developments shall be designed and screened in an attractive
             manner and thereafter maintained so as to integrate the entire development
             visually with the overall natural beauty of the Planning Area.
                     Actions
LA-34                Commercial development shall be conditioned to install landscaped
                     areas on no less than 10% of the total site area. Landscape
                     maintenance agreements shall be made a condition of permit issuance.
                     This shall be added to the Design Review Guidelines
LA-35                The City's Mission Statement describing the character of the City and
                     design standards associated with that character shall be incorporated
                     into the Design Review Guidelines. The Design Review Guidelines
                     shall be approved by the Council and Planning Commission.
LA-36                The City shall pursue a program of amortization and require
                     abatement of those signs not in conformance with the ordinance.
                                                                          LAND USE-18

LP-36.1        Commercial development should include public art.
                      Actions
LA-36.2               Commercial development should incorporate artistic elements and/or
                      treatments into the architecture, landscape design, and infrastructure
                      where appropriate.
LA-36.3               Public art shall become part of the design review guidelines and made
                      available to developers, architects, landscape designers, city
                      committees and commissions. All public art shall be reviewed by the
                      Planning Commission.
