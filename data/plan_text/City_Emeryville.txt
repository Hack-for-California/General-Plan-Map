  Land Use
  How land is used underlies the experience of living, working, or visiting any urban area,
  making Land Use a pivotal element of any General Plan. This chapter of the General
  Plan provides the basis for land use decision-making; establishes the land use classifi-
  cation system, intensity and height standards; and outlines citywide and area-specific
  land use policies. An assessment of the City’s revenue generation, by land use type, is
  also included to better understand the influence that land use has on the City’s fiscal
  health. For more specific policies on the design of buildings and public spaces, please
  see Chapter 5: Urban Design.

  Transportation
  The General Plan recognizes that an efficient multi-modal transportation plan, coupled
  with wise land use planning, is essential to improving quality of life, supporting eco-
  nomic vitality, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Transportation Element
  seeks to create a well-connected transportation network that accommodates cars,
  public transit, walking, and biking.

that of in-commuters (20%). This is influenced by the
substantial proportion of residents that are employed
in San Francisco, Berkeley or Oakland (the top desti-
nations), which can be easily accessed by public trans-
portation from Emeryville.
The journey to work is only one aspect of travel pat-
terns. People also travel for shopping, school, personal
business, recreation, and other reasons. Shopping
trips are especially important in Emeryville because
of the large number of retail stores. However, similar
detailed data is not available for these other trip pur-
poses. While they do not constitute the whole picture,
journey to work patterns are important to understand
because they make up the bulk of the traffic during the
busiest time of day, the “p.m. peak hour” (rush hour),
which largely determines the types of transportation
improvements that are typically proposed.

3.4  WALKING                                                A Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan was prepared in 1998
                                                            and has been updated to reflect changes since that
Walking is part of every trip, whether it is from the park- time. It contains a greater level of detail about pedes-
ing lot to a building or from home to a bus stop, work, or  trian and bicycle facilities, and their implementation,
store. The walking environment is an important element      than is appropriate in the General Plan. The Bicycle
of the public realm and a fundamental component of land     and Pedestrian Plan will need to be updated to be
use planning, design standards, and guidelines.             consistent with this General Plan.
Emeryville’s pedestrian network consists of side-
walks and street crossings with some off-road paths
and trails. There are still a few locations in Emeryville
with no sidewalks, where pedestrians must share the
street with motor vehicles and bicyclists. In the indus-
trial and commercial areas, large blocks, railroad and
freeway corridors act as barriers to pedestrian travel.
These barriers to pedestrian movement limit the via-
bility of walking as a form of transportation.
Recognizing the importance of walking trips to pro-
mote health, provide transportation choice, and
reduce vehicle congestion, a pedestrian circulation
system has been developed and is set forth in Figure
3-4. It consists of the following:
•	 Off-road pedestrian paths and routes, either exclu-
    sively for pedestrians or shared with bicyclists.
•	 Pedestrian priority zones along city streets.
•	 “Key Pedestrian Streets” connecting parks and open
    spaces, as identified in the Open Space Element.
•	 New and existing overpasses and underpasses
    across the railroad and freeway.
•	 The Bay Trail: a regional pedestrian and bicycle
    route that will eventually encircle San Francisco
    Bay and cross it at various places. The City of
    Emeryville’s preferred Bay Trail alignment is set
                                                            Walking can feel unsafe along narrow sidewalks when surrounded by wide streets, surface lots, and parking entrances (left).
    forth in Figure 3-5.                                    Creating a network of streets with pedestrian-oriented features (right) can improve the connectivity of the pedestrian realm and
                                                            encourage walking trips.

  Parks, Open Space, Public Facilities,

  Parks, open space, public facilities, and services are a vital part of a livable, sustain-
  able Emeryville. While they are essential in any city, they become even more important

  relaxation, informal sports, passive and active recreation, social and cultural events and
  a break from the stresses of everyday life.

Improvements
Open Space System
The General Plan proposes several different park types
to accommodate the needs of present and future resi-
dents and to create a cohesive network of open spaces:
two new large parks, several new pocket parks and small
plazas, two greenways, and a series of green streets con-
necting major activity centers. These proposed park and
recreation facilities—which total to between 41 and 46
acres—are described in Table 4-2 and shown on Figure
4-1. The small parks are identified with circles; actual
sites will be identified during the planning period.

A critical part of establishing the identity of Emeryville The quality of building materials and finishes play
as a whole involves “gateways.” These are specially-       a large role in people’s judgment of neighborhood
designed landmark elements to be located at key            quality. The General Plan seeks to provide consistent
entrances to the city as shown in Figure 5-1. It is essen- guidelines and coherence with existing and historic
tial that gateway features be unique in design, visible    structures, while allowing for variety and freedom of
to both motorists and pedestrians, and emblematic of       design. To that end, the City’s Design Guidelines out-

Signage
Wayfinding signage is envisioned as a a way helping to
make Emeryville more navigable and visitor-friendly,
by providing signage, kiosks, public art and other
navigation tools. Signage is to be provided to address
the presence of all major destinations within the city,
including key pedestrian and bicycle paths, crossings
and overpasses; the Greenway and Key Green Streets;
neighborhood centers and activity nodes; the Bay Trail;
and major city parks. Signage efforts may also be incor-
porated into neighborhood streetscape and gateway ele-
ments, to become part of an integrated plan for creating
and articulating identity. The City Council has already

  Conservation, Safety, and Noise
  This chapter establishes goals and policies for the conservation of natural and cultural
  resources, and for the protection of the community from hazards and excessive noise.
  While there are many benefits to the compact, mixed use nature of the city, it presents
  challenges in addressing safety and noise concerns that are not as apparent in cities
  where potentially harmful activities and residents are separated.

of liquefaction hazards can include edge containment
structures (e.g. berms, dikes, retaining walls, etc.),
driving piles, removal or treatment of liquefiable soils,
or modification of site geometry.
The City’s Building Division implements and enforces
the Emeryville Municipal Code and the California
Building Code regulations relative to seismic risk to
development. A City Ordinance specifies the need
and establishes guidelines for the seismic upgrade of
unreinforced masonry buildings. An increase in occu-
pancy or intensification of use triggers the require-
ment for a seismic upgrade. Over the past ten years 75
percent of the City’s unreinforced masonry buildings
have been upgraded for seismic safety. The City also
provides a program for voluntary upgrades of single
family homes.
In 2009, the City is expected to compete a Local Haz-
ards Mitigation Plan to mitigate natural hazards and
enhance resistance.

  Sustainability
  The purpose of sustainability in Emeryville—and its incorporation throughout the
  General Plan—is to take responsibility for the urban development and population
  growth projected during the planning period and their potential impact on the
  environment. By implementing sustainable design measures and policies, Emeryville
  can reduce its contribution to global climate change, minimize its reliance on foreign oil
  and other fossil-fuel sources, and decrease consumption of natural resources.

PARKS, OPEN SPACE, PUBLIC FACILITIES, AND SERVICES POLICIES
PP-P-1	 Increase park acreage to serve the needs of the growing population and address current-deficiencies in
        park and open space standards. Maintain a standard of three new acres of parkland per 1,000 new resi-
        dents, and 0.25 acres per 1,000 new employees.
PP-P-2	 Two new large parks (five acres or larger), one each north and south of Powell Street, shall be provided. Ac-
        tive recreation uses will be a component of these parks. The northern park site is bounded by 61st, 64th,
        Hollis, and Doyle streets. There are two potential southern park sites:
          ››One potential southern park site is shown on the PG&E site on Hollis Street, between 45th and 53rd
            streets. On this site, consideration shall be given as to how to incorporate the existing buildings, which
            are rated Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the Park Avenue District Plan, into future park uses.
          ››The second potential southern park site is located at the AC Transit bus yard between 45th and 47th
            streets, adjacent to the proposed Center of Community Life. Should this site become available, the City
            shall explore the possibility of a public park—along with other public uses. If a large park at this site is fea-
            sible and is considered desirable, all or part of the PG&E site may no longer be needed for a public park.
PP-P-3	 New smaller open spaces—including public plazas and places, community gardens, and pocket parks—will
        provide local focus points and diversify the built environment. These should be developed through the identi-
        fication of underutilized and strategically located parcels, and the redevelopment of larger sites.
PP-P-5	 A system of greenways and Green Streets, as tree-lined open spaces, and as continuous recreational
        paths for bicyclists, joggers, and pedestrians, linking parks and activity centers.
PP-P-6	 The north-south Emeryville Greenway will be expanded, enhancing its role as an open space corridor and
         connector across the City, and a source of inspiration and community pride. The City will support the
         expansion of a park at the Sherwin Williams site, in coordination with the development of Horton Landing
         Park and the Greenway.
PP-P-7	 An east-west greenway located generally along the path of Temescal Creek will be created. This will include
        water features to celebrate the creek and improvements to the riparian corridor, where feasible, while
        maintaining existing drainage capabilities.
PP-P-10	Efficient use of open space will be achieved through techniques such as rooftop play courts and gardens,
        joint use of sports and recreation facilities at schools, co-location of parks with child care facilities, and
        possible use of underground parking below new plazas and parks.
PP-P-12	Design, landscaping, lighting, and traffic calming measures will be employed to create safe parks and
        open spaces.
PP-P-13	Open spaces that have deteriorated, have design features that limit access and use opportunities, and/or
        are in need of activity shall be revitalized.
PP-P-16	The City will continue to partner with Emery Unified School District to optimize the joint-use of school facili-

URBAN DESIGN POLICIES
UD-P-1	 The city shall strive to accentuate activity and presence at the street level, particularly along pedestrian-
         oriented corridors and in residential areas.
UD-P-2	 Parks and open space is required with new development, consistent with Figure 4-1 in the Parks, Open
         Space, Public Facilities and Services chapter.
UD-P-3	 Parks and open space shall be accessible and available to the public through site design standards for minimum
         size/dimensions, visibility, and location along public rights-of-way, particularly Green Streets (Figure 5-3).
UD-P-4	 New development will be required to extend the street grid or pedestrian connections wherever possible.
UD-P-20	The street grid shall be extended as redevelopment on larger sites occurs.
UD-P-22	The City shall maintain and enhance an integrated pattern of streets, pedestrian paths, and bike routes
         through a fine-grain street grid that enables efficient movement throughout the city.
UD-P-24	 The City shall establish Pedestrian Priority Zones in regional and neighborhood centers, around schools, parks,
         and in other locations as indicated in Figure 5-3. While wider sidewalks, street lighting, bulbed crosswalks, and
         other pedestrian amenities should be employed throughout the city, they are prioritized in these locations.
UD-P-40	 Neighborhood structure and pedestrian scale development should be prioritized. The scale and character of exist-
         ing neighborhoods should be maintained to ensure connectivity and continuity of street design within each district.
UD-P-47	Streetscape landscaping shall follow Bay-Friendly Landscaping guidelines and serve the dual purpose of
         treating stormwater runoff and providing shade and beauty to the urban realm.
UD-P-53	 Use of the greenways shall be reinforced by fronting entrances to both commercial and residential devel-
         opment to the public pathway.
           ››Encourage open spaces and plazas adjacent to the greenways.
           ››Encourage other public-oriented ground level uses such as workshops, lobbies, and common areas.
UD-P-58	 Large surface parking lots shall be replaced with structured parking and incorporated into high density
          mixed-use developments. New or expanded large surface parking lots are not allowed.
UD-P-69	 The pedestrian environment shall be enhanced with multiple neighborhood access points, through-streets,
         and pedestrian pathways.
UD-P-70	 Street-level uses should reinforce neighborhood center streets and allow a vertical mix of a diverse range
         of land uses including offices, hotels and residential uses compatible with neighborhood center functions.
UD-P-72	Public space and plazas for gathering and expanded ground-floor retail activities are encouraged. These
         elements enhance the pedestrian realm and provide opportunities for social interaction.

  Implementation Program
  The General Plan provides specific policy guidance for implementation of plan concepts
  in each of the Plan elements and establishes a basis for action. The policies in each
  element of the Plan provide details that will guide program development. This chapter
  describes, in general terms, the responsibilities for implementation.
