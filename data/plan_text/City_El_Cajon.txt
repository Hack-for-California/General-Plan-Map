Section 1: Introduction
A. Legal	Framework	
This 2013-2021 Housing Element represents the City of El Cajon’s effort in fulfilling the
requirements under the State Housing Element law. The California State Legislature has
identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living environment for every
Californian as the State’s major housing goal. Recognizing the important role of local planning
and housing programs in the pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities
and counties prepare a housing element as part of the comprehensive General Plan.
Pursuant to State law, the Housing Element must be updated periodically according to
statutory deadlines. This Housing Element covers the planning period of January 1, 2013
through April 30, 2021.
The Element must include the following components:
           An analysis of the City’s population, household, and employment base, and the
            characteristics of the housing stock.
           A summary of the present and projected housing needs of the City’s households.
           A review of potential constraints to meeting the City’s identified housing needs.
           An evaluation of opportunities that will further the development of new housing.
           A statement of the Housing Plan to address the identified housing needs.
B. Relationship	to	the	General	Plan	
The City of El Cajon General Plan underwent an update in 2001, and is comprised of the
following elements: 1) Annexation; 2) Circulation; 3) Conservation; 4) Historic Preservation; 5)
Housing; 6) Land Use; 7) Noise; 8) Open Space and Parks; 9) Safety; 10) Hazardous Waste
Management; and 11) Solid Waste Management. The Housing Element is being updated at this
time in conformance with the 2013-2021 update cycle for jurisdictions in the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG) region. The Housing Element builds upon the other
General Plan elements and is entirely consistent with the policies set forth by the General Plan,
as amended. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the Plan (including the
Housing Element) will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
The City also recognizes that recent changes to State laws require the updating of various
elements of the General Plan, upon update of the Housing Element, to address the following
issues:
      •     AB 162 – Update to the Land Use, Conservation, and Safety Elements to address flood
            hazards and flood management
Section	1:	                                          	                                 City	of	El	Cajon

      •     SB 244 – Update to the Land Use Element to address the provision of public services
            and infrastructure to disadvantaged unincorporated communities
      •     SB 1241 – Update to the Safety Element to address fire hazards (for Housing Element
            revisions due on or after January 1, 2014)

Section 2: Community Outreach
A. Outreach	during	Development	of	Housing	
      Element	
1. Outreach	at	Community	Events	
The City of El Cajon conducted an extensive community outreach program to obtain public
input on housing needs, policies, and programs as part of the development of the 2013-2020
Housing Element. On June 26, 2012 the City Council approved a Public Participation Plan (see
Appendix A). The City also conducted outreach at the
following community events:
           Cajon Classic Cruise: July 18, 2012
           Concerts on the Green: August 24, 2012
           El Cajon Safety & Career Expo: October 8,
            2012
           Mother Goose Parade: November 18, 2012
A total of ten individuals stopped by the Cajon Classic
Cruise booth and three individuals filled out housing
surveys. A total of 12 individuals stopped by the booth and four individuals filled out housing
surveys at the Concerts on the Green event at Prescott Promenade on August 24, 2012. The top
priorities of those individuals that filled out surveys were as follows:
      Housing Needs:
      1. Senior and disabled housing
      2. Homeless
      3. Large families
      Housing Constraints:
      1. Public services/facilities
      2. Lower income
      3. Availability of mortgage and rehabilitation financing
      Housing Programs:
      1. Homeless shelters
      2. First time homebuyer assistance/residential rehabilitation

2. Information	Distribution	
The City distributed information and updates on the City’s website and Facebook page
throughout the development of the Housing Element:
              http://www.ci.el-cajon.ca.us/dept/comm/housing%20element.html
3. Public	Meetings	
a. Community Meetings
Two housing element community meetings were held on July 18, 2012. The first meeting was at
3 p.m. and the second meeting was at 7 p.m. A total of 10 stakeholders/interested residents
attended the first meeting and two attended the second meeting. Those attending the first
meeting were primarily representatives of housing advocacy organizations. All attendees
participated in a priority setting exercise and filled out surveys to help staff prioritize housing
needs, housing constraints and housing programs.
Cumulative top priorities of those participating in the workshops were as follows:
      Housing Needs:
      1. Housing for low income households
      2. Large families
      3. Transitional/homeless housing
      4. Senior and disabled housing
      Housing Constraints:
      1. Land use regulations
      2. Access to transit
      3. Availability of residentially-zoned land
      4. Public services/facilities
      Housing Programs:
      1. Project based Section 8 housing
      2. Protecting affordable units at-risk for converting to market rate
      3. First-time home-buyer assistance
b. Planning Commission Meetings
Throughout the development of the Housing Element, City staff briefed the Planning
Commission on the community outreach process and public input received.

Section 3: Community Profile
The City of El Cajon strives to achieve a balanced housing stock that meets the varied needs of
all income segments of the community. To understand the City’s housing needs, the nature of
the existing housing stock and the housing market are comprehensively evaluated. This section
of the Housing Element discusses the major components of housing needs in El Cajon,
including population, household, economic and housing stock characteristics. Each of these
components is presented in a regional context, and, where relevant, in the context of other
nearby communities. This assessment serves as the basis for identifying the appropriate goals,
policies, and programs for the City to implement during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle.
A.Population	Characteristics	
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the
future needs of a community. Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing
that is needed in a community. Population growth, age profile, race/ethnicity of residents, and
employment trends are factors that combine to influence the type of housing needed and the
ability of residents to afford housing.
1. Population	Growth	
Population growth is one of the most important factors in determining the existing and future
need for housing. The most significant increase in the rate of El Cajon’s population growth
occurred between 1950 and 1960, when the City’s population increased over 500 percent. While
annexation accounted for a large part of this growth, much of it was also spurred by the
migration of people into San Diego County who needed affordable housing. The City’s
population continued to increase in the 1970s and 1980s, but at noticeable slower rates.
El Cajon’s population grew noticeably by approximately 20 percent between 1980 and 1990. By
2000, El Cajon remained the fifth largest city in the County with a population of 94,819, but the
City’s population increased only seven percent (Figure 1). The 2010 Census reported that El
Cajon’s population increased moderately (five percent) from 94,819 in 2000 to 99,478 in 2010
(Table 1).
The SANDAG 2050 Regional Growth Forecast estimates that the El Cajon population will reach
109,623 by 2020. Although population growth in the City has been notably slower than in the
County, population trends for the City are in line with those of nearby jurisdictions, including
La Mesa, Lemon Grove, and National City.

2. Age	Profile	
A community’s current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age
characteristics of its residents. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and
sizes, ability to earn incomes, and therefore, housing preferences. As people move through each
stage of life, housing needs and preferences change. Traditional assumptions are that the young
adult population (20 to 34 years old) tends to favor apartments, low to moderate cost
townhomes/condominiums, and smaller single-family units. The adult population (35 to 64
years old) represents the major market for moderate to relatively high cost condominiums and
single-family homes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends to generate demand for
low to moderate cost apartments and condominiums, group living arrangements, smaller
single-family units, and mobile homes. In order to create a balanced community, it is important

to provide housing options that suit the needs of various age groups, allowing residents to age
in place.
The median age of El Cajon residents in 1990 was 29.9, which increased to 31.9 in 2000,
according to the Census. Despite the increase in median age, the City’s population remained
younger than the County’s as a whole, which had a median age of 33.2 in 2000. Like the
County, El Cajon also had a sizable elderly population. In 2000, elderly residents comprised
approximately 11 percent of both the El Cajon and County population.
In 2010, approximately 26 percent of                          Figure 2: Age Distribution (1990-2010)

3. Race/Ethnic	Composition	
The race/ethnic composition of residents may have implications for housing needs to the extent
that different groups have different household characteristics, income levels, and cultural
backgrounds that may affect their housing needs and preferences. Studies have also suggested
that different racial and ethnic groups differ in their attitudes toward and/or tolerance for
“housing problems” as defined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), including overcrowding and housing cost burden.1
Between 1990 and 2000, El Cajon became increasingly diverse in its racial and ethnic makeup.
This trend follows County, state and national trends. In California, no one ethnic group holds a
majority. In El Cajon, however, the White population still constituted substantially more than
half the City residents in 2000. According to the 2000 Census, the population in El Cajon was
comprised of 64 percent non-Hispanic White persons. The Hispanic/Latino population was the
second largest racial/ethnic group in the City at 23 percent. Black/African Americans, Asians,
and other racial/ethnic groups constituted only a small proportion of the population. By 2010,
El Cajon was 57 percent White, 28 percent Hispanic, six percent Black/African American, five
percent Other, three percent Asian, and less than one percent Pacific Islander and American
Indian (Figure 3).

El Cajon had a noticeably higher proportion of White residents and smaller proportion of
Hispanic/Latino residents than Lemon Grove, National City and the City of San Diego in 2010
(Figure 3). The City’s proportion of Black/African-Americans and those of “Other” racial and
ethnic backgrounds was roughly similar to that of neighboring jurisdictions and the County,
with the exception of Santee and Lemon Grove. In general, Hispanic/Latino and Asian/Pacific
Islander households exhibit a greater propensity for living in extended families or other
household arrangements than the White population. Communities with larger proportions of
Hispanic/Latino and Asian households tend to have larger average household sizes.
4. Economic	Characteristics	
Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Incomes associated with different jobs
and the number of workers in a household often determines the type and size of housing a
household can afford. In some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and
demand (such as in communities with military installations, college campuses, and large
amounts of seasonal agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to strong housing
demand, while the reverse is true when employment contracts.
The San Diego Region has a large and diverse economy that has grown steadily over the past
several decades and has attracted workers from all over the southwestern United States. El
Cajon is situated east of the County’s largest employment center, the City of San Diego.
a. Occupations
The labor statistics reported by the American Community Survey (ACS) reflect a similar
employment profile in 2010 as in 2000, with the top three largest occupational categories for
City residents being Sales and Office; Management, Business, Science and Arts; and Service.
These categories accounted for a majority (79 percent) of the jobs held by El Cajon residents. By
comparison, these occupations accounted for 83 percent of the jobs held by County residents.

b. Wages
The Management, Business, Science and Arts occupations usually generate employment at the
above moderate income levels. Many El Cajon residents, however, are employed in Sales and
Office and Service occupations, which generally provide jobs at lower income scales, as shown
in Table 4.
Table 4 displays mean annual wage data for occupations compiled by the California
Employment Development Department (EDD) for the San Diego Metropolitan Statistical Area
in 2011. Table 4 shows that the food preparation and serving, personal care and service,
building and maintenance, and farming, fishing and forestry occupations offer the lowest
wages.

c. Unemployment
According to the State Employment Development Department, 54,100 El Cajon residents were
in the labor force as of March 2012, with an unemployment rate of 13 percent. Unemployment
rate in San Diego County was 9.5 percent.
B. Household	Characteristics	
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include
single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood and unrelated
individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories or
other group living situations are not considered households. Household type and size, income
levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other household characteristics determine
the type of housing needed by residents, their preferences, and their ability to obtain housing
that meets their needs. This section details the various household characteristics affecting
housing needs.
According to the 2010 Census, 1,086,865 households occupied housing units in San Diego
County. Of these households, 34,134 households (about three percent) were located in El Cajon.
1. Household	Type	and	Size	
Housing need generally varies by household type and size. Single-person households, typified
by seniors or young adults, tend to reside in apartment units or smaller single-family homes.
Families typically prefer and occupy single-family homes. However, with limited vacant land
remaining, opportunity for new single-family construction is limited. Future residential growth
in El Cajon will most likely focus on multi-family housing construction.
a. Household Type
The number of households in El Cajon increased five percent between 1990 and 2000, from
32,893 to 34,370 households. Average household size in the City increased from 2.63 persons in
1990 to 2.70 persons in 2000, reflecting an increasingly family-oriented community.
The latest Census data indicates that 34,134 households lived in El Cajon in 2010. Of these
households, 23 percent were single-persons and 19 percent were headed by seniors (65+) (see
Table 5). Single person households made up a higher proportion of total households in El Cajon
than nearby National City and Santee, while the proportion of senior-headed households was
on par with that of all nearby jurisdictions and the County. About 35 percent of El Cajon’s
households consisted of families with children; a larger proportion than that found in most
nearby cities and the County, with the exception of National City. The proportion of single-
parent households is the second highest among jurisdictions compared in Table 5. El Cajon’s
proportion of large renter-households is significantly greater than the proportion of these
households in other jurisdictions and throughout the County.

Figure 4 shows that, in 2010, El Cajon households consisted mostly of families (69 percent,
including families with or without children, and other families). Slightly more of these families
were married couples with children, 7,878 families, compared to 7,729 married couple families
without children. The composition of different household types that make up the City of El
Cajon has remained virtually unchanged between 2000 and 2010; however, the greatest change
during this time period was the eight percent increase in other family households and six
percent decrease in other non-family households. Other non-family households are defined as
households which do not have any members related to the householder.

b. Household Size
Household size is a significant factor in housing demand. Often, household size can be used to
predict the unit size that a household will select. In 2010, the average number of persons per
household in the San Diego region ranged from 2.1 to 3.5, with a countywide average of 2.8
persons per household. El Cajon had an average of 2.8 persons per household, representing a
modest increase from 2000, when the Census reported 2.7 persons per household. Table 6
compares household size in El Cajon to household size in surrounding cities and the County.
The average household size in El Cajon was substantially higher than nearby La Mesa but
noticeably lower than National City. The City’s average household size was comparable to that
of Santee, Lemon Grove and the County. SANDAG estimates that average household size in
the region will increase slightly over the next 20 years.

2. Household	Income	
Household income is an indication of wealth in a community and therefore is directly
connected to the ability of residents to afford housing. As household income increases, a
household is more likely to be a homeowner. As household income decreases, a household is
more likely to pay a disproportionate amount of their income for housing or reside in
overcrowded or inadequate housing.
For planning and funding purposes, the California State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) has developed the following income categories based on the
Area Median Income (AMI) of a metropolitan area (such as San Diego County):
           Extremely Low Income: households earning up to 30 percent of the AMI
           Very Low Income: households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI
           Low Income: households earning between 51 percent and 80 percent of the AMI
           Moderate Income: households earning between 81 percent and 120 percent of the AMI
           Above Moderate Income: households earning over 120 percent of the AMI

Combined, the extremely low, very low, and low income groups are referred to as lower
income.
The 2010 Census does not contain information on household income. Household income data
was collected by the Census Bureau through the American Community Survey (ACS). Table 7
presents the ACS household income data categorized into income levels by HUD in the
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).                                        Between 2006 and 2008,
approximately 48 percent of El Cajon households earned moderate or above moderate incomes,
while 52 percent of households had lower incomes.2

Note: This data was developed using the average results from the 2006-2008 American Community Survey, utilizing only small
samples of the population. Therefore, the total number of households is only an extrapolation and does not match the total
reported number of households in the community.

Household incomes in El Cajon tend to be lower than those in the region as a whole. Median
household income in the City was $35,566 in 2000, compared to the San Diego County median
household income of $47,067. Figure 5 compares household income in El Cajon with the
household income of neighboring jurisdictions and the San Diego region as a whole between
2006 and 2010. Median household income in the City was on the lower end of the spectrum for
the region but comparable to surrounding jurisdictions. Specifically, the ACS estimates that the
median household income in El Cajon during this time was $47,048, compared to $63,069 in the
County.
According to the 2006-2010 ACS, 14 percent of El Cajon households had incomes lower than
$15,000, while 27 percent of households earned less than $25,000 (Figure 6). Approximately 26
percent of the City’s households earned incomes between $25,000 and $49,999, while a slightly
higher proportion (32 percent) had incomes between $50,000 and $99,999. Only 16 percent of El
Cajon households earned $100,000 or more annually between 2006 and 2010. By comparison, the
County’s income distribution during this time period was skewed toward the higher income
categories.
2 Data was obtained from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared for HUD by the Census Bureau
using 2006-2008 American Community Survey (ACS). CHAS data does not provide a breakdown of household income for those
with more than 80 percent AMI as those households are not qualified for federal housing programs.

      C. Housing	Problems	
      The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed for HUD provides
      detailed information on housing needs by income level for different household types in El
      Cajon (Table 8). Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
                 Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
                 Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
                 Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
                 Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
      The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some highlights
      include:
                 In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (59 percent)
                  compared to owner-households (45 percent).
                 Large renter-families had the highest level of housing problems regardless of income
                  level (86 percent).
                 Extremely low income (81 percent) and very low income households (86 percent) had
                  the highest incidence of housing problems.
                 Housing problems disproportionately affected elderly renters (67 percent) compared
                  to elderly owners (27 percent).

Note: Data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from sample Census data. The number of households in each category
usually deviates slightly from the 100% total due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total households. Interpretations of these data
should focus on the proportion of households in need of assistance rather than on precise numbers.

1. Cost	Burden	(Overpayment)	
Measuring the portion of a household’s gross income that is spent for housing is an indicator of
the dynamics of demand and supply. This measurement is often expressed in terms of “over
payers”: households paying an excessive amount of their income for housing, therefore
decreasing the amount of disposable income available for other needs. This indicator is an
important measurement of local housing market conditions as it reflects the affordability of
housing in the community. Federal and state agencies use overpayment indicators to determine
the extent and level of funding and support that should be allocated to a community. State and
federal programs typically define over-payers as those lower income households paying over 30
percent of household income for housing costs. A household is considered experiencing a
severe cost burden if it spends more than 50 percent of its gross income on housing.
Table 9 presents overpayment detail by income group for El Cajon. Approximately 71 percent of
lower income households overpaid for housing between 2006 and 2008 versus 26 percent of
moderate and above moderate income households. The CHAS data indicate cost burden
impacted renter-households more as a group than owner-households. Approximately 55
percent of renter- households paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing compared
to 43 percent of owner-households. Extremely low and very low income renter-households
experienced the highest incidence of cost burden (84 percent and 92 percent, respectively).

ACS data echo the finding that renters were more impacted by cost burden than owners.
Between 2006 and 2010, like the CHAS, the ACS reported that 43 percent of owner-occupied
households in El Cajon spent more than 30 percent of their household income on housing. By
contrast, a higher percentage of renter-households (60 percent) overpaid for housing.
2. Overcrowding	
The combination of low incomes and high housing costs has forced many households to live in
overcrowded housing conditions. “Overcrowding” is generally defined as a housing unit
occupied by more than one person per room in house (including living room and dining rooms,
but excluding hallways, kitchen, and bathrooms). Severe overcrowding is defined as more than
1.5 occupants per room. Overcrowding can indicate that a community does not have an
adequate supply of affordable housing, especially for large families. Overcrowding tends to
accelerate the deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy
and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing the quality of life.
As indicated by the 2000 Census, approximately 13 percent of the City’s households were
overcrowded. The incidence of overcrowding in El Cajon was higher than that of the County
(12 percent). About seven percent of El Cajon households were severely overcrowded in 2000
(Table 10). Overcrowding disproportionately affected renters (19 percent of renters versus just
four percent of owners); indicating overcrowding may be the result of an inadequate supply of
larger sized rental units.
Between 2000 and 2010, overcrowding in the City, as documented by the Census, declined
noticeably (Table 10). Only nine percent of El Cajon households lived in overcrowded
conditions during this time period. Overcrowding continued to have a disproportionate impact
on renters, however. Approximately 13 percent of renter-households lived in overcrowded
units compared to less than four percent of owner-households. However, the Census
documentation of overcrowding may under-represent the actual condition in the City. The City
often processes code compliance cases with persons living in unauthorized rooms/units, such
as garages, sheds, and room conversions.

D. Special	Needs	Groups	
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment
and income, family characteristics, disability and household characteristics, among other
factors. Consequently, certain residents in El Cajon may experience higher incidences of
housing cost burden, overcrowding, or other housing problems. As required by State law, the
special needs groups analyzed in this Housing Element include seniors, persons with
disabilities, large households, single-parent households, farmworkers, and the homeless (Table
11). Many of these groups overlap, for example some farmworkers are homeless, and many
seniors have a disability of some type. The majority of these special needs groups would be
assisted by an increase in affordable housing, especially housing located near public
transportation and services.

The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular
group as well as programs and services available to address their housing needs.
1. Seniors	
Many senior-headed households have special needs due to relatively low or fixed incomes,
disabilities or limitations, and health care or dependency needs. Limited discretionary income
and impaired physical mobility can make it difficult for seniors to maintain their homes. Many
elderly also rely on public transportation, especially those with disabilities.
In the San Diego region, seniors spend a higher percentage of their income for food, housing,
medical care, and personal care than non-elderly families. Many senior households need

smaller units to make independent living possible and many single elderly persons need some
form of housing assistance.
According to the Census, approximately 10,749 seniors (65 years of age and older) resided in El
Cajon in 2000, representing 11 percent of the total population. Approximately 4,252 persons
were considered frail elderly with a disability. A disproportionate number of senior households
had lower incomes (62 percent) compared to all residents (52 percent). Approximately 34
percent of lower income elderly households experienced one or more housing problems such as
overpayment and inadequate housing.
Table 12 shows that 10,930 persons were age 65 and over in El Cajon in 2010. This accounted for
about 11 percent of residents, almost identical to the percentage found in the region as a whole.
In 2010, 19 percent of City households were headed by someone 65 years old or older. Of these
households, the majority (64 percent) owned their homes, while the remainder (36 percent)
rented their homes. Housing cost burden has a greater impact on lower income elderly renters.
According to CHAS data, 77 percent of these households overpaid for housing between 2006
and 2008 (Table 8). Aside from cost burden problems faced by seniors due to their relatively
fixed incomes, many seniors also lived with various disabilities. Roughly 47 percent of El
Cajon’s senior population was reported by the 2008-2010 ACS as having one or more
disabilities.

The East County Council on Aging (ECCOA), which was incorporated into the Center for Social
Advocacy, is located in El Cajon and provides information on services to seniors including
counseling, education, emergency services, finances, health, legal, nutrition, recreation,
transportation, and volunteer and employment opportunities. ECCOA also oversees the Shared
Housing program which matches individuals with homeowners to reduce living costs, increase
expendable income, and provide companionship and security.
San Diego County also offers a variety of programs aimed at helping seniors and increasing
affordable housing:
           The County’s Health and Human Services Agency provides funding for in-home
            supportive services to elderly and disabled persons who need assistance to live at
            home.
           The County‘s Aging and Independence Services (AIS) provides services to older
            adults, people with disabilities and their family members, to help keep clients safely in
            their homes, promote healthy and vital living, and publicize positive contributions
            made by older adults and persons with disabilities. Services provided by AIS or
            through contracts with community-based organizations include information services,
            home-based services, protection and advocacy, health independence services and
            community enrichment.
           The County’s Elder Law and Advocacy program provides adults age 60 and older
            with an affordable way to manage simple legal matters. Additionally, this program
            provides free assistance to family caregivers of persons 60 and older.
2. Persons	with	Disabilities	
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working,
restrict one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, disabled persons often have
special housing needs related to limited earning capacity, a lack of accessible and affordable
housing, and higher health costs associated with a disability. Some residents suffer from
disabilities that require living in a supportive or institutional setting.
The 2010 Census did not collect information on disability. According to 2008-2010 ACS data,
approximately 14 percent of El Cajon residents had a disability. The ACS also tallied the
number of disabilities by type for residents with one or more disabilities. Among the disabilities
tallied, cognitive and ambulatory difficulties were almost equally prevalent. However, among
the elderly population, ambulatory and independent living difficulties were most prevalent
(Table 13).

A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability”
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
           Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
            physical impairments;
           Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
           Is likely to continue indefinitely;
           Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
            major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d)
            mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-
            sufficiency; and
           Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
            interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
            assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
            coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration
on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that
can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equates to 1,492 persons in the
City of El Cajon with developmental disabilities, based on the 2010 Census population.
Developmental Disabilities
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, approximately 1,350 El Cajon
residents with developmental disabilities sought services in the San Diego County Regional
Center. Most of these individuals reside in a private home with their parent or guardian and
507 of these persons with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living
environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may
require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are

provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Four factors – affordability, design, location, and discrimination – significantly limit the supply
of housing available to households of persons with disabilities. The most obvious housing need
for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes
are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable
to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and
other features necessary for accessibility. Location of housing is also an important factor for
many persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to travel to
necessary services and shops.
Resources
As of March 2012, 562 beds are available at State licensed adult residential facilities in El Cajon.
In addition, a number of resources are available in the East County area to assist persons with
disabilities:
           Mental Health and Vocational Services in El Cajon offers psychiatric day treatment
            and socialization programs designed to increase functional ability of
            mentally/emotionally disturbed and decrease the need for hospitalization.
           The San Diego County Adult/Older Adult Mental Health offers a wide variety of
            treatment, rehabilitation and recovery services to help people who are experiencing
            persistent and severe mental illness or a mental health crisis.
           The San Diego County Regional Center (SDCRC) serves as a resource where families
            of the developmentally disabled can obtain services and/or be referred to appropriate
            community resources in the fields of health, welfare, and education.
           St. Madeleine Sophie’s Center (2119 East Madison Avenue, El Cajon, CA, 92019) is an
            additional resource. Information concerning programs can be found on their website
            at http://www.stmsc.org/

3. Large	Households	
Large households are defined as those consisting of five or more members. These households
comprise a special need group because of the often limited supply of adequately sized and
affordable housing units in a community. To save for other basic necessities such as food,
clothing and medical care, it is common for lower income large households to reside in smaller
units, which frequently results in overcrowding and can result in accelerated unit deterioration.

The 2000 Census reported that there were 4,356 households with five or more members in El
Cajon, representing 13 percent of total households in the City. Similarly, about 13 percent of the
County’s households were also classified as large households in 2000. Large renter-households
were slightly more prevalent (14 percent) than large owner-occupied households (11 percent).
According to the 2010 Census, the number of large households in the City increased to 5,346.
The 2006-2010 ACS reports that there were approximately 14,216 housing units in El Cajon with
three or more bedrooms, indicating the City has an adequate supply of housing units capable of
supporting the number of large households in El Cajon. However, the issue often relates to
affordability. Table 14 compares the number of large households in El Cajon to that of the San
Diego region. In 2010, about 16 percent of households in El Cajon consisted of five or more
persons, a higher proportion compared to the region-wide proportion of 14 percent.

Table 8, provided earlier in this document on page 18, includes a breakdown of the incidence of
housing problems among larger households by income and tenure between 2006 and 2008.
Housing problems can be defined as cost burden (overpayment) greater than 30 percent of
income, and/or overcrowding, and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities. A
greater percentage of large households (81 percent) had housing problems than all households
(53 percent). Renter-occupied large households (as a group) tend to have more housing
problems than owner-occupied large households. The vast majority of renter-occupied large
households (86 percent) had one or more housing problems, while just under three-quarters of
owner-occupied households (73 percent) had one or more housing problems.
Resources
Lower and moderate income large households can benefit from many of the same programs
(outlined in this section under different special needs groups) that benefit other special needs
households. To provide affordable homeownership opportunities for low income families, the
City uses HOME funds to assist in the construction of family housing and provide first-time
homebuyer assistance to qualified families.
4. Single‐Parent	Households	
Single-parent households, particularly female-headed families with children, often require
special consideration and assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing and
accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families with

children are a particularly vulnerable group because they must balance the needs of their
children with work responsibilities, often while earning limited incomes.
According to the 2000 Census, households headed by women comprised approximately 16
percent (5,461 households) of all households in El Cajon. Of these households, 3,549 female-
headed households (65 percent) included children. As of 2010, an estimated 12 percent of El
Cajon households were headed by single parents (Table 15); the large majority of which were
headed by females (75 percent). The 2006-2010 ACS reports that 35 percent of female-headed
families with children had incomes below the poverty level.

Resources
Lower income single-parent households can benefit from City programs that provide direct
rental assistance or that will facilitate the development of affordable housing. Several local and
regional organizations provide social services that can help stabilize female-headed households:
           Boys and Girls Club of East County
           Center for Social Advocacy
           Consumer Credit Counseling of San Diego and Imperial Counties
           Crisis House (Family Resources Program)
           East County Community Health Services

5. Farmworkers	
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields,
processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload
increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often
supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as
those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence
every evening.
Section	3:	                                                 	                                 City	of	El	Cajon	
Community	Profile	                                      Page	27	                 2013‐2021	Housing	Element	

Due to the high cost of housing in the region and low wages, a significant number of migrant
farmworkers have difficulty finding affordable, safe and sanitary housing. According to the
State Employment Development Department, the average farmworker earned between $19,000
and $30,000 annually.3 This limited income is exacerbated by their tenuous and/or seasonal
employment status. It is estimated that there are between 100 and 150 farmworker camps
located throughout the San Diego region, primarily in rural areas. These encampments range in
size from a few people to a few hundred and are frequently found in fields, hillsides, canyons,
ravines, and riverbeds, often on the edge of their employer’s property. Some workers reside in
severely overcrowded dwellings, in packing buildings, or in storage sheds.
The 2000 Census indicated that less than one percent of the City’s residents were employed in
the farming industry. According to the 2006-2010 ACS, 63 persons in the City of El Cajon were
employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining industry.
Resources
Because only limited agriculture production is allowed within the Open Space land use
designation in El Cajon and the City’s farmworker population is small, the housing needs of
this group are addressed through its standard affordable housing strategies.
6. Homeless	
Due to the long-lasting recession, throughout the country and the San Diego region,
homelessness has become an increasingly critical issue. Factors contributing to the rise in
homelessness include unemployment and underemployment, a lack of housing affordable to
lower and moderate income persons, increases in the number of persons whose incomes fall
below the poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and the de-
institutionalization of the mentally ill. Unemployment in El Cajon was measured at 13 percent
as of March 2012, significantly higher than the countywide average of 9.5 percent.
California Government Code Section 65583(a)(7) mandates that municipalities address the
special needs of homeless persons within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as
defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), describes an
individual (not imprisoned or otherwise detained) who:
	
           Lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and includes a subset for an
            individual who resided in an emergency shelter or a place not meant for human
            habitation and who is exiting an institution where he or she temporarily resided;
           Will imminently lose their primary nighttime residence;
           Are unaccompanied youth and families with children and youth who are defined as
            homeless under other federal statutes who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under
            this definition; and
           Are fleeing, or are attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual
            assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions that relate to
            violence against the individual or a family member.

This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing, (unless it has been
officially condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (for example, doubled up with
others); persons being discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was homeless
when entering and is considered to be homeless at discharge); or persons who may be at risk of
homelessness (for example, living temporarily with family or friends.)
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) is San Diego County’s leading resource for
information on issues of homelessness. The RTFH compiles data from a physical Point-In-Time
(PIT) count of sheltered (emergency and transitional) and street homeless persons. The most
recent data available was from the count that took place on January 27, 2012 and the results are
shown in Table 16. El Cajon was reported to have 487 homeless persons. Among El Cajon’s
homeless population, 378 were sheltered at emergency shelters, safe haven housing, and
transitional housing. The remaining 109 homeless persons were unsheltered, including
individuals who were living in their cars, vans, trucks, or RVs.

The County of San Diego has primary responsibility for providing regional homeless services.
El Cajon is part of the Regional Continuum of Care Consortium (RCCC) system that provides
services and facilities for the homeless and is comprised of local government jurisdictions,
federal agencies, non-profit service and housing providers, technical assistance organizations,
and organizations from the faith community.
Emergency shelters offer temporary overnight sleeping accommodations for generally up to a
month. Emergency shelters provide a means of temporarily housing for homeless persons, but
also offer opportunities to provide referrals and services. Currently, five emergency shelters are
operating in the City of El Cajon:
           County Mental Health Services provides four shelter beds for the severely mentally ill
            homeless.
           Carlton G. Luhman Center operated by the Volunteers of America provides six shelter
            beds for the general homeless and targets families with children.

           ISN Rot'l Shelter operated by the Ecumenical Council of San Diego is a Countywide
            Seasonal Emergency Shelter for the general population. The East County facility is
            located in El Cajon and has a capacity for 12 persons, with a two-month maximum
            stay.
           East County Transitional Living Center is an additional resource and can serve
            approximately 400 persons at any given time. Information concerning programs can be
            found on their website at http://www.ectlc.org/temp/
Transitional housing is distinguished from emergency shelters in that it provides shelter for an
extended period of and generally includes integration with other social services and counseling
programs to assist in the transition to self-sufficiency through the attainment of a permanent
income and housing. Transitional shelters offer housing, case management, and support
services to return people to independent living.
Crisis House operates three transitional shelter facilities in El Cajon, including a 12-bed family
shelter that provides referral, case management, transportation, and other support services to
assist the homeless through the recovery process. Maximum stay is four months. Focus is a
five-bed facility with a maximum stay of nine months. Another 12-bed facility offers
accommodation to adults with disabilities. Maximum stay is nine months.
In addition, case management agencies offer emergency and supportive services to assist clients
in developing a plan for achieving independent living. In El Cajon, Crisis House, Center for
Social Advocacy, Volunteers of America, East County Transitional Living Center and the
Salvation Army serve as case management agencies.
Another form of emergency shelter assistance is programs that offer vouchers so that families
can stay together at local motels. With the Crisis House and East County Transitional Living
Center emergency motel voucher assistance program, El Cajon is able to provide a year-round
voucher program to serve its homeless.
The City is dedicated to homeless prevention services and assisting the homeless to transition
back to permanent housing. In emergency cases, the El Cajon Police Department (ECPD) is able
to offer families with children motel vouchers that have been made available by various social
services agencies. Homeless persons in non-emergency situations are referred to Crisis House
or East County Transitional Living Center in El Cajon or to St Vincent de Paul Village in
Downtown San Diego. Working in collaboration with the region’s social services agencies
through the Homeless Workgroup and the El Cajon Collaborative, the El Cajon Police

E. Housing	Stock	Characteristics	
The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, availability and tenure, age and
condition, and affordability are important in determining the housing needs for the community.
This section details the housing stock characteristics of El Cajon to identify how well the current
supply of housing meets the needs of existing and future residents of the City.
1. Housing	Growth	
The 2000 Census reported 35,190 housing units in El Cajon, representing an increase of two
percent since 1990. This level of growth was similar to that experienced by surrounding cities,
with the exception of the City of San Diego. The area’s housing growth was well below the
countywide increase of 10 percent. Since 2000, the City’s housing stock grew another two
percent to 35,850 units by 2010 (Table 17). Limited housing growth also occurred in Lemon
Grove, La Mesa and Santee during this time period.

2. Housing	Type	
El Cajon maintains a diverse housing stock, with multi-family homes as the predominant
housing type. Figure 7 shows that in 2010, a majority (56 percent) of the City’s housing stock
was comprised of units that were attached to another dwelling, and detached single-family
homes accounted for 38 percent of housing units. By comparison, nearly half (49 percent) of the
region’s housing stock consisted of detached single-family dwellings. The dominance of multi-
family housing reflects the limited amount of vacant land in El Cajon available for new housing.
Table 18 shows the SANDAG forecast of the El Cajon housing stock being increasingly
comprised of multi-family housing through 2030.

3. Housing	Availability	and	Tenure	
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost of housing.
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Tenure is an important market
characteristic because it is directly related to housing types and turnover rates. The tenure
distribution of a community’s housing stock can be an indicator of several aspects of the
housing market, including the affordability of units, household stability, and residential
mobility, among others. In most communities, tenure distribution generally correlates with
household income, composition and age of the householder.
a. Tenure
El Cajon is a predominantly renter-occupied community. The Census reported that nearly 60
percent of dwelling units in the City were occupied by renters in 2000 and 2010. The large
proportion of renters in El Cajon is partially explained by the large amount of multi-family
housing in the City.

As shown in Table 20, renter-occupied households had a slightly larger average household size
than owner-occupied households. In 2000, average renter-household size was 2.72 persons
compared to 2.67 persons for the average owner-household. In 2010, average renter-household
size increased slightly to 2.94 persons compared to 2.70 persons for the average owner-
household, increasing the discrepancy in average household size based on tenure.

b. Vacancy
Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator because they indicate the degree of choice
available. High vacancy rates usually indicate low demand and/or high supply conditions in
the housing market. Too high of a vacancy rate can be difficult for owners trying to sell or rent.
Low vacancy rates usually indicate high demand and/or low supply conditions in the housing
market. Too low of a vacancy rate can force prices up making it more difficult for lower and
moderate income households to find housing. Vacancy rates between two and three percent are
usually considered healthy for single-family housing; and between five and six percent is
considered sufficient to balance supply and demand in the multi-family housing market.
However, vacancy rates are not the sole indicator of market conditions. They must be viewed
in the context of all the characteristics of the local and regional market.
According to the 2010 Census, the overall vacancy rate in El Cajon was 4.8 percent, including
units vacant for seasonal or occasional use, rented and sold units that were vacant at the time of
the Census, and other unclassified vacant units. The vacancy rate for units available for sale or
rent was 1.9 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.
Additional vacancy information was obtained for Fall 2011 from the San Diego County
Apartment Association (SDCAA) and is shown in Table 21. Vacancy rates in El Cajon were
similar to those in neighboring communities and the San Diego region. Apartment properties
in El Cajon that were built more than 25 years ago had a lower vacancy rate than newer

4. Housing	Age	and	Condition	
a. Housing Age
If not properly and regularly maintained, housing can deteriorate and discourage reinvestment,
depress neighboring property values, and eventually impact the quality of life in a
neighborhood. Many federal and state programs use the age of housing as one factor in
determining housing rehabilitation needs. Typically, housing over 30 years of age is more
likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation
work and other repairs.
El Cajon’s housing stock is significantly older than the County’s housing stock (Figure 8); about
77 percent of the City’s housing stock was constructed over 30 years ago, while only 57 percent
of the County’s housing stock is of this age.

b. Housing Condition
Overall, about 28,000 units in the City are at least 30 years of age. Approximately 25 percent of
the housing units are at least 50 years of age, indicating a significant portion of the City’s
housing stock may need some levels of improvements and rehabilitation. The City handles
approximately eight to ten cases of residential abatement each year involving serious
substandard and/or unsafe conditions, representing approximately one percent of total
problem units in the City. This translates to an estimated 800 substandard units within the City
of El Cajon.
In an effort to improve overall housing conditions in El Cajon, the City operates a Code
Compliance program. The Community Development and Fire Departments perform the code
compliance function for the City. Identification of potential code violations occurs primarily
through informal field observations, as well as complaints received from residents. The City
also provides housing rehabilitation assistance to lower income homeowners through the City's
CDBG and HOME Programs. The CDBG program provides rehabilitation assistance for mobile
homes and single-family residences. The HOME program currently provides rehabilitation
assistance to single-family residences and downpayment assistance to first-time homebuyers.
HOME funds are also allocated periodically for acquisition/rehabilitation through projects
undertaken by a Community Housing Development Organization (“CHDO”) or others, as
funding permits.
5. Housing	Costs	and	Affordability	
Housing costs can indicate whether housing is accessible to all economic segments of the
community. Typically, if housing supply exceeds housing demand, housing costs will fall. If
housing demand exceeds housing supply, housing costs will rise. This section summarizes the
cost and affordability of the housing stock to El Cajon residents.

a. Ownership Housing Cost
Median home prices in the South and East County areas of San Diego ranged from $201,000 in
National City to $341,000 in the City of San Diego (Figure 9). El Cajon’s median home price fell
on the lower end of the spectrum at $268,000, but was comparable to neighboring jurisdictions.
Median home sale prices in El Cajon increased noticeably by nine percent between 2009 and
2010 (Table 22). Other southern San Diego cities also saw moderate increases in their median
home prices during this time period.

b. Rental Market
The primary source of information on rental costs in the San Diego region is the San Diego
County Apartment Association (SDCAA). SDCAA conducts two surveys of rental properties
per year. For the Fall 2011 survey, 6,000 surveys were sent out to rental property owners and
managers throughout San Diego County. Responses were received from 19,915 units. Table 23

c. Housing Affordability by Income Level
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in the
City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income levels.
Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of
housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding and
overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal
housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine the
maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of their respective
income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison
than those at the upper end. The maximum affordable home and rental prices for residents in
San Diego County are shown in Table 24.
Table 24 shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each month
without incurring a cost burden (overpayment) by income group. This amount can be
compared to current housing asking prices (Table 22) and market rental rates (Table 23) to
determine what types of housing opportunities a household can afford.

Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of the County Area Median Income
(AMI) – up to $16,900 for a one-person household and up to $26,050 for a five-person household
in 2012. Extremely low income households cannot afford market-rate rental or ownership
housing in El Cajon without assuming a cost burden.

Very Low Income Households
Very low income households earn between 31 percent and 50 percent of the County AMI – up
to $28,150 for a one-person household and up to $43,400 for a five-person household in 2012. A
very low income household can generally afford homes offered at prices between $89,210 and
$117,704, adjusting for household size. Given the costs of ownership housing in El Cajon, very
low income households would not be able to afford a home in the City. Very low income
renters will also find it difficult to find affordable appropriately-sized market-rate rental units
in El Cajon. After deductions for utilities, a very low income household at the maximum
income limit can afford to pay approximately $650 to $1,000 in monthly rent, depending on
household size.
Low Income Households
Low income households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of the County’s AMI - up to
$45,000 for a one-person household and up to $69,400 for a five-person household in 2012. The
affordable home price for a low income household at the maximum income limit ranges from
$158,492 to $224,608. Based on the asking prices of homes for sale (Table 22), ownership
housing would not be affordable to low income households. After deductions for utilities, a
one-person low income household could afford to pay up to $1,100 in rent per month and a
five-person low income household could afford to pay as much as $1,650. Most low income
households in El Cajon would be able to find adequately sized affordable apartment units
(Table 23), although the availability of such units may be limited.
Moderate Income Households
Moderate income households earn between 81 percent and 120 percent of the County’s AMI –
up to $98,400 depending on household size in 2012. The maximum affordable home price for a
moderate income household is $299,660 for a one-person household and $442,747 for a five-
person family. Moderate income households in El Cajon from a one-person household to a five-
person family should be able to find and purchase adequately-sized homes. The maximum
affordable rent payment for moderate income households is between $1,550 and $2,400 per
month. Appropriately-sized market-rate rental housing is generally affordable to households in
this income group.
F. Affordable	Housing	
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
multi-family rental units that are eligible to convert to non-low income housing uses due to
termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during the
next ten years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from January 1, 2013
through December 31, 2022. Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly assisted
housing units in El Cajon, analyzes their potential to convert to market rate housing uses, and
analyzes the cost to preserve or replace those units.

    1. Publicly	Assisted	Housing	
    The City of El Cajon has a number of publicly assisted rental housing developments affordable
    to lower income households. Table 25 provides a summary listing of affordable projects in the
    City. Overall, seven projects in the City include a total of 774 affordable units.

    2. Preservation	of	At‐Risk	Housing	
    Within the 2013-2022 “at-risk” housing analysis period, seven of the City’s affordable housing
    projects are considered at low risk of being converted to market rate because the owners have
    opted to renew their HUD contract annually. While the HUD renewal process is annual, the
    approval is fairly automatic. Furthermore, given the current economic climate, there is little
    financial incentive to convert to market-rate housing in the near future. Though unlikely, it is
    possible that all 561 of the City’s affordable housing units could convert to market-rate at some
    point in the planning period.

a. Preservation Options
State law requires that the Housing Element explore various options to preserve the at-risk
housing units. Preservation options typically include: 1) transfer or sale of units to non-profit
ownership; 2) purchase of affordability covenants; and 3) provision of rental subsidies. In terms
of replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted multi-family housing
units. The following discussion highlights ways that the City’s at-risk projects could be
preserved as affordable housing. All of the presented alternatives are costly and beyond the
ability of the City of El Cajon to manage without large amounts of subsidy from federal and/or
State resources. These options are described below.
Transfer of Ownership or Sale
Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit housing provider is generally one of
the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units remain affordable for the long term. By
transferring property ownership or sale to a non-profit organization, low income restrictions
can be secured and the project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of
governmental assistance, including issuance of Multifamily Housing Revenue Bonds and/or
Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The estimated market value for all of the City’s at-risk units
is provided in Table 26.

Gross	Annual	Income	                                                                                              	$9,027,360	
Net	Annual	Income	                                                                                                	$7,059,960	
Market	Value	                                                                                                   	$88,249,500	
Market value for at-risk units is estimated with the following assumptions:
    1. Average market rent based on Fair Market Rents (FY 2012) established by HUD (Studio unit = $984, One-bedroom
         unit = $1,126, Two-bedroom unit = $1,378, and Three-bedroom unit = $1,960).
    2. Average size is assumed to be: 450 square feet for a studio apartment, 600 square feet for a one-bedroom apartment, 850
         square feet for a two-bedroom apartment, and 1,200 square feet for a three-bedroom apartment.
    3. Annual income is calculated on a vacancy rate = 5%
    4. Annual operating expenses per square foot = $4.50
    5. Market value = Annual net project income*multiplication factor
    6. Multiplication factor for a building in good condition is 12.5.
Current market value for the at-risk units is estimated on the basis of the units’ potential annual
income, and operating and maintenance expenses. As indicated, the estimated market value of
El Cajon’s current stock of affordable housing is $88.2 million. (This estimate is provided for the
purpose of comparison and understanding the magnitude of costs involved and does not
represent the precise market value of this project. The actual market value at time of sale would
depend on market and property conditions, lease-out/turnover rates, among other factors.)

Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of the at-risk project is to provide an incentive
package to the owner to maintain the project as affordable housing. Incentives could include
bonds, writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, providing a lump-sum
payment, and/or supplementing the rents to market levels. The feasibility and cost of this
option depends on whether the complex is too highly leveraged and interest on the owner’s
part to utilize the incentives found in this option. By providing lump sum financial incentives
or ongoing subsides in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City could
ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.
Rental Assistance
Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing. Similar to
Housing Choice Vouchers, the City, through a variety of potential funding sources, could
provide rent subsidies to tenants of at-risk units. The level of the subsidy required to preserve
the at-risk units is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for a unit minus the housing
cost affordable by a lower income household. Table 27 estimates the rent subsidies required to
preserve the affordability of the 561 at-risk units. Based on the estimates and assumptions
shown in this table, approximately $3.5 million in rent subsidies would be required annually.

b. Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low income housing units is a means of replacing the at-risk units
should they be converted to market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends upon a
variety of factors, including density, size of the units (i.e. square footage and number of
bedrooms), location, land costs, and type of construction.
Assuming an average development cost of $113,707 per unit for multi-family rental housing,
replacement of the 561 at-risk units would require approximately $63,789,666, excluding land

costs. When land costs and developer profits are included, the construction costs of new units
can easily double.

c. Cost Comparisons
The above analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under various
options. However, because different projects have different circumstances and therefore
different options available, the direct comparison would not be appropriate. In general,
providing additional incentives/subsidies to extend the affordability covenant would require
the least funding over the long run, whereas the construction of new units would be the most
costly option. Over the short term, providing rent subsidies would be least costly but this
option does not guarantee the long-term affordability of the units.
The cost of constructing 561 housing units to replace the currently at-risk units is high, with an
estimated total cost of nearly $63.8 million, excluding land costs. This cost estimate is
substantially higher than the cost associated with the transfer of ownership option ($88.2
million). While the annual cost of providing rent subsidies similar to Housing Choice vouchers
($3.5 million annually) appears low, once amortized over a long period of affordability,
provision of rent subsidies is equally costly.
d. Resources for Preservation
Preservation of at-risk housing requires not only financial resources but also administrative
capacity of nonprofit organizations. These resources are discussed in detail later in this
Housing Element in the “Housing Resources” section.

Section 4: Housing Constraints
Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are posed by market,
governmental, and infrastructure and environmental factors. These constraints may result in
housing that is not affordable, or may render residential construction economically infeasible
for developers. Constraints to housing production significantly impact lower and moderate
income households and those with special needs.
A.Market	Constraints	
1. Construction	and	Land	Costs	
A significant cost associated with building a new house is the cost of building materials.
According to the San Diego Chapter of International Code Council (ICC) valuation data for
2008-2009, construction costs for wood frame, single-family construction of average to good
quality average about $120 per square foot while custom homes and units with extra amenities
run somewhat higher. The costs for wood frame, multi-family construction average about $107
per square foot, exclusive of parking. The City's ability to mitigate high construction costs is
limited without direct subsidy.
The limited supply of residentially designated vacant land in El Cajon contributes to higher
land costs in the City when compared to unincorporated areas. Few vacant high-density
residential properties remain in the City. Listing prices for vacant commercial properties that
are similar in location and characteristics with properties proposed for rezoning to high-density
or mixed use development (discussed later) were reviewed. Such properties are listed for sale
at about $22 to $25 per square foot or $958,320 to $1,089,000 per acre. While the County has vast
acreage of undeveloped land, the environmental and infrastructure constraints associated with
these areas often make development cost prohibitive. As a result, high demand for developable
land drives up land costs in urbanized areas. Higher density zoning could reduce the cost of
land per dwelling unit, but the reduction is often not significant enough to ensure affordable
housing opportunities because land zoned for higher densities commands also higher relative
market prices. Density bonuses may be used by the City as a mechanism to reduce land costs in
exchange for guaranteed affordable housing.
Private sector "for-profit" developers typically do not build affordable housing. Offering new
units for sale or rent at prices that are affordable to lower income households reduces
investment return, and in many cases, is financially infeasible due to high land, labor, and
materials costs. Although most "for-profit" developers build market-rate projects, recent
tightening of credit markets and limited demand for higher-end market rate units has led some
developers to seek bond and tax credit financing to help subsidize affordable projects.
However, limited funding has created fierce competition for available subsidies resulting in
fewer opportunities to offset market constraints like land and construction costs.

2. Availability	of	Mortgage	and	Rehabilitation	Financing	
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race/ethnicity of
the applicants. The disposition of loan applications submitted to financial institutions for home
purchase and home improvement loans within El Cajon is shown in Table 29. The status of
“other” loans indicates loan applications that were withdrawn by the applicant or closed for
incompleteness. HMDA data contained in this report are analyzed using the LendingPatternsTM
software.

a. Home Purchase Financing
In 2010, 1,445 loan applications were filed to purchase homes in El Cajon. Among these
applications, 72 percent were approved, 16 percent were denied, and 13 percent were
withdrawn or closed. Applicants earning more than 120 percent of the Area Median Income
(AMI) submitted the largest portion of applications, accounting for 38 percent of the total.
Lenders received only 125 applications from households earning less than 50 percent of the
AMI, comprising less than nine percent of the total applications submitted.
Typically, higher approval rates correlate to higher incomes, as income is a key factor in
accessing financing. Applicants earning 80 to 120 percent of AMI had the highest approval rate
(78 percent), followed by applicants earning more than 120 percent of AMI (74 percent). In
comparison, only 59 percent of applications from households earning less than 50 percent of
AMI were approved. Lower income households have less residual income to save for down
payments, homeowner or mortgage insurance, and other costs associated with homeownership
when compared to moderate and upper income households. Stricter approval criteria instituted
by lenders when foreclosures were on the rise and the broader housing market began to show
signs of collapse has also impacted approval rates for lower income households.

b. Home Improvement Financing
In contrast to the high number of home purchase loans submitted, lenders received only 120
applications for home improvement financing in 2010. Refinancing in the current market is
substantially more difficult than it has been in the past. Financial institutions have established
much stricter requirements for mortgage refinancing, making it harder for homeowners to
qualify for a refinance loan. Even homeowners who have excellent credit and a low debt-to-
income ratio face obstacles to refinancing, such as a lack of home equity. Some homeowners
have little or no equity because they bought their property with minimal down payments;
alternatively, many homeowners who had equity have watched it erode in recent years because
of decreasing home values. Among the applications submitted, 53 percent were approved, 31
percent were denied, and 17 percent were withdrawn or closed. Applicants earning more than
120 percent of AMI had the highest approval rate (67 percent), while applicants earning
between 50 and 79 percent of AMI had the lowest (30 percent).
c. Predatory Lending, Subprime Loans, and Foreclosures
With an active housing market, potential predatory lending practices by financial institutions
may arise. Predatory lending involves abusive loan practices usually targeting those with less-
than-perfect credit histories. The predatory practices typically include higher fees, hidden costs,
and unnecessary insurance and larger repayments due in later years. One of the most common
predatory lending practices is placing borrowers into higher interest rate loans than justified by
their credit status. Although the borrowers may be eligible for a loan in the “prime” market,
predatory lenders direct victims into more expensive and higher fee loans in the “subprime”
market. In the other cases, fraudulent appraisal data is used to mislead homebuyers into
purchasing over-valued homes, or misrepresented financial data is used to encourage
homebuyers into assuming a larger loan than can be afforded. While subprime lending cannot
in and of itself be described as “predatory,” studies have shown a high incidence of predatory
lending in the subprime market.4
Victims of predatory lending practices and those who purchased homes with mortgages offered
on the subprime market are highly vulnerable to foreclosure. Foreclosure occurs when
households fall behind on one or more scheduled mortgage payments. The foreclosure process
can be halted if the homeowner is able to bring their mortgage payments current. If payments
cannot be resumed or the debt cannot be resolved, the lender can legally use the foreclosure
process to repossess (take over) the home. When this happens, the homeowners must move out
of the property. If the home is worth less than the total amount owed on the mortgage loan, a
deficiency judgment could be pursued. If that happens, the homeowner would lose their home
and also would owe the home lender an additional amount.
Homes can be in various stages of foreclosure. Typically, the foreclosure process begins with
the issuance of a Notice of Default (NOD). An NOD serves as an official notification to a
borrower that he or she is behind in their mortgage payments, and if the payments are not paid

up, the lender will seize the home. In California, lenders will not usually file an NOD until a
borrower is at least 90 days behind in making payments.
Once an NOD has been filed, borrowers are given a specific time period, typically three months,
in which they can bring their mortgage payments current. If payments are not made current at
the end of this specified time period, a Notice of Trustee Sale (NTS) will be prepared and
published in a newspaper. An NTS is a formal notification of the sale of a foreclosure property.
In California, the NTS is filed 90 days following an NOD when a property owner has failed to
make a property loan current. Once an NTS has been filed, a property can then be sold at
public auction. Many properties, however, are unable to be sold at public auction. In the event
of an unsuccessful sale at auction, a property becomes classified as Real Estate Owned (REO)
and ownership of it reverts back to the mortgage company or lender.
Between 2000 and 2005, with low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down, interest
only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive marketing, hidden fees,
negative amortization), many households purchased homes that were beyond their financial
means. Under the false assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates would always be an
option and home prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates, many households were
(and still are) unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates, and
decline in sales prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage
payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the worth of the homes, many had to resort
to foreclosing their homes. This mortgage crisis led the country to a recession and with
households losing employment and income, the foreclosure rates soared between 2008 and
2011.
While foreclosures remain an issue, particularly for California, the situation has improved
dramatically in recent years. In San Diego County, 3,727 Notices of Default (NODs) were
recorded in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 5,048 NODs filed during the same period in
the previous year (for a 26.2 percent decrease).5 Current foreclosure data was obtained in
January 2013. At that point in time, 162 properties in El Cajon were listed as foreclosures for
sale.6 The majority of these foreclosing properties were purchased during the peak of the
housing market between 2003 and 2007. Another 190 homes are being auctioned and 77 homes
are bank-owned. Among the homes in foreclosure, the median value was $286,449, compared
to the median value of $319,933 for homes being auctioned and $276,552. The estimated values
of some of these homes reach well over $1,000,000, indicating that the impact of foreclosure
extends to households with higher incomes as well as lower income households.
3. Unemployment	Rates	
El Cajon has been hit particularly hard in the current economic downturn. According to the
California Development Department, the average annual unemployment rate in the City
increased from 8.4 percent in 2007 to 13.5 percent in 2011; higher than the County, statewide
and national averages during the same timeframe (Figure 10).                               Unemployment and

B. Governmental	Constraints	
Actions by the City can impact the price and availability of housing in El Cajon. Land use
controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local programs to
improve the overall quality of housing can individually and collectively constrain the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing. This section analyzes these potential
governmental constraints.
1. Land	Use	Controls	
The Land Use Element of the El Cajon General Plan and corresponding zoning provide for a full
range of residential types and densities dispersed throughout the City. The El Cajon Land Use
Element has designated close to 4,200 acres (49 percent) of the City's total land inventory for
residential uses, including single-family homes, multi-family units, and mobile homes.
Residential densities in El Cajon cover a wide spectrum, including the following categories:
           Low-Low Density (3 or fewer units/net acre)
           Low Density (3-10 units/net acre)
           Low-Medium Density (10-18 units/net acre)
           Medium Density (18-20 units/net acre)

a. Downtown El Cajon Specific Plan (SP 182)
The City adopted the Downtown El Cajon Specific Plan (SP No. 182) in 1972. The General Plan
recognizes Downtown as the City’s central business district, the center of governmental offices
and location of City’s oldest residential neighborhoods. Consistent with this vision, SP No. 182
facilitates a more urban, mixed-use form of development downtown. Mixed use developments,
composed of retail, office, and/or residential development may be permitted by a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP) within SP No. 182. Figure 11 illustrates the boundaries of SP No. 182. To
encourage higher density and mixed use development within SP No. 182, density bonuses to
increase the residential densities beyond permitted by the underlying zone may be requested
via the CUP process.

b. Residential Development Standards
El Cajon’s residential development standards are summarized in Table 31. The City
periodically reviews and revises its development standards to ensure the orderly development
of land uses and improve the quality of the physical environment.
Maximum Density
Maximum allowable density varies from less than one unit per acre to 7.2 units per acre in
single-family districts and from 7.2 units per acre and up in multi-family districts.
Maximum Height Limit
Maximum building heights vary from 20 to 35 feet in single-family zones and 35 feet and up in
multi-family zones. The height of buildings within SDA No. 9 of SP 182 is not regulated if the
property is located more than 100 feet from any property zoned for or developed with a
residential use. If the property is located within 100 feet of another property zoned for or
developed with a residential use, the maximum height is 35 feet, unless a greater height is
approved by CUP.

Parking Standards
The El Cajon Zoning Code establishes a minimum requirement of two parking spaces per
apartment unit and 2.25 spaces for units with two or more bedrooms, inclusive of guest parking
requirements. For multi-family developments in the RM-4300 through RM-HR zones, one
additional designated space is required for temporary loading activities per every 25 units, or
fraction thereof. Affordable and senior housing that meets State density bonus requirements is
eligible to use lower State-established parking standards.
Within SDA No. 9, if a project is proposed as mixed use development, the parking requirement
may be reduced to 70 percent of the total number of parking spaces required for each individual
use.
Building Setbacks
Mixed use development within SDA No. 9 has the following setback requirements:
      Frontage Setbacks:
           One- to two-story buildings: no requirements
           Three- to six-story buildings: 10 feet
           Seven- to ten-story buildings: 15 feet
           Interior Setbacks: as required by building and fire codes
Setback requirements may be further reduced via the CUP process.

*Open space requirements are determined by the maximum lot coverage standards. Maximum lot size standards within multi-
family zones include parking areas and driveways.
a. The City requires one additional designated space for temporary loading activities for every 25 units, or fraction thereof. No
additional guest parking is required.
Flexibility in Development Standards
The City facilitates development of housing for lower income households (income restricted)
and for the elderly or persons with disabilities (age or disability restricted) by allowing
deviations from established development standards, when such housing and requested
deviations meet criteria established in Section 17.140.200 of the Zoning Ordinance. The
following list is a summary of deviations listed in the Zoning Ordinance that may be allowed
with approval of a CUP by the City Council:
           Income restricted housing may be granted up to a 30 percent reduction in required
            parking.

            Age and disability restricted housing may be granted reduced parking (as low as one
             space per two dwelling units) and a density bonus of up to 50 units per acre in the
             RM-2500 and RM-2200 zones or up to 75 units per acre for Section 202 projects.
Alternatively, developers of housing for seniors and lower or moderate income households may
apply for a density bonus, reduced parking standards, and associated incentives, waivers, or
modifications consistent with California law (SB 1818) as implemented by Chapter 17.220 of the
El Cajon Zoning Ordinance.
c. Provisions for a Variety of Housing
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and implement development standards to encourage and facilitate
the development of housing for all economic segments of the community. This includes single-
family homes, multi-family housing, second family units, manufactured housing, residential
care facilities, emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, single room
occupancy units (SROs), and farmworker housing.
El Cajon provides for a wide range of housing types throughout the community. Table 32
summarizes the housing types permitted in each of the City’s primary residential zones. Each
residential use is designated by a letter denoting whether the use is permitted by right (P),
conditionally permitted (C), or not permitted (--).

Single-Family Housing
Single-family housing is permitted in all residential districts, and the O-S zone. Single-family
residences on individual legal lots are approved by building permit.
Multi-Family Housing
Multi-family housing is allowed by-right within the RM-4300, RM-2500, RM-2200, RM-1500,
and RM-HR districts. Multi-family requires the approval of a Site Development Plan (SDP).
Site Development Plan review is discretionary but does not require approval by the Planning
Commission or City Council. SDP review and approval is performed administratively by City
staff to ensure compliance with City development standards and other codes (e.g. Building and
Fire codes). The City will update the Zoning Code to include the minimum findings required
by the State of California (Program 17).7 Findings will apply uniformly to all uses that require a
SDP. No use-specific findings will be added to the Zoning Ordinance.
Second Units
Second units, or “granny flats” as they are commonly known, are attached or detached dwelling
units that provide complete independent facilities for one or more persons. Second units
provide a cost effective means of serving additional development through the use of existing
infrastructure, and provide affordable housing for lower income households. Second units are
allowed with approval of an Administrative Zoning Permit (AZP) within the single-family
zones RS-40, RS-20, RS-15, RS-9, and RS-6.
The AZP review is discretionary but does not require approval by the Planning Commission or
City Council. The administrative review is conducted by City staff to ensure compliance with
setback, lot coverage, and height requirements for the applicable zone. The review also ensures
that applications comply with second unit development standards. For example, the living
area of a second unit cannot exceed 640-square feet and one additional paved off-street parking
space is required for each bedroom. Furthermore, the property owner must occupy either the
main or the second unit. The Director of Community Development may approve, conditionally
approve, or deny AZPs without public hearing or refer applications to the Planning
Commission. Decisions by the Director or Planning Commission may be appealed to the City
Council.
In recent years, the number of second family units (granny flats) constructed within the City has
been decreasing. The City currently requires a separate water meter for a granny flat and the
cost of the water meter (capacity fee) has been identified as a reason why this type of housing is
not being constructed. Since January 1, 2010, only one second unit has been approved in the
City. The City is exploring the feasibility of eliminating this requirement.
State law requires ministerial approval of second dwelling units under certain circumstances.
The City will update the Zoning Code to establish criteria for ministerial consideration of
second dwelling units pursuant to AB 1866 (Program 17).

Manufactured Housing
Pursuant to State law, manufactured housing must be allowed by-right in all zones that allow
single-family dwellings so long as it is a mobile home built since June 15, 1976, and certified
under the National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1975, installed on a
permanent foundation, and having surrendered to the Community Development Department
any state registration or certification pertaining to mobile homes. Such housing is subject to the
same development standards and design review criteria as wood-framed housing as set forth
by the zoning district. Mobile Home Parks are permitted subject to the approval of a CUP
within the Mobile Home Overlay Zone. The City will update the Zoning Code to clarify that
manufactured housing units that meet the standards established by State law is allowed by-
right in all zones that allow single-family dwellings (Program 17).
Residential Care Facilities
The City’s Zoning Code defines “residential care facility” as a residential home or facility
providing 24-hour non-medical care for persons in need of personal services, protection,
supervision, counseling, guidance, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily
living. This use classification only includes those facilities described above that are licensed by
the State Department of Social Services, such as elder care facilities and sober living facilities.
Small residential care facilities serving six or fewer clients are allowed by-right in all residential
zones. The City will update the Zoning Code to allow this use by-right in the O-S zone, where
single-family uses are also allowed by-right (Program 17). Larger facilities serving seven or
more individuals are allowed with approval of a CUP in the RM-4300, RM-2500, RM-2200, RM-
1500, and RM-HR residential zones and the O-P, C-N, C-G, C-R, and M non-residential zones.
Congregate Care Facilities
These facilities are multi-family residential developments designed and devoted to housing
persons of impaired physical and/or mental capacities, such as frail elderly and the
handicapped, and offering limited 24-hour non-medical care. The development contains small
individual dwelling units of usually only one or two rooms with a small kitchen allowing for
independent living, but also providing common dining, recreational and social facilities on site,
and minimal convenience services such as housekeeping and transportation services for the
residents. Congregate care facilities are permitted by right in the RM-2500, RM-2200, RM-1500,
and RM-HR zones.
Group Residential
Group residential facilities require a CUP in the multi-family (RM) zones. These facilities are
defined in the Zoning Code as shared living quarters without separate kitchen and bathroom
facilities for each room or unit. This classification includes “boardinghouse,” dormitory,
fraternity house, and sorority house.

Emergency Shelters
Transitional Service Centers are permitted in C-M and M zones as shown in Figure 12, subject to
approval of a SDP, and within the C-G and C-R zones with approval of a CUP.
The C-M and M zones include 488 parcels on 1,086.4 acres. Excluding the properties located
within Gillespie Airfield Safety Zones that do not allow residential land uses, 336 parcels
totaling 400 acres are zoned C-M and M. Specifically, two parcels (2.3 acres) are vacant and 11
parcels (8.4 acres) have only limited improvements. Adequate capacity exists to accommodate
the City’s estimated unsheltered homeless population of 109 persons. Furthermore, these
parcels are located in proximity to a high concentration of community and supportive services,
as well as a transit center that provides excellent access to transportation.
State law requires ministerial consideration of emergency shelters under certain circumstances.
The City will update the Zoning Code to remove the requirement for discretionary review
within the C-M and M zones and establish development standards consistent with SB2.
Furthermore, the City will update the definition of Transitional Service Center to incorporate
the Health and Safety Code definition of Emergency Shelter (Program 17).

Supportive and Transitional Housing
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801(i)) defines "transitional housing" and
"transitional housing development" as buildings configured as rental housing developments,
but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and
recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. Residents of transitional housing
are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the homeless in achieving
greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living situation. Transitional housing
can take several forms, including group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multi-
family apartments and typically offers case management and support services to help return
people to independent living (often six months to two years).
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless, people
with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. California Health and Safety
Code (Section 50675.2) defines “supportive housing” as housing with no limit on length of stay,
that is occupied by the low income adults with disabilities, and that is linked to on-site or off-
site services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his
or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community. Target population includes adults with low incomes having one or more
disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health
conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the Lanterman Developmental
Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5, commencing with Section 4500, of the Welfare and
Institutions Code) and may, among other populations, include families with children, elderly
persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional
settings, veterans, or homeless people.
Transitional/supportive housing can take several physical forms, including group quarters
(congregate living) with beds, single-family homes, and multi-family apartments. El Cajon’s
Zoning Code does not explicitly address supportive or transitional housing facilities. The
Zoning Code will be amended to specifically define transitional/supportive housing (Program
17). Transitional housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 50801(i) will be permitted
where housing is permitted, and subject to the same development standards as other housing
development.         Supportive housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section
50675.14(a)(B)(2) will be permitted where housing is permitted, and subject to the same
development standards as other housing development.
Transitional and supportive housing not meeting the Health and Safety Code definitions will be
accommodated as group living and be treated similar to Group Residential facilities and subject
to a CUP in multi-family (RM) zones.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct
from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen
and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many
SROs have one or the other. SRO units can be an effective method to meet the affordable

Housing	Constraints	                           Page	59	                  2013‐2021	Housing	Element	

housing needs of extremely low income individuals and small households. The City’s Zoning
Code does not include provisions for SRO units. To address this constraint, the City will amend
the Zoning Code to facilitate the provision of SROs. SROs will be defined and listed as an
allowable use within the C-G, General Commercial zone, subject to approval of a CUP (Program
18).
Mixed Use
As previously discussed, mixed use development is permitted within Special Development
Area (SDA) No. 9 within the El Cajon Downtown Specific Plan (SP 182) area, via the CUP
process.
Farmworker Housing
The 2010 American Community Survey identified only 63 residents employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining. No policies or programs are needed to address
farmworker housing in El Cajon because the City’s population employed in agricultural
industry is negligible. The City currently allows agricultural production and related uses by-
right in the O-S, RS-40, and RS-20 zones. Given the urbanized nature of the community and
potential conflict between agricultural and urban uses, including residential uses, the City will
update the Zoning Code to require a CUP for agricultural uses within this zone (Program 17).
In accordance with State law, farmworker housing will also requires a CUP in these zones.
d. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City reviewed its land use controls, zoning regulations, building codes, and development
procedures to determine if constraints exist to accommodate the housing needs of persons with
disabilities. The following summarizes the findings of this review:
Definition of Family
The El Cajon Zoning Code defines a family as “an individual, or two or more persons related by
blood or marriage, or a group of unrelated individuals living together and bearing the generic
character of a relatively permanent housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit.” This definition does
not limit the number of related or unrelated individuals living together and therefore is not
considered restrictive.
Building Code
The City adopted the California Building Code (CBC), 2010 Edition. No local amendments have
been made which would limit housing opportunities for persons with disabilities. The City has
not adopted any occupancy standards except for those prescribed in the CBC and Health and
Safety Code.

Reasonable Accommodation
The City has not established a formal procedure for approving requests for reasonable
accommodation. The Planning Division reviews requests for reasonable accommodation and
can approve the requests over the counter. The Planning Division works with residents with
disabilities to ensure their needs are addressed without compromising health and safety
standards. Accessibility improvements are eligible activities under the City’s various
rehabilitation assistance programs. The City will revise the Zoning Code to include an
administrative and ministerial process for reviewing and approving requests for reasonable
accommodation (Program 17).
Residential Care Facilities
The Lanterman Development Disabilities Services Act (Section 5115 and 5116) of the California
Welfare and Institutions Code declares that mentally and physically disabled persons are
entitled to live in normal residential surroundings. The use of property for the care of six or
fewer disabled persons is a residential use for the purposes of zoning. A State-licensed
residential care facility serving six or fewer disabled persons on a 24-hour-a-day basis is
considered a residential use that is permitted in all zones that permit residential uses. No local
agency can impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes than
otherwise required for homes in the same district.
The El Cajon Zoning Code permits residential care facilities for six or fewer residents within all
residential zones. The City will update the Zoning Code to allow this use by-right in the O-S
zone, where single family uses are also allowed by-right (Program 17). Residential care facilities
serving more than six residents are permitted with a CUP in RM-4300, RM-2500, RM-2200, RM-
1500, and RM-HR zones. Furthermore, residential care facilities, regardless of size, require a
CUP in the O-P, C-N, C-G, C-R, and M commercial/industrial zones. These facilities must be
separated at least 300 feet between structures measured at the closest wall of each building.
The City also has provisions for congregate care and group residential facilities, which can serve
persons with disabilities. Congregate care facilities are permitted by-right within the RM-2500,
RM-2200, RM-1500, and RM-HR zones. Group residential facilities are conditionally permitted
within the RM-6000, RM-4300, RM-2500, RM-2200, RM-1500, and RM-HR zones.
Supportive and Transitional Housing
As stated before, the City’s Zoning Code will be amended to the address the provision of
supportive and transitional housing options (Program 17).
e. Development and Planning Fees
The City charges various fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing permits and
providing certain services and utilities. Table 33 summarizes the City's planning fee
requirements for residential development.

When compared to other agencies in the region, El Cajon’s permitting fees are relatively low. El
Cajon does not currently impose any development impact fees for a Dwelling Unit License fee
on building permits for new residential development. This one-time fee ranges from $188 per
unit for apartments to $300 for each single-family residence. The fee proceeds are designated
for park land acquisition and park development. This fee is minimal and therefore does not
impact the feasibility of a residential project.
Table 34 shows permit fees for a prototype home in El Cajon. Permit fees are based on a one-
story, single-family detached residential dwelling unit with 2,500 square feet of living area and
a 400-square-foot garage. The estimated construction cost for this prototype unit before permit
fees is $318,600, excluding land costs. The construction fees account for an additional sum of
$33,664, or approximately 10.5 percent of the estimated construction cost. When land costs are
factored in, construction fees represent only a small portion of the overall cost of development.

Table 35 shows permit fees for a prototype multi-family development in El Cajon. The fees are
based on a 24-unit apartment building with average 950 square-foot dwelling units and a 1,600-
square-foot carport. The estimated construction cost for this prototype unit before permit fees is
$2,916,000. The construction fees total $341,543, or $14,231 per unit, lower than the per-unit fees
for a single-family home. (Note that some fees are passed through to special districts and
school districts.) This constitutes approximately 11.5 percent of the estimated construction cost,
excluding land costs. When land costs are factored in, construction fees represent only a small
portion of the overall development costs.
The City monitors all regulations, ordinances, departmental processing procedures, and
residential fees to assess their impact on housing costs, and may offer HOME funds to off-set
development fees for affordable and senior citizen housing projects.

f. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of El Cajon has adopted the 2010 edition of the California Building Code with minor
local administrative amendments primarily related to fire sprinklers and roof coverings for
enhanced fire protection. These local amendments are intended to enhance public health, safety
and welfare. The limited scope of the local amendments would not result in a significant cost
increase to housing construction or serve to constrain housing development. The Building and
Fire Safety Division of the Community Development Department enforces the City’s building
codes.
g. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The creation of new lots for new single-family development requires the processing of a
Tentative Parcel Map (TPM) (if four lots or less) or a Tentative Subdivision Map (TSM) (five lots
or more). The process in both involves a public hearing by the Planning Commission which
Section	4:	                                                  	                                            City	of	El	Cajon	
Housing	Constraints	                                    Page	64	                           2013‐2021	Housing	Element	

usually is held within six weeks of the submittal of a complete application.8 The Planning
Commission decision, if approved, is forwarded to the City Council for a second public hearing
within 30 days. The City Council makes the final decision and establishes the final conditions of
approval. Compared to other California agencies, El Cajon processes entitlements and permits
quickly.
Once a TPM or TSM is approved, a final parcel or subdivision map must be prepared and
recorded before the new lots are considered suitable for construction. The processing of a final
parcel or subdivision map is coordinated by the City Engineer. Depending upon the
complexity of the parcel or subdivision map, the amount of time necessary to process a final
parcel or subdivision map averages about nine months.
Once the map is recorded, a building permit must be issued before a single-family residence can
be built. The building permit process requires review by the Planning and Building Divisions
of the Department of Community Development, as well as the Public Works and Fire
Departments. The average processing time is about two weeks.
The construction of apartments requires the approval of a Site Development Plan (SDP), which
is a staff-administered process, to obtain comments from the Planning and Building & Fire
Safety Divisions of the Department of Community Development, and the Public Works and Fire
Departments, as well as comments from school districts, water districts and the power
company. SDP review includes a 30-day process to arrive at a preliminary decision to approve,
approve subject to conditions, or to deny. Once the SDP is approved, the applicant can submit
plans for building permits, which on average takes about three weeks to process and issue.
The construction of new condominiums or other common interest subdivision or the conversion
of existing residential development to condominiums requires the processing of a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) and a TPM or TSM. Both the PUD and TPM or TSM are processed
simultaneously as public hearing items before the Planning Commission and City Council as
described above. The processing times for a PUD are consistent with those for a TPM or TSM as
described above. The conversion of existing apartments to condominiums may require the
upgrading of common area facilities and individual unit features depending upon their status
at the time of conversion. Relocation assistance for existing residents who may be displaced
may also be required.
Occasionally, the City uses the Specific Plan (SP) process to review residential developments.
An SP application involves a public hearing by the Planning Commission and a second public
hearing by the City Council. The process takes 11-18 weeks. Once an SP is approved, the
conditions of approval must be satisfied before an ordinance is adopted. Once the Specific Plan
ordinance is effective, building permits can be processed as described above.
8 This timeframe assumes that the project is exempt from CEQA. The timeframe for projects subject to CEQA is much
longer but varies depending on scope and associated environmental issues. Approximately 90 percent of
development projects proposed in El Cajon qualify for a CEQA exemption.

h. On- and Off-Site Improvements
Requirements for on- and off-site improvements vary depending on the presence of existing
improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed development. In general, most
residential areas in El Cajon are served with infrastructure. However, aging infrastructure
continues to be an issue. The City continues to utilize a capital improvement plan to facilitate
the upgrading of infrastructure and public facilities. Currently, the City does not impose any
development impact fee for traffic, drainage, or other public facilities. However, the City may
in the future consider impact fees and this would not be a constraint on housing, as it would
normalize El Cajon as compared to other agencies and allow for getting infrastructure and
public facilities to support the RHNA.
Developers are responsible for all on-site improvements, including parking, landscaping, open
space development, walkways, drainage, and all utility connections. Projects must be designed
to minimize water quality impacts consistent with Low Impact Development (LID) principles.
LID measures minimize or eliminate pollutants in storm water through natural processes by
maintaining pre-development hydrologic characteristics, such as flow patterns, surface
retention, and recharge rates. Implementation of LID measures can be costly and potentially
constrain residential development.
In addition, new subdivisions are required to underground all utility lines. Public street widths
are specified in the El Cajon Public Works Improvement Manual. This document establishes
street classifications, right-of-way widths, and improvement standards. For a typical residential
street, the standard is 36 feet of paved roadway within a 56-foot right of way.
i. State Tax Policies and Regulations
Proposition 13
Proposition 13, a voter initiative that limits increases in property taxes except when there is a
transfer of ownership, may have increased the cost of housing. The initiative forced local
governments to pass on more of the costs of housing development to new home owners. The
law also increased the initial cost of purchasing a home as future tax savings are imputed into
the purchase price.
Article 34 of the California Constitution
Article 34 requires that low-rent housing projects developed, constructed, or acquired in any
manner by any State or public agency, including cities, receive voter approval. There are costs
associated with the process and with the uncertainty and delay caused by the process. At this
time, the City has voter approval for senior housing projects only.
Federal and State Environmental Protection Regulations
Federal and state regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs resulting from the environmental review
process are also added to the cost of housing and are passed on to the consumer. These costs
Section	4:	                                       	                                 City	of	El	Cajon	
Housing	Constraints	                           Page	66	                  2013‐2021	Housing	Element	

include fees charged by local government and private consultants needed to complete the
environmental analysis, and from delays caused by the mandated public review periods.
However, the presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure
environmental safety to the El Cajon residents.
Local Tax Policies
El Cajon voters have authorized two separate local sales tax increase to fund public services and
facilities since 2004. More than two-thirds of El Cajon voters supported Proposition O to add a
half-cent to local sales tax in 2004. Voters narrowly approved Proposition P in 2008, which
authorized an additional half-cent sales tax increase. Only 52 percent of city voters approved
this second sales tax increase. Waning public support for potential further tax increases to
support critical services and facilities may force the City to place a larger burden for new
construction on future developers.
j. Governmental Funding
The City of El Cajon utilizes a variety of funding sources to preserve, improve, and expand the
City’s affordable housing inventory.
City Funding Sources
The City of El Cajon receives/manages various funding sources to support affordable housing
production and to improve existing housing for lower and moderate income households. Those
funding sources typically include: CDBG, HOME, CalHome, and Redevelopment Low and
Moderate-Income Housing Funds (LMIHF). Housing Programs currently offered through the
City and their sources include: Mobile-Home Rehabilitation (CDBG); Single-Family
Rehabilitation Program (HOME); and First-Time Homebuyer Program (HOME and LMIHF).
Each source has had severe funding reductions or in the case of redevelopment, has been
eliminated through the passing of ABx1 26 by Governor Brown on June 28, 2011. These
reductions and/or the dissolution of redevelopment agencies have placed severe constraints on
the City’s ability to provide for the production, rehabilitation and/or preservation of affordable
housing.
City staff will have to work diligently to protect and preserve its existing loan portfolio in order
to recapture and re-assist eligible program households and maintain or increase affordable
housing units. City staff will soon undergo a housing strategy for the El Cajon Housing
Authority, its purpose, role and mission and likely seek out other funding sources to offset the
constraints with current funding sources outlined below.
CDBG: The City utilizes CDBG funds to rehabilitate aging mobile-homes for low-income
households living in approved mobile-home parks, including senior parks that maintain
compliance with building code standards. Elimination of lead-based paint and other hazards
are typically required, except in senior only parks, as part of the program as well. However
since FY2010-11, CDBG funding to the City has dropped by 26 percent and funding for mobile-
home rehabilitation is competing with city-wide capital projects that benefit a greater number of
lower and moderate income households. The reduction of funding and competition with other
Section	4:	                                       	                                   City	of	El	Cajon	
Housing	Constraints	                          Page	67	                    2013‐2021	Housing	Element	

projects and programs creates an additional constraint in ensure the improvement of existing
housing stock for lower income households.
HOME: The City utilizes HOME funds to rehabilitate aging single-family residences to bring
the property up to not only Housing Quality Standards, but current Building Code standards as
well. Borrowers must be lower income, have sufficient equity, and utilize City-approved
licensed contractors. Lead based paint hazards are identified and abated in each unit as part of
the program as well. However, since FY2010-11, funding for the HOME program has been
reduced by 55 percent. In addition, the housing bubble and subsequent economic crisis have
created negative-equity situations where applicants have insufficient equity to apply for City
assistance. This negative equity situation, along with the HOME reduction in funding, and the
typical cost of a single-family rehabilitation loan of approximately $100,000, prevent the City
from assisting even a meager number of lower income households from rehabilitating their
aging single-family homes.
In addition, HOME funds are utilized to assist lower income households with down-payment
and closing costs assistance to purchase single-family or condominium homes in the City. Based
on current rates and terms, the average gap or subsidy required for a family of four is
approximately $40,060 to purchase a three-bedroom unit paying approximately 35 percent of
monthly gross income. If these funds are leveraged with LMIHF, the gap/subsidy required
increases to approximately $154,300 due to affordable housing cost requirements.
Redevelopment Low and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF): With the passage of ABx1
26 (the “Dissolution Bill”) by Governor Brown on June 28, 2011, and subsequent dissolution
date of all redevelopment agencies on February 1, 2012, production, substantial rehabilitation,
and preservation of affordable housing units with LMIHF’s ended unless an “enforceable
obligation” was already in place or outstanding loan funds are returned.
In the past, LMIHF monies have been utilized for the acquisition, demolition and
redevelopment of blighted properties for: new multi-family and single-family housing;
preservation of at-risk housing; acquisition and substantial rehabilitation of single and multi-
family housing units; rehabilitation of single-family housing; and first-time homebuyer
assistance. With the dissolution of the El Cajon Redevelopment Agency (Agency), the El Cajon
Housing Authority accepted the LMIHF housing functions and assets of the former Agency)
and will continue to monitor and recycle outstanding loans that are repaid or recaptured upon
sale, rental, refinance, or transferred. These monies will be utilized under newer programs
identified by the Housing Authority for the production, improvement and preservation of
affordable housing.
The dissolution of the Agency is a major constraint to the production and preservation of
affordable housing for the City. As the result of the dissolution, the immediate estimated loss in
LMIHF is approximately $3.4 million as of February 1, 2012. Each year thereafter,
approximately $3 million in affordable housing funds will be lost. Staff must seek out other
funding sources mentioned above through the strategic planning process; otherwise continued
production of affordable housing units in El Cajon will stall at the City level.

Other Grant and Public Funds
The City periodically applies for, or participates in, a variety of other grant or public funding
sources to ensure adequate and affordable housing production. Funding is limited, typically
subject to a competitive application process or subject to Federal or State funding allocations.
Some of those programs that the City and/or Housing Authority may seek or continue
participation include:
CalHome: The City received an allocation of CalHome Funds in 2005 that can be utilized to re-
assist new lower income households upon sale, rental, refinance, or transfer. CalHome funds
are subject to State of California funding allocations, an application and competitive award
processes. Limited funding and competitive interest places a constraint the availability of other
public funding, as Federal and redevelopment sources dwindle or are eliminated.
Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC): The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, authorized by
Congress in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, is an alternative to mortgage revenue bond-
backed financing as a means of providing financial assistance for the purchase of single-family
housing. In 1985, the State adopted legislation authorizing local bond-issuing agencies to make
Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCCs) available in California. The MCC Program is an IRS tax
credit issued to homebuyers by the County of San Diego equal to 20 percent of the first
mortgage interest, which increases affordability by increasing net earnings by the credit. MCC’s
are subject to annual funding allocations to each jurisdiction by the California Debt Limit
Allocation Committee and are committed on a first come-first serve basis. The limited
allocations and high interest creates a restraint on the number and availability to assist a large
number of lower and moderate income households in El Cajon.
Other Governmental Funding Sources
Other governmental funding sources include those outside the control of the City of El Cajon,
but eligible for application by lower and moderate income households within the City. Those
funding sources include: FHA, CalHFA, Making Home Affordable programs, and other
Federal/State mortgage resources. The housing bubble, subsequent economic crisis, and current
budget issues at the federal and State of California level places tremendous constraints on
buyers in El Cajon due to reductions in funding levels and/or increases in stringent
underwriting criteria, especially for condominiums which are typically affordable to lower
income households.
Given the City’s built out character, condominiums offer an affordable ownership housing
option in the City of El Cajon. However, Fannie Mae (FNMA) condominium lending
regulations adopted in January 2009 have an onerous impact on condominium sales and project
development. Some of the requirements include:
       For new construction and newly converted condo developments, 70 percent of the units
        must be pre-sold (closed or under contract), an increase from the previous requirement
        of 51 percent.
       No more than 15 percent of the condo project units can be more than 30 days delinquent
        on condo fees.

       Fidelity insurance will be required for condos with 20 or more units, ensuring that
        homeowner association funds are protected.
       Borrowers must obtain a condo unit owners insurance policy unless the master policy
        provides interior unit coverage; coverage may not be less than 20 percent of the assessed
        value.
       No more than 10 percent of a project can be owned by a single entity.
       No more than 20 percent of a project can consist of non-residential space, impacting
        mixed-use commercial-residential use projects.
       The homeowners association must have at least 10 percent of its budgeted income
        designated for replacement reserves and adequate funds budgeted for the insurance
        deductible.
The revised guidelines have negatively affected buyers’ ability to obtain conventional loans for
either a new or established condo if the project does not conform. Most notably, the changes
have dramatically affected new developments, especially in hard hit areas such as California.
C. Availability	of	Public	Services	and	Facilities	and	
      Environmental	Constraints	
1. Availability	of	Public	Services	and	Facilities	
As a highly urbanized community, public services and facilities are available to facilitate
development throughout the City. All of the residentially designated land in El Cajon is served
with sewer and water lines, streets, storm drains, and other infrastructure and utilities.
The Helix Water District and Padre Dam Municipal Water District provide potable water in the
City. Wastewater is collected and transmitted to the San Diego Metropolitan Sewer District for
treatment. State law requires that water and sewer providers develop written policies that
grant priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower income
households. The legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the
approval of development that includes housing affordable to lower income households, unless
specific written findings are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted Housing
Element to the Helix Water District, Padre Dam Municipal Water District, and the San Diego
Metropolitan Sewer District within 30 days of adoption. The City will coordinate with these
providers to ensure priority service provision to affordable housing developments.
2. Environmental	Constraints	
The identified sites for future residential development are located in urbanized areas of the
City; most sites have been previously developed and are not subject to significant
environmental constraints. Individual sites may have hazardous materials that require cleanup
efforts depending on prior uses. Portions of the very low density residential areas in the City
are constrained by topography and may be subject to wildfires.

Section 5: Housing Resources
Resources that are available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in
the City of El Cajon are discussed in this section. The analysis demonstrates the City’s ability to
satisfy its share of the region’s future housing need, and identifies administrative resources
available to support housing activities and facilitate implementation of City housing policies
and programs. Opportunities for energy conservation are also explored.
A.Future	Housing	Needs	
State law requires each community to play a role in meeting the region’s housing needs.
Specifically, a jurisdiction must demonstrate in the Housing Element that its land inventory is
adequate to accommodate its share of the region’s projected growth. This section assesses the
adequacy of El Cajon’s land inventory in meeting future housing needs.
1. RHNA	Requirement	
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) developed and adopted by the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG) covers an eleven-year growth projection and planning
period (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2020). The RHNA assigns a housing production
to each jurisdiction in the region. El Cajon’s share of the regional housing need for the 2010-
2020 period is allocated by SANDAG based on factors such as recent growth trends, income
distribution, and capacity for future growth. El Cajon must identify adequate land with
appropriate zoning and development standards to accommodate its allocation of the regional
housing need.
According to the RHNA, El Cajon’s share of regional future housing needs is a total of 5,805
new units between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020. This allocation is distributed into
different income categories, as shown below in Table 36. The RHNA includes a fair share
adjustment which allocates future (construction) need by each income category in a way that
meets the State mandate to reduce over-concentration of lower income households in
historically lower income communities or areas within the region.

Source: Final Regional Housing Needs Allocation, SANDAG, 2011.
AMI = Area Median Income
Note: * The City has a RHNA allocation of 1,448 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units). Pursuant to
State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based on Census income
distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low. According to the CHAS data developed by
HUD, 32.5% of City households earned less than 50 percent of the AMI. Among these households, 54.0 percent earned incomes
below 30% (extremely low). Therefore the City’s RHNA allocation of 1,448 very low income units may be split into 724
extremely low and 724 very low income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA allocation,
State law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.
2. Credits	toward	RHNA	
The RHNA is an 11-year planning goal. Housing units built, under construction, or approved
from January 1, 2010 onward can be credited towards meeting the City’s RHNA. These units
can be subtracted from the City’s share of regional housing needs. The City must demonstrate
in this Housing Element its ability to meet the remaining housing needs, through the provision
of sites, after subtracting units under construction or anticipated (Table 37).

a. Units Built
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2010 as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing
Element planning period of 2013-2020, jurisdictions may count new units built or issued
certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2010 toward the RHNA.
Housing construction in the City has slowed significantly in recent years. Based on the City’s
building permit records, a total of 41 units have been constructed since January 1, 2010. Of
these units, nine are deed-restricted as housing affordable to low income households and seven
are deed-restricted as housing affordable to moderate income households (Table 37). These

affordable units are part of the City’s affordable ownership housing project on Birchwood Lane.
As of the writing of this Housing Element, 18 units have been completed and sold to very-low
and moderate income households. The remaining eight units have been completed and will be
sold as unrestricted to all income levels.
b. Units under Construction
A total of 49 dwelling units within the City were under
construction as of May 2012. The Chambers Senior
Residences “SolTerra” housing project at Linda Way
and Chambers Street in El Cajon broke ground in April
2012. This project will provide affordable and
sustainable residences for very low income seniors. The
development will offer 49 homes and is located at 131
and 155 Chambers Street. Overall, this project achieved
a density of 59 units per acre on a 0.83-acre site.
The residences will also offer on-site management, a
computer lounge, gated and covered parking, and a
community room. Daily shuttle and flex car are also
options available to residents who choose to live a car-
free lifestyle. SolTerra, a mixed-use development, will
also offer its residents the convenience of on-site
businesses and retailers. The project is expected to be
completed April 2013.
c. Units Planned or Approved
As of December 2012, 85 housing units have been planned or approved for development. The
following projects have tentative subdivision maps filed with the City, but no building permits
issued as of yet.

d. Remaining RHNA
After accounting for units built, under construction and approved since January 1, 2010, a
remaining need of 5,630 units exists, including 1,399 very low income, 1,092 low income, and
1,012 moderate income units. The City must demonstrate the availability of sites with
appropriate zoning and development standards that can facilitate and encourage the
development of such units by December 31, 2020.
B. Residential	Sites	Inventory	
Density and Affordability
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the land
inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the regional growth. The City
is committed to identifying sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The State, through
AB 2348, has established “default” density standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes
that a density standard of 30 units per acre for suburban jurisdictions, such as El Cajon, is
adequate to facilitate the production of housing affordable to lower income households.
Currently, the highest multi-family residential zoning in the City is RM-1500, allowing
development at a density of up to 29 units per acre. Most of the City’s existing affordable rental
housing projects were developed on RM-1500 properties. As part of the City’s efforts in
providing adequate sites for the RHNA, the City will be amending the Zoning Code to change
the current RM-1500 zone to RM-1450, allowing up to 30 units per acre.
Therefore, in estimating potential units by income range, it is assumed that:
       A density of 0 to 10 units per acre (primarily for single-family homes) is assumed to
        facilitate housing in the above moderate income category;
       A density of 10.1 to 29 units per acre (primarily for medium density multi-family
        developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the moderate income category; and
       A density of 30 or more units per acre (primarily for higher density multi-family
        developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the very low and low income
        category.

Methodology
Given the built out character of the City, this RHNA allocation represents a significant challenge
to the City of El Cajon. To identify adequate sites to accommodate this significant RHNA, the
City has developed a strategy that involves various approaches that are reasonable and
appropriate for the community.
Development of the sites inventory began with a series of GIS analyses to identify vacant and
underutilized sites throughout the City. Specifically, GIS data from SANDAG and County
Assessor’s Office were used. Vacant and underutilized properties were identified using the
following steps and criteria:
       Improvement-to-land value ratio less than 1.0, indicating the improvements on site are
        worth less than the land and therefore, conducive to recycling to higher intensity uses.
        Google aerial and street-level photos were reviewed to assess the condition of existing
        structures and building footprints versus surface parking areas. Field surveys were
        conducted to confirm the condition of the building structure (deferred maintenance or
        structural problems), level of occupancy (occupied, for lease, or abandoned), and
        existing uses. Properties that appear to house viable uses or with new construction are
        removed from the sites inventory.
       Underutilized sites are those that can accommodate three times the number of existing
        units on site. Any property that cannot result in tripling the existing number of units
        (unless with potential for lot consolidation with adjacent properties) is removed from
        the sites inventory.
       Apartments and condominium structures are automatically removed from the sites
        inventory except in a couple of instances where field surveys and staff knowledge of
        specific properties confirm the feasibility of recycling.
       Additional parcels are added or removed based on interests expressed by developers
        and/or owners’ intents.
City staff then reviewed the inventory of vacant and underutilized sites and proposed a series
of land use policy changes to facilitate a range of housing options to accommodate the RHNA.
The following sections outline the City’s approach to meeting its RHNA.
1. Downtown	El	Cajon	Specific	Plan	182	(SP	182)	
a. Existing Conditions and Recycling Trends
The purpose of SP 182 is to implement the recommendations of the Downtown Master Design
Plan adopted by the City on November 24, 1992. The project area is located in Downtown El
Cajon and centered around the City’s existing civic center and its historic main street area. This
area is primarily developed with low-intensity uses. Many properties are underutilized, with
outdated improvements to remain competitive in the current market.
Revitalization of this Downtown area has been the major focus of the City, the former
Redevelopment Agency, and the former El Cajon Community Development Corporation
(CDC). Until the economic recession that began in 2006, the Downtown area saw significant

Housing	Resources	                             Page	75	                 2013‐2021	Housing	Element	

increases in new businesses and jobs. The City has also invested public funds for capital
investment projects. Private reinvestment was also active. Other improvements included
increased lease rates, decreased crime rates, and increased number of visitors. All these trends
pointed to a market that was conducive to recycling of underutilized sites to higher intensity
uses. The City anticipates the Downtown area remains one of the most prospective areas for
future residential growth in El Cajon once the housing market bounces back from the recession.
Recycling activities that have included residential uses include:
       At the southwest corner of Main Street and Magnolia Avenue, 28 detached townhomes
        and mixed commercial uses were developed on properties that were formerly occupied
        by a variety of nonperforming retail uses.
       A townhome development of 103 units has been approved and partially completed on a
        city block at Park Avenue and Ballantyne Street acquired by the City and former
        Redevelopment Agency. This site was formerly occupied by a variety of nonperforming
        commercial uses.
       The 49-unit Chambers Senior Residences “SolTerra” at Linda Way and Chambers is
        under construction on properties that were formerly developed with underutilized
        residential uses.
b. Development Potential
Currently, mixed use development is allowed in SP 182 via a CUP. No maximum density has
been established for mixed use development. Residential development pursuant to the
underlying zoning is permitted by right with increased densities permitted via a CUP.
In estimating development potential in the Downtown area, the City identified 67 acres of
primarily underutilized land where recycling to high intensity development is feasible and
appropriate. Existing uses include parking lots, vacant retail and office buildings, outdated
office/retail uses, single-family homes, and auto-related uses. A handful of vacant lots
scattered throughout the area.
Among the 67 acres identified, 39.3 acres will continue to offer opportunities for mixed use
development. As no maximum densities are specified for parcels in SP 182, for the purposes of
calculating residential capacity in this Housing Element, a maximum density of 40 units per
acre and an average density of 32 units per acre are used to develop a conservative estimate of
potential capacity. This density level is consistent with the downtown character and transit-
oriented development trend in the region. Transit-oriented development in the neighboring
jurisdiction – La Mesa – achieved a 60-unit per acre density. The 49-unit Chambers Senior
Residences with 2,000 square feet of commercial/retail space achieved a density of 59 units per
acre. Based on an average density of 32 units per acre, vacant and underutilized mixed use
properties in SP 182 can potentially accommodate 1,124 new units.
In addition, the City has identified 27.6 acres of underutilized properties in SP 182 where
recycling to high density residential is appropriate. Program 1 in the Housing Plan section
Section	5:	                                      	                                 City	of	El	Cajon

proposes to amend SP 182 to allow High Density Residential at 40 units per acre on these sites.
These properties can accommodate 739 new units based on an average density of 32 units per
acre. Table 39 provides a summary of the development potential in SP 182. A detailed sites
inventory is included in Appendix C.

2. Westfield	Parkway	Plaza:	Specific	Plan	No.	19	
Specific Plan No. 19 is comprised of the Westfield Parkway Regional Mall located between the
Interstate 8 and Fletcher Parkway. This regional mall site encompasses approximately 75 acres.
This older mall reflects the typical configuration of standalone buildings amongst vast areas of
surface parking. SP No. 19 is zoned C-R, which only allows a caretaker unit at the site. Surface
parking occupies approximately one-third of this site or 27.53 acres.
SANDAG’s Smart Growth Concept Map indicates that the shopping center is a
planned/existing Community Center. The Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP) also indicates
that Community Centers have a land use intensity target of 45+ average units per net acre
within a one-quarter mile of a transit station. Program 1 in the Housing Plan section proposes
to amend SP No. 19 to allow High Density residential at 45 units per acre. For purposes of this
analysis, only the surface parking portion of the site is used.

Outside of the City’s Downtown, most of the City’s vacant and underutilized residential sites
are zoned for low to medium density residential uses. Some are large properties that can be
subdivided and accommodate additional units. When small vacant residential properties are
identified, one unit per legally created lot is assumed in the sites inventory. Based on the
allowable density and effective yield, the 151 vacant and underutilized residential sites in the
City can accommodate 587 units (Table 42). Specifically, 331 units can be accommodated on
low density residential sites, affordable primarily to above moderate income households.
Another 256 units can be accommodated on medium density residential sites that are
considered feasible to facilitate moderate income housing.

Notes:
1. Maximum Density is based on allowable density per Zoning Code.
2. Effective Density Yielded is based on the overall yield in the zone/district, taking into account the following: a) subtracting
    existing units; b) assuming only development up to 80 percent of allowable density on individual lots; and c) assigning one
    unit per legally created lot for small lots.
3. SP7 is implemented by Specific Plan No. 438, which allows residential developments up to 10 units per acre.

a. Vacant and Underutilized Residential Sites to be Upzoned to Achieve General
    Plan Consistency
Throughout the City, certain parcels have zoning designations that are not consistent with the
General Plan Land Use Map, primarily at lower densities than allowed under the General Plan.
As part of this Housing Element update effort, the City proposes to upzone these properties to
align with the General Plan. This effort is anticipated to yield 206 additional units in the City.
Program 1 in the Housing Plan section of this Housing Element outlines the timeline for
achieving this rezoning.

b. Vacant and Underutilized Nonresidential Sites to be Rezoned Mixed Use
The City has underutilized office/commercial properties that are outdated and nonperforming.
The age of these structures makes renovation/rehabilitation to accommodate modern uses or to
meet current building codes costly. Included in this category of potential sites is the Town and
Country Shopping Center, which has a significant portion of the site being used as surface
parking. Throughout California, many communities have successfully transformed outdated
shopping centers into urbanized mixed use centers by infilling the surface parking or unused
“airspace” with residential/mixed use developments and replacing surface parking with
parking structures. Another key site for rezoning to Mixed Use is the Arnele Transit Center site,
where the existing uses are primarily older industrial uses. Surface parking lots at the Trolley
Station also offer excellent potential for transit-oriented mixed use developments in the
community.
To facilitate the reuse of underutilized properties, the City proposes to create two categories of
Mixed Use – MU (30 du/ac) and MU (60 du/ac). Rezoning and/or General Plan Amendment
will be required to implement mixed use on these properties. Overall, new Mixed Use
properties in the City could potentially accommodate 1,580 units at build out. Program 1 in the
Housing Plan outlines the City’s timeline for rezoning and General Plan Amendment.

c. Vacant and Underutilized Residential Sites to be Rezoned High Density
     Residential
Portions of the City, primarily located between El Cajon Boulevard and Main Street, are
currently developed with older single-family homes and multi-family housing at low to low-
medium densities (averaging at a density of 10 units per acre). These areas are located
immediately outside the Downtown area, abutting commercial uses. The City proposes to
create a new High Density Residential zone to allow multi-family housing up to 60 units per
acre. Recycling of these older residential areas is anticipated to yield an additional 937 units.
Implementation of this zone requires both a General Plan Amendment and Zone change.
Program 1 in the Housing Plan outlines the City’s timeline for rezoning and General Plan
Amendment.

d. Housing Overlay Zone
The City has identified a number of vacant and underutilized properties, primarily along
commercial corridors, that due to their neighboring uses, may be appropriate to recycle to
higher density residential uses. The City proposes to introduce a new mechanism – Housing
Overlay Zone – to allow property owners/developer to redevelop these sites into residential
uses as an option. The Housing Overlay Zone is proposed to cover approximately 63 acres of
underperforming commercial and residential areas and may potentially support up to 1,363
additional units.

C. Adequacy	of	Sites	Inventory	
The large RHNA allocation for the City of El Cajon presents a significant challenge to the City,
especially in the current depressed market conditions where development interests are limited.
To accommodate the remaining RHNA of 5,630 units, the City developed a multi-tier land use
strategy, involving rezoning and upzoning based on market feasibility and compatibility with
surrounding uses.
Overall, future residential development will occur as higher density residential developments.
At buildout, this land use strategy can accommodate 7,643 additional units (including more
than 6,500 units being accommodated on high-density residential or mixed use sites). However,
not all mixed use sites are expected to be developed with a residential component. Assuming
50 percent of the mixed use sites to be developed with a residential component, the overall
capacity is estimated at 6,291 units, adequate to meet the City’s remaining RHNA of 5,630 units
(see Table 47).
It is the City’s intent to preserve the single-family neighborhoods and offer affordable
homeownership opportunities to residents. Therefore, few existing single-family residential
properties have been identified for rezoning/upzoning.                              Affordable homeownership
opportunities will likely be accommodated in the form of townhomes and condominiums.
As discussed earlier and summarized in Table 47, the City’s RHNA strategy involving rezoning
and upzoning of properties as outlined in previous sections and summarized in Figure 13.

 Rezoning and upzoning will occur within three years of the Housing Element adoption.
 Without rezoning, the City’s sites inventory would offer a capacity for only 1,827 units,
 resulting in a RHNA deficit of 3,803 units. State law specifies that if rezoning/upzoning is
 required to accommodate the RHNA, only half of the RHNA shortfall in the lower income
 category can come from mixed use developments. The other half of the lower income RHNA
 shortfall must be accommodated in high-density residential zones. As shown in Table 48, the
 majority of the sites identified for rezoning/upzoning are for residential-only sites.

D. Funding	Resources	
With the dissolution of the El Cajon Redevelopment Agency pursuant to State law and
diminishing housing funds available at the State and federal levels, the City of El Cajon must
prioritize its limited funding to address the most critical housing needs. For the 2013-2020
Housing Element planning period, the City anticipates funding available from the following
programs:
1. Redevelopment	Funds	
Since 1952, tax increment financing ("redevelopment funds") has been a primary source of
funding used to redevelop blighted communities. Under California Redevelopment Law (CRL),
redevelopment agencies were given broad powers and specific tools to conduct redevelopment
activities that could include assembling property, issuing bonds, investing in infrastructure, and
providing affordable housing. Redevelopment in EI Cajon was focused on eliminating blighted
conditions in the City, and was effective in spurring new development, promoting job growth
and generating tax revenues. In EI Cajon, the EI Cajon Redevelopment Agency was the agency
given responsibility for carrying out the activities allowed under CRL. In addition, under CRL,
not less than 20 percent of redevelopment funds collected was to be set aside for low and
moderate income housing households. These "Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds" were
used to increase, improve or preserve the supply of low and moderate income housing within
the city limits of EI Cajon. These funds provided effective means for the City to leverage
additional funds and served as a major source of match for HOME funds.
However, the Governor's decision to sign into law ABx1 26 and ABx1 27 on June 28, 2011, and a
subsequent Court ruling in December of 2011 striking down the legality of provisions contained
with ABx1 27, eliminated the opportunity for redevelopment agencies to continue to exist and
dissolved redevelopment agencies throughout the State of California as of February 1, 2012.
Any unencumbered redevelopment funds will likely be transmitted to the County to re-
distribute to taxing entities including the City, School and various other special districts.
Section	5:	                                        	                                    City	of	El	Cajon

However, return of Low and Moderate Income Housing funds received by the El Cajon
Housing Authority from assets approved by the California Department of Finance on the
Housing Assets List, will be utilized to produce, assist or leverage the production or
preservation of affordable housing units and activities. These funds are identified in Section 6 as
Low and Moderate-Income Housing Asset Funds (“LMIHAF”) and eligible activities include,
but are not limited to:
       Acquisition
       New Construction
       Rehabilitation
       Homebuyer Assistance
       Preservation of At-Risk Units
       Administration
2. Community	Development	Block	Grant	(CDBG)	
CDBG funds are grants awarded to the City on a formula basis for housing and community
development activities. Eligible activities include:
       Acquisition
       Rehabilitation
       Public Improvement
       Economic Development
       Homeless Assistance
       Public Services
The City of El Cajon currently receives approximately $1,000,000 in CDBG funds annually. This
funding is used primarily for providing public improvements. However, a portion of the
CDBG funds is used to provide housing rehabilitation assistance, emergency shelter programs,
and fair housing services.
3. HOME	Investment	Partnerships	Act	(HOME)	
The HOME program is a flexible grant program awarded to the City on a formula basis for
expanding affordable housing opportunities. Eligible activities include:
       New Construction
       Acquisition
       Rehabilitation
       Home Buyer Assistance
       Rental Assistance
The City currently receives approximately $380,000 in HOME funds annually. HOME funds are
used for various housing activities including single-family rehabilitation, mobile home
rehabilitation, multi-family rehabilitation, and first-time homebuyer assistance as specific
projects are identified.

4. Housing	Choice	Vouchers	
The Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly known as Section 8) provides rental assistance
payments to owners of private market rate units on behalf of very low income tenants. The City
Housing Authority of the County of San Diego administers the Section 8 program in the City of
El Cajon.
5. CalHOME	Funds		
The CalHome Program is a competitive application process that provides funds to local public
agencies and non-profit organizations for deferred-payment mortgage assistance loans for low
income first-time homebuyers or for owner-occupied rehabilitation. In FY 2012-13, San Diego
Habitat for Humanity used a portion of its most recent award of CalHome funds to supplement
the City's HOME funds to provide assistance to first-time buyers to purchase units developed in
the City by Habitat for Humanity.
E. Administrative	Capacity	
1. El	Cajon	Housing	Authority	
The City Council established and activated the EI Cajon Housing Authority in March 2011, a
new agency, and adopted a resolution to become the Successor Agency for all housing assets
and functions acquired or assisted with Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds in January
2012. Although no new Low and Moderate Income Housing funds will be available, the El
Cajon Housing Authority has accepted responsibility for the physical housing assets and
housing loan portfolio which may continue to generate income as loans are repaid. The EI
Cajon Housing Authority will have responsibility for determining the direction and focus of
any income generated from original Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds. A plan for the
use of income generated from these assets, including specific goals, objectives and activities, is
currently under development.
2. Affordable	Housing	Partners	
The City works closely with affordable housing developers to expand housing opportunities in
the City. Specifically, the City of El Cajon has partnered with the following nonprofit and for-
profit affordable housing developers.
       Affirmed Housing: Affirmed Housing provides affordable housing in the San Diego
        region, with an emphasis on housing for persons with disabilities.
       Habitat for Humanity: The City recently provided HOME funds to leverage CalHOME
        funds received by Habitat for Humanity to assist first-time homebuyers in the City.

       San Diego Community Housing Corporation: This City has provided HOME funds to
        San Diego Community Housing Corporation to acquire land and construct ownership
        housing units for lower income first-time homebuyers.
       San Diego Interfaith Housing Federation: Interfaith Housing is organized by churches
        interested in addressing the housing needs of low and moderate income families, the
        elderly and disabled persons.
       Weiland Development Company: The City and former El Cajon Redevelopment
        Agency has provided funds to Weiland Development Company to acquire land and
        construct ownership housing units for very-low, moderate and above-moderate income
        first-time homebuyers.
       Priest Development Corporation: The former El Cajon Redevelopment Agency has
        provided funds to Priest Development Company to acquire land and construct
        ownership housing units for very-low income first-time homebuyers.
3. Housing	Authority	of	the	County	of	San	Diego	
The Housing Authority of the County of San Diego administers the Housing Choice Voucher
Program (Section 8) on behalf of the City of El Cajon. Currently, approximately 2,500
households in El Cajon are utilizing Housing Choice Vouchers.
F. Opportunities	for	Energy	Conservation	
1. City	Initiatives	
In 2010, the former Redevelopment Agency established the Greenovation Program for the
acquisition, rehabilitation and resale of substandard, distressed, and foreclosed single-family
properties in the former Redevelopment Project Area. The former Agency entered into an
agreement with Bay Kitchen &Bath to identify blighted homes within the former EI Cajon
Redevelopment Project Area, to acquire or assist in acquiring properties, to substantially
rehabilitate the units by including Green or sustainable improvements, and then to sell those
dwellings to low and moderate income households under the California Dream First-Time
Homebuyer Program. The Agency pledged Low and Moderate Income Housing funds to
underwrite this Program and each property will have recorded covenants to ensure
affordability periods for 45 or 55 years. The Housing Authority assumed this commitment and
has authorized an expansion of the program parameters in January 2013 to include acquisition
of multi-family properties and is subject to approval by the Successor Agency Oversight Board
and the California Department of Finance.

2. State	Regulations	and	Programs	
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code establishes energy conservation standards that
must be applied to all new residential buildings. The regulations specify energy saving design
for walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems,
gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the use of non-depleting energy sources, such
as solar energy or wind power. Compliance with the energy standards is achieved by satisfying
certain conservation requirements and an energy budget. Among the alternative ways to
meeting the energy standards are the following:
       Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper solar orientation,
        appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation
        levels.
       Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has
        no thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
       Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water
        heating in exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
Residential developers must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
The California Department of Community Services and Development in partnership with the
network of local community services agencies that assist lower-income households, administers
the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Energy Low Income
Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE-LIWAP). LIHEAP provides financial assistance to
lower income households to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling their residences. DOE-
LIWAP provides installation and weatherization measures that increase energy efficiency of
existing residential and multi-family dwellings occupied by lower-income persons. Eligible
weatherization services include a wide variety of energy efficiency measures that encompass
the building envelope, its heating and cooling systems, its electrical system, and electricity
consuming appliances. In San Diego County, the energy service provider is Campesinos
Unidos, Inc.
    	
3. Private	Sector	Programs	
The following private sector energy conservation programs are available to housing developers
and El Cajon residents:
       California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE): Lower-income customers enrolled in
        the CARE program receive a 20 percent discount on their electric and natural gas bills
        and are not billed in higher rate tiers that were created for San Diego Gas & Electric
        (SDG&E). CARE is funded through a rate surcharge paid by all other utility customers.

       Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR): Includes a one-year electric rate reduction
        home energy audit, free compact fluorescent lights, and replacement of inefficient
        refrigerators. Income qualification and enrollment by Red Cross.
       Family Electric Rate Assistance Program (FERA): This program was developed for
        families whose household income slightly exceeds the threshold for assistance in other
        energy program allowances. Qualifying households have some of their electricity usage
        billed at a lower rate.
       Low Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEE): The LIEE program provides no-cost
        weatherization services to lower income households who meet the CARE guidelines.
        Services provided include attic insulation, energy efficient refrigerators, energy efficient
        furnaces, weather stripping, caulking, low-flow showerheads, water heater blankets,
        and door and building envelop repairs that reduce air infiltration.
       Residential Energy Standards Training: SDG&E offers seminars on energy efficiency
        compliance best practices. Architects, designers, builders, engineers, energy consultants,
        HVAC contractors, building department inspectors, and plan checkers are encouraged
        to learn about new technologies that improve energy efficiency and reduce the cost of
        complying with evolving State energy standards.
       Lighting Turn-In Program: Through this program, SDG&E replaces resident’s
        incandescent bulbs with more energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) free of
        charge. Residents can access the program via community events that are held
        throughout SDG&E’s service area and coordinated through an extensive network of
        community organizations and government agencies.
       Rebate Program: SDG&E offers rebates for single-family and multifamily dwelling units
        for certain improvements in their units that lead to greater energy efficiency. These
        improvements include purchase and installation of insulation, energy-efficient
        appliances, and the replacement of old light bulbs with Energy Star light bulbs.

Section 6: Housing Plan
The Housing Plan identifies the City’s housing goals, polices, and implementing programs. The
overall strategy is to present a balanced and diverse array of policies that cover four overall
areas of concern: construction, rehabilitation, conservation, and administration. The goals and
policies of the Housing Element were organized into concise goal and policy directives.
A.Goal,	Objectives,	and	Implementing	Programs	
The City of El Cajon’s overarching housing goal is to:
    Increase, improve and preserve a variety of safe, decent, affordable housing units
    meeting the existing and future needs of El Cajon residents of all income levels,
    including special needs populations.
Objective	1:		 Accommodate	 an	 Increase	 in	 Residential	 Units	 for	 All	
                    Income	Levels	
Policy 1-1:     Facilitate the production of housing for all segments of the population including
                those with special needs.
Policy 1-2:     Encourage that housing constructed expressly for lower income households not
                to be concentrated in any single portion of the City.
Policy 1-3:     Encourage the development of new housing units in close proximity to public
                transportation and community services.
Policy 1-4:     Ensure that any future development adjacent to or near the railroad/light rail
                right-of-way is planned with the safety of the rail corridor in mind.
Program 1: Adequate Sites for Meeting RHNA
The City of El Cajon has been assigned a Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) of 5,805
units for the 2013-2020 Housing Element. With units constructed, under construction and
approved at the time of writing this Housing Element, the City has met a portion of its RHNA,
with a remaining RHNA of 5,630 units: 1,399 extremely low/very low income units; 1,092 low
income units; 1,012 moderate income units; and 2,127 above moderate income units. The City is
committed to providing adequate sites to accommodate the remaining RHNA. To accomplish
this mandate by the State, the City will:
       SP No. 182: Amend SP No. 182 to allow 27.6 acres of existing commercial and medium
        density residential uses to be developed with new High Density Residential zone at 40
        units per acre (see Table 39 and Appendix C for details).

       Westfield Parkway Plaza SP 19: Amend SP 19 to allow residential development at 45
        units per acre (see Table 40 and Appendix C for details).
       Consistency with General Plan: Rezone 34.6 acres of vacant and underutilized lower
        density residential sites to be consistent with the General Plan (see Table 43 and
        Appendix C for details).
       Mixed Use: Create two new mixed use zones – Mixed Use (30 du/ac) and Mixed Use (60
        du/ac) and redesignate 49 acres of existing vacant and underutilized
        commercial/industrial uses to M-U (30 du/ac) – 30 acres and M-U (60 du/ac) – 18.9
        acres (see Table 44 and Appendix C for details).
       High Density Residential: Rezone existing vacant and underutilized low to medium
        density residential uses to RM-HR (60 du/ac) (see Table 45 and Appendix C for details).
       High Density Residential - RM-1450: The current High Density Residential Zone of
        RM-1500 allows development up to 29 units per acre. The Zoning Code will be
        amended to change the RM-1500 zone to RM-1450, allowing up to 30 units per acre.
       Housing Overlay Zone: Create a new zoning mechanism – Housing Overlay Zone – that
        can be applied to 63.8 acres of existing vacant and underutilized nonresidential
        properties. The property owners have to option of redeveloping these properties as
        medium density residential uses as RS-2200 (19.8 du/ac) or RM-1500 (30 du/ac)
        depending on the location (see Table 46 and Appendix C for details).
The above rezoning/upzoning actions will result in a capacity of 5,816 units (Table 48.
Combined residential capacity under the City’s existing land use policies, the City offers a total
capacity for 7,643 units, adequate to meet the City’s remaining RHNA of 5,630 units (see Table
47).
Specifically, the City’s current sites capacity has a shortfall of 1,363 lower income units.
Rezoning to accommodate this component of the RHNA must meet the following requirements:
       Sites must be rezoned to permit owner-occupied and rental multi-family housing by
        right without discretionary review of the use or density;
       Sites must be zoned with a minimum density of at least 20 units per acre and permit at
        least 16 units per site;
       At least 50 percent of the lower income RHNA shortfall (682 units) must be permitted on
        sites designated for residential use where nonresidential uses or mixed use are not
        permitted.
For the specific rezoning efforts meeting the requirements stated above, the City will focus in
areas near public transit (sites at the Arnele Transit Center, Marshall Trolley East, and Marshall
Trolley West), as well as sites proposed for rezoning to High Density Residential (60 units per
acre). Combined, these areas offer a capacity for 1,684 additional units at 60 units per acre (747
mixed use residential units and 937 residential-only units). Contiguous areas with adjacent

  Agencies:           Commission; City Council
  Objectives and
                        Pursue amendments to the General Plan, Specific Plans, and Zoning
  Timeframe:
                         Code as outlined above by June 30, 2015. Establish appropriate
                         development standards to permit residential developments to occur
                         at the allowable maximum densities for the respective zones.
                        Provide appropriate land use designations to fulfill the City's share
                         of regional housing needs of 5,805 units.
                        Maintain an inventory of vacant and underutilized sites and monitor
                         the development trends to ensure continued adequacy of the sites
                         inventory in meeting the RHNA.
                        Make available the sites inventory to interested developers.
Program 2: Monitoring of Residential Capacity (Not Net Loss)
The City will monitor the consumption of residential acreage to ensure an adequate inventory is
available to meet the City’s RHNA obligations. To ensure sufficient residential capacity is
maintained to accommodate the RHNA, the City will develop and implement a formal ongoing
(project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code Section 65863. Should
an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity below the residential capacity
needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower income households, the City will identify
and if necessary rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall and ensure “no net loss” in
capacity to accommodate the RHNA.

                              Monitor and report through the HCD annual report process.
Program 4: Second Units/Granny Flats
State law requires ministerial approval of second dwelling units under certain circumstances.
The City currently requires an Administrative Zoning Permit (AZP) for the approval of second
units in single-family zones. AZP review is discretionary although a public hearing is not
required. The City will update the Zoning Code to establish criteria for ministerial
consideration of second dwelling units pursuant to AB 1866.

In addition, to promote second units, the City will amend the Zoning Code to remove the
requirement for separate water meters for second units (granny flats), and to allow required
second unit parking to be accommodated on driveways serving the primary unit.

                           remove the requirement for separate water meters, and to allow
                           the required parking be accommodated on driveways.
                          Achieve five second units annually for a total of 40 units over the
                           next eight years.
Program 5: Affordable Housing Development
The City continues to have extensive needs for affordable housing for lower income
households, especially for seniors, disabled, the homeless, and those at imminent risk of
becoming homeless. The City will continue to work with housing developers to expand
affordable housing opportunities in the community.
   Funding:            HOME; LIHTC; Multi-Family Housing Revenue Bonds; Other
                       resources as available.

   Objectives and         Continue to streamline the environmental review process for
   Timeframe:              housing developments, using available state categorical
                           exemptions and federal categorical exclusions, when applicable.
                          Annually allocate designated affordable housing funds to increase
                           the supply of safe, decent, affordable housing in El Cajon for
                           lower income households (including extremely low income
                           households), such as seniors, disabled, the homeless, and those at
                           risk of homelessness.
                          Annually pursue State, Federal and other funding opportunities to
                           increase the supply of safe, decent, affordable housing in El Cajon
                           for lower income households (including extremely low income

Program 6: Affordable Housing Ordinance
With the dissolution of the El Cajon Redevelopment Agency, the City’s ability to subsidize
affordable housing construction has been seriously compromised. Without redevelopment
housing set-aside funds and diminishing State and federal housing funds, the City does not
have adequate funding capacity to pursue affordable housing projects at a meaningful scale.
The City will evaluate the need for a citywide Affordable Housing Ordinance that includes an
inclusionary housing component, an in-lieu fee option, and other incentives to promote the
inclusion of affordable units in private developments.

El Cajon’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing program consists of three phases: Phase 1 is an eight-hour
seminar for owners, property managers, and property staff; Phase 2 is the Safety Inspection; and
Phase 3 is the Safety Social. An apartment complex, mobile home or hotel/motel that completes
the program is certified as a Crime-Free property for one year. This program is a recognized
program in which tenants in search of housing seek out Crime-Free properties. Certified
properties are allowed to use the Crime-Free program logo in advertising the properties and the
Police Department keeps a list of certified Crime-Free properties.

Program 10: Greenovation Program
In 2010, the former Redevelopment Agency established the Greenovation Program for the
acquisition, rehabilitation and resale of substandard, distressed and foreclosed single-family
properties in the former Redevelopment Project Area. The former Agency entered into an
agreement with Bay Kitchen & Bath to identify blighted homes within the former EI Cajon
Redevelopment Project Area, to acquire or assist in acquiring properties, to substantially
rehabilitate the units by including Green or sustainable improvements, and then to sell those
dwellings to low and moderate income households under the California Dream First-Time
Homebuyer Program. The Agency pledged Low and Moderate Income Housing funds to
underwrite this Program and each property will have recorded covenants to ensure
affordability periods for 45 or 55 years. The Housing Authority assumed this commitment and
has authorized an expansion of the program parameters in January 2013 to include acquisition
of multi-family properties and is subject to approval by the Successor Agency Oversight Board
and the California Department of Finance.

The Housing Authority of the County of San Diego (HACSD) administers the Housing Choice
Voucher Program (Section 8) on behalf of most of the cities in the region, including the City of
EI Cajon. This program provides rent subsidy payments for very low income households in
privately owned rental housing units. It is anticipated that just over $100 million in Section 8
funds will be used to assist nearly 11,000 households throughout the County. Of these
households, approximately 2,400 households (22 percent) are assisted annually with Housing
Choice Vouchers in the City of EI Cajon.

Program 17: Mortgage Credit Certificates
The San Diego Regional Mortgage Credit Certificate Program allows qualified first-time
homebuyers to reduce their federal income tax by up to 20 percent of the annual interest paid
on a mortgage loan. With less being paid in taxes, the homebuyer's net earnings increase,
enabling him/her to more easily qualify for a mortgage loan. Purchasing property in
designated areas increases the income eligibility and purchase price limits, as well as removes
the first-time homebuyer requirement. An MCC may only be used to purchase single-family
detached homes, condominiums, townhomes and manufactured homes on a permanent
foundation.
The City of El Cajon has participated with most of the other jurisdictions in San Diego County
for the administration of the Mortgage Credit Certification (MCC) Program (17 of the 19
jurisdictions pool the resources, only the cities of San Diego and Oceanside administer their
own on a separate basis). MCC can be used in conjunction with other local programs.

Program 18: Zoning Code Amendments
The City will amend its Zoning Code to address the provision of housing for the homeless and
persons with special needs. The majority of these amendments involve just technical
corrections for minor inconsistencies with State law or within the Zoning Code sections. These
amendments would ensure consistent interpretation of the Zoning Code. Detailed discussions
about these housing options are provided in the Housing Constraints section of this Housing

                         El Cajon will pursue the following:
                            Findings for Multi-Family Housing: Amend the Zoning Code to
                             include minimum and objective findings for Site Development
                             Plan approval for multi-family housing pursuant to State law to
                             provide certainty for development.
                            Second Units: Amend the Zoning Code to make second unit
                             approval a ministerial process with established standards for
                             approval, to remove the separate water meters requirement, and
                             to allow the use of driveway of the primary unit to fulfill the
                             parking requirement for the second unit.
                            Manufactured Housing: Amend the Zoning Code to allow
                             manufactured housing by-right in all zones that allow single-
                             family dwellings. Currently the Zoning Code only defines
                             manufactured housing, but does not explicitly allow or prohibit
                             the use.
                            Small Residential Care Facilities: Amend the Zoning Code to

Appendix A: Public Participation
Plan
The City implemented a comprehensive public participation program for the development of
the Housing Element (see attached).
Joint City Council and Planning Commission Workshop – May 28, 2013
On May 28, 2013, the City conducted a Joint City Council and Planning Commission Workshop
on the Draft Housing Element. A local developer and a property owner provided public
comments in support of the Housing Element.
Public Review of Draft Housing Element
During the public review period of the Draft Housing Element, the City had received comments
from several property owners writing in support of the Housing Element. Specifically, three
property owners requested to be included in the rezoning program. Staff reviewed the
appropriateness of the individual requests and adjusted the sites inventory accordingly.
The California Public Utilities Commission also provided comments on the Housing Element,
recommending adding language to the Housing Element so that any future development
adjacent to or near the railroad/light rail right-of-way is planned with the safety of the rail
corridor in mind. The Housing Element has been revised to include such a policy.

2013-2020 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE:
    HOUSING EL CAJON’S FUTURE
      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PLAN
               June 26, 2012

1. INTRODUCTION
State law requires the City to have an adopted General Plan containing at least seven elements,
including a Housing Element. Unlike the other mandatory General Plan elements, the Housing
Element is required to be updated periodically and is subject to detailed statutory requirements
and certification by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
State law requires that Housing Element updates in the San Diego region be completed by
April 30, 2013, but it also allows a 120 day grace period after the deadline to comply. The
purpose of the Housing Element update is to assess the current housing needs of all economic
segments of the City of El Cajon and to define goals and policies that will guide the City’s
approach to resolving those needs.
2. PURPOSE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Participation by the public is a critical aspect of the Housing Element update. Public
participation helps to ensure that appropriate housing strategies are more efficiently and
effectively evaluated, developed, and implemented. Successful public participation is also
important because a diverse cross section of the population can be engaged in defining housing
problems and in crafting community sensitive solutions. Another benefit of broad participation
is that when it is time to adopt housing strategies and approve housing developments, a
greater portion of the community has been involved and participated in the plan and more
frequently will support its implementation. Meaningful participation increases the legitimacy
and accountability of decisions made throughout the Housing Element update. Participation
will be achieved by engaging the general public as well as key stakeholders such as government
agencies, developers and housing advocates. Evidence of public participation in the Housing
Element update is required by HCD.
3. APPROACH
The philosophy of the Public Participation Plan is to obtain meaningful public input in the
preparation of the new Housing Element. The approach to achieving an adopted and certified
Housing Element is built on these themes:
    •   Be broad: Reach out and be accessible to a broad array of stakeholders to inclusively
        capture the diverse array of housing perspectives, needs, issues and opportunities.
    •   Be strategic: Maximize resources by proactively targeting key stakeholders and
        continue to communicate with them throughout the process. Use a variety of outreach
        methods to gain public input.
    •   Be transparent and communicate: Sharing complete work products and communicating
        findings provides a foundation from which to yield meaningful public input. Good
        communication includes listening to public input and acknowledging what was heard in
        summary reports. Being transparent and communicating also includes checking in with
        the Planning Commission and City Council at key milestones by reporting and reviewing
        the information, while seeking feedback and direction.
    •   Build consensus step-by-step: This approach is designed to maximize the potential for
        consensus and focus the policy discussion on a few key issues. This result is
                                             Page 2

                                  accomplished incrementally, with each successive step in the process building upon the
                                  previous.

                                  strategies and tactics worked and what enhancements could be made for future
                                  Housing Element updates
                                                                        Page 3

5. PROPOSED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION METHODS
The following methods of obtaining public input will be used:
   •    Community Meetings:
        Community meetings will occur after the adoption of the Public Participation Plan, in
        July and September. Meetings will be conducted during the day and in the evening.
   •    Community Events Participation:
        To reach a wider audience, project information will be provided and community input
        sought through participation in community events. The Cajon Classic Cruise is a
        community event (car show) that occurs periodically in downtown El Cajon. Staff
        proposes having a booth at two of the Classic Cruise events in order to solicit input from
        the public. Concerts on the Promenade are another community event that occurs on a
        weekly basis on Fridays, during the summer. Staff proposes to have a booth at two of
        the concert events. Staff will also host a booth at the Mother Goose parade.
   •    Stakeholder Outreach:
        A list of stakeholders is identified in the attached in Appendix A. The stakeholders
        include religious institutions, charities, housing advocates, developers, downtown
        stakeholders, major employers, etc. Staff will contact these stakeholders and request
        that they participate in the update.
   •    Internet Surveys:
        Stakeholders that are willing to participate in the update will be sent a survey. The
        survey will also be available on the project web page and at all community events.
   •    Media Communications:
        The El Cajon Community Bulletin Board broadcasts daily on Channel 24 within the City
        limits of El Cajon on Cox Cable. It is filled with useful information such as job openings,
        community events, schedules for City Council and Commission meetings, safety tips, City
        information and much more. Information concerning the Housing Element will be
        added to the Bulletin Board, which will then be available to the public. A project fact
        sheet will be created that will include useful information about the Housing Element.
        Information concerning the Housing Element will be translated into Spanish and Arabic.
        A new City of El Cajon Housing Element Facebook page will be created. Information will
        be added to the Community Development Department Web page to build awareness
        about the Housing Element, promote outreach events, provide information, secure
        input, and facilitate dialogue. Staff will send e-mail notifications to stakeholders prior to
        community meetings and events. All project informational materials will be updated to
        reflect any updated or changed information that occurs during the preparation of the
        Housing Element. This will include updates to the Web site, Facebook page,
        presentations and any other materials that provide project information.
                                               Page 4

    •   Joint City Council – Planning Commission Study Sessions:
        Study sessions would be public meetings to check in with the Planning Commission and
        City Council at key milestones, as shown in the public participation schedule in
        November and February.
    •   Public Review of Draft and Final Documents:
        Prior to the adoption hearings, the updated Draft Housing Element will be available for
        review at City Hall and at the two public libraries in the City of El Cajon, 201 East Douglas
        Avenue and 576 Garfield Avenue. The Draft Housing Element will also be posted on the
        City’s website. Staff will also distribute information about the availability of the draft
        Housing Element to all of the stakeholders listed in Appendix A and anyone else who
        asks, and requests to participate in the update.
    •   Public Hearings:
        Required public hearings will be conducted by the Planning Commission and City Council
        at the end of the process. The public hearings will be the final opportunity for public
        input at the local level.
6. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PLAN REPORTING
Staff will provide reports to the Planning Commission and City Council at key project milestones
to summarize what has been learned through the Public Participation Plan. These reports will
include:
    •   A quantitative assessment of the Public Participation Plan including the number
        meetings/presentations/events participated in, number of friends on Facebook,
        approximate number of people reached, and number of comments received
    •   A summary of input received
    •   Any proposed modifications to the Public Participation Plan based on assessments at
        key milestones
7. WORK PROGRAM AND SCHEDULE OVERVIEW

Housing Element update. The schedule will create a framework that will allow the Housing
Element update to be adopted no more than 120 days after April 30, 2013, as required by the
State. Specific dates and tasks are approximate and may evolve, as the public process is
dynamic, necessitating responsiveness and adaptation of this Public Participation Plan.
