 I. Executive Summary
INTRODUCTION
By state mandate each city and county in California is required to plan for the housing
needs for its share of the expected new households in the Bay Region over the next five to
eight years as well as for the housing needs of all economic segments of the city’s
population. This planning will be done in Burlingame by updating the City’s 2009-2014
Housing Element of the General Plan. Broad based community participation is essential to
preparing an implementable and locally meaningful housing policy and action program. The
programs included in this document evolved from the participation and experience of local
residents and representatives of agencies which provide housing and other social service
assistance to city, county and regional residents.
PROFILE OF THE COMMUNITY
Research on Burlingame community demographics identifies some themes of change
through the years. While the city’s total population has remained fairly stable over the past
40 years there has been an increase in ethnic diversity and number of children living at
home as well as growth in the population approaching retirement. The median income in
2011 was $88,915 (in 2013 inflation adjusted numbers). The median prices of single-family
homes ($1,400,000) and multiple-family homes ($650,000) in 2012 reflected the rising
home prices in a recovering housing market. More than three-quarters of the city’s housing
stock is over 50 years old, but most remain well maintained as exemplified by the number
of building permits issued for improvements during the previous planning period.
HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Residential developers looking to build in Burlingame face zoning regulations and fees
comparable to those in other San Mateo cities. Like all cities in the state, but particularly
because of our location on the edge of San Francisco Bay, the regulations of outside
agencies have come to play an increasing role. These regulations tend to increase both
processing time and cost of new residential development. Since, like our San Francisco
Peninsula neighbors, the city is essentially “built out,” scarcity of land and high construction
costs increase the cost of housing. While energy is a critical parameter to future growth
throughout California today, Burlingame has been aggressive in implementing local
conservation and recycling legislation as well as providing information on energy
conservation programs offered by other agencies.
COMMUNITY RESOURCES
The city began as a small settlement centered on the Burlingame Train Station (designated
a State Historic Landmark). In a sense, this was an early example of what urban planners
now refer to as “transit villages,” though at the time it was simply a reflection of the
transportation and development patterns of the time. Later the City of Burlingame annexed
the Broadway train station and the settlement adjacent to it. A century later, the Millbrae
train station just to the north of Burlingame was expanded to provide both Caltrain and
BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) service, as well as SamTrans bus service, creating a robust
regionally-oriented transit hub within proximity to Burlingame’s northern neighborhoods.
Over these same decades, El Camino Real developed with the city’s highest-density
Profile of the Community                                                                 Page 5

residential uses – a pattern distinctly different from other cities on the Peninsula, where it
developed as a commercial corridor.
Because the land area of Burlingame is primarily built-out, the majority of new housing
opportunities will have to replace existing development. In the proposed planning program
the key sites for residential reuse follow the compact, transit–oriented pattern of our past,
building on the transit access opportunities offered at the northern end of the city, in
Downtown and along El Camino Real. Beyond these areas, additional sites in “buffer areas”
offer opportunities to improve compatibility between low-scale residential and other land
uses. The site selection program evaluated residential densities and affordability, and these
opportunities were influenced by community goals such as situating housing within
proximity to transit and providing sensitive transitions between existing lower-scale
residential neighborhoods and other uses. An infrastructure study and program confirmed
that services are available through collection and processing facilities that are in place to
support these programs.
Implementation of the 2009-2014 Housing Element demonstrated the effectiveness of using
local legislation to achieve housing policy. Zoning changes were implemented to incorporate
high density residential and mixed use zoning in the Downtown area, with incentives such
as reduced parking and increased height. Continuing the single family residential design
review process effectively conserved neighborhood character while supporting maintenance
of an older housing stock. A new second unit ordinance was implemented to allow second
units on some R-1 zoned lots when certain development standards are met. The Second
Unit Amnesty program was continued to legalize and preserve older second units in the
single family zoned areas.
COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITIES
The 2009-2014 Housing Element set the foundation for policies and programs that provide
the best opportunities to meet the City’s fair share of housing needs. Starting with the areas
already identified for housing opportunities in the Downtown and North Burlingame areas,
additional opportunities were added within these areas and along the El Camino Real Priority
Development Area. The most effective programs from the 2009-2014 Housing Element have
been carried forward, as well as new programs which will expand opportunities for zoning
incentives to the transportation corridors as well as the transit hubs.
EVALUATION OF THE 2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
There were several key programs which were most successful in implementing the goals
and policies of the 2009-2014 Housing Element. These include the following:
    1) Zoning Implementation for the Downtown Specific Plan, which created new multi-
        family and mixed use zoning districts within the Downtown area, and provided for
        reduced parking requirements for properties within this transit oriented area;
    2) Adding a residential overlay zone in an older commercial area between two existing
        residential communities to allow for high density residential use;
    3) Providing opportunities for emergency shelters for the homeless and for supportive
        and transitional housing as outlined in State law;
    4) Adopting a Reasonable Accommodations for Accessibility Ordinance to establish a
        process by which an individual with a disability may request modification to
        development standards to install improvements such as ramps, handrails or lifts,
        necessary to accommodate the disability; and
Profile of the Community                                                                Page 6

    5) Allowing for new secondary dwelling units subject to performance standards on some
        single family residential lots.
Other programs that continued successfully throughout the planning period, which include:
    1) Continuation of the second unit amnesty program which allows nonconforming
        second units which meet certain criteria to become a permanent part of the city's
        housing stock; and
    2) Residential design review to provide for compatibility of additions and new
        construction with existing neighborhoods.
All of these programs are being used as a basis for development of the 2015-2023 work
program where the following is also proposed:
    1) Additional incentives be offered in a wider area (along the El Camino Real and
        California Drive transit corridors);
    2) Consider adoption of a commercial impact in-lieu fee based on a nexus impact fee
        study and a residential in-lieu fee as an alternative to providing affordable units on
        site; and
    3) Implement an outreach program for persons with disabilities.
HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTION PROGRAM
The Housing Element’s goals and policies describe the City’s land use and development
parameters for residential land uses. The action program for each policy describes the
specific means and targets for each program to implement the City’s housing policies
between 2015 and 2023. The Housing Element is unique because a quantified eight-year
program is required. Each action program also has a specific time frame. These
requirements form the basis of the annual progress report provided to the City Council.

II. Introduction
ROLE AND ORGANIZATION OF HOUSING ELEMENT
Each city and county in California is required to plan for the housing needs of all economic
segments of its population. California Government Code Section 65400 sets forth
requirements for a Housing Element, one of the seven mandatory elements of a local
general plan. Communities in the nine Bay Area counties are required to update their
Housing Elements by January 31, 2015.
The law sets guidelines for the preparation and adoption of a Housing Element. Local
governments are required to “make a diligent effort” to involve all economic segments of
their population in development of the Housing Element. The future local housing needs
numbers for Burlingame which are to be addressed in the housing element were developed
by the twenty-one cities within San Mateo County, as well as the County itself, with the help
of the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The twenty-one cities, organized as
the 21 Elements Technical Advisory Committee, determined a methodology for housing unit
allocation specific to their region. Local governments are also directed by the government
code to address housing needs by lowering barriers and encouraging the construction of
housing for all economic segments of the population; but local governments are not
required by State mandate to build housing directly or commit the City’s operating funds to
the effort of building housing.
Burlingame’s Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
    • Preserving and improving housing and neighborhoods;
    • Providing adequate housing sites;
    • Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
    • Removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment; and
    • Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
The City’s Housing Element consists of the following major components:
    • An analysis of the city’s demographic, household and housing characteristics and
        related housing needs.
    • A review of potential market, governmental, and infrastructure constraints to
        meeting Burlingame’s identified housing needs.
    • An evaluation of residential sites, financial and administrative resources available to
        address the City’s housing goals.
    • The Housing Element Work Program for addressing Burlingame’s housing needs,
        including housing goals, policies and programs.
The Burlingame Housing Element is a statement of community housing goals and policies. It
outlines the strategies that will be pursued to implement the community’s housing
objectives during the planning period (2015-2023). The action program identifies the
strategies to be pursued in conserving and improving the existing housing stock, in
providing adequate sites for future housing; in assisting in developing affordable housing, in
removing government constraints which might affect housing production and cost; and in
promoting housing opportunities within the community. The goals, policies and action
program for the 2015-2023 Burlingame Housing Element is included in this report as its own
section.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION
Burlingame’s current Housing Element was prepared in 2009 and was certified by the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) the same year. The
present document is an update of the 2009-2014 Housing Element. In preparing the
Housing Element, various sources of information are consulted. Demographic, economic,
and housing data, prepared by 21 Elements, became the basis for analysis. It was
supplemented by additional data from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey.
This updated element uses population data and housing and employment data from the
2000 and 2010 Census; the 2009-2011 American Community Survey; income limits from
the Department of Finance; projections from the Association of Bay Area Governments
Projections 2013 forecasts for the San Francisco Bay Area; ABAG’s Certified Final 2013
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA); and current local perspectives and opportunities
related to housing collected from local sources as referenced in the text. A list of all the data
sources used in preparation of Burlingame’s 2015-2023 Housing Element is included at the
end of the document.
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT
To create an inclusive process in the development of housing policy, the City of Burlingame
hosted two community workshops, along with Planning Commission and City Council
meetings open to the public. The workshops were publically advertised, and attendees
comprised Burlingame residents, local organizations and affordable housing providers.
Planning Commission and City Council meetings that discussed the Public Review Draft prior
to initial submittal to the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
provided opportunities for additional public input, as did adoption hearings to approve the
Final Housing Element.
City staff created an open process that allowed residents to learn more about the Housing
Element process and comment on housing issues (see the Appendix A). In the two
community workshops, informational materials were available in hardcopies at the meetings
and posted on the City’s website www.burlingame.org, under the Community Development
Department webpage. Attendees were given opportunities to ask questions and make
comments during the meeting. City staff was also available to speak with residents after the
meeting. The public was invited to attend Planning Commission and City Council meetings
prior to submittal of documents to HCD. Through these avenues, the City established open
channels to provide information and gather input.
The key discussion points in the community workshops reflected the nature of development
opportunities available in a built-out community such as Burlingame, located in a region
with ever-increasing housing prices. In the first community workshop, audience members
were given the opportunity to comment on housing issues after hearing an overview of
demographic and housing characteristics of the city. They voiced support for mixed use
development, expressed concern about rising housing prices in the city and around the
region and discussed whether developers would be attracted to constructing smaller units.
In the second community workshop, City staff opened discussion about opportunity sites for
development. Those who attended the meeting expressed general agreement with the sites
proposed by City staff, which were selected largely from sites identified in the existing
Housing Element and expanded to include new parcels largely near those sites. Other
discussions covered issues about areas that were no longer available for housing, the
Profile of the Community                                                                   Page 9

challenges of developing sites where the parcels are owned by different parties, the
requirements for second unit development and the existing constraints on sites that were
not included in the proposed opportunity sites.
CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Burlingame General Plan provides the long-range policy direction for future land use
and development within the city. The General Plan is made up of nine elements, one of
which is the Housing Element. It is essential that the goals and policies of all of the General
Plan elements should be internally and mutually consistent. If the Housing Element as
adopted makes other elements of the general plan inconsistent, those elements should be
adjusted.
While the Housing Element is the primary document regarding housing, the other elements
establish goals, policies, objectives and actions that have a relation or directly affect
housing. The Land Use Element establishes categories of net residential density which are
confirmed on the plan diagram: low density up to 8 dwelling units per acre; medium density
9 to 20; medium high density 21- 50; and high density over 50 dwelling units per acre. In
addition, Specific Plans for the North Burlingame/Rollins Road area, the Bayfront Area, and
the Downtown area near the Burlingame Train Station have been adopted. These Specific
Plans are refinements of the General Plan and also specify residential densities.
Areas of the city identified as having potential for residential development include the North
Burlingame area between El Camino Real and the railroad tracks, and along Trousdale Drive
between Magnolia Avenue and Ogden Drive; in the Downtown area along Howard Avenue
and California Drive; and on Carolan Avenue, south of the Northpark Apartments. These
areas were identified for future housing development in the 2009-2014 timeframe and
continue to be areas of housing opportunity for the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
A review of the policies, objectives and actions of the other elements indicates that the
proposed policies and implementing actions of this Housing Element are also consistent with
the intent of these other elements in the General Plan as well as local and regional planning
documents. Compliance with the San Mateo County Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan,
as amended, for San Francisco International Airport: Government Code Section 65302.3
requires that a local agency general plan and/or any affected specific plan must be
consistent with the applicable airport/land use compatibility criteria in the relevant adopted
airport land use plan (CLUP). The housing policies, goals, programs, and any other
provisions to accommodate future housing development, as specified herein, do not conflict
with the relevant airport/land use compatibility criteria contained in the San Mateo County
Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan, as amended, for San Francisco International Airport.
PREPARATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element was prepared in house by the Burlingame Community Development
Department staff with technical assistance provided by Metropolitan Planning Group.
The Housing Element programs were developed building on the lessons learned through the
implementation of the 2009-2014 Housing Element and by widening the scope of the
successful Housing Element programs.

III. Profile of the Community
BURLINGAME TODAY
Burlingame’s residential population has experienced only a modest growth over the past
twenty years. The city’s population in 2010 was 28,806, which is only a 2.3 percent increase
from the 2000 population of 28,158 and a 7.48 percent increase from the city’s 1990
population of 26,801.
Despite these measures of growth, the region as a whole is projecting population growth in
the coming decades and a share of this growth will look to be accommodated in Burlingame.
The Association of Bay Area Governments’ population projections predict an increase from
28,806 residents in 2010 to 31,700 in 2020, a further increase to 34,800 in 2030, and
finally an increase to 38,400 in 2040. This amounts to about a 10 percent population
increase each decade between 2010 and 2040.
The demographic of the city’s population has been steadily changing since 2000:
    • The White population, which had accounted for 76.9 percent of the population in
        2000, had decreased to 67.7 percent in 2010, with gains from all other groups;
    • Age groups that experienced growth included school age residents (under 20) and
        older adults (45 to 74);
    • The population of adults between 20 and 44 years decreased as a whole; and
    • The median age of the population increased from 38.4 in 2000 to 40.5 in 2010.
Burlingame’s housing stock consists of 13,027 dwelling units, of which 48 percent are
multiple family structures, 4 percent are single family attached structures (such as
townhomes), and 48 percent are single family detached structures. Fifty-one percent of the
housing stock in 2011 was occupied by renters. This proportional distribution is contrasted
with the rest of San Mateo County in which 59 percent of housing units in 2011 were owner-
occupied and 41 percent were occupied by renters.
The following are characteristics of the city’s households:
    • In 2011, there were 12,137 households in Burlingame. The average household size
        was 2.3 persons. Owner-occupied units had an average household size of 2.6
        persons, larger than the average household size of 2.1 persons in renter-occupied
        units. These figures were slightly lower than the San Mateo County average
        household size of 2.7 persons (2.8 persons in owner-occupied units and 2.7 in
        renter-occupied units);
    • Families constituted more than half of the households (56 percent) in Burlingame.
        Those families with children made up about 29 percent of all households. Four
        percent of households had a female head of household caring for children alone; and
    • In owner-occupied units, the vacancy rate was 1.3 percent, while the rate was 4.5
        percent for renter-occupied units.
The workforce and jobs in the city are projected to grow by 2040 together with (and in
likelihood influencing) the population growth, based on the following trends:
    • The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in 2013, compared 5.0 percent in San
        Mateo County;
    • In Burlingame, about 54 percent of households earned more than $75,000 and 19
        percent earned less than $35,000;

     •   Professional, Scientific, Management, and Administrative and Waste Management
         Services was the industry group that employed the most residents (19.4 percent).
         Educational Services, Health Care and Social Assistance employed the second largest
         percent of residents (19.0 percent); and
     •   ABAG projects a growth of jobs to 37,780 by 2040, a 27.9 percent increase from
         29,540 jobs in 2010.
Since Burlingame is a built out community, the total number of housing units has remained
fairly stable.
     • In 2010 there were 13,027 housing units in Burlingame;
    • Nearly three-quarters of the city’s housing units were more than 50 years old (built
         before 1960), and almost two-thirds were more than 60 years old;
    • The median cost of a single family dwelling was $1,384,000. The median cost of a
         multiple family dwelling was $654,000; and
    • Average monthly rent for a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom unit in 2013 was $2,346.
HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Fundamental to Burlingame’s housing policies and programs is an assessment of the
components of the city’s housing stock and the residents’ needs. To determine the size and
appropriate programmatic approaches, the needs assessment is divided into segments:
household conditions, housing stock conditions, housing needs of special segments of the
resident population, and evaluation of potential conversion of “affordable” units to market
rate.
1. Demographic Profile
The type and amount of housing needed in a community are largely determined by
population growth and other demographic variables. Factors including age, race/ethnicity,
occupation, and income level combine to influence the type of housing needed and the
ability to afford housing.
Population Growth and Trends
Over the past 40 years, Burlingame's population has remained fairly stable in terms of total
population. In 1970, the population was 27,320. It declined in 1980 to 26,171 and
increased again in 1990 to 26,666, to 28,158 in 2000, and 28,806 in 2010. This represents
an increase of 5.4 percent since 1970, including a 2.3% increase in the decade from 2000
to 2010.
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) predicts a growing population over the
next 30 years in the Bay Area, including Burlingame. Between 2010 and 2040, ABAG
projects Burlingame to see an addition of nearly 10,000 new residents. The forecast
anticipates a consistent percentage change of about 10 percent each decade.
The growth anticipated in the ABAG projections would represent a significant departure from
historic trends in Burlingame, however, with an assumption that the population will increase
much faster than it had in previous years. During the past thirty years from 1980 to 2010
the Burlingame population increased by 2,635 (approximately 10 percent over thirty years),
whereas ABAG anticipates an increase of 9,594 over the next thirty years from 2010 to
2040 (approximately 33 percent over thirty years).

For comparison, the State Department of Finance (DOF) issues population estimates each
year for all California cities. These estimates are based on annual housing unit change data
that are supplied by local jurisdictions and the U.S. Census Bureau. Household population
estimates are derived by multiplying the number of occupied housing units by the current
persons per household. The persons per household estimates are based on 2010 census
benchmark data and are adjusted by raking the current county population series into these
estimates. From 2010 to 2014, the DOF estimates the population of Burlingame to have
grown by 901 (3 per cent), for an average annual growth rate of 7.5%. DOF does not
provide population growth projections on a city level, but anticipates the population of San
Mateo County to grow approximately 18 percent between 2010 and 2040.
Some explanation for the variation between the ABAG projections compared to historic
trends and DOF data and projections would be assumptions about the location and nature of
future development. ABAG anticipates a significant amount of development in the region
over the next thirty years to be in infill locations within close proximity to transit and
services. In many cities, this would represent a change in approach to development over
the past thirty years. Burlingame is served by an existing rail station (Burlingame Caltrain),
a regional multi-modal station (Millbrae BART/Multimodal), and frequent express bus service
on El Camino Real. Furthermore the Broadway Caltrain station is anticipated to return to full
service by the end of the decade. Given that a significant portion of Burlingame is situated
within proximity to transit and services, the ABAG assumption that future development in
the region will focus on such areas would imply an increase in the city’s rate of growth
compared to historical trends. Furthermore, historical trends and DOF forecasts are based
on existing housing stock, whereas ABAG forecasts account for projected employment
growth in the region that will put pressure on the housing supply.
This assumption presents challenges for Burlingame, however. Through its history,
Burlingame’s densest neighborhoods have developed in areas served by transit and
services, so those areas assumed for future infill development are already developed with
multiple family residential housing at relatively high densities. Typically infill projects in
Burlingame involve replacing an existing use with a new, slightly more intensive new use.
While new projects typically result in an increase in the number of units compared to the
buildings being replaced, the net increase is less than if the sites were vacant or less
intensively developed.

The Housing Element is the General Plan document that articulates the City’s plan to
accommodate a growing population. While each population projection uses its own
methodology and takes different growth factors into account, a certain amount of population
growth is likely with a corresponding necessity to plan for future housing needs.

Age Characteristics
        Median Age
        The median age is the midpoint of the city's population distribution. Burlingame’s
        median age in 2010 (40.5) increased from the median in 2000 (38.4). The growing
        number of residents who aged into the 45 to 74 year range, coupled with the
        decrease of residents in the 20 to 44 year range, contributed to the rising median
        age. Table III-2 shows the population changes between 2000 and 2010.

        Children
        Between 2000 and 2010, the school age population increased. Table III-2 shows that
        the number of residents under 20 accounted for 23.0 percent of the population in
        2010, an increase from 20.7 percent in 2000. Over a decade, the group of children
        under the age of 5 increased by 19.3 percent and the group in the 5 to 9 year range
        increased by 23.7 percent. These trends show an expanding school age population
        that may place extra demand on school facilities. As children age the pressure to
        accommodate them throughout their education will be a continuing challenge.

        Elderly
        Although persons of retirement age (65 and older) had decreased between 2000 and
        2010, a growing segment of the population had been entering age groups on the
        verge of retirement, as shown in Table III-2. An overall decrease in the retirement
        age population was attributed to a significant decline of residents between ages 75
        and 84, which decreased by 23 percent over a decade. Populations approaching
        retirement age had grown, however. Residents nearing retirement (age 60 to 64)
        comprised 3.9 percent of the population in 2000, growing 39 percent over a decade
        to 5.3 percent of the population in 2010. The population of older adults approaching
        retirement age – residents ages 55 to 59 – grew more than 40 percent over the
        same period of time. This trend of aging citizens coupled with a decrease in the
        working-age population between 20 and 44 years could impact the dynamics of the
        community in the coming years.
Gender
In 2010, 52 percent of residents were male and 48 percent female. Demographic
characteristics related to female heads of household are described later in the document
under Special Needs Populations.
Ethnic Diversity
Burlingame is becoming a more diverse city. Between 2000 and 2010, the number and
proportional distribution of the White population had decreased while the population of all
other groups had increased. The Asian/ Pacific Islander population saw the largest increase,
ahead of all other groups with an addition of nearly 2,000 residents over a decade and
enough to expand their proportional distribution from 14.3 percent of the population to 20.8
percent. Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic population had also grown, with nearly
1,000 new Hispanic residents added to Burlingame’s population, representing a 32.4
percent increase. This contributed to a changing demographic where the Hispanic population
now represents 13.8 percent of the Burlingame community.

2. Employment and Travel Patterns
The 2007-2011 American Community Surveys estimates that there were more than 14,700
employed residents in the city. According to U.S. Census OnTheMap 2011, there were
approximately 35,600 jobs in Burlingame. Despite the large number of jobs relative to the
number of residents employed, most residents actually worked outside of the city.
    •   12 percent of employees worked and lived in the city;
    •   22 percent worked in other cities around San Mateo County;
    •   18 percent of Burlingame residents worked in San Francisco;
    •   10 percent worked in Santa Clara County; and
    •   7 percent worked in the East Bay.
The small percentage of residents who worked and lived in Burlingame suggests that, for a
number of Burlingame’s employees, finding housing affordable and suitable for their
households in the city is a significant challenge.
The commute patterns of Burlingame residents show that car travel was the predominant
mode of transportation but other modes, including public transportation, were viable
options. The average commute time was 25.4 minutes in 2011. More than 72 percent of
residents drove to work alone. About 22 percent found alternative transportation options,
including 11 percent who used public transportation, as shown in Table III-4. Between 2000
and 2011, Burlingame had an increasing percentage of residents using public transportation
and a decreasing percentage driving to work. Despite these changes, driving alone remains
the predominant means for the commute. Since most residents worked outside of
Burlingame, driving and spending an hour on the road continue to be expected parts of the
daily commute.

Burlingame’s 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports identifies the top 10 employers
in the city. Virgin America was the largest employer in 2012, followed by Wright Medical
Technology Inc. The remaining eight were comparable in their workforce sizes - from 460 to
555 employees.

The largest industry in Burlingame was Transportation and Warehousing and Utilities, which
categorized nearly one-third of the jobs in the city. The Professional, Scientific,
Management, Administrative, and Waste Management Services sector employment made up
more than 16 percent of jobs in the city. Educational, Health, and Social Services sector
employment made up nearly 15 percent of jobs in the city. More than 11 percent of jobs
were in Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, Accommodation, and Food Services. Table III-6

The ABAG projects continued employment growth between 2010 and 2040 in Burlingame
and San Mateo County. In their 2013 projections, ABAG used a base employment number of
29,540 jobs to forecast an employment figure of 37,780 in 2040. This 28 percent increase is
comparable to the 29 percent increase projected in San Mateo County. Although
employment figures and forecasts are expected to change over time, and ABAG will
continue to adjust their predictions, Burlingame is expected to experience continued growth
in employment.

Unemployment Rate
According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD) the unemployment
rate in San Mateo County was 5.0 percent in 2013. Of the 16,200 members of Burlingame’s
work force, 600 (3.6%) were unemployed at that time. This range is within what is
considered “full employment” (typically defined as somewhere between 3 percent and 4
percent, reflecting the normal ebb and flow of the workforce as people transition between
jobs).

3. Household Profile
Household type and size, income levels, and the presence of special needs populations all
affect the type of housing needed by residents. This section details the various household
characteristics affecting housing needs in Burlingame.
Household Size

continuing a trend from 2000. The total number of households actually decreased from
2000. Table III-9 provides a summary of household data.

Household Type
Burlingame has undergone some change in its household types since 2000. The city had an
increase in families without children and a corresponding decrease in families with children.
In 2011, families without children increased to 27.4 percent of the population from 24.1
percent in 2000. Table III-10 shows the proportional distribution of household types for
2000 and 2011. Over that period of time, single person households did not experience much
change in terms of their population distribution. The trend indicates that while people have
been forming family households with relative consistency, fewer of these households have
children.
Despite an increasing number of households without children, Burlingame still had a lower
percentage than the County and the State in 2011, as shown in Table III-12. San Mateo
County and the State as a whole also had lower percentages of single persons. This
comparison suggests that more residents in Burlingame were in single person households
rather than families compared to those in the County and the State.

4. Special Needs Populations
Housing is a basic necessity of life for everyone. However, the search for decent affordable
housing is greatly complicated for many individuals because of various barriers, including
disability, advanced age, and life crisis. The City has identified several special populations
that are in need of particular housing services and are most likely to be in the Extremely
Low-Income category: seniors, persons with disabilities, large families, single-parent
households, college students, and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
(Given Burlingame’s urban location, farmworkers are not considered a population with
special needs, but a short description is provided below.)
Senior Households
Seniors, the persons over the age of 65, have four primary concerns:
        1) Income: People over 65 are usually retired and living on a fixed income;
        2) Health Care: Because the elderly have a higher rate of illness and dependency,
            health care and supportive housing is important;
        3) Transportation: Many seniors use public transit. However, a significant number of
            seniors have disabilities and require alternatives to transit;
        4) Housing: Many seniors live alone and rent.
Approximately 4,000 residents 65 years or older live in the city of Burlingame, representing
14 percent of the population. There were 2,343 senior households, more than 81 percent of
which are homeowners.

Seniors who live on fixed and limited incomes may encounter difficulties in finding
affordable housing. Nearly one-third of senior households in Burlingame have incomes
under $30,000. About half have incomes under $49,000. Generally, persons 75 and older
who are heads of household are homeowners, but there are many who are in the Low, Very-
Low and Extremely-Low Income categories.

Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an individual’s mobility, ability
to work, or ability to care for themselves. Persons with disabilities include those with
physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. Disabled persons have special housing needs
because of their fixed income, shortage of affordable and accessible housing, and higher
health costs associated with their disability.
The 2009-2011 American Community Survey reported that 1,835 persons in Burlingame
had one or more disabilities, accounting for roughly 7 percent of the population. Table III-
17 shows the age and types of disabilities. It is important to note that a person may have
multiple disabilities.

The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of the disability.
Many persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of other family
members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require assistance. This
can include special housing design features for the physically disabled, income support for
those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical
conditions. Accessible housing can also be provided via senior housing developments.

        Developmentally Disabled
        Persons with developmental disabilities are a separate population identified by the
        State of California, with differing housing needs from others with disabilities. The
        Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act ensures that “patterns and conditions of
        everyday life which are as close as possible to the norms and patterns of the
        mainstream of society” are available to these individuals. Furthermore, the Olmstead
        v. L.C and E.W. United States Supreme Court case required an “Integration
        Mandate” that “States are required to place persons with mental disabilities in
        community settings rather than institutions…when determined to be appropriate.”
        Despite these laws, people with developmental disabilities are finding it increasingly
        difficult to find affordable, accessible, and appropriate housing that is inclusive in the
        local community.
        A developmental disability is defined by the State as “a lifelong disability caused by a
        mental and/or physical impairment manifested prior to the age of 18 and are
        expected to be lifelong.” The conditions included under this definition include:
             • Mental Retardation,
             • Epilepsy,
             • Autism, and/or
             • Cerebral Palsy, and
             • “Other Conditions needing services similar to a person with mental
                 retardation.”
             Source: Background Report, 2008, Developmental Disabilities Board Area 5
        According to the Golden Gate Regional Center, the entity designated to provide all
        services for people living with developmental disabilities in the San Mateo County
        area, there are 138 persons with developmental disabilities living in Burlingame.
        According to the Department of Social Services – Community Care Licensing Division
        (April 2014), the city has 4 adult day care facilities, with a total capacity of 150
        persons, capable of serving persons with developmental disabilities. Two adult
        residential facilities and one group home have the ability to accommodate persons
        with developmental disabilities and can serve up to 24 individuals at maximum
        capacity.
        The housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities can vary from person
        to person. Many live with parents or guardians. Some can live independently or in
        community care facilities. A prediction of housing needs for the developmentally
        disabled was calculated based on the living arrangement distributions presented in
        Table III-18 and estimates of population growth using ABAG population forecasts.
        Table III-19 shows the estimated housing need.

         Accessible Accommodations
         Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing
         Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable
         accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning and other land use
         regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons
         an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be a
         reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties that
         have already been developed in order to accommodate residents with mobility
         impairments. The Burlingame zoning ordinance has been amended to provide a
         process to request reasonable accommodations for these types of physical
         improvements to a residence.
         The City does not require special building codes or onerous project review to
         construct, improve, or convert housing for persons with disabilities. Residential care
         facilities with six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential zoning
         districts and several commercial districts. Care facilities with seven or more persons
         are also permitted in residential districts and several commercial districts, subject to
         a conditional use permit.

Female Headed Households
Single-parent households typically have a special need for such services as childcare and
health care, among others. Female-headed households with children in particular tend to
have lower incomes, which limits their housing options and access to supportive services.
Female-headed households comprised 3,548 of 12,137 households in 2011, or 29.2 percent
of all households. Most of these households were females living alone. Female-headed
family households represented 8.4 percent of Burlingame’s households according to the
2009-2011 American Community Survey, an increase in households since 2000. In
particular, the percentage of single mother households increased from 3.5 to 4.4 percent. If
a trend towards more female headed households with children continues, these households
may require special services to meet their specific needs.

Large Households
Large households (those with five or more persons) often have special housing needs due to
their income and the lack of adequately sized, affordable housing. As a result, large
households often live in overcrowded conditions. The lack of large units is especially evident
among rental units.
Based on the CHAS (Comprehensive Housing and Affordability Strategy) Databook prepared
by HUD, Burlingame’s large renter households suffer from one or more housing problems,
including housing overpayment, overcrowding and/or substandard housing conditions.
Burlingame had 850 large households, accounting for approximately 7 percent of all
households. There were 575 owner-occupied units with large households and 275 renter-
occupied units with large households. Of all large households, about one-third were renters.

Burlingame had more than 6,000 rental units, of which 725 (12%) have more than 3
bedrooms. A breakdown detailing the number of bedrooms in occupied units is shown in
Table III-23. Given that the city had 275 large renter households, in theory there should be
an adequate supply of rental units to accommodate the city’s large families. However, 4.1%
of rental units were either overcrowded or extremely overcrowded, as shown in Table III-
24, indicating that some larger families may not necessarily be renting the larger units.

Homeless
The number of homeless persons and families has been increasing nationally and in the Bay
Area. The demographics of the homeless also have been changing, from predominately
single persons often with substance abuse or mental illness to an increasing number of
families unable to afford high rents.
According to the San Mateo County Homeless Census and Survey, there were 2,281
homeless people in Santa Mateo County counted in 2013. Approximately 43 percent of
these individuals were found in shelters; 57 percent were unsheltered. In the city of
Burlingame, 13 persons were counted during this survey; all of whom were unsheltered.
Although these numbers represent small fractions of the total population (less than one
percent at both the city and county level), the shelter and care needs of homeless
individuals are great.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through seasonal agricultural work. Farmworkers have special housing needs because they
earn lower incomes than many other workers and move throughout the season from one
harvest to the next. The USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture found that 1,722 farmworkers
were hired in San Mateo County. However there are no farms in Burlingame, and ABAG
reported only 20 Burlingame residents working in Agriculture and Natural Resources Jobs,
representing less than 0.01 percent of the population. This low percentage, combined with
the fact that there are no agricultural lands or farm labor housing within or adjacent to the
City’s limits, indicates that the number of actual farm workers in Burlingame is very small
and, therefore, the City has no specialized housing programs targeted to this group beyond
overall programs for housing affordability.

Extremely-Low Income and Very-Low Income Households and Housing Provided
The CHAS 2006-2010 database reported 1,405 extremely-low income (ELI) households,
representing 11.6 percent of the total households (12,137) in the city of Burlingame. In
addition, 1,075 households were defined as very-low income, representing another 8.9
percent of total households. Assuming the same proportions over time (i.e. no change in
income) and utilizing ABAG projections of 13,620 households by 2020 and 14,890
households by 2030, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1,577 ELI households
and 1,206 very-low income households by 2020, and 1,724 ELI and 1,319 very low income
households by 2030. For the purposes of meeting the RHNA, half of the very-low income
units are assumed to be needed by ELI households. This is consistent with the proportion
determined by the CHAS data and HCD provisions. Table III-25 shows the income limits for
various income categories.

5. Housing Stock Characteristics
This section identifies the characteristics of Burlingame’s physical housing stock. This
includes an analysis of housing growth trends, housing conditions, housing prices and rents,
and housing affordability.
Number of Housing Units
Since Burlingame is a built out community, the total number of housing units has remained
fairly stable. There were 13,027 units identified in the 2010 Census. The 2000 Census
identified 12,869 housing units in Burlingame. Between 2007 and 2013, an additional 77
housing units were added. This is an average of 11 new units per year. As an older
community with little remaining vacant residential land for new development, housing
growth in recent years has primarily been attributable to infill on small residential sites.

Increase in Housing Stock
Burlingame has had an incremental increase in new housing units over the past several
Housing Element cycles:
    • Between 1994 and 1998, 152 housing units were built in the city. Of these 152 new
        units, 102 units were multifamily, 2 units were single family, and the remaining 48
        units were in an elderly housing development.
    • Between 1999 and 2007, 111 housing units were added to the city's housing stock,
        38 market rate units and 73 moderately affordable units.
    • From 2008 to 2012, 7 moderate and 63 above moderate units were added.
Housing developments under construction or in the building permit review phase are
primarily comprised of condominium and apartment projects:
    • 1459 Oak Grove Ave is a 3-unit condominium project (all market rate) that replaces
        a single family dwelling unit.
    • 1321 El Camino Real replaces a single family dwelling with a 5-unit apartment
        building containing 1 moderate income unit.
    • 904 Bayswater Ave is a 6-unit condominium project that replaces 5 existing units;
        one of the new units is a moderate income unit.
    • 1800 Trousdale Drive features a new 25 unit condominium (22 market, 3 moderate
        income) that replaces an office building.
    • 1225 Floribunda Ave (5 market rate, 1 moderate income, replacing 2 existing units)
        has submitted an application for building permits and is expected to be completed
        within the planning period.
Cumulatively, these projects would result in 45 new units, with 39 market rate and 6 deed-
restricted affordable units, replacing 9 units and an office building.
In addition to projects under construction, several pending proposals could add a number of
units to the housing stock:
    • 1509 El Camino is a 15-unit condominium project (13 market rate, 2 moderate
        income) that would replace 11 existing units.
    • 556 El Camino Real is a 25-unit project (22 market, 3 moderate income) that would
        replace 14 existing units.
    • 1433 Floribunda Ave is a 10-unit project (9 market rate, 1 moderate income) that
        would replace 5 units.
    • 21 Park Road proposes 8 units (7 market rate, 1 moderate income) that would
        replace an existing commercial use on the site.
These projects could add up to 58 new units to the city, with 51 market rate units and 7
deed-restricted affordable units, while replacing 30 units and a commercial use.
Housing Type and Tenure
Table III-27 presents the mix of housing types in Burlingame. Typical of a built out
community, the overall distribution of housing types in the city has remained relatively
stable. Of the city’s more than 13,000 housing units in 2010, 48 percent were single-family
homes and 50 percent were multi-family units. The remaining 2-3 percent of units
(approximately), are made up of “attached” single-family units. Burlingame has no mobile
home units.

Single Family Homes Vs Multiple Family Units
Single-family detached homes made up 48 percent of Burlingame’s housing stock. Single-
family attached units were 4 percent of the housing stock. Multiple family units were 48
percent of the housing stock and are occupied predominantly by renters. The housing
composition in Burlingame is contrasted with the greater prevalence of single family
detached homes in the County (57%) and the State (58%). The high percentage of multiple
family units in Burlingame gives the community a unique character and different range of
housing opportunities compared to the greater proportion of single family housing stock
found in many jurisdictions in the County and around the State.

Renter Vs Owner Occupied
Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or is vacant. Tenure is an
important indicator of the housing climate of a community, reflecting the relative cost of
housing opportunities, and the ability of residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences
residential mobility, with owner units generally exhibiting lower turnover rates than rental
housing. According to the 2009-2011 American Community Survey, 49 percent of
Burlingame’s households were homeowners.
The 2009-2011 American Community Survey indicates that of Burlingame's occupied units,
49 percent were owner occupied and 51 percent were renter occupied. The number of
owner occupied units has increased from 48 percent in 2000.

Vacancy Rate
A vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good
indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current
demand for housing. A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing and two percent for
ownership housing is generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance
between the demand and supply of housing. A lower vacancy rate may indicate that
households are having difficulty finding housing that is affordable, leading to overcrowding
or households having to pay more than they can afford.
Profile of the Community                                                             Page 37

The 2010 Census reports a homeowner vacancy rate of 1.3 and a rental vacancy rate of 4.5.
The vacancy rate had increased for owners since 2000, when the homeowner rate was 0.4
and the rental rate was 4.5.
Housing Age and Condition
The age of a community’s housing stock can provide an indicator of overall housing
conditions. Typically housing over 30 years in age is likely to have rehabilitation needs that
may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs.
        Condition of Housing Stock
        Based on building permit activity, with many new homes replacing older homes,
        second floor additions and remodels, the overall condition of the housing stock in
        Burlingame has been improving. Between 2007 and 2013, the City has issued 99
        permits for new single family dwelling units and 2,165 permits for residential
        alterations. The City has also issued 347 permits for bathroom upgrades and 279
        permits for kitchen upgrades, most of which were for residential units.
        In 2000, the number of housing units in the city was 12,858. The 2010 Census
        reported 13,027 units. Approximately 87 percent of these units were built prior to
        1980. Typically, structures over 30 years old may be in need of major repairs,
        however, discussions with the City’s Code Enforcement Officer revealed that no units
        have been cited for property upkeep or identified as unfit for human habitation in the
        past seven years.

Housing Cost and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a higher
prevalence of overpayment and overcrowding. This section summarizes the cost and
affordability of the housing stock to Burlingame residents.
        Housing Costs
        The median price of a single-family home ranged from $1.2 million to $1.6 million
        between 2005 and 2012. During this period the price peaked to $1,652,000 for
        single-family homes and $771,000 for multiple family homes in 2007, before a steep
        drop during the housing crisis and recession. After a decline in prices between 2007
        and 2011, single-family and multiple family home prices rose in 2012. With the
        recovering housing market in the region, Burlingame may see an increase in median
        sale prices in following years.

        There is a significant difference between the maximum affordability price of a home
        and the actual median values of single family homes and condominiums. The
        maximum affordable home price is based on annual income. Table III-33 shows a
        large disparity between a maximum affordable price and the median price in San
        Mateo County. A median-priced single family home for a single person earning the
        median income is more than four times the person’s maximum affordable price. A
        median-priced condominium is more than twice the maximum affordable price. For
        persons who earn less than the median income, the affordability gap becomes even
        larger and a median priced home becomes more than four times their maximum
        affordable home price.

Second units can provide an affordable rental option for households. Based on a survey of
39 secondary dwelling units on Craigslist, prepared by 21 Elements in December 2013, the
median price of secondary rental units in San Mateo County was $1,350. Rents ranged from
$500 to $2,650, and unit sizes varied from studios to two-bedroom units. Although the
survey was based on a small sample, some information was gleaned about the breakdown
of second unit rental affordability:
    • 3 percent was affordable to extremely low income one and two person households.
    • 12 percent was affordable to very low income one and two person households.
    • 57 percent was affordable to low income one person households.
             o 64 percent was affordable to low income two person households.
    • 18 percent was affordable to moderate income one person households.
             o 16 percent was affordable to moderate income two person households

Overpayment
With the high cost of housing in and around the city, households often spend a large portion
of their income on housing. According to CHAS data from the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development, overpayment is defined as households that spend more than 30
percent of income on housing. More than 40 percent of households in the city were either
overpaying or severely overpaying for housing. About 29 percent of all households in the
city were categorized in the low or very low income range and experienced some level of
housing overpayment. Table III-36 shows households overpaying by income category.
Overpayment and severe overpayment greatly affect very low to low income renter
households and moderate to above moderate owner households, as shown in Table III-37.

Overpayment disproportionately affects younger households (between 15 and 24 years old)
and older households (65 years and above). For younger households, this is likely due to
the fact that they recently purchased homes at high prices and are stretching their incomes
to pay monthly costs. For older households, this is likely due to the fact that residents in
this age group may be retired and receive fixed incomes.

According to the 2006-2010 CHAS Data Query Tool from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, a high percentage of low income households were overpaying for
housing. Overpayment affects about 88 percent of extremely low income households, 79
percent of very low income households, and 64 percent of low income households. The
majority of owner households in all lower income categories that overpaid for housing were
contributing more than 50 percent of their incomes. Most extremely low income renter
households paid more than 50 percent of their incomes to housing. The majority of very low
and low income renter households paid between 30 and 50 percent towards housing. Table
III-38 shows the percentage of households overpaying at different income categories.

Overcrowding
Overcrowded housing is defined as units where the number of occupants is greater than the
number of rooms. An overcrowded unit has greater than 1 and up to 1.5 persons per room.
An extremely overcrowded unit has more than 1.5 persons per room. In Burlingame, about
150 households were living in overcrowded conditions and about 170 households were living
Profile of the Community                                                           Page 43
in extremely overcrowded units. A greater number of renter households faced overcrowded
conditions than owner households. Although overcrowding was not an issue among the
majority of residents, it did affect a number of residents, especially renter households where
1.5 percent lived in overcrowded conditions and 2.6 percent lived in extremely overcrowded
conditions.
Overcrowding may be associated with housing problems that affect the quality of life. The
cost burden of housing affected more than 90 percent of extremely low and very low income
renter households. Owner households that experience cost burdens included 83 percent of
extremely low income households and 59 percent of very low income households. Cost
burden was an issue for more than 60 percent of low income households, for both renters
and owners.

Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
The State Housing Element law and HUD Consolidated Plan regulations require cities to
prepare an inventory including all assisted multi-family rental units which are eligible to
convert to non-low-income housing uses due to termination of subsidy contract, mortgage
prepayment, or expiring use restrictions. State Housing Element law requires this inventory
to cover a ten-year evaluation period following the statutory due date of the Housing
Element (January 31, 2015); whereas the HUD regulation requires the inventory to cover
only the five-year planning period of the Consolidated Plan.
According to a study conducted by the California Housing Partnership Corporation published
in August 2008, the city of Burlingame has no HUD subsidized properties (with HUD 236 and
221 (d)(3) mortgages and/or Section 8). In 2014, CHPC confirmed again that there were no
HUD subsidized affordable housing properties in the city. This means that there are no units
at risk of conversion to market rate. While the City does maintain over 100 Section 8
contracts, those contracts are tied to individual households, not units.
6. Regional Housing Needs
State law requires that a housing element quantify existing and projected housing needs for
persons of all income levels within each community, including the community’s share of the
regional housing need by income level. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is
responsible for preparing estimates of local and regional housing need based on factors
prescribed by State Law (Section 65884 or Article 10.6). The factors included in the division
of the regional housing need into individual community assignment are: market demand for
housing, availability of suitable sites and public-facilities, commuting patterns, housing type
and tenure, and housing needs of farm workers. In addition ABAG looks at regional and
local vacancy rates and at housing values and rents as indicators of market demand.
Household projections are based on employment opportunities, availability of sites and
commuting patterns. Type of housing is based on census data and regional projections.
Existing Housing Needs
The projected housing need obligation for the 2015 to 2023 planning period is 863 units. Of
these units, the city will need to accommodate 420 low to extremely low income housing
units. From 2009 to 2013, 59 above moderate income and 6 moderate income units have
been built. No low or very low income units were constructed during that period.
Eight-Year Projected Housing Need
State law requires that each community consider the housing needs of people of all income
levels. In addition, State law requires that the regional housing needs should be balanced
throughout the region so that communities will not be impacted with relatively high
proportions of lower income housing. In considering existing need, we also should give
attention to the number of existing units needed to replace substandard structures or
substandard living conditions generally marked by overcrowding and overpayment.
ABAG has the responsibility of projecting the housing needs for the 2015-2023 period based
on the factors identified in State law. The eight-year housing need numbers include market

rate housing as well as units for those with lower incomes. The projected need number is
the number of dwelling units needed to provide for the total expected household growth and
Burlingame’s share of the projected regional housing need. For this cycle, the 21 cities
within San Mateo County, and the County as well, combined efforts to develop a housing
allocation for the sub-region. The projected need number for the planning period (2015-
2023) for Burlingame is 863 dwelling units.
Following are the projected housing need numbers for 2015 through 2023 for the City of
Burlingame by income category:

IV. Housing Constraints
One of the roles of the Housing Element is to identify possible constraints to the creation of
affordable housing. Constraints can be government policies, financial burdens, market
trends, environmental factors, and more. This section will discuss potential constraints, both
governmental and non-governmental to the production of housing.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Land Use Regulations
General Plan
The General Plan establishes land uses and land use densities for the city of Burlingame.
Residential densities and corresponding zoning designations are as follows: single family
uses (up to 8 dwelling units per acre) R-1; medium density (duplex at 9 to 20 units per
acre) R-2; medium high (21 to 50 units per acre); and high density (51 plus units per acre)
R-4.
Specific Planning Areas
North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan
The North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan, adopted in 2004, specifies areas in North
Burlingame for multiple family residential uses with a maximum density of 40 units per
acre. Mixed uses projects with a residential component are also allowed, with a maximum
density of 40 units per acre for the residential portion of the project.
To implement the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan, the TW (Trousdale West)
and ECN (El Camino North) zoning designations have been established. The TW zone
district allows by right both stand-alone multifamily residential development or mixed office
and residential development. It is also required that at least one-half of the floor area be in
residential use. In a mixed use building, the maximum residential density is 30 units per
acre, and a stand-alone multi-family residential development would have a maximum
density of 40 units per acre. The zoning requires a minimum building height of 35 feet, and
a maximum height which varies from 62 to 75 feet, depending on the street frontage. The
zoning also encourages reduced setbacks, requiring a front build-to line of ten feet. These
standards would encourage development at the upper ranges of density, and would also
encourage re-use of sites that are now developed with smaller office buildings. There are
many single story offices that were built in the 1960’s and 1970’s in this area.
The ECN zone district allows by right both stand-alone multi-family residential development
or mixed office/retail and residential development. The density for both stand-alone and
mixed use residential is 40 units per acre, and the mixed use project must include a
residential component. In this zone, there is a minimum building height of 35 to 48 feet,
depending on the street frontage, and maximum allowed heights of between 62 and 75 feet.
Depending on the street frontage, structures are required to be constructed at a front build-
to-line, in some cases with no setback. Density bonuses are given to a development when
the project includes lot consolidation.
Housing Constraints                                                                    Page 47

Downtown Specific Plan
The Burlingame Downtown Specific Plan was adopted by the City Council on October 4,
2010, and the implementing zoning for the plan was adopted by the Council on September
19, 2011. Downtown Burlingame is divided into a series of Planning Areas, and each
planning area or district provides for a different mix of uses and intensities. Multi-family
residential uses are permitted in eight of the twelve areas, both on the ground floors and
upper floors of buildings. The zoning districts within the Downtown Specific Plan area where
multi-family residential uses are permitted are HMU (Howard Mixed Use), CAR (California
Auto Row), MMU (Myrtle Mixed Use), BMU (Bayswater Mixed Use) as well as the R-3 and R-
4 zoned properties within the Downtown Area. The adopted zoning for the downtown area
includes parking reductions for sites within the downtown area based on the fact that they
are within walking distance to the transit centers. Additional incentives outside of the
Downtown Specific Plan regulations would apply for affordable housing and lot consolidation.
The CR zone is for a very small area along California Drive with through lots to Edgehill
Drive. The mixed use zone provides for retail commercial development on California Drive,
combined with residential development fronting on Edgehill. The residential development
standards are similar to the R-2 standards which apply to other properties along Edgehill
Drive. Although there has been one project built within this zone within the last 10 years,
there are no opportunity sites identified within this district.
Zoning Ordinance
The City of Burlingame’s Zoning Ordinance sets forth requirements that can affect the type,
appearance and cost of housing built in Burlingame. The zoning ordinance sets the
standards for lot size, use, lot coverage, floor area ratio, setbacks, height, open space and
parking. In Burlingame, there are four residential zoning districts. With implementation of
the North Burlingame/Rollins Road and Downtown Specific Plans, there are also several
mixed use districts (C-R, TW, ECN, HMU, CAR, MMU and BMU), allowing all multi-family
residential or mixed commercial/residential use. All of these mixed use zoning districts are
close to the city’s major transportation corridors, encouraging residential development in
these locations.
The minimum residential lot size in Burlingame is 5,000 square feet. There are some areas
in the city, mostly hillside areas, where the minimum lot size is 7,000 and 10,000 square
feet. There are also some nonconforming 3,000 and 4,000 square foot parcels in the city’s
older subdivisions. The lot coverage allowed for single-family development is 40%, and 50%
coverage is allowed for multiple family development. Lot coverage on corner lots in R­3 and
R-4 zoning districts is 60%. Side setback requirements are based upon lot width, range
from 4 to 7 feet, and are required for all residential developments. The minimum front and
rear setback requirement is 15 feet. Private and shared open space are required only for
residential condominium developments. These requirements are on a per unit basis, with 75
square feet of private open space required per unit, and 100 square feet of common open
space required per unit. Floor area ratio pertains only to single-family projects and depends
on the lot size, location and placement of the house.
Unlike other cities in San Mateo County, over half of Burlingame’s housing stock is multi-
family units. The densities of the multi-family units vary from 20 units per acre, to over 50
units per acre. Except for the addition of residential condominium requirements for multiple
family units in the 1970s, the zoning regulations for multi-unit developments have not
changed much over the years.
Housing Constraints                                                                   Page 48

Burlingame does not have density limits (units per acre) established by zoning in the
residential zoning districts, except for a density limit of 40 units per acre is required in the
residential mixed use zoning districts (ECN and TW) in North Burlingame. Within the
Downtown Specific Plan, there is an average maximum unit size of 1,250 square feet per
unit (meaning the average unit size of all units cannot exceed 1,250 square feet), which in
effect serves as a minimum density.
In practice, the number of parking spaces that can be accommodated on a site is the
ultimate determination of the maximum number of units on a multiple family zoned lot. The
parking requirement in Burlingame is based upon the number of bedrooms, per unit. One
and one-half spaces are required for each studio or one-bedroom unit; two parking spaces
required for a two bedroom unit; two and one-half spaces required for a three or more
bedroom unit. Within the Downtown Burlingame area, the parking requirement for multi-
family districts is reduced based on the area's proximity to the Caltrain station and regional
bus routes. Within Downtown Burlingame, one space is required for each studio or one
bedroom unit; one and on-half spaces for each two bedroom unit; and two spaces for units
with three bedrooms or more.            Guest parking is required only for multiple family
condominium projects and is required based upon the project size. Guest parking is not
required for projects within the Downtown Specific Plan area.
Parking is one of the major limiting factors in developing high-density housing in
Burlingame. Often parking in below grade structures is used to increase the dwelling unit
densities in multi-family developments, through typically only one level of underground
parking is financially feasible for projects. The Code allows group residential facilities for the
elderly to be built with 25% of the required parking per unit. Except within the Downtown
Specific Plan area, there are currently no provisions for reduced parking for multi-family
development near mass transit, although some compact spaces are allowed.
The height limit for residential structures in the R-1 and R-2 zoning districts is two and one-
half stories or 30 feet, and can be increased to 36 feet to accommodate design features of
certain architectural styles. The R-3 zoning district has a height limit of four stories or 55
feet and the R-4 zoning district is six stories or 75 feet in height. A conditional use permit is
required for any multiple family structure over 35 feet in height. However, the inclusionary
zoning regulations contain an incentive which allows heights up to 46 feet (4 stories) by
right for any project which complies with the inclusionary zoning provisions. In addition,
heights of between 62 and 75 feet are allowed by right for residential uses in the TW and
ECN zones (North Burlingame). In the Downtown Specific Plan area, heights up to 55 feet
are allowed by right in the HMU and R-4 Incentive areas; within the MMU and BMU zoned
areas, heights up to 35 feet are allowed by right and up to 45 feet (MMU) or 55 feet (BMU)
are allowed with a Conditional Use Permit. At the north end of the city near the BART
station in Millbrae, there are height limits imposed by the FAA and SFO Airport. The
maximum height in the portions of this area affected by the flight paths is limited based on
the Height Restrictions specified in the San Mateo County Comprehensive Airport Land Use
Plan.
Comprehensive Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
The City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG) has found that
the Burlingame 2015-2023 Housing Element is consistent with the policies established in the
Comprehensive Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (November 2012). Policies that govern
the safety of critical airways from obstructions beneath the calculated ascent and descent
profiles are found under section 4.5.4 (Airspace Protection Policies) in the Plan. Proposed
projects in Burlingame must be compliant with policies as established in the Plan, including:
Housing Constraints                                                                      Page 49
1) notification and filing requirements (4.5.4, AP-1); 2) design recommendations from
findings in FAA aeronautical studies (4.5.4, AP-2); 3) height restriction and filing
requirements (4.5.4, AP-3); and 4) C/CAG review and project consistency with FAA
regulations for land uses that may cause flight hazards (4.5.4, AP-4).
Federal Aviation Administration
All future housing development in the city of Burlingame, within the area bounded by
Murchison Drive, Sequoia Avenue, Quesada Way, Davis Drive, Dufferin Avenue and
California Drive will require formal FAA review, per the FAA Form 7460-1 review process.
The project sponsor is responsible for this requirement, at or before the time of project
submittal to the City. The City considers the FAA's evaluation and recommendation(s), as
part of its review of the proposed project.
In areas where there are airport height restrictions, the FAA requires that an applicant
obtain a “Determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation.” In the North Burlingame area, the
airport height restrictions generally extend higher than the 75 foot height limit of the ECN
and TW zone districts. However, since it is a sloped surface, there is the potential for the
project to be affected. The applicant submits the proposed project plans to the FAA, the FAA
staff reviews the height proposed by the project and compares it to the obstruction
standards of the FAA regulations. This process is an administrative process, and generally
takes about 30 days for a determination. Of the four projects reviewed by the FAA within
the North Burlingame area, none have exceeded the FAA’s obstruction standards.
Conditional Use Permits
A Conditional Use Permit (CUP) is a regulatory mechanism to allow the proper integration
into the community, uses which may be suitable only in specific locations in a zoning
district, or only if such uses are designed or arranged on the site in a particular manner. Per
the City of Burlingame Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission may impose such
requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance, operation,
site planning, traffic control and time limits for the use permit as it deems necessary for the
protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.
The Planning Commission may grant a Conditional Use Permit if, from the application or the
facts presented at the public hearing, it finds:
        a) The proposed use, at the proposed location, will not be detrimental or injurious to
            property or improvements in the vicinity and will not be detrimental to the public
            health, safety, general welfare or convenience;
        b) The proposed use will be located and conducted in a manner in accord with the
            Burlingame general plan and the purposes of this title;
        c) The planning commission may impose such reasonable conditions or restrictions
            as it deems necessary to secure the purposes of this title and to assure operation
            of the use in a manner compatible with the aesthetics, mass, bulk and character
            of existing and potential uses on adjoining properties in the general vicinity. (Ord.
            1378 § 8 (part), (1988))
In 2011, the City Council adopted zoning implementation for the Housing Element which
includes definitions for emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing and
temporary housing. The code indicates that the uses are permitted by right in any zone that
allows residential uses, subject to the same restrictions as other residential uses of the
same type in the same zone.
Housing Constraints                                                                      Page 50

Second Units
A second unit amnesty program was adopted by the City Council to legalize existing second
units on single family zoned (R-1) lots. The program was originally adopted for two years,
and has since been made a permanent program. Burlingame first adopted a zoning code in
1921 when second units were allowed on R-1 zoned lots. In January 1954, R-1 district
regulations were revised to allow only one dwelling on an R-1 zoned lot. Many of the older
second units were originally built during the housing crisis associated with World War II, and
the program sought to retain existing units as a legal part of Burlingame’s housing stock.
The units are usually smaller, more affordable, and are suitable for single or elderly people
with limited incomes. The intent of the program was also to make these units safe and
sanitary for the current and future tenants.
In order for a second unit to qualify for the amnesty program it must meet certain criteria,
including being able to conform to the requirements of the California Health and Safety
Code. The amnesty process is primarily administrative and includes an inspection by the
Building Inspector and notification to neighbors within 100 feet of the property. Any appeals
are resolved by the Planning Commission. If all the criteria are met and no appeals are filed,
the unit is granted amnesty. With the grant of amnesty for a second unit, some limitations
are placed on the property including future expansion of the second unit and a requirement
that one of the two units on-site be owner occupied.
In 2011, the City Council amended the zoning code to also allow construction of new second
units on certain properties subject to complying with performance standards. The new
second dwelling unit is required to be on a lot with a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet,
there shall be no more than one secondary unit on a lot with one primary dwelling, one of
the units shall be occupied by the property owner, the secondary unit shall be a studio or
one-bedroom unit limited to a maximum unit size of 640 square feet, and shall comply with
the other measurable standards of the zoning.
Residential Design Review
Design review is required for second story additions, new construction and first floor
additions which involve substantial construction in the residential zoning districts. The intent
of the design review is to preserve the original and unique patterns of the distinct
residential neighborhoods in Burlingame. Design review is required for both single family
and multi-family projects.
Concurrent Processing
When a project requires more than one type of application (such as Design Review and a
Conditional Use Permit), the applications are processed concurrently, which reduces the
overall timeline for processing.
Factory-Built and Mobilehome Units
Factory built housing or mobilehome units would be considered similar in use as a single-
family use. These units are permitted in all residential zones, and if a new structure, would
require Design Review consistent with any new single-family home. Approval of factory built
or mobilehome unit would not require additional regulatory requirements over and above
similar uses in the same zone.
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 51

Homeless Shelters
The zoning ordinance provides the opportunity for homeless shelters in the R-3, R-4, C-1
and C-2 zoning districts. These districts allow temporary homeless shelters in conjunction
with a church or nonprofit institution on those properties located along a transportation
corridor. Most of the properties along El Camino Real are zoned R-3, and many of the
community's churches are located along this corridor. Conditional use permits have been
granted at several local churches along the El Camino Real corridor for the Interfaith
Hospital Network program which provides shelter at the churches to homeless families on a
rotating basis.
In 2011, the City Council adopted zoning implementation for the Housing Element which
allows homeless shelters by right subject to performance standards in the northern part of
the RR (Rollins Road) zoning district.
The City of Burlingame had identified the northern portion of the Rollins Road area as the
appropriate zone to accommodate emergency shelters. In addition to being near transit, this
area is appropriate for this type of facility because it is located near support services
including the new Peninsula Hospital and grocery stores.
There are about 70 properties in the RR zoned area with the zoning overlay allowing
homeless shelters subject to performance criteria. These properties range in size from 0.35
acres to 13.63 acres.         It is anticipated that a smaller homeless shelter could be
accommodated on a site between 0.5 and 1.0 acres, and a larger homeless shelter would fit
on a parcel between 1.0 and 2.0 acres in size. There are 20 properties in this area between
0.5 and 1.0 acre in size, and there are 22 properties between 1.0 and 2.00 acres. Most of
these properties are now developed with older light industrial or warehouse buildings which
may be suitable for conversion, or could be replaced with a new building.
The identified area can accommodate a shelter large enough to have capacity for the City’s
unmet homeless need. The 2013 San Mateo County Homeless Census and identified 13
unsheltered persons in Burlingame. Depending on the size of site required, and other
amenities provided in a homeless shelter, an adequately sized facility could be
accommodated in this zone. While the majority of the sites are less than one half acre,
there are opportunities for site consolidation, as well as sites that are one acre or more.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
This type of facility is longer term than a temporary shelter and generally provides housing
for people with specific needs for six months or longer to allow them time to rehabilitate,
save money, and search for permanent housing and jobs. These types of facilities are often
located in converted apartment buildings.
In 2011, the City Council adopted zoning implementation for the Housing Element which
includes clear definitions for transitional and supportive housing as outlined in State law,
and provides that these uses are allowed by right in all zones which allow residential uses,
only subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
same zone.
InnVision Shelter Network, a non-profit organization which operates programs providing
both emergency shelter and transitional housing throughout San Mateo County, now
operates four transitional housing facilities for families and one facility for shingle adults.
The facility located in Daly City serves northern San Mateo County with housing and
services for 14 families, the facility in Menlo Park serves southern San Mateo County with
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 52

services for 23 families, and the facility in Redwood City serves central San Mateo County
from Burlingame to Redwood City with housing and services for nine families. There is also
a facility in the City of San Mateo which offers transitional housing for 39 families. The
facility for single adults in Redwood City serves 75 persons. Other programs also provide
support for persons facing homelessness, such as the Housing First Program, which provides
financial assistance for permanent housing to persons who are homeless but have reliable
incomes, and the Bridges Program, which provides transitional housing while formerly
homeless individuals enroll in schools to obtain job skills. The City of Burlingame contributes
financial support to InnVision Shelter Network in its annual budget as well as other
programs to increase housing options such as HIP Housing, Samaritan House and Samaritan
House Safe Harbor – Winter Shelter.
As noted above, pursuant to Senate Bill 2, the City of Burlingame has amended its zoning
code to require that an application for supportive and transitional housing will be treated
equal to any other multifamily residential project application in process and review. See
Housing Element Policy H(D-5).
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
SRO Units would be considered similar in use to a multi-family development, permitted in
multi-family residential zones in a new development, subject to Environmental Review. Any
new building or multi-family residential use requires these same entitlements; therefore
approval of SRO housing would not require additional regulatory requirements over and
above similar uses in the same zone.
Burlingame Fair Property Rights Ordinance (“Measure T”)
In 1987, the voters of Burlingame passed an Ordinance called the Burlingame Fair Property
Rights Ordinance (“Measure T”). This ordinance contains the provision that an owner of real
property has the right to establish the price for which that property may be sold, leased,
rented, transferred or exchanged. The ordinance further states that the City of Burlingame
shall enact no law which imposes restrictions on the price for which real property may be
sold, leased, rented, transferred or exchanged. Therefore, in order to implement a program
that includes rent control, the matter would have to be brought to the voters of the City of
Burlingame to repeal the provisions of this ordinance that might be in conflict with the
anticipated rent control program.
2. Building Codes
The City of Burlingame applies the 2013 California Building Code (CBC) and California Fire
Code (CFC) to review minimum health and safety standards for residential and commercial
construction projects. There are local amendments that require more restrictive standards
for certain items. The local amendments that apply to housing include a requirement for the
installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems in all residential developments larger than
2,000 square feet in area and for structures taller than two stories. For all structures,
residential included, all storm water roof drainage must be collected and conveyed to the
public storm water system. There are seismic standards applied, and extra engineering may
be required for structures in the hillside areas. Because Building and Fire Code standards
are established for life safety reasons, it is not reasonable to consider not complying with
the Code in order to reduce housing costs.
Burlingame enforces energy conservation standards enacted by the State. The standards
may increase initial construction costs, but will reduce household costs over the long term
Housing Constraints                                                                    Page 53

by reducing energy costs. In addition, for residential remodels and new construction,
applicants are required to complete a Build It Green "Green Points" checklist to document
what measures have been incorporated in the project to promote healthy, durable, energy
and resource efficient buildings.
Burlingame code enforcement is distributed among Planning, Building, Public Works, and
City Attorney personnel. In each case, the most applicable department leads enforcement
based on the nature of the nature of the issue. Most of the code enforcement in Burlingame
is complaint driven, but there is some active enforcement initiated by staff based upon
observation. It is unlikely that the code enforcement in Burlingame would have a negative
impact on the long term affordability of the city’s housing stock.
3. NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) Requirements
Burlingame is located at the foot and along the east side of the coastal ridge between the
Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Seven creeks drain the area directly into San
Francisco Bay. For these reasons, runoff and water quality are important considerations in
development and construction. The Clean Water Act of 1972 prohibits the discharge of
stormwater into United States waters unless the discharge is in compliance with a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). To meet its mandate from the State, the
City of Burlingame has joined with the other cities in San Mateo County, to obtain a regional
discharge permit from the State Water Quality Control Board (SWQCB) for stormwater
water discharge. In order to reduce non-point pollution sources, each construction project is
required to implement “best management practices” on job sites to minimize erosion, stop
contaminated run-off and control construction site pollution. NPDES requirements also
encourage site planning including swales, detention ponds and other design elements that
can be incorporated into project design to reduce storm water run-off and contamination.
The City of Burlingame requires stormwater run-off to be collected and channeled into a
public storm water system. Current regulations focus on solutions that encourage on-site
retention and recharge of stormwater, so that all drainage does not have to enter the storm
drain system. This can result in a more affordable solution for accommodating storm water
runoff.
The impact of the current requirements will require additional site planning, post
construction controls and maintenance that will likely result in additional time and expense
to developers.
4. On and Off-Site Improvements
On and off-site improvements also add to the cost of development projects, and are usually
required before a building permit can be signed off for occupancy of a structure. Residential
developments in the city of Burlingame are required to meet City standards for curb cuts,
which is a width not exceeding 25% of the lot dimension or 16 feet for a two-car garage. As
stated above, all storm water roof drainage must be collected and conveyed to the public
storm water system. Sewer laterals are required to be tested upon sale and replaced all the
way from the house to the city clean out for all new residential buildings. For single family
residential and duplex projects, the City’s urban reforestation ordinance requires that one
landscape tree be planted on-site for each 1,000 square feet of floor area. For multiple
family residential projects, one tree is required for each 2000 square feet of floor area.
These trees can be 15 gallon up to 24" box size when planted. For properties along El
Camino Real (State Route 82), sidewalk and curb cut changes require Caltrans approval.
Housing Constraints                                                                  Page 54

Communal amenities are also considered on-site improvements within a new housing
development. While amenities such as swimming pools, club houses, on-site laundry
facilities, etc. are not required, they are encouraged. If a new project proposes such an
amenity, this would be seen as a positive aspect to the project which could attract potential
tenants. Program H(B-3) encourages provision of communal amenities in new housing
developments, but specifically states only where feasible and provision of which does not
impair achievement of maximum densities or the financial feasibility of developing housing
affordable to lower-income households.
5. Environmental Requirements
Burlingame is mandated to follow the procedures set forth in the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). Since two square miles of the city is under San Francisco Bay water, the
city has a substantial bay edge. Four creeks drain the coastal range to the bay through the
city. Sites that have unusual topography and/or sensitive habitat may require in-depth
review and special studies to evaluate the environmental impacts of a proposed project.
This can add additional costs to a project. Residential properties containing a creek that are
proposing significant alterations or culverting of a creek are also required to obtain approval
from the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
Potential development sites with sensitive habits, endangered species, or significant
environment problems are generally not recommended sites for affordable housing. For
example, steeply sloping sites in the Burlingame Hills that may be available for housing
would be quite expensive to develop because of geotechnical problems.
6. Fees and Exactions
The costs involved with development in the city of Burlingame include planning and building
plan check and permit fees; utility service fees, school fees and a recycling fee. The City
does not have park dedication fees or bedroom tax, as do many cities. The City has no
exactions on residential developers to provide public art or sound walls.
Although the fees established for the Planning permit process have been increased in the
past few years to recover as much as possible of the costs to process the applications,
Burlingame’s planning processing fees are below the average for communities in San Mateo
County.
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 55

Planning Fees
The Planning Department fees required for residential development include the following:

Housing Constraints                                                                 Page 56
Other development fees associated with new construction include:

Burlingame’s Planning Department is only partially funded by fees, with the remaining costs
covered by the general fund. The cost of planning is partially subsidized in Burlingame, with
the fees collected for projects not entirely covering the cost of staff time to process such
projects.

Building Fees
Building permit fees are charged on a sliding scale that is based upon the valuation of the
project, plus plan check fees. The estimated valuation of a project is checked against a
minimum valuation per square foot for residential development. The basic plan check fee is
65% of the building permit fee. The energy plan check fee (when applicable) is an additional
25% of the building permit fee. The basic fee for electrical, plumbing and mechanical
permits is $25 dollars, with additional fees charged on a line item basis.
Public Impact Fees
Ordinance No. 1830 was adopted in 2008 by the Burlingame City Council in order offset the
impacts of new development projects on City facilities. In establishing the fees, the City had
a study conducted that provided information on the nexus between development projects
and impacts on City facilities and set out a formula of fees that would serve to offset some
of those impacts. Public Impact Fees applicable to new residential development are shown
on Table IV-4 below.

Due to the physical constraints of a largely, built-out environment, the City does not have a
Quimby Act fee for adding parkland. There are limited opportunities to acquire land for
parks and any acquisitions would be costly. To pursue improvements to parks and other
public recreational facilities, the City’s Parks and Recreation Public Facility Impact Fee has
been a source of funding for these types of projects.
If a project proposes to include open space/recreational amenities on site, the project
applicant can request a waiver of the Public Facilities Impact fee related to Parks and
Recreation. The Municipal Code Chapter related to Public Facilities Impact fees allows a
developer of a project to apply to the Community Development Director for a reduction or
waiver of any one of the fees. The fee waiver request will be considered by the Planning
Commission at the time that the development application is considered. The findings for
such a waiver would be based on the provision of open space/recreational amenities to be
available for the use of the residents, therefore, the project would not create an impact to
the existing parks in the community.
Housing Constraints                                                                    Page 59

Recycling Fees
Ordinance No. 1645 was adopted in 2000 by the Burlingame City Council in order to meet
the goals of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which requires all
California cities and counties to divert 50% of waste they generate away from landfills. The
City’s recycling ordinance requires that 60% (by weight) of all waste generated from
demolition and new construction be reused and/or recycled, and that a minimum of 25% of
structural material (excluding concrete, asphalt and dirt) must be recycled.
Prior to permitting, applicants must complete a recycling and waste reduction form, then a
City employee makes a site visit to verify the estimated waste anticipated to be generated
by the project. The applicant is then required to pay a deposit at the rate of $50 per ton of
waste generated. For example, if a project is estimated to generate 10 tons of debris, the
deposit would be ($50 X 10 tons) $500, and 5 tons is required to be recycled. All recycling,
reuse and disposal must be documented by receipts, weight tags or other records. If the
recycling goal is met, the full deposit is refunded, however if the recycling goal is not met
only a proportionate amount of the deposit will be returned. Some waste materials can be
sold by the developer to offset his/her additional cost of removal caused by recycling.
Public Works
Public Works fees associated with housing development typically include sewer connection
fees which are $237 for a single family dwelling or duplex and $180 per unit for multi-family
structures. Water meter and service connection fees can range from $4,100 to $5,420
depending on the size of the service and meter required. Sidewalk and special
encroachment fees are range from $315 to $570 for properties in residential zoning
districts. Fees for street frontage improvements commonly associated with housing
development, including sidewalk, curb, gutter, and curb drain modifications, are $402 for
changes to 150 square feet or less.
School Fees
Two school districts serve Burlingame: the Burlingame Elementary School District and the
San Mateo Union High School District. School fees are collected to offset costs of
rehabilitation and maintenance of school buildings, with 60% of the fees collected going to
the elementary school district and 40% to the high school district. Fees are collected on all
new construction projects and residential remodels in Burlingame that add 500 square feet
or more. Residential school development fees for 500 square feet or more of development
are $3.06 per square foot, and commercial and industrial projects are charged $0.49 per
square foot. Mini-storage buildings are also charged a fee of $0.01 per square foot.
7. Process and Permitting Procedures
Planning Process: Single Family Construction
Burlingame adopted interim single family residential design review guidelines in 1998 for
new single family construction and second story additions in the R-1 zoning district. The
process was revised slightly to include first floor additions involving substantial construction
and to expedite processing times, and was made permanent in April 2000. The intent of the
guidelines is to preserve the original and unique patterns of distinct neighborhoods through
consistency of character in individual homes to allow protection of each homeowner’s
investment when future projects are initiated. The process requires that all qualifying
projects go before the Planning Commission in a design review study meeting, with notice
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 60

to all neighbors within 300 feet. The project is either referred to a design review consultant
or the project is moved forward on the Planning Commission calendar for action. The
Planning Commission action is appealable to City Council. The average processing time for a
project that is not referred to a design review consultant is 60 days. Approximately 26% of
the projects requiring design review are sent to a design review consultant. The average
processing time for these projects is approximately 90 days. These average processing
times include “out of court” time in which the applicant is revising drawings. The design
review process has been extended to include all types of residential and commercial
development.
In addition to design review, applicants may request exceptions to the zoning code in the
form of variances, conditional use and special permits. A variance is generally a measurable
standard, such as parking space dimension or front setback dimension. Special permits and
conditional use permits are more discretionary.
The average processing times for these types of applications is about 8 to 10 weeks (56 to
70 calendar days). This time line is generally driven by legal noticing requirements and
Planning Commission hearing availability. The Burlingame Planning Commission meets the
second and fourth Monday of each month. All applications require two meetings before the
Commission; one for design review study and one for action. Three weeks is added to the
review time if a decision is appealed to the City Council because of the requirements to
comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act provisions.
There are two administrative processes in Burlingame: minor modifications and hillside area
construction permits. Minor modifications are similar to variances, but are for minor
encroachments beyond the established development regulations. For example, a property
owner may seek a minor modification rather than a variance for a 1 foot extension into the
required side yard. In the hillside areas of the city, any construction requires a hillside area
construction permit. The intent of this process is to allow opportunity to review construction
for its effect on existing distant views from inside structures on nearby properties.
Administrative permits are noticed to immediate neighbors (within 100 feet). If there are no
appeals within 7 days, the permit is issued administratively. If a neighbor wishes to appeal
the project it moves on to full review with a public hearing before the Planning Commission.
An administrative permit review which is not appealed takes about 16 days.
Planning Process: Multiple Family Construction
Residential Condominium Permits
All proposals for condominiums, residential or commercial, require a condominium permit.
The Planning Commission and City Council must approve the project based on the following
criteria: conformity with zoning regulations and General Plan densities, its effect on
surrounding community, impact on schools, parks, public utilities, streets, traffic, and
submittal of legal tentative parcel map approved by the City Engineer. Condominium
projects must also meet certain development criteria such as common and private open
space, as well as greater setbacks than is required for apartments.
Apartment Development
Apartments are allowed by right in the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts, assuming all
development standards of the district are met. However, these projects are subject to the
design review process. There are no requirements for common and private open space in
apartment projects.
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 61

The California Environmental Quality Act allows categorical exemptions for projects involving
four or less units, and for larger infill projects which meet certain criteria. For those larger
developments which do not meet the infill criteria, the environmental review process may
add time to development projects, as discussed above.
Plan Check
The City of Burlingame offers a parallel plan check process which allows applicants by their
choice to submit construction plans to the Building Department while they are
simultaneously going through the zoning review process. The intent of providing this option
to the public is to expedite the review process. However, there is a risk involved with this
process in that plan drawings and engineering and structural calculations may be required
to be redone should the action of the Planning Commission cause a substantial change to
the project. Additional plan check fees are charged for revised plans. There is a 7 day
performance standard for Planning Department review of building permit applications.
Public Works
Since Burlingame operates its own wastewater treatment plant, and it must meet the
operating requirements of the San Francisco Region Water Quality Control Board, it is a part
of the City’s permit that a sewer lateral test be completed prior to the sale of a house that is
25 years old or older and before renovations occur where two or more plumbing fixtures are
added. Typically these tests cost $315, in addition to any repairs or line replacement
required.
Coastal Zone Requirements
A portion of Burlingame is adjacent to the San Francisco Bay, which is considered part of
the State of California's Coastal Zone. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and
Development Commission (BCDC) has authority over the portion of the Coastal Zone which
is adjacent to San Francisco Bay.
The area along Burlingame's San Francisco Bay frontage is zoned SL, Shoreline and AA,
Anza Area, both of which allow development of hotels, offices, restaurants and commercial
recreational uses but do not allow residential uses. Therefore there is no housing allowed
within the area that falls within BCDC's jurisdiction.
8. Constraints to Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Existing Regulations
Building Code
The City of Burlingame has adopted the California Building Code and Uniform Fire Code,
2013 Editions for reviewing construction plans. Burlingame has adopted amendments to the
California Building Code which relate to the appeals procedure and requirements for lighted
street addresses, roof covering, drainage, reroofing, retaining walls, slab thickness, bracing
framed walls and suspended ceiling upgrades. None of these amendments would impact
additions of accessibility features to a home or upgrades required for a group home.
Building code regulations are established to provide minimum health and safety standards
for structures. These minimum standards for occupancy and exiting must be met for any
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 62

group home occupancy in a single family residence. The Building Code and Federal ADA
standards require that certain accessibility amenities for persons with disabilities be included
in new construction and improvements to property.
Zoning Code
Per State law, the Burlingame zoning ordinance allows licensed care facilities, including
group homes with up to six residents, by right in all residential zoning districts. Since these
facilities are considered a "single housekeeping unit", no additional parking is required for
this use, the group home only needs to meet the parking requirement for a single family
home (one or two covered and one uncovered parking space, depending on the number of
bedrooms). There are no City restrictions on the distance between two (or more) group
homes. The City does not have occupancy standards that apply to unrelated adults and are
not required of families. The maximum occupancy for a residential use is based on the
safety requirements of the fire and building codes.
Group residential facilities for the elderly are allowed in the multiple-family R-3 and R-4
zoning districts with a conditional use permit. Parking for group residential facilities is
required at the rate of one parking space for each three dwelling units, or one for each four
lodgers, if separate units are not provided. This is about one-third of the parking required
for an apartment building. Rooming and Boarding Houses are also allowed with a conditional
use permit; they have a parking requirement of one space for each rented room for the first
four rooms, plus one space for each two additional rooms.
All residential zoning districts require building setbacks from property lines and are limited
in the area of the lot that can be covered by structures. Generally, all structures over 30
inches high, including the portions of such ramps which are over 30 inches above grade, are
subject to the setback and lot coverage requirements. At least a portion of ramps and
landings installed to provide access for the disabled are over 30 inches high and would be
required to meet the lot coverage and setback requirements.
As a part of the Housing Element Implementation program adopted by the City Council in
September, 2011, provisions were added to the zoning code which would allow supportive
and transitional housing to be considered as a residential use, and only subject to the
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Supportive housing is defined as housing with no limit on the length of stay, that is occupied
by target populations, as defined in the California Health and Safety Code, and that is linked
to on- or off-site services that assist the supportive housing residents. Transitional housing
is housing development that provides residence and support services for a specified length
of time.
Opportunities to Remove Constraints to Housing for Persons with Disabilities
To improve the options for housing for persons with disabilities, Burlingame has adopted a
Reasonable Accommodation for Accessibility procedure as a part of the zoning code. This
allows a person with a disability to request modifications to zoning standards in order to
install physical improvements to a residence to accommodate the person's disability. These
improvements would include such improvements as ramps, walls, handrails, as well as
elevators or lifts. This is an administrative procedure, subject to meeting the criteria
outlined in the zoning code chapter.
Housing Constraints                                                                      Page 63
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Environmental
Geotechnical/Noise
The topography in Burlingame goes from the waters of San Francisco Bay to the coastal
range foothills. Four creeks drain from the coastal range, through the city, to the bay. In
Burlingame the face of the coastal range is divided into large-lot single-family dwellings.
Due to the steep slopes and shallow underground streams, some areas are vulnerable to
landslides during the wet weather. The hillside area is divided into larger lots (10,000 SF
minimum). Developments on these lots require additional seismic and structural engineering
features. The flat land areas in Burlingame are subject to a high water table and, in some
areas to short term flooding. These constraints increase the cost of building housing in some
areas.
Certain areas of the city are also subject to high noise levels. These areas include sites close
to US 101, the Caltrain rail line, and areas subject to over flight from planes departing San
Francisco International Airport. A larger area of the flat land and upward sloping area at the
north end of the city are also subject to back blasts (low frequency) noise from departing
airplanes. Housing development in these areas will require noise mitigation, which also adds
to increased housing costs. It should be noted that due to advance technology in airplane
design, noise impacts from the airport have decreased.
2. Land and Construction Costs
Housing and land costs within San Mateo County have dramatically increased in recent
decades. This is due in large part to the rapid growth of high-technology businesses in the
Bay Area region, particularly on the San Francisco Peninsula. The increase in the
employment and housing demand has been more dramatic than any time in the past twenty
years, with housing costs rising much faster than household income levels.
In general lots are small in Burlingame with the typical lot between 5000 and 6000 SF.
There are fewer than 30 acres of vacant undeveloped land in the city, and most new
development will occur by re-use of already developed land. It has become common
practice to see proposals that include the demolition of a single family dwelling and
reconstruction of a larger single family dwelling on the lot. Many of these proposals are
made by developers who intend to market these homes on the high-end real estate market.
The largest increase in residential units has been in the multi-family zoned areas. Between
1999 and 2007, 111 multi-family units were added to the city’s housing stock. From 2008 to
2013, 70 units were added, resulting in 181 units added between 1999 and 2013.
The cost of construction for residential development has dramatically increased in recent
decades as well. The economic boom in the technology industry sparked a large demand for
office space in the Bay Area in the late 1990s, but then fell dramatically early in the next
decade. Demand for office space has only recently begun to increase in Silicon Valley and
San Francisco, but has yet to increase on the rest of the Peninsula. Building construction
costs are estimated by the Building Department to be $200 per square foot for single family
residential development.
Housing Constraints                                                                     Page 64

3. Financing and Affordability
In San Mateo County “affordable” housing is defined as that with a contract rent or price
affordable to low and moderate income households, based upon rent not exceeding 30% of
monthly income and monthly mortgage payment not exceeding 33% of gross monthly
income.
The median sales price in 2012 for a single family detached home in San Mateo County was
$661,000 (compared to $600,000 in 2000). The median price in 2012 for a condominium in
San Mateo County was $360,000, which is the same price as in 2000. In Burlingame, the
average price for a single family detached home in Burlingame in 2012 was $1,382,000 –
compared to $811,418 in 2000. The median sales price in 2012 for a condominium in
Burlingame was $654,000 – compared to $747,000 in 2006. And where 47 percent of the
housing stock is multiple family units, the average monthly rent for a 2-bedroom unit in
Burlingame was $2,346 in 2013, up from $1,784 in 2005.
Assuming a 20% down payment, a $1,384,000home financed for 30 years at 4.5 percent
would require a monthly payment of approximately $5,610. An annual household income of
about $192,300 would be required for the mortgage to be considered affordable – with
affordability defined as 35 percent of household income for owner-occupied units. The
median annual household income for Burlingame was $88,915 in 2011 (based on 2013
inflation adjusted dollars), which shows the large disparity between affordability and the
median income.

V. Community Resources and Opportunities
LAND INVENTORY AND SITE IDENTIFICATION
State law requires that local governments identify sufficient vacant or underdeveloped land
to accommodate the community's housing needs. One of the primary ways to do this is the
identification of lands suitable for future residential development. This identification should
include review of vacant sites and sites that have potential for reuse or whose use could be
intensified for residential use. An important factor in suitability of sites for housing is the
relationship of the identified sites to appropriate zoning, public facilities, and services.
PROPERTIES WITH POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT
The selection of areas of the city and sites within those areas with the greatest potential for
development was based on a number of considerations, including the experience with
effective programs in the 2009-2014 Housing Element and changes in our developed
environment which have served to attract residential development.
The sites potentially available for housing in the city of Burlingame range from as small as
50 feet by 100 feet to as large as 2 acres. While these may be considered “small sites,” the
majority of the sites are fairly typical for the city. Because Burlingame is built out and there
are no large, vacant parcels available, projects are proposed and built on these smaller
sites, at fairly high densities. Some of these parcels are adjacent to one another, such as in
the Downtown area. The City can encourage lot consolidation through development
incentives such as reduced parking, increased heights, and density bonuses for lots that are
developed over ½ acre. (See Implementation Policy H(F-1) and Table V-1 for opportunity
sites). In addition, in the past 20 years, there have been 15 multi-family projects built with
three to six units each on lots as small as 5000 square feet, with densities averaging 24
units per acre. With lot consolidation, increased density could easily be achieved. Although
the City of Burlingame does not currently have a housing authority with the ability to
purchase land for redevelopment, the City is in constant contact with property owners and
potential developers to facilitate development.
Since Burlingame is virtually built out the focus of the 2009-2014 Housing Element was on
in-fill development and changing the use of existing properties. During the planning period
of the previous Housing Element between 1999 and 2006, a net of 104 dwelling units were
added on in-fill sites (including one at the north end of the city) near the city’s commercial
areas and along El Camino Real. These were sites which had been developed in lower
density residential uses and on which multiple family (R-3 and R-4) zoning had been in
place for a number of years. Between 2007 and 2012, 77 units were been added.
An important reuse development incentive in the 2002 Housing Element was to create a
new zoning district which allowed for the highest density multiple family zoning in areas
with previous commercial zoning on two of the blocks at the north end of the city within
one-quarter mile of the Millbrae BART/Caltrain station. The intention of this new zoning was
to encourage more transit oriented residential development on these properties now
developed with older, more marginal office buildings. Since the implementation of the
zoning in this area, one 45-unit multiple family residential development has been built on a
former office site, and another 25-unit multi-family project is under construction. In
addition, a 77-unit senior housing facility is under construction in this area, and a 124-unit
senior housing facility is under review.

The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District extended BART to San Francisco International
Airport with an end of the line station and cross platform with Caltrain's San Francisco
Peninsula rail service at the Millbrae Intermodal station, one quarter mile from Burlingame's
northern border. This regional transportation service provides unique incentives for multiple
family residential development at the north end of the city. Furthermore, SamTrans recently
upgraded its El Camino Real bus route to provide service every 15 minutes, with a stop at
the Millbrae Intermodal station, thereby improving transit access to multifamily properties
along El Camino Real. Building on the experience of implementing the earlier Housing
Element action programs (particularly the multiple family mixed use zoning) and the
proposed residential incentive programs built into the 2015-2023 Housing Element the City
has every expectation of meeting its fair share housing numbers particularly in the north
end of the city and along El Camino Real.
There were several new residential development incentive programs included in the 2009-
2014 Housing Element to encourage reuse of the identified sites and other sites in the area
not specifically cited but with residential potential, whose development will be stimulated by
market demand, overlay zoning or other owner initiative. The action programs proposed
were:
         • Provide additional incentives in the new multi-family/mixed use zoning districts at
            the north end of the city adjacent to BART/Caltrain and Peninsula Hospital;
         • Offer developers incentives in all residential areas to include affordable housing;
         • Provides opportunities for increasing densities with reduced parking requirements
            and increased height for housing within one-third mile of a major transportation
            hub;
         • Amend the zoning code regulations to expand types of housing, live/work units
            and mixed commercial/residential; and
         • Provides incentives for lot consolidation.
Several of these programs were implemented with the Council's 2011 adoption of the
Zoning Implementation for the Housing Element. The zoning for the North Burlingame area
includes incentives for multi-family and mixed use development as well as for lot
consolidation. The Council adopted reduced parking requirements within the Downtown
Burlingame area for residential projects based on its proximity to Caltrain and along two
major transit corridors and added provisions to provide smaller, more affordable units. The
zoning for both the North Burlingame and Downtown Specific Plan areas include provisions
for mixed use as well as standalone residential projects.
The properties included in the analysis of properties for development include
underdeveloped or vacant properties zoned for high density residential use or mixed use. An
inventory of these properties, along with an estimated buildout capacity of 80 percent
density (to control for site variations that would likely reduce total unit count in practice), is
included in Table V-1. The identified sites yield a total potential of 1,486 units (at 80%
density). Based on the 1981 Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) for the city of Burlingame,
all sites identified for potential residential development are outside of the 100 and 500 year
flood boundaries. In addition to proposing rezoning programs for these sites, it is proposed
that zoning code changes be implemented which would offer incentives for building
affordable housing, incentives for building more housing within one-third mile of the three
transportation hubs, and incentives for consolidating smaller lots into a larger development.
A description of the actions to be taken to achieve these goals is at the end of this chapter.

1. Vacant Or Underused Sites Now Zoned For Residential Use
North Burlingame Area
Although Burlingame is a built-out community with few vacant sites, there are a number of
sites already zoned for residential use where the full potential has not been used. Many of
these sites are located in the Downtown Specific Plan area and the North Burlingame/Rollins
Road Specific Plan area. There is a concentration of underutilized parcels within the area
bounded by Murchison and Dufferin between El Camino Real and California Drive. This office
commercial area was rezoned to a new multi-family residential/mixed use zone district (ECN
– El Camino North) in 2006 to implement the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan.
Prior to that, as a part of the 1994 Housing Element work program, an R-4 overlay zone
was created. One office building was removed and the 1.24 acre site has been developed
with a 20-unit residential condominium and a 48-bed residential care facility for the elderly.
In addition, an area west of El Camino Real and North of Trousdale Drive was rezoned to a
new residential mixed use district (TW – Trousdale West). Within this area, a condominium
project at 1800 Trousdale Drive is under construction; it will replace an office building with
22 market rate units and 3 moderate income units. All of these sites are within one-half
mile of the Millbrae Intermodal Station. Because of proximity to a transit terminal, these
sites would warrant special provisions for higher residential density such as reduced parking
requirements and increased height. All development of sites in this area is subject to
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval for height.
Carolan Avenue Residential Overlay
In 2009 the City Council approved the rezoning of the C-2 zoned sites along Carolan and
Rollins Road to include a high-density overlay (R-4). This rezoning allows stand-alone high
density residential uses on these parcels, which total 5.4 acres combined.
Downtown Specific Plan
In 2010 the City adopted a Specific Plan for the area framed by Oak Grove Avenue on the
north side, the Caltrain tracks south to Burlingame Avenue and Anita Road on the east side,
Peninsula Avenue and the City limits on the south side, and El Camino Real on the west
side. Within this area the plan has areas of medium-high (R-3) and high (R-4) density
residential, as well as mixed-use development opportunities. The Specific Plan identifies new
mixed use areas (previously zoned C-1) along Howard and Lorton Avenues, Primrose and
Park Roads, and along California Drive. Within the mixed use zones, it is proposed that a
project could either be mixed use or standalone high density residential. Table V-1: Vacant
or Underused Sites identifies those sites within the proposed Downtown Specific Plan. The
development standards vary for the different areas within the planning area, but include
zero setback requirements in many instances, average maximum unit sizes of 1,250 square
feet, increased height limits, and reduced parking standards. These development standards
will facilitate mixed-use and multi-family residential housing, particularly because housing
was not previously permitted in some of these areas, and because the new standards allow
more intensive development compared to other residential areas in the city.
The Downtown Specific Plan area contains numerous sites with the potential for reuse. In
2011, these areas were rezoned to reflect the mixed use area identified in the Downtown
Specific Plan. The areas determined to be appropriate for mixed use zoning, which includes
the opportunity for standalone multiple family residential uses are: HMU (Howard Mixed
Use), BMU (Bayswater Mixed Use), CAR (California Auto Row), and MMU (Myrtle Mixed Use).
In addition, there are areas within the boundaries of the Downtown Specific Plan which are
Community Resources and Opportunities                                                 Page 69

zoned R-3 and R-4, including an R-4 incentive district, which allows building heights up to
55 feet. As a part of the zoning implementation, reduced parking standards for multiple
family residential development was adopted for properties within the Downtown Specific
Plan area. Since the Downtown Specific Plan and zoning amendments were adopted, 12 new
units have been approved and another 70 units have been proposed.

SITE INVENTORY
In determining the total potential capacity of sites, the available area for development and the development densities were
considered. The maximum allowable density of a site, as a product of site acreage and maximum zoning density, is shown in
the column “Total Max” of Table V-1 below. A more likely estimate of development potential is considered as 80 percent of the
maximum units. For the purpose of estimating total capacity of opportunity sites, the column “Realistic Total- 80%” has been
used to determine the number of units for each site.

ZONING TO ACCOMMODATE HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
State law requires cities to demonstrate the capacity of the site inventory to accommodate
a city’s share of lower income households. Cities can show the ability to accommodate lower
income households by identifying sites zoned for higher densities. California Government
Code Section 65583.2(c) establishes the minimum density, or “default” density, deemed
appropriate to accommodate lower income households. This is based on the recognition that
sites zoned for higher densities allow for more units which can potentially lower per unit
costs through economies of scale. For Burlingame, the “default” density is 30 dwelling units
per acre, consistent with the rest of San Mateo County.
About half of the sites identified in the inventory have been zoned for more than 30 units
per acre and are available for development. The default density is applicable to a total of 40
parcels with the potential to accommodate 1,076 units, which exceeds the RHNA allocation
of 575 for very low, low and moderate income households.

SUMMARY OF SITES TO MEET RHNA
The site inventory has the potential to meet projected housing needs for all income levels as
provided by the RHNA. A summary of the inventory in comparison with the RHNA is shown
in Table V-5. The City has the capacity to accommodate housing needs through the
following:
    • Currently approved projects to be completed within the 2014-2022 RHNA cycle;
    • A site inventory with total unit development potential above the RHNA target;
    • Sufficient sites zoned to accommodate lower income housing through “default
         densities” (Government Code Section 65583.2(c)).

ACTIONS REQUIRED/ZONING CHANGES
All of these areas already have zoning in place to achieve new residential development. In
order to improve the opportunities on existing residential sites, the following actions are
required.
1. Amend the Zoning Code To Offer Additional Incentives For Affordable Housing
And Transit Oriented Development
In areas near a transit hub, zoning code changes would be considered to:
     •   Provide incentives for affordable housing;
     •   Outside of Downtown, provide for reduced parking and increased height for
          development within one-third mile of a transportation hub or corridor;
     •   Provide incentives such as reduced parking requirement for efficiency units if all units
          are affordable;
     •   Amend the zoning code regulations to provide opportunities for live/work units and
          mixed use projects in areas outside of Downtown;
     •   Provide incentives for lot consolidation in areas where there are small
          underdeveloped lots and/or residential development design would benefit from
          larger lots;
     •   Provide multiple incentives, such as reduced parking requirements and increased
          height, for projects that propose units affordable to Extremely Low Income (ELI)
          households.
Community Resources and Opportunities                                                            Page 108

PUBLIC FACILITY CAPACITY
The city of Burlingame is almost built out and public facilities in place are adequate to serve
existing and proposed development. There are two public sewer projects which have been
completed in the last 20 years which have removed any constraints to new residential
development, particularly at the north end of the city. Many of the sites identified are
located in the northern portion of the city.
1. Sewer Treatment Plant Improvements
In 1994, major improvements were made to the city's wastewater treatment plant facilities.
As a result of these upgrades, the capacity of the plant was increased to accommodate the
ultimate population anticipated in the City's General Plan. According to estimates made by
the Association of Bay Area Governments, Burlingame's General Plan buildout would
accommodate an additional 1240 housing units above what is shown to exist in Burlingame
by Census 2010. Therefore, there is adequate capacity at the wastewater treatment to
handle the projected 863 units proposed.
2. Sewer Interceptor Project
In 1998, the Public Works Department completed a major sewer interceptor project which
included installation of new sewer collection main along California Drive from the city's north
boundary to the Wastewater Treatment Plant. This project improved the capacity of the
sewer collection system and provided sufficient capacity for development in the north end of
Burlingame, including all the sites selected north of Peninsula Hospital.
3. Water Supply
The City of Burlingame provides water service to properties within its boundaries as well as
to the unincorporated Burlingame Hills area adjacent to the west. The Burlingame Hills area
is a residential subdivision of 420 dwelling units which is entirely built out. The City's sole
source of potable water is the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) system,
which also supplies water to the City and County of San Francisco and other cities along the
Peninsula.
In May of 2011, the City of Burlingame adopted an Urban Water Management Plan in
accordance with State law requirements. The plan looks at the City's water needs and
anticipated supplies to accommodate current needs and future growth.
The Urban Water Management Plan uses the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
population projections as well as updated General Plan projections based on the adoption of
the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan and the Downtown Specific Plan to
anticipate the future water supply needs for the city of Burlingame and the unincorporated
Burlingame Hills. ABAG had projected that the population for Burlingame by 2030 will be
34,000 people. The Department of Finance indicates that as of January 1, 2013, the current
population of Burlingame is 29,426 people. ABAG projections anticipate an increase in
population of about 4500 people by 2030.
The Housing Element update plans for the potential addition of 863 housing units in
Burlingame by the year 2023. The 2010 Census indicates that the average household size in
Community Resources and Opportunities                                            Page 109
Burlingame is 2.29 people. Therefore, the 863 new housing units would accommodate a
population increase of about 2000 people by the year 2023. This is well within the scope of
the 4500 person increase in population projected by ABAG and used as a basis for the
Urban Water Management plan.
The city of Burlingame now uses about 4.8 million gallons of water per day (mgd). By 2019-
2020, the Urban Water Management Plan projects that Burlingame will use about 4.97 mgd
(a 4% increase). Burlingame has a guaranteed allotment of 5.24 mgd from the total supply
of the SFPUC system (300 mgd), which may be modified in the future. At the writing of this
document, there is an adequate supply of water available to accommodate the addition of
863 housing units within the next eight years. If there are any substantial changes to the
future water supply, the appropriate analysis will be completed.
The City of Burlingame provides waste water treatment for its residents and those in the
Burlingame Hills area as well as parts of neighboring Hillsborough. Burlingame has started
using recycled water for non-potable uses at its Waste Water Treatment Plant, and will be
building a water distribution system to use recycled water for irrigation at some of the City's
parks and other municipally owned landscaped areas. Larger commercial developments on
the east side of US 101 are required to extend water lines for non-potable irrigation water
to support their required landscaping. The Burlingame Municipal code requires that any new
landscape installation shall include water conservation measures, and this is implemented
by the Department of Public Works. Implementation of these measures will help reduce
future demand for water from the SFPUC system.
4. Housing Funding Opportunities
Because the city's population is less than 50,000, Burlingame does not receive Federal
housing assistance money (Block Grant/CDBG) directly. However, the City does have an
administrative agreement with San Mateo County, which is the recipient of the CDBG funds
for the unincorporated county and all the jurisdictions too small to receive Block Grant funds
directly.
Although the City of Burlingame does not offer assistance directly to first time homebuyers;
the City does participate with the County consortium in a Community Development Block
Grant program funded by the Federal Government, which provides some first time
homebuyer programs.
The San Mateo County Office of Housing and Community Development is the lead agency
for the Consortium. San Mateo County HOME Consortium receives federal block grants from
which they fund housing projects. The Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) is
one of the more active loan programs operating in the county. The participating cities, along
with the unincorporated area of the County compete for funding from this grant. The local
jurisdiction in which a project is funded, must match 25% of the Federal funds. Projects
seeking funding from the block grant must complete a request for proposal (RFP) that is
reviewed by the HOME Program Review Committee that formulates recommendations to the
Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors makes the final decision on which projects
are to be funded.
The other main program operating in the County is the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
(MCC). The MCC is a tax credit certificate that is issued by San Mateo County Department of
Housing and Community Development to eligible homebuyers. The certificate allows a tax
credit equal to 20 percent of the annual mortgage interest paid on a home loan, with the
Community Resources and Opportunities                                           Page 110
remaining 80 percent of the mortgage interest still eligible to be taken as an itemized
deduction. With this benefit, new homeowners may wish to adjust their Federal tax
withholdings, resulting in more spendable income each month. In order to qualify for this
program, applicant’s total gross household income cannot exceed $84,400 for a 1 or 2
person household, and $105,500 for a 3 or more person household, according to 2014
limits. The purchase price cannot exceed $673,616 for a newly constructed or existing
dwelling. Due to the high cost of housing in Burlingame, it may be difficult to find a property
that would meet the criteria for the above stated programs.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is promoting investments in priority
development areas through its four-year, $320 million OneBayArea Grant (OBAG) Program.
The OBAG funding distribution formula to county Congestion Management Agencies (CMA) is
based on factors such as population, past housing production, and future housing
commitments – the allocation for San Mateo County is about $26 million. The City/County
Association of Governments (C/CAG), the CMA for San Mateo County, programs OBAG funds
to projects that meet requirements in one of six transportation improvement categories:
Local streets and roads preservation; bicycle and pedestrian improvements; transportation
for livable communities; safe routes to school; priority conservation areas; and CMA
planning activities. Only jurisdictions with an adopted complete streets resolution or a
general plan that complies with the California Complete Streets Act of 2008 will be eligible
for OBAGs. Additionally, a jurisdiction must have a housing element certified by the
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
Human Investment Project for Housing (HIP) is a non-profit organization located in San
Mateo County that has programs to assist people with special needs, either from income or
circumstance, to live independent, self-sufficient lives in decent, safe, low cost housing. HIP
Housing’s Home Sharing program matches those who have space in their home with those
who need an affordable place to live, maximizing housing inventory and turning existing
housing stock into a new affordable housing option. It is the only program of its kind in San
Mateo County and provides a housing option for over 700 people each year. Over 90% of
those using the Home Sharing program are low to extremely low income.
There are several other grants and low interest loan opportunities that are available for
housing rehabilitation, construction, acquisition, retention, and preservation in the city of
Burlingame. Many of these funds are accessed through the County Office of Housing and
Community Development, like the HOME program described above. An example of some of
the other housing assistance programs include; CalHome Program, Emergency Solutions
Grant (ESG) Program, and Multifamily Housing Program (MHP).
ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
It is a requirement of every housing element to include a section on residential energy
conservation opportunities. Since the deregulation of energy companies in 1998, the price
of energy has increased substantially. With such an increase in prices, energy costs can be a
substantial portion of housing costs. Effective energy conservation measures built into or
added to existing housing can help residents manage their housing costs over time and
keep lower income households affordably housed. There are a number of programs offered
by the City of Burlingame, the local energy provider (PG&E) and the State of California,
which provide cost-effective energy saving programs.
Community Resources and Opportunities                                             Page 111

1. Energy Programs Offered by the City of Burlingame
Primary Programs
    •  All new residential and nonresidential construction in the city must abide by the
       State of California’s residential building standards for energy efficiency (Title 24 of
       the California Administrative Code). Title 24 Standards were established in 1978 to
       insure that all-new construction meets a minimum level of energy efficiency
       standards. Burlingame requires that new development must exceed Title 24 energy
       conservation requirements by fifteen percent.
    •  The City’s zoning ordinances do not discourage the installation of solar energy
       systems and other natural heating and cooling opportunities.
Secondary Programs
    •  The City of Burlingame enforces a tree preservation and reforestation ordinance. Part
       of the ordinance requires that when additions are made or new residences are built,
       property owners shall plant one (1) landscape tree for every 1,000 square feet of lot
       coverage or habitable space for single family homes or duplexes; and one (1)
       landscape tree for every 2,000 square feet of lot coverage for apartment houses and
       condominiums. New trees planted shall be 15 gallon to 24" box size, and shall not be
       fruit trees. In addition, the ordinance provides for the protection of the larger,
       existing trees in the city. With the proper siting of trees to allow sun exposure in the
       winter and shade in the summer, a homeowner can save up to 25% of a household’s
       energy consumption for heating and cooling. Computer models devised by the U.S.
       Department of Energy predict that the proper placement of only three trees will save
       an average household between $100 and $250 in energy costs annually.
    •  The Bay Area Air Quality Management District is encouraging cities to adopt an
       ordinance which would allow only pellet-fueled wood heaters, an EPA certified wood
       heater, or a fireplace certified by the EPA should the EPA develop a fireplace
       certification program for installation of any woodburning appliance. The use of
       properly regulated woodburning appliances would decrease the amount of natural
       gas and electricity required to heat homes in the city while preserving the region’s
       air quality.
    •  The City of Burlingame adopted an ordinance requiring the recycling and salvaging of
       construction and demolition materials. Enforcement of this ordinance reduces the
       amount of materials going to landfills and also conserve energy through the reuse
       and recycling of these materials. The Steel Recycling Institute reports that steel
       recycling, the number one recycled material in the U.S., saves enough energy to
       electrically power the equivalent of 18 million homes for a year.
2. Local Energy Supplier (PG&E)
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) supplies all of the electric and gas needs to
the residents of Burlingame. PG&E offers an assortment of programs that provide residents

VI. Housing Goals, Policies and Action Programs: 2015-2023
The Burlingame community and City Council have worked hard and achieved many of the
implementing action programs set out in the 2009-2014 Housing Element. In some cases
time and opportunity hindered the accomplishment of some programs. Over the past five
years circumstances facing the city and its residents have also changed. In this section the
focus is on the particular successes of the 2009-2014 Housing Element which should be
carried forward, the lessons to be learned from the action programs not achieved, and the
changing circumstances which will affect the city's housing opportunities and programs in
the coming planning period, as well as the goals and policies that the City of Burlingame
intends to implement to address the housing needs identified in the needs assessment
evaluation.
KEY PROGRAMMATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Burlingame's 2009-2014 Housing Element action program was divided by planning goals.
The premise was that the residents, Council and staff would work together identifying and
implementing action programs to create opportunity for more housing to assist in meeting
the City's share of California's housing need but also to assist those households with unique
housing needs. In Burlingame these households include persons with disabilities, the elderly
who live on lower or fixed incomes, single heads of households, and our service and public
employees. Because more than half the city's single family housing stock and
neighborhoods were built before 1940, maintenance and conservation of neighborhood
character was a leading issue during the planning period.
Burlingame’s 2009-2014 Housing Element action program contained a number of items that
have been accomplished. Among the programs implemented during the planning period
were:
    • Reasonable Accommodation for Accessibility: The zoning code was amended to
       include a Reasonable Accommodation for Accessibility procedure which establishes a
       process by which an individual with a disability may request modifications to
       development standards to install physical improvements (such as ramps, handrails,
       elevators or lifts) necessary to accommodate the disability.
    • Emergency Shelters: The zoning code was amended to permit emergency shelters
       by right within the northern part of the Rollins Road (RR) zoning district subject to
       performance standards. This area was identified as appropriate for emergency
       shelters because it is near services and transportation (close to the Millbrae
       BART/Caltrain Station)
    • Transitional and Supportive Housing: The zoning code was amended to include
       definitions for transitional and supportive housing as outlined in State law, and to
       specify that these uses are considered a residential use subject to the same
       restrictions as other residential uses of the same type in the same zone district.
    • Secondary Dwelling Units: The zoning code was amended to allow secondary
       dwelling units on certain lots within the R-1 zone district, subject to performance
       standards.
    • Downtown Specific Plan Zoning Implementation: In addition, the Downtown
       Specific Plan was adopted as well as all implementing ordinances. The zoning
       implementation actions for the Downtown Specific Plan which also implemented the
       Housing Element programs include the following:
            o Established a series of Mixed Use Zoning District in areas which were
               previously zoned exclusively for commercial uses. These districts would allow
Housing Goals, Policies and Action Program                                     Page 115

               both mixed use buildings which include residential uses as well as stand-alone
               multiple family residential uses.
            o  Established an R-4 Incentive District adjacent to the Downtown Commercial
               core which allows taller buildings to encourage multiple family residential
               development.
            o  Established reduced parking requirements for any multiple family residential
               use within the Downtown area west of California Drive.
            o  Established a maximum average dwelling unit size throughout the downtown
               area to encourage smaller, more affordable units.
In addition, the City continued to implement the following programs that were established in
previous housing elements:
    • Single family residential design review which places an emphasis on structural and
        neighborhood conservation and maintenance;
    • Second Unit Amnesty which encourages the retention and maintenance as lower cost
        housing of second units built before 1954 on single family lots;
    • An active code enforcement program to manage property maintenance issues and
        broker tenant/owner disputes;
    • Participated in and funded the City’s proportional share of a new north San Mateo
        County homeless shelter for single adults;
    • A day center and emergency shelters at local churches to participate in an ongoing
        program of emergency housing and support assistance for homeless families have
        continued to successfully operate in the community;
    • Continued to promote and enforce urban reforestation and exterior illumination
        regulations which support local goals for energy conservation.
Building on these programs, over the planning period the City added 77 dwelling units and
rehabilitated 216 dwelling units. The City laid more ground work for adding opportunities for
new housing and maintaining the city's residential quality and supporting affordable housing
than with any other Housing Element implementation program. The 2015-2023 Housing
Element will build on and expand on this legislative base and implementation experience.
LESSONS FROM THE 2009-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
The City has learned from the variety of experiences implementing the 2009-2014 Housing
Element. The proposed 2015-2023 Housing Element work program is based on the current
Housing Element’s successes and reality checks. The City has been successful with
legislation which provides incentives for private developers to change land use from
commercial to residential using multiple family overlay zones and residential mixed use
zones on commercial properties, both of which allow standalone multiple family
development, as well as with incentives to single family homeowners to maintain their
properties, retain older second units and in some cases add second units. Without a
redevelopment agency or direct government entitlement funds, it became apparent that
City staff must work at being informed and build a bridge of information and program
linkage between developers and available assistance. Moreover, as the regulatory programs
outside the City's control multiply and discourage new residential development by increasing
its cost, City staff must be trained to facilitate and communicate. The 2015-2023 Housing
Element work program is built on these lessons. The City's mandate is to facilitate
development which implements the City's planning goals and policies and to maintain the
City's services and facilities to meet the standards of regulatory agencies and residents
needs so that new residential development can be accommodated. The private sector's
mandate is to build new residential units within the established goals and policies. The
Housing Element will provide the link to form a partnership.

The types of programs proposed in the 2015-2023 Housing Element which should succeed
because they build on the success and experience of the 2009-2014 Housing Element are:
   • Continue rehabilitation through code enforcement;
   • Allow fee waivers for affordable rehabilitation;
   • Continuation of Second Unit Amnesty program coupled with participation in county
       housing rental rehabilitation programs;
   • Facilitate creation of new second units that meet the criteria outlined in the zoning
       code;
   • Residential and neighborhood maintenance through residential design review;
   • Expand zoning incentives for transit oriented development with inclusion of
       affordable units to include the Priority Development Area along the El Camino Real
       and California Drive corridors as well as areas within 1/3 mile of the city's three
       transit hubs;
   • Continue to maintain partnerships with a local non-profit organizations to insure
       existing and new residential units stay affordable;
   • Build on successful partnerships with non-profit providers and provide more
       regulatory incentives to encourage housing assistance for senior citizens including
       assistance in modifying existing housing for the elderly and disabled;
   • Continue to promote housing in areas which have been zoned for mixed use;
   • Reduce greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable building practices;
   • Establish a policy to maintain zero net-loss of housing units when new development
       is proposed; and,
   • Implement an outreach program for persons with disabilities;
   • Continue to provide incentives for developers to include affordable units in new
       residential projects;
   • Consider adoption of a commercial impact in-lieu fee that would require developers
       of employment-generating commercial and industrial developments to contribute to
       the supply of low- and moderate-income housing through the provision of
       commercial in-lieu fees as prescribed in a nexus impact fee study;
   • Consider adoption of a residential in-lieu fee as an alternative to providing affordable
       units on site.
These policies are outlined in more detail in the following Goals, Policies and
Implementation Programs, which outlines the specific programs, five year objectives,
funding sources, responsible agencies and time frames for implementation.

QUANTIFIED SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES
As required by Section 65583 of the California Government Code, the goals, policies, and
actions in this chapter seek to meet quantified housing objectives. Table VI-2 summarizes
these findings, which result in a total estimated capacity of 1,066 housing units. Most of
these units will be produced through new construction. Although the City expects to
rehabilitate homes, some of these upgrades may not meet the definition of “substantial
rehabilitation” as required under Section 65583. Planning staff consulted with the Building
Official and Code Enforcement Officer and determined that no units within the city have
been found to be unfit for human habitation.

addressing the housing needs of this population in the housing element. Although ELI need was not calculated by
ABAG, HCD allows the City to assume that approximately half of the very-low income households qualify as ELI.

applications would be approved based on past performance.

APPENDIX A – WORKSHOP SUMMARIES
1. Outreach Summary: Workshop #1
The City of Burlingame hosted Workshop #1 of the Housing Element Update on March 18,
2014. The meeting convened at the Burlingame Recreation Center at 7:00 pm. The fifteen
people in attendance were introduced to the Housing Element Update project. The workshop
was structured as an informational session that highlighted the findings of the Housing
Needs Assessment and covered demographics, housing needs, Burlingame’s existing
housing stock, housing affordability and the Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) target
for the City. Attendees were informed about the importance of the Housing Element being
certified by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and
the necessary steps to adopt a certified Housing Element by the January 31, 2015 deadline.
City staff answered questions that arose during the presentation and during the comments
session after the presentation.
City staff fielded questions about several housing element requirements. Several questions
related to the consequences of failing to certify a Housing Element and how smaller
communities would be able to meet their RHNA. Although the presentation touched on the
consequences of an uncertified Housing Element, City staff and the consultant expanded
upon the legal challenges that would arise from noncompliance. Further, the RHNA
numbers and the role of HCD and ABAG were discussed to clarify why the City needs to plan
for its share of the regional housing needs allocation.
There were a number of inquiries regarding the process for identifying potential housing
sites. Attendees asked whether existing single-family homes would be replaced with
multifamily units, but staff replied that it was not recommending any changes to zoning
designations. The opportunity sites analysis typically focuses on determining sites with
development potential – these sites may be vacant, underused or have a potential for
reuse, but in Burlingame do not require rezoning. An audience member expressed support
for mixed use developments and felt a need for more development featuring residential
units over ground-floor shops. City staff explained that mixed use development is indeed
promoted in Burlingame, particularly in the Downtown and North Burlingame areas.
The rising cost of housing in Burlingame is a concern for residents. As stated by one of the
attendees, there is increasing pressure that is driving up rents in the rental market. Those
who can afford rents in Burlingame are concerned with rents rising beyond what they can
afford. Others who want to be part of the community, who are working in the city but have
lower incomes, will continue to be excluded as a result of chronically high housing costs.
High rents can also force larger households into smaller apartments.
Attendees asked whether developers would be interested in building smaller units. City staff
responded that there is a market for smaller units, as evidenced by a few projects in the
Downtown that feature smaller units to comply with unit size regulations in the Downtown
Specific Plan. Several projects featuring smaller units are under review as well. A member
of the audience who works in affordable housing development confirmed that there is
indeed interest among developers. Developers may look to develop affordable housing
Appendix A                                                                     Page A1

projects but the project must be financially sound. Developing more units at smaller sizes is
one method to create a more financially viable project. There is interest in smaller units
among buyers, which makes is viable for developers to build units that cater to this market.
In responding to questions about tools that the City may use to promote the development of
more affordable units, City staff raised the idea of fee generation through a variety of
mechanisms. A nexus study is being prepared to determine the link between new
development and the cost of housing. Other programs that are also being considered
include linkage fees and impacts.
The meeting concluded with an invitation to attend the next community meeting to discuss
opportunity sites.
2. Outreach Summary: Workshop #2
The City of Burlingame hosted Workshop #2
of the Housing Element Update on May 20,
2014. The meeting convened at the
Burlingame Recreation Center at 7:00 pm.
Twelve people who were in attendance
listened to the presentation of potential
housing      opportunity     sites,    program
accomplishments and strategic approaches in
developing housing programs. The workshop
was structured as an informational session
that encouraged audience members to ask
questions and make comments about sites
and programs.
City staff explained that many sites were carried over from the existing site inventory in the
adopted Housing Element. Maps of these sites, as well as newly proposed sites, were shown
to residents on maps in a PowerPoint presentation. The new sites were highlighted in colors
that distinguished them from the previously identified sites to show the relative locations of
all housing opportunity sites that are proposed for the 2015-2023 Housing Element. The
majority of sites were concentrated in North Burlingame and Downtown Burlingame.
Sites
After City staff went through these sites, attendees asked a few questions about specific
sites that were included and wondered whether other sites could be included:
     •  Peninsula Hospital area:
        Located in North Burlingame, this area could accommodate new housing in the City.
        An audience member stated that the area around Peninsula Hospital used to be
        affordable to seniors but is now too expensive. She wondered whether there was a
        way to make housing affordable to keep people in their homes. Staff replied that new
        development at the site would be required to meet the City’s affordability
        requirements, but that plans are only conceptual at this point.
     •  North Burlingame area, office buildings:
        One attendee believes that some of the sites in the North Burlingame area seem to
        be neglected in terms of new development. Staff noted that there are a number of
Appendix A                                                                      Page A2

        individual property owners in the area, which makes it difficult to consolidate parcels
        and gain efficiencies of scale with larger parcels. Older office buildings are still being
        rented out, and many long-term property owners do not want to put their properties
        on the market.
    •   East Burlingame/ Burlingame Bayfront:
        The movie theater site was not included in the housing opportunity sites inventory,
        but was a location that an audience thought might warrant some consideration. Staff
        stated that the zoning would need to be changed in order to accommodate housing,
        and that the current update was not focusing on zoning changes. However the City’s
        upcoming General Plan update will provide an opportunity to reconsider land uses
        and would provide a better venue for considering changes to sites that the
        community thinks would be better utilized, including the Bayfront area. In terms of
        physical constraints, the lack of services near the site to support housing
        development is an existing challenge and will require more planning and investment
        if it were to become a residential location.
    •   Burlingame Plaza:
        A question arose about changes to Burlingame Plaza. Zoning allows changes to
        Burlingame Plaza but owners are pursuing a remodel instead. The shopping center is
        split into multiple parcels, so it is difficult to coordinate a project.
    •   Other:
        One attendee was interested in assisted living projects that may be developed. A
        Sunrise Senior Living assisted living project has resumed construction in North
        Burlingame after being dormant for several years. There is also an application under
        review for an additional assisted living project on a nearby site.
Affordable Housing
City staff and attendees discussed opportunities
for    affordable     housing    development         in
Burlingame. Affordable housing is often located
near amenities such as transit, senior centers,
and parks. Burlingame’s BART and Caltrain
stations can provide housing units with great
access to public transportation. Sites with the
potential     to   support    affordable      housing
development are ones that meet eligibility for
State and Federal funding, with transit
proximity as a common requirement.
Second Units
Questions and interest about second units were discussed, including the definition of second
units, restrictions and applicability towards the RHNA. In brief, City staff stated that second
units count towards the RHNA and are defined as independent dwelling units occupying the
same lot as a primary unit. There are provisions in the zoning code which allow new second
units on certain lots in Burlingame, subject to performance standards to make sure the units
are compatible with the neighborhood.
Organizations
Attendees and City staff had conversations about organizations that can help the City and
residents in the provision of affordable housing options for all residents.
Appendix A                                                                        Page A3

    •  Neighborhood Housing Services of Silicon Valley is an affordable housing resource
       It manages Burlingame’s affordable housing programs, however the number of
       affordable housing units in Burlingame is still relatively small.
    •  Human Investment Program opportunities
       Human Investment Program (HIP) connects people to affordable housing options,
       including a homesharing program linking people in need of housing with people who
       have space in their homes. The homesharing program is mentioned in the Housing
       Element and the City will continue to monitor the affordable housing alternatives
       managed by HIP. While home sharing is not counted towards RHNA targets, it
       provides a valuable option for meeting housing needs of the community.
    •  Center for Independence of Individuals with Disabilities as an additional local
       resource
       City staff has conducted outreach with the Golden Gate Regional Center, which
       provides services to persons with disabilities in the region encompassing San Mateo,
       San Francisco, and Marin counties. In expanding outreach to persons with
       disabilities, staff will also reach out to other local resources including the services
       provided by the Center for Independence.
The meeting concluded with an invitation to attend the Planning Commission meeting to
discuss the public review draft of the Housing Element.

           Dear Ms. Goldman:
           RE:      City of Burlingame's 5th Cycle (2015-2023) Adopted Housing Element
           Thank you for submitting Burlingame's housing element adopted January 5, 2015
           which was received for review on January 12, 2015. Pursuant to Government Code
           (GC) Section 65585(h), the Department is reporting the results of its review.
           The Department is pleased to find the adopted housing element in full compliance
           with State housing element law (GC, Article 10.6). The Department's review found
           the adopted housing element to be substantially the same as the revised draft element
           the Department's November 25, 2014 review determined met statutory requirements.
           Please note, the City of Burlingame now meets specific requirements for several State
           funding programs designed to reward local governments for compliance with State
           housing element law. For example, the Housing Related Parks (HRP) Program,
           funded by Proposition 1C, provides grant funds to eligible local governments for every
           qualifying lower income unit permitted since 2010. The HRP Program 2014 Notice of

                                                                              CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                                    INTRODUCTION
The California State Planning Law now requires the general plan of each city and county to
include a Conservation Element. Section 65302(d) of the Government Code defines the
Conservation Element in these terms:
(d)      A Conservation Element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural
resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors,
fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources. That portion of the conservation
element including waters shall be developed in coordination with any countywide water agency
and with all district and city agencies which have developed, served, controlled or conserved
water for any purpose for the county or city for which the plan is prepared. The conservation
element may also cover:
         1.        The reclamation of land and waters;
         2.        Flood control;
         3.        Prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other waters;
         4.        Regulation of the use of land in stream channels and other areas required for the
                   accomplishment of the conservation plan;
         5.        Prevention, control, and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches, and shores;
         6.        Protection of watersheds; and
         7.        The location, quantity and quality of the rock, sand and gravel resources.
Burlingame, in the main, is a "developed" community. However, there are important natural
resources within and adjacent to its boundaries and the City needs to develop and implement
programs that encompass the conservation of both the "built environment" and these natural
resources.
The City gave general recognition to conservation needs in adopting the General Plan in 1969.
The City General Plan now includes policy statements related to conservation. These are in three
categories: (1), General Goals intended to reflect basic aims of the majority of citizens; (2),
Community Development Goals identifying the general course of "development" needed in the
City to satisfy the basic aims embodied in the General Goals; and (3), Implementing Objectives
linking broad categories of action to the Community Development Goals.
The policy statements from the General Plan most directly related to conservation are cited
below. These statements provide the point of departure for the Conservation Element which will
further define conservation policy and provide a framework for conservation activities needed to
protect and enhance the quality of life in Burlingame.
City of Burlingame                                 C-2                                        General Plan
                                                                               CONSERVATION ELEMENT
General Goals:
                  Educational, cultural, and aesthetic advancement.
                  Improvement of the physical environment, facilities, and services for living.
Community Development Goals:
                  To maintain and improve the quality of the environment to preserve the public
                   health and enhance the prospects for enjoyment by residents and visitors.(Goal
                   IV; see PP-5)
Implementing Objectives:
                  Insure levels of air quality compatible with the preservation of public health,
                   including prevention of irritation to the senses, interference with visibility, and
                   damage to vegetation.(Goal IV a)
                  Maintain and improve the quality of water in San Francisco Bay and in the
                   streams flowing through the City.(Goal IV b)
                  Maintain the pleasant appearance prevailing in most of the City's residential areas
                   and improve the visual quality in areas of less satisfactory appearance.(Goal IVc;)
                  Improve the visual quality of commercial and industrial areas with particular
                   attention to the Central Business District, Broadway, and the industrial areas
                   viewed from major highways.(Goal IVd)
                  Protect the citizens of the community against excessive noise.(Goal IVe)
In addition to these general policy statements, more specific policies and proposals for
conservation in the waterfront area are included in the Waterfront Element.
In the Conservation Element, issues are discussed and suggestions for dealing with associated
problems are advanced. This document is a beginning point in a program to provide solutions to
the many environmental problems faced today. To assist the City in ongoing conservation
education and action programs Appendix I provides a directory of public agency sources of
technical information or advice; Appendix II is a selection of reference material; Appendix III
gives sources of data on the physical characteristics of the planning area; Appendix IV presents a
summary description of sub-areas within the Burlingame Planning Area. These Appendixes are
available under the heading of Conservation Element in the Appendix to the Burlingame General
Plan document. These Appendices are available under the Heading of Conservation Element in
the Appendix to the Burlingame General Plan document.
THE CONSERVATION ELEMENT AS PART OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The Conservation Element is intended to be supplementary to previously adopted General Plan
elements. The Conservation Element includes three divisions: Division I - Concepts and
Definitions; Division II - Objectives and Principles; and Division III - Program. The
Conservation Element, when adopted, will become part of Part II of the General Plan.
City of Burlingame                                  C-3                                         General Plan

                                                                           CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                    CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS
Conservation in Burlingame is concerned not only with the natural environment (where the
forces of nature and the natural processes are dominant) but also with the built environment
(areas where nature is modified by man through design and construction for visual and
functional effects to serve and please human users). The built environment is characterized by
buildings and other structures and the sites upon which they sit; streets; parking areas, gardens
and parks (other than natural preserves). This element, therefore, defines conservation policy
and provides a programmatic framework for the conservation and utilization of natural resources,
and for protecting and enhancing the aesthetic qualities and usefulness of the built environment.
If the qualities of the natural and built areas of Burlingame are to be maintained or enhanced,
citizens must be aware of the existing problems and issues both of local and regional nature.
Many urban environmental problems in Burlingame can be successfully dealt with locally, but
some broader environmental concerns, e.g. air, noise, and water pollution, require
interjurisdictional cooperation on an area-wide or regional level. In addition, some concerns
may require cooperative efforts between the City and public and private agencies at the State or
even national levels.
Conservation in Burlingame has three basic aspects. First is an understanding of the natural site
on which the City has been built-- the hillsides, canyons, streams, and the marshes and the Bay--
all of which have been altered through the years as roads and railways were laid out, woodlands
cleared, marshes and Bay filled, and houses, stores and factories built to form the City as it now
is. Second is a respect for the City itself as a functioning whole-- the homes, streets, market
places and meeting places, businesses and industries that are the setting for human activities.
And third is an awareness of the dynamic impact of natural forces that continue to affect the
City-- the rains, wind, erosion and floodings, and tides and currents in the Bay; the growth (and
sometimes decline) of street trees, gardens, park landscaping; the impact on wildlife habitat, of
changes in woods, backyards, tidelands, the Bay and its shores.
CONSERVATION ETHIC
Not only in Burlingame but throughout most other urban areas, conservation begins with
awareness and understanding. Man is involved in the ecological continuum (natural and man-
made) of which he is a part. Apathy (or perhaps a sense of helplessness) in the face of
environmental degradation is showing signs of dissolving, and is being replaced with a growing
ecological consciousness. A part of this is an awareness that man not only must have a sound
natural environment, but also a sheltering city which meets his cultural needs. A conservation
"ethic", then, is concerned with both. It derives from a special feeling for the earth, the
ecosystem, and all living things. It includes recognition of the value and role of our built
environment and the useful things within it. The City should foster the conservation ethic
through communication, cooperation, education, and action.

                                                                               CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                       OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY
                               RECOMMENDATIONS
The objectives and action principles following provide essential general policy for a systematic
approach to conservation of natural resources and city values in Burlingame.
OBJECTIVES
         C(A): To initiate, develop, and implement programs for the conservation of natural
                   resources giving particular attention to critical resource conditions.
         C(B): To prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and stimulate the health and
                   welfare of the citizens of Burlingame.
         C(C): To restore, where found to be feasible, natural features of vegetative cover,
                   streams, marsh and bay where areas have been unduly disturbed by man.
         C(D): To initiate, develop, and implement programs for the conservation of the built
                   environment.
         C(E): To foster public educational programs on local conservation needs.
         C(F): To participate in regional conservation programs of direct concern to the City.
         C(G): To promote economic growth which is consistent with an improvement in the
                   quality of the environment.
ACTIONS
         C(1): The City should act to protect valuable vegetative cover and encourage planting
                   additional vegetation, giving preference to indigenous materials.
         C(2): The City should initiate a study by the Planning Commission of the remaining
                   natural areas to determine the effect of development on or near these areas.
         C(3): Because projects being developed outside the corporate limits can adversely
                   affect the City environment, Burlingame should monitor all major developments
                   through the EIR process and other procedures.
         C(4): The City should protect the creeks flowing through private and public lands by
                   regulation and acquisition of conservation easements where found to be
                   necessary.

                                                                               CONSERVATION ELEMENT
         C(5): The City should acquire development rights where found to be necessary to
                   protect areas that are of outstanding value in their natural condition.
         C(6): To protect existing urban areas and structures from deterioration, Burlingame
                   should insure that private places are properly maintained.
         C(7): In order to develop a stronger conservation awareness in the people of
                   Burlingame, the City should help to develop conservation education programs in
                   the schools and in the community.
         C(8): To develop an exchange of information, the City should maintain communication
                   with conservation groups and conservation agencies in areas of direct concern to
                   the City.

                                         PROGRAM
GENERAL EXPLANATION
The comprehensive conservation program deals with the two basic environments found within
Burlingame-- the built and the natural. Although the state law identifies conservation with the
natural resources, it is necessary that the City consider, in addition, the conservation of some
particular sections of the City where remedial actions are needed. For this program, natural
resources as defined in the Government Code (Section 65302(d)) are grouped in the following
categories: water; vegetation; soils and geology; wildlife; and air.
For the "built" environment, areas of the City are treated in three broad categories: stable urban
areas, in which relatively little adverse change is anticipated; special urban conservation areas,
requiring remedial action; and areas of change where redevelopment and new development could
adversely affect the natural resources.
Carrying out the conservation program requires a wide range of public and private actions,
including: government regulation; acquisition in fee or lesser interest; technical advice;
education; incentives; and remedial work programs, public and private.
Charts I and II identify the interrelation of the components of the conservation program. These
charts provide a frame work for review and evaluation of the public and private actions needed
to achieve conservation objectives. Such review by City staff, officials and citizens can become
an important part of an on-going conservation action program. (See Charts following.)

                                                                            CONSERVATION ELEMENT
CONSERVATION PROGRAM ACTION COMPONENTS
Government Regulation. The natural resources important to Burlingame can be conserved in
large part through adequate control of new and existing development by suitable regulation-
applied by the City under its powers to enact laws which are in the public interest and which are
directly related to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Such regulation can
be in the form of zoning; architectural and site plan review; subdivision regulation; grading and
site development regulations; and other measures to protect creeks and bay, require careful siting
of development around the canyons, provide control over use of natural hazard areas, other
unstable areas and flood plains. The zoning ordinance can include height, bulk, and usable open
space regulations for conservation of the "built" environment.
Action: Review existing regulations in relation to conservation needs and prepare revised or new
regulations as required.
Acquisition. There are cases where private development and use will not be compatible with
resource conservation nor will regulation be adequate for achieving conservation objectives. In
these situations public acquisition will be needed. This can be either full fee title, or acquisition
of easement or other limited rights as necessary for the purpose to be secured. The rights
acquired should be consistent with the conservation purpose. Acquisition can be by gift,
dedication required as a condition of a permit, negotiated purchase, or purchase under eminent
domain.
Action: Prepare acquisition program based on Open Space Element and other relevant
information.
Technical Advice. Additional technical information and advice on natural processes is needed
for an on-going conservation program, and should be so catalogued and organized that it can be
made available and useful, not only to City staff and officials, but to the public as well.
Information on services available and sources of professional advice including county, state and
federal agencies, professional societies, conservation groups and appropriate local professionals
(e.g. landscape architects, architects, geologists, biologists, hydrologists) should be made
available at the Burlingame City Library and through public schools within the City, and at the
high schools and the community colleges. Through the Burlingame City Library the Bay Area
Reference Services can provide access to information sources not available locally.
Education. The primary role of the City in conservation education is to provide information
about its own programs and its background studies of the Burlingame setting. This information
should be made available through the Burlingame library system as well as through the City
Planning Department. Although new conservation related curricula are now being developed at
every grade level in the school systems, public and private, high school adult education and
community colleges, the need for more specific information on local ecosystems warrant setting
up effective channels of information. Important participants in community actions to further the
conservation goals and encourage private initiative and cooperation are the civic and
conservation organizations concerned with the quality of the City environment. Improved
channels of communication will encourage citizen participation. The City, too, could benefit
from an exchange of information in order to take advantage of the valuable body of local

information being developed by these organizations--on City history, archeology, historic
buildings and sites, birds and other wildlife, horticulture and the like.
Incentives. For effective conservation of natural resources and the "built" environment a
program of public incentives may be needed. Tax relief or other financial incentives could be
used for the conservation of urban areas, specific buildings and natural areas. Although such
incentives would require State and Federal legislation, the City could adopt policy in favor of
such incentives. Other incentives might be in the form of allowing modification of regulations,
conditioned on specific conservation measures to be taken by the property owner or developer,
or agreements by owners on maintenance of historic structures or sites.
Remedial Work Programs. Remedial work programs directed at specific conservation problem
areas can prevent further irreversible damage to the environment. The most urgent of such
programs are rehabilitation of the creek systems; measures to halt and repair erosion in the hills
area; and corrective work (together with more stringent regulations on development and
conversion projects) to insure compatible development along the bayshore line.
CONSERVATION PROGRAM
The conservation program is organized under two major headings, "Natural Environment" and
"Built Environment" with sub-headings for the natural resource and urban conservation
categories previously identified.
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
In this element of the plan natural resources are treated under the broad categories of water,
vegetation, soils and geology, wildlife, and air. And, in turn, each category is considered in terms
of conservation, development and utilization. The many physical impacts of our urban
technological society interact to create conditions detrimental to the natural environment. Chart
I, for reviewing and evaluating natural resource problems, is intended to help identify specific
harmful frictions at the urban-natural resource interface and suggest at the same time possible
avenues of corrective action.
Water
The Bay
Issues:            The Bay and its shores comprise a resource of the greatest importance to the
                   region, State and Nation. Conservation of this magnificent resource presents a
                   wide range of issues. The status of tide and submerged lands granted to private
                   owners in the late 1800's by the State presents a major problem. A portion of the
                   tide and submerged lands within the corporate limits of Burlingame is held by the
                   City of San Francisco as a part of the airport property. In addition, 530 acres of
                   tide and submerged lands are claimed by Ideal Cement Company, the largest
                   single expanse of vacant "land" in Burlingame (title to this area is now in
                   litigation). These problems and issues and others related to the Bay and its shores

                                                                              CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                   are described in the report "Burlingame 1968: Background for the General Plan."
                    The City has shared jurisdiction with the Bay Conservation and Development
                   Commission (BCDC), other State agencies and Federal agencies including the
                   Corps of Engineers. Conservation of the waters of the bay is very much an
                   interjurisdictional matter. The City has zoning authority and can exercise control
                   over uses and structures in addition to control by BCDC.
Program:           Continue to exercise zoning control through T-P zoning.
         -         Review the T-P regulations and impose new requirements if needed.
         -         Initiate a program of continuing education.
         -         Continue to cooperate with regional, State and Federal agencies on matters of
                   mutual interest.
         -         Formulate a specific plan for this portion of the Bay and its shores working with
                   BCDC to insure a mutually acceptable plan.
Creek System
Issues:            Seven creeks flow through the City to the Bay. Of the total length of the creeks,
                   only a small portion remains in a state approximating natural conditions. The
                   remaining length has either been rechanneled, concreted, under grounded, or
                   otherwise modified. A large portion is privately owned. Above Burlingame and
                   within the City of Hillsborough and unincorporated Burlingame Hills are canyons
                   from which originate Sanchez Creek and Burlingame Creek. Terrace and Ralston
                   Creeks have their headwaters in the same vicinity. "Continued development of
                   areas within the City and in Hillsborough will tend to increase the flooding
                   potential unless corrective measures are undertaken." 1 South of Hoover
                   School/Shinnyo-en Temple and situated in Hillsborough is a reservoir formed by
                   an earth fill dam on a branch of Sanchez Creek. The operation of this reservoir is
                   of concern to Burlingame since it affects downstream flow. Although there have
                   been no reports of problems, structural safety of the dam is a matter of interest.
Program:           Retain present natural sections of the creek system in a natural condition.
         -         Inform the public of the part the creeks play in the ecosystem to instill an
                   understanding (therefore, respect) of the creek systems.
         -         Study soil stability, vegetation and bank conditions along the creeks and regulate
                   appropriately.

                                                                               CONSERVATION ELEMENT
         -         Improper development along the headwaters of these creeks can cause problems
                   in Burlingame from excessive run-off, erosion, and siltation; therefore, to monitor
                   upstream conditions protect downstream reaches.
         -         Request, from any agency with jurisdiction in the headwaters of these creeks,
                   environmental impact reports on any and all projects which could affect the
                   streams.
         -         Review any inspection reports on the dam on Sanchez Creek and monitor any
                   development that could cause excessive run-off into the impounding area.
Water Quality
Issues:            Grading and building of structures such as walls and revetments, or removal of
                   vegetation along creeks from steep lands can cause erosion and the siltation of the
                   creeks and also of the Bay. Storm water run-off contributes to pollution because
                   of "non-point" sources. Burlingame made a major advance in wastewater
                   treatment through construction of a full secondary and partial tertiary treatment
                   system complete in 1969. The Bay now receives discharge from Burlingame's
                   wastewater treatment plant through a 50 foot outfall after full secondary and
                   partial tertiary treatment.
Program:           Restrict any further disturbances along the creeks.
         -         Extend a sewer outfall to the deep waters of the Bay, preferably through
                   cooperative action with other jurisdictions, if federal grants are received.
         -         Prohibit any discharge into Bay waters from any manufacturing or retail
                   enterprise without proper treatment of the discharge.
         -         Study feasibility of controlling pollution from storm drainage and other "non-
                   point" sources.
         -         Cooperate with regional agencies with responsibility for maintaining water
                   quality.
Vegetation
Vegetative cover, in addition to contributing to the beauty of the area, helps to maintain the
quality of watershed lands, aids in erosion control, and is an important element of the wildlife
habitat. In addition, it helps maintain air quality through re-oxygenation, and reduces noise
impact.
Issues:            The tall eucalyptus (E. globulus) that line El Camino Real and border the railroad
                   have long been a dominant feature of Burlingame landscape. But throughout
                   much of the City other street trees and public plantings provide green canopies

                                                                               CONSERVATION ELEMENT
                   that shade sidewalks, act as wind breaks, and contribute to the public health and
                   pleasure.
Program:           Continue maintenance program and replacement program for street trees lost
                   through aging and damage.
         -         Periodically review planting lists for street trees, and modify to more fully relate
                   to conservation objectives.
Hillside Vegetation
Issues:            The land around Mills Canyon was subdivided from 1951 to 1960, and only a few
                   of the parcels remain undeveloped. Because of their large size, many parcels
                   neighboring Mills Canyon Park are of the same wooded character as the Park.
                   Other areas of like character with extensive native vegetation are the Easton
                   Creek/Canyon Road area, and the Canyon above Hoover School.
Program:           Maintain the character of the areas and protect the vegetation.
         -         Inform the people owning property, in these areas, of the importance of
                   maintaining ground cover and native vegetation.
City Parks and School Grounds
Issues: Washington Park in the center of the City offers green spot for the inhabitants. Other
                   parks likewise contribute to health and amenity. The existing trees and shrubs are
                   a habitat for birds, squirrels and other small animals. The High School site is
                   devoid of significant vegetation as are most of the older elementary school sites.
Program:           Carry on the program of good maintenance of vegetation on all City parks.
         -         Encourage a program of landscaping on the High School and other school sites
                   using trees of suitable size and character.
Wildlife
Shell Fish
Issues:            The waters of San Francisco Bay off Burlingame were known at one time for their
                   abundance of edible shell fish which supported a large fishery. Pollution of the
                   Bay continuing over many years all but destroyed this valuable resource.
                   However, wastewater treatment has improved in recent years and there are
                   indications that there has been a resurgence of some species of marine life.
Program:           (See program under Water Quality heading)
Shore Birds

                                                                               CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Issues:            The bayshore is the habitat for shore birds attracted there because of other aquatic
                   life and vegetation. Disturbances to their food supply, in the form of water
                   pollution and destruction of mudflats, have diminished the bird population of the
                   area. Water fowl are an integral part of the ecological system. They also add
                   interest and visual enjoyment.
Program:           Maintain an appropriate environment for this wildlife by providing a sanctuary
                   along the bayshore. Mudflats, marshland, and clean water are essential
                   ingredients of this environment.
         -         Regulate development and the discharge of pollutants along the bayshore.
Hillside Wildlife
Issues:            The Mills Canyon area is the habitat for rabbits, squirrels, quail and other birds,
                   insects, and an occasional deer. The same holds true of other wooded or brush
                   covered hillside areas large enough to support and protect such wildlife.
Program:           Protect the quantity of vegetation on the hillside by regulating development on
                   adjoining lots.
         -         Inform residents of the relationship between vegetation and wildlife.
         -         Encourage the planting and maintaining of vegetative types that improve the
                   wildlife habitat.
Soils and Geology
Erosion
Issues:            Some of the most frequent causes of erosion are grading, road cuts, destruction of
                   vegetative cover and accelerated rainwater run-off from structures and paved
                   areas. Erosion results in loss of valuable top soil, and in subsequent pollution and
                   siltation of creeks and Bay.
Program:           Identify and correct erosion problems on City-owned lands.
         -         Develop erosion control programs and incorporate in regulations.
         -         Inform the public of the causes and effects of erosion and suitable corrective
                   measures.
         -         Regulate new development to reduce erosion problems.

Air
Air Quality
Issues:            Although maintaining air quality is primarily a regional and state matter, there are
                   local sources and practices not presently regulated. Vegetation in the City
                   regenerates the air supplies with oxygen.
Program:           Support agencies working for air quality.
         -         Encourage the maintaining or increasing of the vegetative supply on private lands.
                   Insure that all public lands are well planted wherever possible.
         -         Encourage use of public transit as an alternative to the private auto.
         -         Support programs to reduce wasteful use of energy sources contributing to air
                   pollution.
BUILT ENVIRONMENT (see Built Environment Diagram)
The concern for the built environment focuses particularly on two kinds of areas in transition.
First are those built up sections of the City where changes are occurring accompanied by signs of
decline or increased intensity of use. These are older areas where many structures are obso-
lescent or deteriorating and where residents have grown older and the structures no longer fit the
particular needs of the present occupants. (These are identified as "Special Urban Conservation
Areas.") Second are the areas, now largely vacant or occupied by low intensity uses, where
added development is imminent and of such potential magnitude and intensity that changes could
significantly affect natural resources. (These are identified as "Areas of Change.") In addition
are the areas in good physical condition where reasonably adequate conservation measures are
now being taken by property owners and the City. (These are identified as "Stable Urban
Areas.")
Stable Urban Areas
Stable Urban Areas: 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22, 26-38.
Characteristics:           These are areas where the quality of development is good, and the level of
                           maintenance is adequate. There is either a single type of land use or a
                           compatible mixture of uses. The scale of development is human and
                           intimate. In the main, urban services are adequate and community
                           facilities near at hand.

Program:           Maintain present land use pattern.
         -         Insure that urban services meet the demands.
         -         Develop a maintenance code for all private properties to eliminate fire hazards
                   and to improve appearance and public safety.
         -         Determine the capacity of the urban services and the probable maximum use as
                   set by zoning.
         -         Determine possible future problems and identify actions needed to ameliorate
                   contributing conditions.
         -         Monitor the needs of the areas and develop programs accordingly.
Special Urban Conservation Areas
Areas of mixed residential use: 11, 14, 18, 23, 24.
Characteristics:           These areas of mixed residential use, needing some remedial action, have
                           over the years suffered from age or change including illegal conversions.
                           Some are exposed to adverse conditions nearby. In some of these
                           neighborhoods= buildings are deteriorating from insufficient maintenance
                           or have buildings and infrastructures too old to be serviceable. In other
                           sections, the relationships to the rest of the City are poor, community
                           facilities are not conveniently accessible, or the area suffers from the
                           impact of some adverse external influences.
Program:           Determine more completely the nature and causes of changes taking place.
         -         Determine compatibility between the direction of change and existing zoning and
                   the General Plan.
         -         Determine the extent of structural deterioration and conversions.
         -         Develop programs to arrest deterioration.
         -         For areas in transition monitor the needs of the areas and develop programs
                   accordingly.
         -         Insure that urban services meet the demands.
         -         Study the impact of the commercial intrusions and implement policy that reflects
                   the recommendations of the study.
         -         Develop a maintenance code for all private properties, to eliminate fire hazards
                   and to improve appearance and public safety.

Area of mixed residential/commercial use: 16.
Characteristics:           This was formerly an area of single-family homes, but now land uses are
                           mixed with new apartments and commercial buildings. The area lacks
                           parks and recreation areas.
Program:           Develop a comprehensive design for the area.

                   diversity of rents.
         -         Integrate residential with highly-serviceable commercial enterprises.
Area of residential/office use: 19.
Characteristics:           This is an area of mixed residential uses now changing to higher density
                           apartments and office buildings. It contains the new City Hall and library.
                            The maintenance of properties is good but it is an area undergoing
                           marked changes in intensity of use.
Program:           Develop a comprehensive design.
         -         Zone according to the comprehensive design.
         -         Develop architectural guidelines and review and advise on building proposals.
         -         Explore the possibility of introducing other civic facilities in the area.
Areas of commercial use: 15, 25.
Characteristics:           These commercial areas lack unity in design although a humane scale still
                           exists in some portions. Some structures are old and obsolescent. Traffic
                           congestion and parking are problems and expansion of parking would be
                           difficult and only possible by intruding into nearby residential areas.
Program:           Determine the extent of transition, its direction, and its possible influence on other
                   areas.
         -         Develop a comprehensive urban design.
         -         Develop architectural guidelines.
         -         Determine the compatibility between the commercial enterprises and the few
                   residential parcels.

                                                                                CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Area of industrial use: 9.
Characteristics:           This industrial area suffers from poor layout and lot pattern.
                           Consequently traffic circulation is difficult. Some vacant land remains. It
                           is an area of warehouse use.
Program:           Develop a maintenance code.
         -         Develop a comprehensive design including improved traffic circulation.
         -         Negotiate for resubdivision of the remaining vacant land to alleviate the chaotic
                   lot patterns.
         -         Develop regulations to maintain some of the open space.
         -         Determine the amount of structural deterioration.
         -         Study the capacity of urban services, determine areas of deficiency, and alleviate.
         -         Develop architectural guidelines.
Areas of Change Affecting Natural Resources
Areas include: developed and undeveloped properties adjacent to the Bay: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Characteristics:           This large expanse of land to the northeast of Bayshore freeway was
                           created by one of the last extensive land fills in the South Bay. The major
                           portion is in private ownerships, in part already developed, and the
                           remaining open land is planned for extensive development in the future.
                           This area includes the waste water treatment plant and the solid waste
                           disposal site to be incorporated in the City's proposed aquatic park. This
                           fill area lacks a comprehensive plan and guidelines. There is severely
                           limited capacity for traffic into the area. Some of the development that
                           has already occurred, though well maintained, is not easily compatible
                           with the atmosphere of the Bay.
Program:           Develop comprehensive designs giving special attention to the natural resources.
         -         Institute stronger zoning regulations to protect the natural resources.

Although the current Circulation Element of the General Plan was adopted by the City
Council as a part of the original adoption of the General Plan (October 20, 1969, Resolution
No. 87-69) there are several other policy documents related to circulation that have been
adopted over the intervening years. These documents consist of:
       Complete Streets Policy of the City of Burlingame – adopted by the City Council
        on November 5, 2012, by Resolution No. 77-2012
       Burlingame Bicycle Transportation Plan – adopted by the City Council on
        October 8, 2004, by Resolution No. 91-2004
       Burlingame Bayfront Specific Plan Chapter IV. Traffic and Circulation –
        adopted by the City Council on April 5, 2004, by Resolution No. 26-2004.
        Amendments to the Bayfront Specific Plan were adopted on August 21, 2006, by
        Resolution No. 58-2006 and on June 18, 2012, by Resolution No. 44-2012.
       North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan Chapter 5. Circulation and
        Infrastructure – adopted by the City Council on On September 20, 2004, by
        Resolution No. 85-2004. The Specific Plan was amended by the Burlingame City
        Council on February 5, 2007, by Resolution No. 13-2007.
       Burlingame Downtown Specific Plan Chapter 7. Circulation and Parking –
        adopted by the City Council on On October 4, 2010, by Resolution No. 73-2010.
The purpose of this update is to consolidate all the relevant circulation policies into one
document, to update the data in these documents to reflect current conditions, and to
report on what implementation measures within these documents have been completed. It
is not the intent to change the policies that are now in place; the existing policies
incorporate the provisions of the California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358) and take into
account the multimodal transportation networks within the community and the connections
throughout San Mateo County and the Bay Area.

I.      Current Circulation Element
On October 20, 1969, by Resolution No. 87-69, the Burlingame City Council adopted the
Burlingame General Plan, which included the following Circulation Element.
OVERVIEW
An integrated system is proposed including the Southern Pacific Railroad (including both
passenger service and through movement of freight), local transit, and four categories of
streets and highways. The street and highway system would accommodate private passenger
automobiles, trucks and local transit vehicles. The integrated system is proposed to include all
modes of travel, including walking, bicycling and transit, allowing users of all ages and abilities
to reach destinations in the community and region safely and directly.
POPULATION
In 2000, 28,128 people lived in the City of Burlingame. About 20.6% of these people were
under the age of 20 and 15.2% were over 65. By 2010 the city's Population had increased by
2.4% to 28,806. There was a minor change in the age composition. By 2010 about 23% of the
city's residents were under 20 and about 14% were over 65. In 2000 there were 2.22 persons
per household on the average. This had increased slightly to 2.29 persons per household in
2010. These minor changes in population and composition reflect the fact that Burlingame is a
built out community where there are no large vacant tracts of land suitable for residential
development. Any new development is expected to replace existing development, primarily in
areas that are near the community's two major transit hubs (Burlingame Caltrain Station and
Millbrae Intermodal Station) and along transit corridors such as El Camino Real and California
Drive.
Population projections for Burlingame are based on build-out of vacant and underused
residential land to the densities given in the General Plan. Projections of household size reflect
a continuation of the minor increase of average household size. However, the critical factor in
the population range given is the rate of new residential construction. The following projections
are derived from Projections 2013, published by the Association of Bay Area Governments:
Population 2000-2010, Projected to 2030
         2000              28,128
         2010              28,806
         2020              31,700
         2030              34,800
Source: ABAG Projections 2013
Household size assumptions for the population projections were:
         2010              2.33
         2020              2.33
         2030              2.34

TRANSIT
An integrated system of regional rapid transit and local transit has been developed to serve
Burlingame residents and workers and to provide for the high volume through-movement that
needs to be accommodated in this corridor. If determined appropriate, grade separations
should be considered to accommodate local street crossings.
The Caltrain commuter line has been established along the existing Southern Pacific Railway
right-of-way along the California Drive/Carolan Avenue corridor. This line also connects to the
Millbrae Intermodal Station with connections to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system and
SamTrans Bus lines. Opportunities exist for Complete Streets projects along this corridor. A
Complete Streets project is proposed for Carolan Avenue between Oak Grove Avenue and
Broadway, to accommodate bicycle lanes and pedestrian improvements. This project is now in
the design process, and is expected to be under construction in 2015. These projects will
enhance the use of the transit facilities and reduce reliance on private automobile travel. There
are also opportunities near the transit stations identified in the Downtown Specific Plan and the
North Burlingame Rollins Road Specific Plan for higher density development that will benefit
from proximity to public transit and to the Complete Streets amenities.
STREETS AND HIGHWAYS
Bayshore Freeway (Highway 101) and Junipero Freeway (280 Freeway) are recognized in the
plan. The main proposals affecting the freeways are additions and improvements to the
interchanges at Millbrae Avenue, Broadway, and Peninsula Avenue to provide for full directional
movement at each of these interchanges and to accommodate the increasing volumes of traffic
that will be generated, particularly from the industrial areas. The Millbrae Avenue and
Peninsula Interchange improvements have been completed, and the Broadway interchange
project began construction in 2014. These interchange improvements include facilities for
bicycles and pedestrians using the overcrossings of US 101.
A system of major arterials is proposed to take care of longer distance local trips and to
connect Burlingame with adjacent communities. These include El Camino Real (a State
highway), California Drive, and Bayshore Highway and its extension through the Anza Pacific
development (Airport Boulevard) for major north-south movements. The latter route would
connect with the San Francisco Airport on the north and with the major street system in the
City of San Mateo on the south. Airport Boulevard has been completed to provide through
traffic in the Bayfront area, and a Bayfront trail system has been developed adjacent to
Bayside Park to provide pedestrian and bicycle travel through this area. In addition, bicycle
lanes were recently added to Airport Boulevard. Other major arterials include Millbrae Avenue
(in the City of Millbrae), Trousdale Drive, Carmelita Avenue from El Camino Real to California
Drive, and Oak Grove Avenue and Peninsula Avenue. These arterials would carry the major
volume of east-west trips and connect with State highways and freeways.
The other elements of the street system are secondary arterials connecting collector and local
access streets to the major arterials, and collector streets to feed traffic to the arterials and
major centers of activity in Burlingame. The systems of streets proposed around the Broadway
shopping center and the Burlingame Avenue shopping center are of particular importance.
These are intended to provide movement around the centers, connect to parking lots, and
permit the central portions of these shopping centers to provide for limited vehicular traffic and
turned over primarily to pedestrians.
GRADE SEPARATION STRUCTURES
Railroad grade separations are recommended at Broadway, Oak Grove, Howard, and Peninsula
Avenues. A highway overpass is needed across Bayshore Freeway to connect Millsdale and
Current Circulation Element                                                             Page 2
East Millsdale Industrial areas. (See also proposals under the heading, Broadway-Bayshore
Interchange Area.) A bicycle pedestrian overcrossing of Highway 101 has been constructed
adjacent to the Broadway interchange to provide access to Bayside Park from the
neighborhoods south of Broadway.
PARKWAY
In addition to the other elements of the circulation system, it is recommended that a parkway
be established along the Bayfront connecting Burlingame's Bayside Park with San Mateo
County's Coyote Point Park. Provisions for the Bayfront trail system are included in the
Bayfront Specific Plan, using the Bay Conservation and Development Commission Plan as a
guide. Portions of the trail have been developed in conjunction with development projects
along the Bay shoreline. However, there are gaps in the trail system that will only be
completed when the remaining properties with Bay frontage are developed.
BROADWAY-BAYSHORE INTERCHANGE AREA
Major changes are needed in the circulation system around the Bayshore-Broadway
interchange and the proposed grade separation at Broadway and the railroad. The changes
should be designed to:
1.     Reduce the congestion at the present intersection at Rollins Road and Broadway by
       providing other means of access to Millsdale and by reducing points of conflict.
2.     Provide as much flexibility as possible so that future changes in travel patterns can be
       accommodated within the system.
3.     Provide alternative routes of travel so that individual drivers have some options to
       permit them to avoid points of congestion. (Traffic flow tends to be somewhat self-
       adjusting where alternative paths of travel are available.)
4.     Increase capacity throughout the Broadway-Bayshore Area by reducing conflicts
       through traffic control measures, providing added lanes at critical points, and grade
       separating turning movements wherever feasible.
More specific proposals are:
1.     Grade separate Broadway and the Southern Pacific Railroad.
2.     Provide two completely new links to permit some traffic to avoid the Broadway-Rollins
       Road intersection. One of these should connect the Millsdale and East Millsdale
       Industrial areas with an overpass on Bayshore Freeway. The other link proposed is a
       new street southeast of Cadillac Way extending from Bayshore Boulevard to Carolan
       Avenue. This new street should be obtained when the presently vacant land is
       developed.
3.     On Bayshore Freeway, move the entrance to the southbound off-ramp as far north as
       possible and provide connections to Marsten Road, Broadway and Cadillac Way.
Many of these issues will be resolved by the construction of the Broadway Interchange. The
improvements at the interchange are expected to increase the capacity of the
Broadway/Rollins intersection and provide for less delays due to congestion. Any remaining
issues can be evaluated as a part of the upcoming General Plan update.

II.     Complete Streets Policy of the City of Burlingame
On November 5, 2012, the City Council of Burlingame, by Resolution No. 77-2012, adopted the
following Complete Streets Policy.
COMPLETE STREETS POLICY OF THE CITY OF BURLINGAME
The objective of this policy is to establish guiding principles and practices so transportation
improvements are planned, designed, constructed, operated and maintained to encourage
walking, bicycling, and transit use while promoting safe operations for all users.
A.      COMPLETE STREETS PRINCIPLES
1.      Complete Streets Serving All Users. The City of Burlingame expresses its
        commitment to creating and maintaining Complete Streets that provide safe,
        comfortable, and convenient travel along and across streets (including streets, roads,
        highways, bridges, and other portions of the transportation system) through a
        comprehensive, integrated transportation network that serves all categories of users,
        including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of
        commercial goods, users and operators of public transportation, seniors, children,
        youth, and families.
2.      Context Sensitivity. In planning and implementing street projects, departments and
        agencies of the City of Burlingame shall maintain sensitivity to local conditions in both
        residential and business districts as well as urban, suburban, and rural areas, and shall
        work with residents, merchants, and other stakeholders to ensure that a strong sense
        of place ensues. Improvements that will be considered include sidewalks, shared use
        paths, bicycle lanes, bicycle routes, paved shoulders, street trees and landscaping,
        planting strips, accessible curb ramps, crosswalks, refuge islands, pedestrian signals,
        signs, street furniture, bicycle parking facilities, public transportation stops and
        facilities, transit priority signalization, and other features assisting in the provision of
        safe travel for all users, such as traffic calming circles, transit bulb outs, and road diets,
        as well as those features identified in the City of Burlingame Bicycle Transportation
        Plan.
3.      Complete Streets Routinely Addressed by All Departments. All relevant
        departments and agencies of the City of Burlingame shall work towards making
        Complete Streets practices a routine part of everyday operations, approach every
        relevant project, program, and practice as an opportunity to improve streets and the
        transportation network for all categories of users, and work in coordination with other
        departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to maximize opportunities for Complete
        Streets, connectivity, and cooperation. The following projects provide these
        opportunities: pavement resurfacing, restriping, accessing above and underground
        utilities,    signalization    operations    or   modifications,     and   maintenance      of
        landscaping/related features.
4.      All Projects and Phases. Complete Streets infrastructure sufficient to enable
        reasonably safe travel along and across the right of way for each category of users shall
        be incorporated into all planning, funding, design, approval, and implementation
        processes for any construction, reconstruction, retrofit, maintenance, operations,
        alteration, or repair of streets (including streets, roads, highways, bridges, and other
        portions of the transportation system), except that specific infrastructure for a given
        category of users may be excluded if an exemption is approved via the process set forth
        in section C.1of this policy.
Complete Streets Policy                                                                     Page 5
B.     IMPLEMENTATION
1.     Plan Consultation and Consistency. Maintenance, planning, and design of projects
       affecting the transportation system shall be consistent with local bicycle, pedestrian,
       transit, multimodal, and other relevant plans, except that where such consistency
       cannot be achieved without negative consequences, consistency shall not be required if
       the head of the relevant department provides written approval explaining the basis of
       such deviation. Such deviations shall be presented to the Bicycle and Pedestrian
       Advisory Committee early in the planning and design stage, to ensure the Bicycle and
       Pedestrian Advisory Committee has an opportunity to provide comments.
2.     Street Network/Connectivity. As feasible, the City of Burlingame shall incorporate
       Complete Streets infrastructure into existing streets to improve the safety and
       convenience of users and to create employment, with the particular goal of creating a
       connected network of facilities accommodating each category of users, and increasing
       connectivity across jurisdictional boundaries and for existing and anticipated future
       areas of travel origination or destination.
3.     Bicycle     and    Pedestrian     Advisory    Committee      Consultation.   Applicable
       transportation projects shall be reviewed by the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory
       Committee early in the planning and design stage, to provide the Bicycle and Pedestrian
       Advisory Committee an opportunity to provide comments regarding Complete Streets
       features to be incorporated into the project.
4.     Evaluation. All relevant agencies or departments shall perform evaluations of how well
       the streets and transportation network of the City of Burlingame are serving each
       category of users.
C.     Exemptions
1.     Leadership Approval for Exemptions. Projects that seek Complete Streets
       exemptions must provide written finding of why accommodations for all modes that
       were not included in the project and signed off by the Public Works Director or
       equivalent high level staff person. Projects that are granted exceptions must be made
       publically available for review.

III. Bicycle Transportation Plan
On October 8, 2004, the Burlingame City Council, by Resolution No. 91-2004, adopted the
Bicycle Transportation Plan, an amendment to the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
Updated February 2, 2015: The following text has been updated to reflect current data and
trends, and includes a summary and status update of the priority projects listed in the 2004
Bicycle Transportation Plan (refer to Pages 18 – 20 for Priority Project Status Update).
1. OVERVIEW
Purpose of the Plan
Since Burlingame's inception, the center of community activity has been around its two
commercial areas which grew up adjacent to the Burlingame and Broadway train stations with
surrounding nearby multiple family residential development fanning out to single family
homes. The promotion of bicycling as an alternative transportation source is a natural
progression from this transit-oriented community base. Since Burlingame is an older
community, many of the streets are narrow and most of its properties are built out. New
development generally occurs on sites which have had a previous use. The purpose of this plan
is to:
              Identify the regional and local bicycle routes through Burlingame for commuters,
               recreational riders and local shopping trips;
              Explore how the bicycle routes can be made more safe and accessible;
              Provide a framework for making physical improvements to the bicycle route
               system.
Public Participation
In order to take leadership in promoting bicycle safety in the community and participation in
the preparation of this plan, the Traffic Safety and Parking Commission (TSP) and the Planning
Commission appointed a subcommittee consisting of two TSP members and one Planning
Commissioner. This committee has also contacted members of the local bicycle community to
ask their advice on the best and safest routes through Burlingame as well as the areas which
need improvement.
Once the plan was drafted, public hearings before the Traffic, Safety and Parking Commission
and the Planning Commission were held to offer an opportunity for the public to review and
comment on the plan. Notices of these hearings were published in local newspapers, posted on
the City's website, and posted on streets in the Burlingame Avenue and Broadway Commercial
Areas, as well as at the train stations and at the local bicycle shop. Following the public
hearings, the City Council held a public hearing and adopted the plan by amending it to the
City's General Plan.
This bicycle plan also builds on the regional routes developed in the San Mateo County
Comprehensive Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan, adopted in 2011, which was developed after a
series of public workshops held throughout San Mateo County. It is also consistent with the
routes shown in the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's adopted 2009 Regional Bicycle
Plan Update for the San Francisco Bay Area, which shows the Bay Trail and the
California/Carolan north-south route through Burlingame.
Bicycle Transportation Plan                                                             Page 7

2. BACKGROUND AND SETTING
The terrain in Burlingame is similar to other Peninsula communities, with a relatively flat area
east of El Camino Real, and hillier areas to the west of El Camino Real towards Skyline
Boulevard and Highway 280. The north/south bicycle routes are generally flat, with gently
rolling hills on the route just west of El Camino Real. However, the road connections between
lower Burlingame through the hillside areas to Skyline Boulevard are fairly steep. There are
routes in nearby Hillsborough to reach the west end of Burlingame which are not quite as steep
but are more circuitous.
Because most of Burlingame was subdivided before 1940 and the city was almost fully
developed by the 1970's, with little population growth in the ensuing years, the street pattern
is fixed and many of the older residential streets are narrow designed to pre-World War II
standards. El Camino Real as it passes through Burlingame is a substandard four-lane highway
lined by a historic grove of Eucalyptus trees. Burlingame has always been a city of trees, and
even in the early days, efforts to widen El Camino were fought by residents wanting to
preserve the Eucalyptus and Elm trees which line it. The historic Tree Rows were listed in the
National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
There are a few local streets through the established residential neighborhoods which were
originally designed as "boulevards" and have adequate width to accommodate bicycle travel.
These routes are now used informally by bicyclists. The proposed local and regional network of
bicycle routes was developed using these streets as a base, to connect to the local routes in
San Mateo, Hillsborough and Millbrae. The inter-city routes pass through Burlingame's
neighborhoods as close as possible to existing local parks and schools.
In addition, Burlingame has about two and one-half linear miles of frontage on San Francisco
Bay. The Bayfront land area was primarily created from fill in the 1950's and 1960's. As
development occurred after the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) was
established in 1972, sections of the Bay Trail were built adjacent to the bay's edge. Since there
are still a few parcels which have not been developed, or reused since BCDC was established
by the State legislature, a few gaps in this trail system on private property remain. In 1999,
the City completed construction of the portions of the Bay Trail located on City-owned parcels
with frontage on San Francisco Bay.
Except for a few vacant parcels on the Bayfront, the Burlingame Community is primarily built
out, and the land use patterns are well established. Figure III-1 depicts Burlingame's
transportation hubs, schools, parks and shopping districts.

Existing and Expected Bicycle Commuters
Based on data collected in the 2010 Census, there are 3453 residents who live and also work
in Burlingame. Of those, 66 (1.9%) commute by bicycle and 345 (10.0%) walk to work. Of the
14,570 Burlingame workers 16 years old and older, there are 131 people (0.9%) who
commute to work by bicycle and 539 people (3.7%) who walk to work.
County-wide, the 2010 Census shows that out of the 358,970 workers, 4,666 (1.3%) bicycle to
work, and 9,333 (2.6%) walk to work. In comparison, Burlingame has more people who walk
to work and fewer people who bike to work than in the County as a whole.
The following tables, based on data from Census 2010, 2000 and 1990 Census, compare
Burlingame commuters to commuters in the region and State.

The data indicates that Burlingame has shown a slight increase in bicycling commute trips and
an increase in walking trips over the past ten years, which is on par with the County, Bay Area
and State-wide in the number of commuter trips by bicycle and walking. Over the past ten
years, Burlingame, San Mateo County and the Bay Area have seen a significant increase in
bicycling and walking trips by commuters, while in California as a whole, bicycle commute trips
have increased, and pedestrian commute trips have decreased.
The Bay Area has a temperate climate which is conducive to commuting by bicycle or walking.
The San Mateo County Comprehensive Bicycle Route Plan indicates that based on a survey
conducted county-wide many people who might bicycle to work are concerned with finding safe
routes and having bicycle facilities, including bicycle parking and showers, at their place of
employment.
By making the improvements proposed by this plan, the bike routes through Burlingame will
be safer and easier to use. It is expected that the number of commuters using bicycles or
walking could be increased to well above the Bay Area average. It is a goal of this plan to
increase the number of bicycle and pedestrian commuters in Burlingame to 6.5% of
commuters walking or riding their bicycle to work; and to facilitate bicycle access to
employment destinations in the City.

Existing Bicycle Routes
The primary bicycle routes through Burlingame are now marked with signs. In 1972, the
Burlingame City Council adopted a system of bicycle routes through Burlingame as shown on
Figure III-2, Exhibit A dated May 15, 1972. The routes include Bayshore Highway and Airport
Boulevard east of U.S. 101, Skyline Boulevard on the western edge of Burlingame, and two
other north/south routes on local residential roads between San Mateo and Millbrae, with local
east-west connector routes near the train stations and the commercial core. This route map as
adopted in 1972 shows no east/west routes to connect to Skyline Boulevard to the west.
In the 1970's, bike lanes were installed on Skyline Boulevard. In addition, bicycle route signs
were installed to delineate one of the north-south Class III bike routes through Burlingame.
Over the years, most of the signs along this route have been removed and the bike route is no
longer clearly marked. There are no signs along the other 1972 identified routes through
Burlingame.
Since the adoption of the Bicycle Plan in 2004, most of the bicycle routes identified are now
marked by signs, bicycle lanes have been added on Howard Avenue, Airport Boulevard and
Airport Boulevard, and "sharrow" lane markings have been added to California and Hillside
Drives.

4. BICYCLE NETWORK, FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS
Local and Regional Routes
Figure III-3 shows the local and regional bicycle routes through Burlingame. The primary
regional routes are:
     North/South Routes
      Bay Trail
      Airport Boulevard/Bayshore Highway
      Howard/Carolan/California Drive
     East/West Routes
      Howard Avenue from Humboldt in San Mateo to Ralston Avenue in Hillsborough
      Adeline Drive from Central Burlingame through unincorporated Burlingame Hills to
        Skyline Boulevard
The local routes through the residential neighborhoods also provide regional access, but by
roads with less traffic and are more scenic. The route west of El Camino Real which follows
Cabrillo Avenue and jogs up to Quesada Way passes several schools and parks and offers a
fairly flat alternative to El Camino Real, which is much too busy and narrow through
Burlingame to accommodate bicycle traffic.
Bicycle Storage and Shower Facilities
Bicycle racks are available at the Burlingame Public Library, the Recreation Center at
Washington Park and at the schools and parks shown on Figure III-3. Based on the San
Mateo County Congestion Management Plan, bicycle facilities are required as traffic
mitigation for all new development in Burlingame. These facilities could include bicycle
lockers, racks and shower facilities provided for employees working in a new office or
commercial building. It is recommended that additional bicycle racks of a type selected by
the City be placed at strategic locations, such as public parking lots as a part of streetscape
improvements, within the Broadway and Burlingame Avenue Commercial Areas as uses
change, buildings are replaced, and sidewalks are redone.
Bicycle lockers and racks are available at both the Burlingame and Broadway Caltrain
Stations. The Burlingame train station has 18 bicycle lockers available for rent on a monthly
basis and a bicyle rack which will hold 8 bicycles. The Broadway train station has 12 bicycle
lockers for rent and two bicycle racks which will hold a total of 16 bicycles.
Coordination and Consistency with other Plans
This plan is an amendment to the Circulation Element of the Burlingame General Plan, and
is consistent with the transportation policies contained in that plan, including the Bayfront
Specific Plan, the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan and the Downtown Specific
Plan.
The regional bicycle routes shown in the plan are consistent with the routes shown in the
San Mateo County Comprehensive Bicycle Plan adopted by the City/County Association of
Governments in 2011. In addition, the priority projects identified in the County's plan have
been incorporated into the list of projects identified in the implementation chapter of this
plan. In addition, the routes in this plan are consistent with the routes shown in the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission's adopted 2009 Regional Bicycle Plan for the San
Bicycle Transportation Plan                                                             Page 14

Francisco Bay Area. The MTC regional plan shows the Bay Trail and the California/Carolan
north-south route as regional routes through Burlingame.
The regional routes shown also connect with regional routes to the south which are shown
in the City of San Mateo Bicycle and Pedestrian Chapter of the Circulation Element. To the
north, the regional routes connect with those identified in Millbrae's General Plan. Although
the Town of Hillsborough does not have a formal bicycle plan, the routes shown through
Hillsborough are the routes which are commonly used by cyclists and connect to the
planned route on Skyline Drive in Burlingame as well as to regional routes along the San
Andreas reservoir.

Bicycle Transportation Plan Page 1
Bicycle Transport on Transit
There are two Caltrain stations in Burlingame, at Burlingame Avenue and Broadway at
California Drive. Each local train is equipped with two cars which allow up to 40 bicycles on
board (gallery car) or 24 bicycles on board (Bombadier cars). These bicycle cars are heavily
used during commute hours. Caltrain also offers limited stop and "Baby Bullet" express
trains that do not stop at all local stops. The bullet train service does not stop in
Burlingame; the nearest stop is at the Millbrae Intermodal Transit Station just north of the
Burlingame border. Some of the limited-stop trains stop at the Burlingame train station.
Caltrain offers 18 bicycle lockers and 13 rack spaces at the Burlingame station.
SamTrans operates a bus system throughout San Mateo County, with three local routes and
five regional routes which provide service in Burlingame. All SamTrans buses are equipped
with bicycle racks, which hold a maximum of two bikes, and two additional bikes are
allowed inside the bus. Following are the bus routes which serve Burlingame:
         Route 43 travels from Burlingame Plaza Shopping Center at El Camino Real and
            Murchison and connects with the Tanforan Shopping Center in San Bruno,
            traversing local streets through Millbrae and El Camino Real.
         Route 46 operates entirely within Burlingame starting at Trousdale and Quesada
            on the north and traveling south along California Drive to Burlingame Avenue,
            and east to Washington Park and the Recreation Center.
         Route 292 runs from the Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo to the
            Transbay Terminal in downtown San Francisco, and travels through Burlingame
            along Peninsula Avenue, California Drive, Broadway and Bayshore Highway.
         Route 397 Connects downtown Palo Alto with downtown San Francisco, and
            travels through Burlingame on El Camino Real.
Bicycle Safety and Education
           Currently, there is no avenue for bicycle education and safety. It is proposed that
            brochures be developed which inform people of the location of the bicycle routes
            through Burlingame, as well as to offer safety tips for riding, such as the rules of
            the road, how to negotiate intersections, riding defensively, and how to use hand
            signals. These brochures would be made available at the City's recreation center
            and library, as well as distributed to schools. In addition, the posting of signs
            along the bicycle routes will educate motorists to expect bicycle traffic on these
            streets. The Burlingame Police Department has a School Liaison Officer, and the
            brochures can be distributed through this officer as a part of a bicycle safety
            education program. The Peninsula Traffic Congestion Relief Alliance also has a
            program that provides Bike and Pedestrian Safety workshops at an employer's
            work site.
           In addition, the League of American Bicyclists conducts an education program for
            bicyclists to learn how to ride safely. Classes are taught through local community
            centers and provide education to both children and adults. The community can
            take advantage of this resource to provide education to all cyclists.
           Once some of the designated routes have been established, the community
            should hold a "Bicycle Day" to promote the use of the bicycle routes and to
            distribute information on bicycle safety.

5. IMPLEMENTATION
Priority Projects
In an effort to improve bicycle transportation in and through Burlingame, the following have
been identified as having the highest priority and giving the most benefit to bicycle
commuters and recreational riders in the community.
    1. Bicycle Detectors/Crosswalks and marked bike lane at the Cadillac
        Way/Rollins       Road       intersection    to     access     the   new     Broadway
        bicycle/pedestrian bridge. As a part of the Caltrans Auxiliary Lane project
        between Third Avenue in San Mateo and Millbrae Avenue, Caltrans will be
        constructing a bicycle pedestrian bridge adjacent to the existing narrow Broadway
        interchange overpass. The bridge will land in the island across from the Cadillac
        Way/Rollins Road intersection, where it is difficult for pedestrians and bicyclists to
        cross Rollins Road to access the bridge. This crossing could be made safer by:
        a. providing a crosswalk across Rollins Road from the north side of Cadillac Way to
            the bridge landing;
        b. providing street markings and bicycle detectors on Cadillac Way so that cyclists
            can make a left turn towards the bridge landing; and
        c. adding a designated bicycle lane along Rollins Road approaching the bridge to
            separate bicyclists from the nearest automobile travel lane.
               STATUS UPDATE: While these improvements have not been completed, the
                Broadway interchange project, which started construction in 2014, will result
                in a reconfiguration of this intersection. Bicycle and pedestrian access to the
                existing bridge will be included as part of the interchange project.
    2. Bike Lanes on Carolan, California and Howard Avenue – The San Mateo County
        Comprehensive Bicycle Route Plan contains a list of 15 priority projects to enhance
        the regional bicycle route system. One of the projects on this list is the completion of
        a North-South Bikeway as it runs through San Mateo, Burlingame and Millbrae. The
        portion through Burlingame would connect with Delaware Avenue in San Mateo to
        the South, and would connect to the Millbrae Intermodal Transit Station to the North.
Most of this regional route is on streets (California, Carolan, Howard) which have adequate
width to provide Class I bike lanes, or to provide adequate shoulder for cyclists to safely
ride next to automobile traffic. It is recommended that improvements to these roadways be
made to add Class II bike lanes to the extent feasible, and to provide adequate signage to
direct riders to use this route (see diagram on Page CI-15 for an explanation of Class I, II
and II bicycle routes).
               STATUS UPDATE: Within the last few years, bicycle signage and "Sharrow"
                lane markings have been added on California Drive, and bicycle lanes have
                been added on Howard Avenue between California Drive and Humboldt
                Avenue. A Complete Streets project is being designed for Carolan Avenue
                between Oak Grove Avenue and Broadway. Design for this project is now
                underway, and it is expected to begin construction by Fall of 2015.
Bicycle Transportation Plan                                                            Page 18

    3. Explore the possibility of a local bicycle path between the Broadway and
       Burlingame Commercial Areas and train stations using existing right-of-way
       along the Caltrain tracks. Along the Caltrain tracks between Burlingame Avenue
       and Broadway, there may be excess right-of-way on either side of the tracks
       sufficient to install a Class I bicycle path. This right-of-way is not owned or controlled
       by the City of Burlingame, but belongs to either the Joint Powers Board which
       operates Caltrain, or the City and County of San Francisco (adjacent to California
       Drive). This project would have to be a joint effort in cooperation with these agencies
       and is a long range project. If the project is determined to be feasible, the path
       should be a joint use trail, with separate clearly designated areas for bicycles and for
       pedestrians. It is allso recommended that a landscaped buffe be included between
       the railroad tracks and the pathway.
    4. Place Bicycle Racks in the Burlingame Avenue and Broadway Commercial
       Districts. These two busy commercial districts can be easily accessed by bicycle
       from the surrounding residential areas. Bicycle racks of a design to match the
       existing street furniture could be placed either along the sidewalks or in the many
       public parking lots which serve these areas. These should be designed into any
       future streetscape improvements in the public right-of-way.
           STATUS UPDATE: Bicycle racks have been added on both Burlingame Avenue
            and Broadway as part of the streetscape projects for these streets.              The
            Burlingame Avenue streetscape project was completed in November, 2014, and
            includes wider sidewalks along Burlingame Avenue between California Drive and
            El Camino Real to allow more room for dining al fresco, parallel parking,
            improved intersections with corner bulb-outs, classic street lights and furniture,
            beautiful landscaping.
    5. Explore the possibility of creating a loop path connecting to the proposed
       creekside paths in the Rollins Road area. As a part of the North
       Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan, a series of multi-use (pedestrian/bicycle, etc.)
       creek trails is proposed which would be developed as new development occurs in
       that area. In order to connect these trails within the Rollins Road area and provide a
       full connection through the Rollins Road area, it is proposed that bicycle connections
       to these creek trails be created. The exact locations of the connections and whether
       they would be on public or private property would need to be explored.
    6. Provide a second bridge crossing of U.S. 101 in the vicinity of Winchester
       Drive to connect to the existing bike and pedestrian path on the east side
       near Anza Boulevard and Bayside Park. The Bayfront Specific Plan identifies this
       location for a pedestrian/bicycle crossing of 101 which provides direct access from
       the residential neighborhoods west of U.S. 101 to the recreational amenities at
       Bayside Park and along the Bay Trail.
    7. Bicycle Route Signs along Local and Regional Routes. Another project on the
       priority list in the San Mateo County Comprehensive Bicycle Route Plan is to provide
       directional signage and signal detectors along the regional north south route. In
       addition, some of Burlingame's local bicycle routes have signs which were installed in
       the early 1970's, but many are missing and the route is not always apparent. A
       comprehensive program for signing all the bicycle routes through Burlingame would
       go a long way toward making the City's system more user-friendly and safer. Also,
       the signage would raise awareness of automobile drivers to look for bicyclists along
       these routes. Since many of these local bicycle routes are through residential
Bicycle Transportation Plan                                                              Page 19

         neighborhoods, the option to mark some of the routes with street markings rather
         than signs, where the situation warrants, should be considered.
            STATUS UPDATE: Comprehensive Bicycle Route signage has been implemented
             for most of the bicycle routes throughout the Community.
         As a part of this sign program, it is also recommended that signs be placed at the
         prominent gateway entrances to Burlingame which include a statement which
         identifies Burlingame as a bicycle friendly community. Possible locations for these
         signs would be at the City limits on El Camino, California Drive, Rollins Road, Airport
         Boulevard and Bayshore Highway.
    8. Explore the possibility of adding "zebra crossings" (clearly marked
         pedestrian crossings) across El Camino Real and California Drive at
         intersections with bicycle routes. One of the impediments to bicycling to and
         from parks, playgrounds and shopping areas in Burlingame is the ability to safely
         cross these two busy arterial streets. Caltrans has recently completed the installation
         of video bicycle detectors on signals at critical intersections along El Camino Real.
         Where the video detectors work with the signals, the striped crossing would reinforce
         and make the motorist aware to watch for pedestrians and bicyclists crossing at the
         bicycle route intersections.
    9. Create handouts and an outreach program to make people aware of the
         bicycle routes and provide guidance regarding bicycle safety. An important
         element of creating a safe environment for bicycle riding is education. The public
         needs to be aware of the routes which can be used to access our local facilities, and
         both motorists and bicyclists can benefit from learning the rules of safe bicycle
         riding. The handouts would be made available to schools through the Police
         Department's School Liaison Officer and distributed at parks and libraries.
6. DESIGN STANDARDS
The proposed projects will be designed in accordance with the Design and Maintenance
Standards as outlined in Chapter 5.0 of the San Mateo County Comprehensive Bicycle Route
Plan. The general criteria outlined in the County Plan is that projects are to Conform to
Caltrans standards for bikeways. The following chart delineates the three types of bicycle
facilities, Class I, Class II and Class III. Specific details on the design standards for these
types of facilities may be found in the San Mateo County Comprehensive Bicycle Route Plan.

FUNDING SOURCES
There are several Federal, State and local Programs which provide funding for bicycle and
pedestrian projects. These projects are rated based on such criteria as the need of the
project to complete a regional bicycle route system, the increased safety that the project
will provide and the amount of the local match for the outside funding. Following are a list of
the primary funding sources available in 2004.
          TEA-21 (Transportation Enhancement Activities): This is a federal funding
           source which offers funding for projects which enhance alternative transportation
           opportunities.
          State Bicycle Transportation Account: An annual program through the State
           which provides grants to local jurisdictions with an emphasis on projects which
           benefit bicycling for commuting purposes.
          Transportation Development Act (TDA) Article 3 (SB 821): These funds
           originate from the state gasoline tax and are distributed to local jurisdictions
           based on population. In San Mateo County, the distribution of these funds is
           administered by the San Mateo City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG).
          New Construction/Impact Fee: Any new development in Burlingame's
           Bayfront and North Burlingame/Rollins Road areas will be required either to
           install the planned bicycle improvements on their property and for area-wide
           improvements to pay a Development Impact Fee which will fund the future
           installation of bicycle lanes on a comprehensive basis.
          Peninsula Congestion Relief Alliance – This agency has a program which
           provides funds to employers to place bike racks and lockers at their place of
           business. The Alliance pays one-half the cost for purchasing and installing any
           bike parking for up to a maximum of $500.00 per unit. The Alliance also has a
           program that provides Bike and Pedestrian Safety workshops at an employers
           work site.

IV.    Burlingame Bayfront Specific Plan –
       Traffic and Circulation
On April 5, 2004, the Burlingame City Council, by Resolution No. 26-2004, adopted the
Burlingame Bayfront Specific Plan. Amendments to the Bayfront Specific Plan were adopted
on August 21, 2006, by Resolution No. 58-2006 and on June 18, 2012, by Resolution No.
44-2012. Following is the Traffic and Circulation Chapter of the adopted Burlingame
Bayfront Specific Plan.
1.      EXISTING ROADWAY CONFIGURATION AND CLASSIFICATION
Roadway Access: The following roadways provide access to and within the Bayfront
Planning Area. Table IV-1 provides an explanation of the roadway classifications, and Figure
IV-1 shows the circulation plan, including bicycle routes.
         US 101 is a State Highway which provides regional access to this section of
          Burlingame. This freeway travels in a north-south direction through the State of
          California. In the planning area, four travel lanes are provided in each direction
          with auxiliary lanes on some segments within Burlingame. The interchanges that
          provide access to the Shoreline, Inner Bayshore, and Anza, Anza Extension and
          Anza Point Areas are: Millbrae Avenue, Broadway, Anza Boulevard (northbound
          only), Peninsula Avenue (northbound only) and Poplar Avenue (southbound
          only).
         Airport Boulevard is an arterial roadway which runs parallel to US 101, from
          Bayshore Highway at Bayside Park to the City boundary and through
          unincorporated San Mateo County to Coyote Point Drive. The width of this
          roadway varies from two to four lanes. It provides access to office buildings,
          hotels, restaurants, recreation facilities and a long-term airport parking lot. It has
          direct access to US 101 at the Broadway interchange.
         Bayshore Highway is a four-lane arterial roadway that parallels US 101 north of
          Airport Boulevard at the Broadway interchange and extends to the Millbrae
          interchange. It provides access to hotel, office, restaurant, light industrial, and
          warehouse uses.
         Anza Boulevard is a two- to four-lane collector roadway that connects Airport
          Boulevard to northbound US 101. At its northern end, it provides access to office
          and hotel uses.
         Coyote Point Drive is a four-lane roadway that intersects Airport Boulevard
          near the US 101/Peninsula Avenue interchange. It provides access to the Coyote
          Point County Recreation Area and the City of San Mateo Poplar Creek Golf
          Course.

                                 Roadway Classification
Classification  Description
Local Street    Provides for local traffic circulation with direct access to adjoining
                properties. Through traffic is deliberately discouraged.
Collector       Provides for traffic movement between arterials and local streets. Provides
                both access to adjoining properties and through routes within commercial
                and industrial neighborhoods.
Arterial        Provides service to trips of moderate length. Distributes travel to smaller
                geographic areas than major arterials. May carry local bus routes and
                provide intra-community continuity.
Major Arterial  Carries the major portion of traffic entering and leaving the City, as well
                as the majority of movements desiring to bypass localized areas and
                travel through the community

Federal Highway Administration Aid Roadways
In addition to the above classifications, roadways which are considered to be regionally
important have designations assigned by the Federal Highway Administration and the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). The Federal Highway Administration
designates certain roadways as Federal Aid Routes. These routes can be eligible for federal
funding for improvements. Both Bayshore Highway and Airport Boulevard, including the
portion in San Mateo County between Lang Road and the Peninsula Interchange, are
designated as part of Federal Urban Aid Route No. FAU D466 and are eligible for some
federal funding. MTC is a regional transportation agency which oversees transportation
projects in the nine-county San Francisco Bay region. The MTC Metropolitan Roadway
System classifications are used to determining funding priorities for regional transportation
projects. The MTC's Metropolitan Roadway System (MTS) map designates US 101 as an MTS
Freeway, and Bayshore Highway and Airport Boulevard, including the section between Lang
Road and the Peninsula interchange, as MTS Local Roads.
Bicycle Access: Bicycle facilities in the planning area include bike paths, bike lanes, and
bike routes. Bike paths are paved and are separated from roadways by spaces or by
physical barriers. Bike lanes are lanes on roadways designated with special pavement
markings and signs for use exclusively by bicycles. Bike routes are roadways that are
designated for use by bicycles with signs and/or paint.
Bicycle facilities within the planning area include portions of the Bay Trail, a multi-use
recreational paved pathway along San Francisco Bay, Sanchez Channel and Burlingame
Lagoon; and bike lanes on Airport Boulevard (see Figure IV-2, Bicycle and Pedestrian
Circulation Map for existing and proposed bicycle routes). There are two bike routes in
Burlingame which access this area across US 101. Millbrae Avenue in Millbrae also provides
a bicycle route which crosses US 101 to serve this area. There is a bicycle over crossing of
US 101 south of the Broadway interchange, which was installed as a part of the auxiliary
lane project on US 101 which provided auxiliary lanes between the Millbrae interchange and
the 3rd Avenue on and off ramps in San Mateo. The auxiliary lane project also included
widening of the Peninsula Avenue overpass, to include bicycle lanes. Future bicycle and
pedestrian access to the Anza Extension recreation facilities should include a second bridge
over U.S. 101 in the vicinity of Morrell Avenue and Rollins Road.
Bus Service: The Burlingame Bayside Area Shuttle carries commuters between the Millbrae
Intermodal Station and Burlingame businesses along Bayshore Highway and Airport
Boulevard during morning and evening commute periods. The Burlingame Trolley operates
between Airport hotels and office areas and the Burlingame and Broadway shopping areas.
The shuttles are funded by the City of Burlingame, Peninsula Joint Powers Board, San Mateo
Transit District, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, City/County Association of
Governments of San Mateo County, the Downtown Burlingame Business Association, and
the Broadway Improvement District. The services are free to passengers.
The San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) operates fixed-route bus service to San
Mateo County. There is one bus route in the Bayfront Planning Area – Route 292. This route
operates between Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo and the Transbay Terminal in
downtown San Francisco. It operates within the planning area from the Broadway
interchange north on Bayshore Highway.

In 2003 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) service began from the new Millbrae Station. The
BART station and 3000-space parking garage are accessed from the Millbrae interchange at
the north end of the planning area. The station is about a mile from Cowan Road and
Bayshore Highway.
Pedestrian Facilities: The completed portions of the Bay Trail provide pedestrian access
along a major portion of the bay frontage throughout the planning area. There are only a
few gaps in the trail which are on private property. When these remaining parcels are
developed or redeveloped, the developer will be required to complete and maintain these
sections of the Bay Trail. Both Bayshore Highway and Airport Boulevard have sidewalks
along their entire length. Most large properties with trail improvements also have vertical
access from the Bay Trail to the public sidewalk, so users today can travel continually on
most of Burlingame's water frontages.
2.      TRAFFIC PATTERNS – TRIP GENERATION AND INTERSECTION CAPACITY
There are limited access points to the Bayfront Planning Area. Therefore, it is important that
the main access intersections are operating at an acceptable level of service. Intersection
operations are described by standards known as "level of service" (LOS), which is a
qualitative description of traffic flow based on such factors as speed, travel time, delay, and
freedom to maneuver. Six levels of service are defined, ranging from LOS A, the best
operating conditions, to LOS F, where demand exceeds capacity and there is excessive
delay. LOS E normally corresponds to operation "at capacity".
The following table shows the existing intersection levels of service in the Bayfront Planning
Area, plus development approved and under construction. This establishes the baseline
conditions for the Specific Plan.

The Traffic Analyzer
The 1981 Burlingame Bayfront Specific Area Plan based the mix of land use designations
and densities on the traffic producing characteristics of each of the land uses. The impact of
each use on the key intersections which provide access to the area was critical. The traffic
analyzer model was first developed in 1979 and has been updated twice, most recently in
2002-2003. The distribution and intensity of development was determined for the Specific
Plan based on the assumption that all of the critical intersections, except Broadway on-
ramps, which are already operating at an "F" level of service in the PM peak hours, would
continue to operate at acceptable levels of service.
Different types of development generate traffic at different rates and at different times of
day. Trip generation rates for different types of land uses have been developed to look at
traffic during the evening commute period (PM peak hours), when traffic volumes are
generally highest. These trip generation rates are used to determine the worst case traffic
impacts of a proposed development, particularly on the critical intersections.
Using the Traffic Analyzer model, a new development proposal can be analyzed to
determine its incremental impact on the critical intersections. The analyzer looks at the
capacity of these intersections, consisting of existing traffic volumes plus approved projects,
to establish baseline conditions. The baseline conditions show how much capacity is still
available at each critical intersection (refer to Table IV-1). Using the analyzer tables, the
amount of capacity consumed by a new development project can be determined at each of
the nine key intersections. This provides a way to monitor the amount of intersection
capacity left for future development in the area, allowing for balanced growth and continued
maintenance of acceptable levels of service within the planning area.
Many jurisdictions consider LOS D to be the minimum acceptable level of service. However,
LOS C is considered the target level of service rating for planning purposes. Therefore, since
the traffic analyzer is a planning tool, the LOS C is used to evaluate Planning Area
intersections in the analyzer.
The original analyzer looked at six key intersections in the area, later expanded to nine
intersections:
     Bayshore Highway/Millbrae Avenue
     Broadway/Rollins Road
     Broadway/Bayshore Highway
     Bayshore Highway/Airport Boulevard
     Airport Boulevard/Anza Boulevard
     Airport Boulevard/Coyote Point Drive
     Peninsula Avenue/North Humboldt Street
     Airport Boulevard/Future 101 Ramps
     Coyote Point Drive/North Bayshore Boulevard
3.      NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS
In order to ensure that the capacity of both the critical intersections and the connecting
roadways is maintained at an acceptable level of service, there are several roadway
improvement projects which should occur. Based on each project's impact on the critical
intersections in the Bayfront Area, they will be charged a Bayfront Development Fee to be
matched with City funds to make improvements to the roadway system. Some of these
projects were identified in the 1981 Bayfront Specific Area Plan. The improvements
identified at the time the Bayfront Development Fee was established in 1979 and which
were used as a basis for the original traffic analyzer are as follows:

                                                              infeasible
As noted above, three of the six projects have been completed. Engineering and
environmental studies have been completed for the proposal to widen Airport Boulevard to
four lanes and it is still a valid project for improving traffic flow in the Bayfront Planning
Area. This project should be included in the list of projects to be funded by the update of the
Bayfront Development Fee. Preliminary studies were also done on the proposal to build new
freeway on and off-ramps at Humboldt/Howard and Rollins Road and this project was
determined to be infeasible. It should not be included in future improvement plans to be
funded by the Bayfront Development Fee. In addition, the addition of a second left turn lane
to the northbound freeway on-ramp from Broadway was studied. The proposal was to move
the on-ramp to the north with the idea that it would provide for more storage capacity. In
fact, after study it was determined that this project would result in less storage capacity
than is available in the current configuration.
The Traffic Analyzer Update identifies the following additional roadway improvements
required to maintain an acceptable level of service within the planning area. It is proposed
that these roadway improvements would be funded in part by private development through
implementation of an updated Bayfront Development Fee as discussed in Chapter VII. –
Plan Implementation of the Bayfront Specific Plan.
Airport Boulevard Curve Realignment – Airport Boulevard has sharp curves (90º) at two
locations along its southern portion in the Anza Point Area. As traffic volumes increase,
these sharp curves will prove to be both capacity constraints and safety hazards. Therefore,
it is recommended that these curves be smoothed out to comfortably handle traffic along
Airport Boulevard at the roadway's design speed. A curve on this type of roadway with a 30
miles per hour (mph) design speed should have a radius of 300 feet.
Airport Boulevard Median Reconstruction/Site Access Plan – Currently, along Airport
Boulevard between Lang Road and Anza Boulevard, the median is intermittent with frequent
breaks. This median area will likely need to be reconstructed to allow for specific project
access to Airport Boulevard. Therefore, it is recommended that a comprehensive plan be
developed to strategically position the median breaks at appropriate locations along Airport
Boulevard to accommodate future projects. It is recommended that this median access be
planned, rather than designed and constructed on a project-by-project basis, to ensure that
Burlingame Bayfront Specific Plan – Traffic & Circulation                               Page 31

project access locations are efficiently located with respect to each other and to Airport
Boulevard.
Airport Boulevard Bridge Widening (Sanchez Channel) – Airport Boulevard transitions
from four lanes to three lanes (one southbound lane and two northbound lanes) just north
of the Burlingame Lagoon bridge crossing, and continues with this configuration south of the
lagoon. Although the capacity of the roadway is expected to be adequate, providing a
second lane in each direction allows traffic to turn into and out of developed sites without
impeding through traffic and providing safe pedestrian separation. Therefore, it is
recommended that this roadway and bridge be widened to accommodate a four-lane cross
section, with full pedestrian access to the adjacent Bay trail.
Transition between New Broadway Interchange and Airport Boulevard – Airport
Boulevard, between its current intersections with the Bayshore Highway and Anza
Boulevard, is a two-lane facility. In the future, the Broadway interchange with US 101 will
be reconfigured and straightened to align directly with Airport Boulevard at Bayshore
Highway. Broadway is a four-lane facility. Therefore, in order to connect with the
straightened Broadway, it is recommended that Airport Boulevard be widened to four lanes
between the Bayshore Highway and Anza Boulevard. This widening, in conjunction with the
bridge widening described above, will create a continuous, four-lane Airport Boulevard from
its beginning at the Bayshore Highway to Beach Road, where Airport Boulevard transitions
to a two-lane facility in San Mateo County.
   STATUS UPDATE: This transition will be completed as a part of the Broadway
    Interchange Construction Project.
Airport Boulevard Bicycle Lanes – It is recommended that continuous bicycle lanes be
installed along Airport Boulevard to provide continuous bicycle access through the Anza
Area.
   STATUS UPDATE: Bicycle lanes have been installed along Airport Boulevard between
    Broadway and the Sanchez Channel bridge.
Bayshore Highway Median Reconstruction – Bayshore Highway is now a four-lane
roadway with median areas in some locations and continuous shared two-way left-turn
lanes in other areas. Similar to the recommended access plan for Airport Boulevard, an
improvement plan is recommended for Bayshore Highway, to determine the appropriate
locations of median breaks to serve existing and future development. As part of that plan,
the existing signals will need to be upgraded to provide for signal interconnect and
coordination. Where possible, the plan should provide opportunities for landscaping and
lighting within the median.
Local Roadway Signalization required with the Realignment of Broadway
Interchange – The reconstruction of the Broadway interchange will change the alignment
of the connecting roadways to "T" or full intersections where they connect with the
Broadway overpass. New signals will be required at these intersections.
   STATUS UPDATE: These local roadway signals will be completed as a part of the
    Broadway Interchange Construction Project.
Broadway Interchange: It should be noted that the Rollins Road/Broadway/US 101
southbound off-ramp is now operating at a Level of Service "F" and will continue to do so
with plan implementation. The levels of service for the intersections at or near the
Burlingame Bayfront Specific Plan – Traffic & Circulation                           Page 32

Broadway interchange will continue to function at this level until the Broadway intersection
is reconstructed. There are long range plans to improve the Broadway interchange, but that
project has not yet been funded. It will be a priority project when funding for regional
projects becomes available. The project would also include changes to the surrounding
intersections, which should ease the congestion on the on-ramps.
   STATUS UPDATE: Broadway            Interchange    Construction     Project is  funded   and
    construction is underway.
There are also proposals to change the operation of Caltrain at the Broadway station (such
as relocation of the station platforms; fewer trains stopping at the station) which will lessen
the down-time for the Caltrain gates on Broadway. When the Broadway interchange project
is implemented, and when the proposed changes to the Broadway Caltrain station and/or
the changes in operation of Caltrain occur, the traffic circulation in this area will improve.
However, because of the short distance between intersections and the location of the
Caltrain tracks, it may not be possible to bring these intersections at either side of the
interchange to a level of Service C.
4.      LAND USE DENSITIES AND TRAFFIC CONTROL
The updated traffic analyzer also looked at the proposed land uses and densities as outlined
in Chapter III. – Land Use of the Bayfront Specific Plan. The land use densities for each
subarea were selected based on the traffic generating characteristics of those uses. With the
land use densities identified in Chapter III, and the improvements outlined above, it is
expected that all intersections, except the Rollins Road/Broadway/US 101 southbound off-
ramp will continue to operate at acceptable levels of service after build-out of the plan.
The analyzer also looks at the way traffic trips are distributed as they come and go from the
area. These directions of approach and departure are determined using the traffic surveys
done in this area over the years. For instance, the hotel traffic comes predominately from
the north, to and from the airport. Office traffic, on the other hand, tends to come from
both the north and south, indicating more regional trips on U.S. 101 rather than local trips
from residential areas to the west. About 15 per cent of the restaurant trips were internal to
the Bayfront Area indicating that the restaurants serve the adjacent hotels and businesses.
Using all if this collected data, each land use and each subarea have been assigned a
specific "Capacity Consumption Rate" which assigns the new trips to the area's critical
intersections. Therefore, as each development proposal comes in, its traffic impacts
attributed to each intersection can be identified. In addition, this information will be used to
update the Bayfront Development Fee and to develop with the City a fair share allocation of
the costs for these public improvements. This will ensure that the circulation system
continues to provide acceptable levels of service. Chapter VII., Plan Implementation of the
Bayfront Specific Plan provides a discussion of the Bayfront Development Fee formula.

V.      North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan –
        Circulation and Infrastructure
On September 20, 2004, the Burlingame City Council, by Resolution No. 85-2004, adopted
the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan. The Specific Plan was amended by the
Burlingame City Council on February 5, 2007, by Resolution No. 13-2007. Following is
Chapter 5 of the Adopted Specific Plan – Circulation and Infrastructure.
1.      ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
There are no intersection improvements needed to implement the North Burlingame/Rollins
Road Specific Plan, however, two roadway changes are proposed. They are not expected to
have an effect on roadway or intersection capacity and are discussed below.
New Connection between Rollins Road and Adrian Road – Part of the Specific Plan's
land use component suggests opportunity sites for new car dealerships on Adrian Road, just
west of U.S. 101. Existing access to this area fronting U.S. 101 is indirect via Adrian Road in
Millbrae or David Road from Rollins Road to the south. The two suggested sites would
provide increased visibility for these businesses locating there. To facilitate this visibility and
the accessibility of those sites, the Plan recommends that a road be constructed to improve
access to the auto dealerships from the Rollins Road area, by providing a more direct and
visible link to the potential auto dealership sites. The exact location of this road will be
determined as properties develop and opportunities arise. This new roadway connection is
not expected to have any effect on roadway capacity or operations.
Adjustment to El Camino Real Cross-section – Within the project study area, El Camino
Real is a six-lane facility with adjacent landscape berms and frontage roads. The North
Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan calls for adjusting this cross-section to remove the
frontage roads on either side of El Camino Real. In its place, the Plan calls for phased
development of a more pedestrian-friendly land use along the corridor. This phasing
scenario is described in Chapter 3 of the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan. In
addition, the Plan calls for enhancement to pedestrian and bicycle facilities along El Camino
Real, including wide sidewalks, streetscape improvements and on-street parking that would
improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation and safety. These improvements are not
expected to have an effect on traffic operations since, except for median strip
improvements, they will occur on City property adjacent to the Caltrans (State) right-of-
way. Three through traffic lanes in each direction should be maintained on El Camino Real.
   STATUS UPDATE: Further study since the specific plan was adopted has shown that
    this concept may be unworkable. The frontage roads are controlled by Caltrans, and in
    some instances contain utilities. An alternative would be to design the frontage roads in
    a multi-lane “boulevard” style, including on-street parking to serve businesses and wide
    sidewalks to enhance the pedestrian environment.
2.      STREETSCAPE IMPROVEMENTS
The North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan recommends the creation of cross-sectional
standards for El Camino Real, Trousdale Drive, California Drive, Magnolia Avenue and Rollins
Road. These standards will help to define the ambience for future development in each area.
These street standards are limited to streetscape improvements, such as bicycle lanes,
wider sidewalks, street furniture and trees. These improvements should enhance the
North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan                                               Page 34

pedestrian and bicycle environment without significantly compromising the capacity of the
roadway network.
El Camino Real – The El Camino Real cross-section, shown in Figure V-1, would be
reconfigured to clarify pedestrian and vehicular travel patterns and facilitate greater
pedestrian circulation in North Burlingame on land that is currently dedicated to service and
frontage roads. The reconfiguration would create a substantial amount of new developable
land that can then be used to develop street frontages that are primarily upper level
residential uses over ground-floor retail with office uses above.
New buildings would frame a more deliberate pedestrian friendly and memorable entry to
Burlingame. Figure V-2 shows an overlay of the proposed change superimposed over an
aerial photograph of the existing El Camino Real to illustrate that there is essentially no
change to the existing travel lane configuration.
El Camino Real would become a vibrant and pedestrian friendly retail corridor to serve local
residents. Parking lanes would be included to buffer pedestrians from traffic lanes. The
improvements will include street trees at regular intervals that will supplement the existing
Eucalyptus canopy and provide shade for pedestrian areas. Street lights, benches and other
furnishings would be part of the streetscape improvements. The improvements would foster
safer and more spatially defined pedestrian circulation routes along El Camino Real and
strengthen connections between the Mills Peninsula Hospital, retail opportunities in
Burlingame Plaza and the Millbrae Intermodal station.
   STATUS UPDATE: Further study since the specific plan was adopted has shown that
    this concept may be unworkable. The frontage roads are controlled by Caltrans, and in
    some instances contain utilities. An alternative would be to design the frontage roads in
    a multi-lane “boulevard” style, including on-street parking to serve businesses and wide
    sidewalks to enhance the pedestrian environment.

Trousdale Drive – Trousdale Drive is a busy four lane arterial, running east-west that
connects Interstate 280 with El Camino Real and California Drive. Streetscape
improvements on Trousdale Drive, illustrated in Figures 5-3 and 5-6, can enhance the
pedestrian environment while also contributing to the reduction of vehicular speeds and the
creation of a generally safer environment for pedestrians. The concepts illustrated anticipate
a new entrance to Mills Peninsula Hospital on Trousdale Drive at Magnolia Avenue and
reconfiguration of travel lanes to accommodate the shifted hospital-related traffic.
Curb extensions at corners, or "bulb outs," at the intersection of Trousdale Drive and El
Camino Real would help to reduce traffic speeds at this busy intersection while also creating
shorter crossing distances for pedestrians. The bulb out will delineate parking lanes, where
they exist, on Trousdale Drive. Tree wells will be cut into the existing ten foot sidewalks to
allow the planting of street trees at regular intervals. Pedestrian crosswalks would be added
at appropriate locations to facilitate greater and safer pedestrian use. Improvements will
include pedestrian-scaled street lighting. These amenities will also improve pedestrian
access to Mills Peninsula Hospital for people using BART and other public transit.

                                                                      California Drive
California Drive – Traffic volumes on California Drive are likely to increase with the
continued operation of the Millbrae Intermodal Station and as transit patrons south of the
Specific Plan area use California Drive to access the station via the Millbrae Avenue
underpass. Improvements to the streetscape, shown in Figure V-5, and low fencing with
landscaping set back from the edge of the sidewalk along California Drive combined with
greater pedestrian activity that will result from new development on California Drive parcels,
will calm vehicular traffic and contribute to a safe and pleasant pedestrian environment
along this route. Bike lanes in both directions will allow for bicycle access from the transit
facility to parts of the Specific Plan Area, including the hospital west of El Camino Real via
Murchison Drive or Trousdale Drive.
   STATUS UPDATE: Although bike lanes have not been installed, bicycle route signage
    and "sharrow" street markings have been added to California Drive to allow for bicycle
    access to the Millbrae Intermodal Station and as a north-south connection through
    Burlingame.
Magnolia Avenue – Magnolia Avenue is a very wide street laid over a 60-foot wide San
Francisco Water District easement. With the completion of the replacement hospital,
Magnolia will complete the intersection at the main entrance to the hospital. Magnolia
connects Trousdale Drive to Murchison Drive and provides the primary service access for
some of the retail establishments at the back of Burlingame Plaza and to the shops which
face El Camino Real. The service entries at the rear of the businesses facing El Camino
share the Magnolia Avenue street façade with the front doors of many other businesses.
Curb bulb outs could be added on Magnolia Avenue at the intersection with Trousdale Drive
to improve pedestrian access and safety. The bulbouts would narrow the perceived width of
travel lanes and contribute to the reduction of traffic speeds. The bulb outs would also
reduce pedestrian crossing distances. The current configuration of parallel parking on the
west side and a mixture of parallel and diagonal parking on the east side are proposed to
remain.

To break up the street parking visually, street tree bulb outs could be added at regular
intervals on the west side and tree wells could be cut into the existing walk on the eastern
side to avoid a conflict with the underground water main. Improvements will also include
pedestrian scale street lights and additional crosswalks at convenient locations.

Rollins Road Gateway – The gateway, illustrated in the conceptual sketches in Figures V-
8 and V-9, will signal the entry into the Rollins Road industrial area. Utilizing the unused
shoulders of the El Portal Channel bridge the gateway will provide pedestrian seating areas,
entry signage and landscape elements. Improvements will include the refurbishments of the
bridge to include pilasters and upgraded security fencing and railings.

Rollins Road – Improvements to Rollins Road, which are illustrated in Figures V-10 and V-
11, will include the installation of street trees in tree wells cut into the existing sidewalks. At
locations where the street trees are to be planted, the sidewalk will be reconstructed around
the tree locations. The goal of this street tree program is to calm traffic by narrowing the
perceived street width, which can cause drivers to reduce their speed. Therefore, it is
advantageous for the street trees to be as close to the travel lanes as possible. Rollins Road
is also a designated bicycle route in Burlingame’s adopted Bicycle Transportation plan.
Bicycle lanes have been installed along Rollins Road within the Plan area.
Additionally, a significant goal of the North Burlingame/Rollins Road Specific Plan is the
creation of a more aesthetically pleasing environment on Rollins Road, and the addition of
street trees will help to accomplish that goal. The trees will also shade large areas of the
Rollins Road pavement, reducing temperature and glare. The width of the City-owned right-
of-way on Rollins Road differs on either side of Easton Creek. South of Easton Creek, the
right-of-way is 75 feet, with a sidewalk of approximately 5 feet on either side. North of
Easton Creek, the right-of-way is 84 feet, including approximately 5 feet between the back
of the sidewalk and the property line. Therefore, as shown in Figures 5-10 and 5-11,
construction of the tree wells and realigned sidewalks in the section of Rollins Road below
Easton Creek will require the City to acquire an easement from property owners.
Construction of this street tree program in this more constrained section of Rollins Road
may be limited by other improvements on these properties and will need to be reviewed on
a parcel by parcel basis.

Street Tree Recommendations – Street trees are recommended with the goal of creating
a transition in scale between roadways and adjacent land uses as well as to provide a
comfortable pedestrian realm. Trees were chosen based on their long term appeal;
however, as with any tree species the interim look and growth pattern of the tree is
dependent on the City of Burlingame's tree maintenance program. It is suggested that at
the time of planting, steps to increase the future heath of the tree be taken. These efforts
include proper soil amendment to reduce soil compaction and water tubes to induce deep
root growth. It should be expected that during periods of a tree’s normal growth it will
encroach on a roadway. The pruning of trees in order to avoid conflicts with roadways will
be necessary during these initial periods of growth. Trees should be pruned to minimize this
impact and with the future appearance of the tree in mind.
Table V-1 indicates the recommended street trees to be used for streetscape improvements
in the Specific Plan Area. Most trees are listed in the City of Burlingame's Planning
Department Tree List. The Accolade Elm has been considered as a replacement tree for
sections of El Camino Real south of the Plan Area. It is very similar to Elm trees that were
historically planted on El Camino Real and is one of the best Elm species for resisting the
attack of Dutch Elm disease.

3.      PEDESTRIAN NETWORK
In the Rollins Road area, a creekside open space and pedestrian trail system would provide
amenities and pedestrian and bike facilities for area businesses as well as recreation
opportunities Rollins Road workers and Burlingame residents. These open space areas,
combined with streetscape improvements on Rollins Road, will facilitate safer and more
attractive non-vehicular connections between Rollins Road employment destinations and
transit opportunities to the north in Millbrae and to the south on Broadway. The proposed
network is shown in Figure V-12 and a conceptual illustration of these creekside areas is
shown in Figure V-13.
The gradual development of a trail network will occur over time as opportunities arise to
acquire access by purchase or gift. Except where necessary to mitigate impacts of a
particular project, no conveyance of public access rights is intended to be imposed on
projects in the area.

4.      PARKING
As shown in the design guidelines in Chapter 6, on-site parking throughout the Specific Plan
area should be encouraged to be located behind buildings in order to adequately define the
pedestrian realm and create safe and aesthetically-pleasing environments on Burlingame
sidewalks and streets. However, on parcels with lot frontage on El Camino Real at grade
parking visible or accessed from El Camino should be discouraged. This parking will be
supplemented by on-street parking, including some portions of El Camino Real, on which
parallel curb parking should be provided as part of its redesign.

VI.     Burlingame Downtown Specific Plan –
        Circulation and Parking
On October 4, 2010, the Burlingame City Council, by Resolution No. 73-2010, adopted the
Burlingame Downtown Specific Plan. Following is Chapter 7 of the Adopted Specific Plan –
Circulation and Parking.
1. RECOMMENDED ROADWAY NETWORK IMPROVEMENTS
The Downtown Specific Plan includes a series of roadway projects intended to either
mitigate existing or anticipated traffic conditions, or otherwise satisfy urban design
objectives for streetscapes, pedestrian and bicycle access and open space.
Existing Roadway Network – Regional access to Downtown Burlingame is provided via
Highway 101 freeway. The closest interchanges with the freeway are located at Peninsula
Avenue (southern edge of the plan area) and at Broadway (north of the plan area). The
Peninsula interchange provides access in the northbound direction only, while the Broadway
interchange provides access for both northbound and southbound traffic. A system of major
arterials accommodates the longer distance local trips and connects Burlingame with
adjacent communities. These include El Camino Real (State Highway 82) and California
Drive providing north-south access. Other major arterials include Peninsula Avenue and Oak
Grove Avenue. These arterials carry the major volume of east-west trips and connect with
State highways and freeways. The other elements of the street system are secondary
arterials, such as Howard Avenue, that connect collector and local access streets to the
major arterials. Collector streets feed traffic to the arterials and major centers of activity in
Burlingame.
Based on existing travel patterns, the majority of project-traffic would occur along California
Drive heading towards Burlingame Avenue and Howard Avenue from the north and south.
Additional project-traffic would occur along Howard Avenue, Burlingame Avenue, and
Peninsula Avenue, and Primrose Road.
Traffic bound for downtown on El Camino Real is expected to exit from El Camino Real at
the first opportunity and utilize the east-west collector roadways. As such, traffic not bound
for downtown will likely bypass and continue traveling along El Camino Real, while the
majority of downtown-related traffic will likely enter via Park Road, Primrose Road,
Bayswater Avenue, Howard Avenue, and Burlingame Avenue. In addition, on- and off-street
parking facilities are primarily located along these local roadways, which would attract
patrons to exit El Camino Real to access the parking.
Downtown Specific Plan – Circulation & Parking                                   Page 47

Considering location and types of development projected in the plan, traffic generated by
future downtown development is expected to primarily affect the following intersections:
   El Camino Real/Howard Ave                          California Dr/Lorton Ave
   Burlingame Ave/Park Rd                             El Camino Real/Peninsula Ave/Park Rd
   Primrose Rd/Chapin Ave                             California Dr/Peninsula Ave
   Primrose Rd/Bellevue Ave                           California Dr/Howard Ave/Highland Ave
   Primrose Rd/Douglas Ave
Traffic mitigation measures, such as signalization and signal timing adjustments have been
proposed in order to reduce potential impacts to these intersections. Traffic calming could
also be implemented in surrounding neighborhoods if necessary to address cut-through
traffic.
California Drive/Lorton Avenue Intersection – The California Drive/Lorton intersection
needs improvement, regardless of possible future development. The unconventional layout
of the intersection is inefficient, and is confusing for both vehicles and pedestrians.
The Downtown Specific Plan includes two alternative reconfigurations for the California
Drive/Lorton Avenue intersection. Both would be acceptable choices for improving vehicle
and pedestrian circulation through the intersection, and both could accommodate traffic
from anticipated future development as described in this specific plan.
Option 1: Signalized Intersection
Option 1 would refine the current configuration with a more straightforward intersection
design, and the addition of a traffic signal. With this improvement, the intersection will have
an improved level of service and reduce vehicle delays significantly. The intersection could
also be configured to create a small usable open space, as described in Chapter 4:
Streetscapes and Open Space of the Downtown Specific Plan.
Option 2: Roundabout
City engineering staff has been actively studying the possibility of a roundabout design to
mitigate existing and future traffic conditions. This would improve traffic safety and act as a
traffic calming measure. In addition, the traffic circle at the center of the roundabout would
have attractive landscaping and could have a prominent design element such as flowers or a
monument, as described in Chapter 4: Streetscapes & Open Space of the Downtown
Specific Plan. Traffic would enter the roundabout and circulate one-way around a center
circular island, typically in a counterclockwise direction. On California Drive, travel lanes
would be reduced from two lanes to one lane at the roundabout entrance in order to allow
orderly traffic flow into the circle. Crosswalks would extend around the outer circle of the
roundabout, with refuge islands at intermediate positions.
Downtown Specific Plan – Circulation & Parking                                     Page 48

Civic Center Circle – The intersection of Primrose Road,
Bellevue Avenue and Douglas Avenue between the Library
and City Hall currently is complex, inefficient, and confusing.
The existing divided traffic islands could be replaced with a
single traffic circle, with crosswalks connecting each corner
of the streets leading to the circle. The circle could provide a
small open space, as described in Chapter 4: Streetscapes
and Open Space. This reconfiguration would improve the
function of the intersection and provide an additional open
space amenity.
Highland Avenue – The last block of Highland Avenue
between California Drive and Howard Avenue is a one-way          California Drive/Lorton Avenue
street and primarily serves to provide access and parking to     Option 1: Signalized Intersection
the businesses fronting the street, and also provides a short-
cut for vehicles turning right from southbound California
Drive onto Howard Avenue. Even with this short-cut
function, however, there are minimal traffic volumes along
this block during the peak hours.
Given the limited function of the street segment and its
potential to complicate traffic patterns, there could be
justification for narrowing or closing the street segment to
improve the streetscape and increase the size of the
                                                                 California Drive/Lorton Avenue
adjoining open space. Depending on the mix of businesses
                                                                 Option 2: Roundabout
alongside, closing the street and replacing it with open space
frontage could either be an asset to the businesses or be
detrimental. Uses such as restaurants may appreciate
frontage on an open space, but retailers may value the
proximity of parking and access more than open space.
Since the majority of traffic would travel through on
California Drive and would not turn onto Highland Avenue,
the closure or narrowing of the roadway would not impact
the traffic operations at the California Drive/Howard Avenue
intersection.
                                                                 Civic Center Circle
Narrowing the segment and redesigning it to create a more
unified composition with the adjoining open space could be a
satisfactory option that would retain traffic circulation and
parking, but be more oriented to the adjacent businesses
rather than to traffic making a short-cut to Howard Avenue.
The street could be redesigned with a “flexible zone” where
the parking area and traffic lane would be shared by
pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles. This concept would
involve special paving and flush integrated curbs, a greater
number of trees, street furniture, and bicycle parking. The
intention would be to create a more seamless transition          Highland Avenue Plaza
between the street area and the open space area.
Downtown Specific Plan – Circulation & Parking                                      Page 49

California Drive Reconfiguration – A concept that merits further study beyond the scope
of the Downtown Specific Plan would be to reconfigure the California Drive traffic lanes to
better serve traffic flow and accommodate bicycles. Currently California Drive has two traffic
lanes in each direction, but due to the large number of turns in center lanes, the center
lanes effectively do not function for through traffic. A reconfiguration could have one clear,
through traffic lane in each direction, together with a center median/turn lane to
accommodate turns. The traffic lanes would remain clear of obstructions so traffic flow
would be steady (but calm), while turns would be accommodated separately from the
through traffic. The redesign would provide enough room for generous bicycle lanes on each
side, so California Drive would become a convenient and effective bicycle route through
Burlingame and to Downtown. Existing on-street parking would also be accommodated.
This approach, sometimes referred to as a "road diet," has been demonstrated to be very
effective elsewhere in the Bay Area on streets with comparable traffic volumes and
characteristics to California Drive. Further study would need to consider impacts along the
length of California Drive to ensure that traffic does not spill into adjacent neighborhoods.
However, with the functional and aesthetic improvements, the expectation would be that
California Drive would become a preferred access route into Downtown, as well as between
Downtown and the Broadway commercial district.
 Currently California drive has two traffic
 lanes in each direction, but due to the large
 number of turns in center lanes, the center       Reconfigured California Drive with one travel
 lanes do not function for through traffic.        lane in each direction, center median/turn
                                                   lane, and bike lanes.

El Camino Real/Peninsula Avenue/Park Road Signalization – Traffic analysis has
projected that the El Camino Real/Peninsula Avenue/Park Road intersection could
experience a potentially significant reduction in level of service depending on amount of
downtown development in the future. However, even with a relatively high level of
development in the future, these impacts could be reduced with changes to the traffic signal
timing. By increasing the signal green time by ten seconds in the Peninsula Avenue
westbound approach and Park Road southwest approach, and removing ten seconds of
green signal time in the northbound and southbound El Camino Real approaches, the
potential impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.
California Drive/Howard Avenue Signalization – Traffic analysis has projected that the
California Drive/Howard Avenue intersection could experience a potentially significant
reduction in level of service depending on amount of downtown development in the future.
However, even with a relatively high level of development in the future, these impacts could
be reduced with changes to the traffic signal timing. By increasing the signal green time by
five seconds in the California Drive northbound and southbound directions and removing
five seconds of green signal time in the Howard Avenue eastbound and westbound
approaches, the potential impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.
2.   TRANSIT
The following discussion includes descriptions of each transit service provider that serves
Downtown Burlingame. System-level ridership, performance measures, and planned transit
improvements specific to transit stations and stops in Burlingame are further reviewed.
Caltrain - Caltrain provides local and
commuter train service between San
Francisco and San Jose, with weekday
commute-hour service to Gilroy. The main
objectives of the Caltrain Short Range
Transportation     Plan     (2008)    included
addressing    station    needs,   coordinating
service with connecting transit operators
throughout the Bay Area, improving station
access for all passengers, and enhancing
system performance. Over the long-term,
Caltrain patronage has risen and is
anticipated to continue to do so. Station

the station.
Compared to other Caltrain stations, passenger boardings and capacity utilization rates at
the Burlingame Station are relatively moderate-to-low. However, the land use plan for the
Downtown Specific Plan encourages more intensive development in many of the blocks
within close proximity to the train station, which should allow more people to take
advantage of the train for some of their transportation needs. The plan encourages more
frequent stops at the Burlingame Avenue station to encourage ridership and capitalize on
more intensive development downtown near the train station.

                                             east of the Bayshore Freeway. There is a

                                             therefore added an express bus service along
                                             the corridor. The land use plan for the
                                             Downtown Specific Plan encourages more
                                             intensive development in many of the blocks
                                             close to El Camino Real, which should help
                                             increase transit demand along the corridor.

California High Speed Rail –The California High-Speed Rail (CHSR) is a rail line in the
planning stages that will provide a high-speed link between San Francisco and Los Angeles,
as well as a number of other key destinations. Though the CHSR will not stop in Burlingame,
the proposed corridor for the project runs north-south through the city along the existing
Caltrain right-of-way.
Given that the CHSR alignment is proposed to pass through Burlingame and its downtown,
there is concern over the potential for the rail line to create a physical barrier through the
city if it involves bridging, elevated tracks, or the use of retaining walls. Like other peninsula
cities, Burlingame has indicated a preference for having the rail line in an underground
tunnel rather than at surface or above grade Having the line underground would be more
compatible with the continued economic vitality and quality of life of Burlingame and its
downtown. It would also be more compatible with the preservation of valuable historic
resources such as the eucalyptus grove and the Burlingame Avenue and Broadway train
stations. If all rail lines are accommodated underground along the length of the peninsula
alignment, it will enable dozens of surface crossings to be relieved of train conflicts, thereby
easing access at many scales and reducing congestion throughout the peninsula.
While the CHSR is beyond the scope of the Downtown Specific Plan, the project will have an
important impact on Downtown Burlingame. It is essential that the CHSR planning process
thoroughly investigate and mitigate impacts on Caltrain service, utilities, and effects that
may concern schools, residents, and businesses.
3. PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
Most of Downtown Burlingame is highly
pedestrian-oriented and has a high amount
of pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian activity is
primarily the result of the amount of retail,
office, and restaurant land uses in the heart
of Downtown, as well as the proximity to
surrounding residential neighborhoods.
Increasing pedestrian convenience and
safety is an objective in Downtown
Burlingame, and several actions are
proposed to improve pedestrian conditions.
These include implementing traffic-calming
measures (mid-block crossings, traffic             Increasing pedestrian convenience and safety is

sidewalk “linkages” to improve connectivity
to and within downtown, and widening
sidewalks. These measures are more
thoroughly       described    in    Chapter   4:
Streetscapes and Open Spaces of the
Downtown Specific Plan. Overall, these
measures would improve pedestrian safety
and encourage residents and visitors to
patronize Downtown Burlingame.

4.      BICYCLES
An objective of the Downtown Specific
Plan is for bicycles to be a viable choice
for getting to downtown. Safety, ease of
access, and parking must all be carefully
considered so that people are able to
consider bicycling as an appealing and
realistic means of transportation. If people
are able to swap automobile trips for
bicycle trips, not only would there be
environmental advantages in terms of
reduced greenhouse emissions, but there
would be less of a need for the City to
provide additional, costly parking facilities      Bicycles can be a viable choice for getting to
for autos over the long-term.                      and around downtown.
Bicycle Routes - Bicycle routes in Downtown Burlingame include:
•       Primrose Road – from Oak Grove Avenue (north) to Howard Avenue (south).
•       Highland Avenue – from Howard Avenue (north) to Peninsula Avenue (south) and
        continues south of Peninsula Avenue.
•       California Drive – from Burlingame City Limits (north) to Howard Avenue (south).
        Within Downtown, this route intersects with Burlingame Avenue.
•       Howard Avenue – from Humboldt Road (east) to Occidental Avenue (west). Within
        Downtown, this route intersects with El Camino Real, Primrose Road, Park Road,
        Lorton Avenue, and Highland Avenue. Howard Avenue also includes a bicycle lane.
If California Drive is reconfigured as described in Section A, it offers the potential to be a
significant bicycle route into Downtown from neighborhoods to the north, south, and east.
Cyclists can then access Howard Avenue to reach the side streets, and the side streets to
reach the center of the downtown district. As streetscape improvements are implemented
along Howard Avenue and the side streets, accommodations for bicycles should be a key
design consideration. Lanes should provide adequate clearances, and intersections should
be designed to minimize automobile and bicycle conflicts. Side streets can be designed and
clearly signed as "sharrows" where it is clear that the roadway are to be shared by bicycles
and automobiles, and to alert motorists of the presence of bicycles.
Downtown Specific Plan – Circulation & Parking                                   Page 54

Bicycle Strategies and Guidelines
The desirability and effectiveness of bicycles to
serve Downtown can be improved with the
following enhancements:
Short-Term Parking – Public Bike Racks:
Individual bike racks are part of a two-tier bicycle
parking strategy for Downtown. Generally, bike
racks are useful for short-term parking (from a
few minutes to a few hours), and should be
provided throughout the redesigned streetscapes
to be convenient to businesses and attractions.

throughout Downtown.                                 the presence of bicycles where there is

Facility. A centrally-located, convenient, and
highly visible facility should be established for
longer visits downtown (from a few hours to a full
day or work shift). As opposed to sidewalk bike
racks, which are provided for short-term
convenience, the central facility would appeal to
those wanting to store their bicycles for a longer
period of time. The concept would be that
someone cycling to Downtown could proceed
directly to the central parking facility with
knowledge that they would be able to find
convenient and secure longer term parking.
Ideally, the parking facility would offer some
protection from weather, and could offer a choice
of racks and electronic lockers.

offers a measure of security. Initially the facility
could be established in one of the central public
parking lots, and over time could grow and be
located in the Lot E signature open space, or in a
nearby parking lot or structure.
Downtown Specific Plan – Circulation & Parking                                 Page 55

Downtown Specific Plan Circulation and Parking Page 5
Bicycle Accommodations in New Developments: New development should provide safe,
secure facilities for bicycles. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, depending on
the type of development. Where possible, secured, indoor parking space (i.e. lockable,
caged space) for bikes should be provided in all new residential and commercial buildings.
New projects should include bike stalls to allow users the opportunity to securely store their
bicycles. These can include racks or hooks on walls in front of parking spaces in residential
buildings, and designated and secure bicycle storage areas in commercial buildings.
Modest locker facilities in new, larger Commercial/Mixed Use projects should also be
provided. Lockers should be sufficient to store helmets and other necessary equipment.
A centrally-located bicycle parking facility
would be intended for protected long-term
parking and also serve as a social hub.

7.5. PARKING
This section outlines the parking supply plan for the Downtown Burlingame municipal
facilities. It is expected that the parking supply for future development will be met by a
combination of on-site parking and an enhancement of the existing public parking facilities
in the Downtown area. Parking requirements for development are outlined in Chapter 3:
Land Use of the Downtown Specific Plan. Generally, retail, restaurant and personal service
uses on the ground floor are exempt from parking requirements within the Downtown
Parking Sector. For commercial uses that are required to provide parking (upper floors
within the Parking Sector, and all floors outside the Parking Sector) requirements can either
be met on-site or through payment of an in-lieu fee. In-lieu fees will be used to build
structured parking at existing public parking lots in the Downtown areas.
Shared Parking Concept
The vision for Downtown Burlingame is a mix of uses. A mix of uses, as opposed to a
predominance of a single use, has positive implications on parking demand. For example,
retail land uses tend to experience peak hour parking demand between 3:00 PM and 4:00
PM during the weekday and between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM during the weekend. Office land
uses experience 100 percent parking occupancy between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM during
the weekday, but very little demand on weekends. Hotel uses experience peak parking
demand between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM during the weekday and weekend. Residential uses
experience peak hour parking demand between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM during the weekday
and weekend.
As a result of the different times of peak parking demand by these complementary uses,
demand is overlapping rather than additive. Thus less parking is required. The ability for
different uses to share the common parking areas at different times of day reduces the
overall parking demand. However, as Downtown grows, there will be near-term and longer-
term parking needs to accommodate.
The Downtown Specific Plan recognizes the opportunities for shared parking. For projects
with off-street parking included on site, different uses with different peak demands can
utilize the same parking spaces at different times of day, allowing fewer parking spaces
than if each use were fully parked. The parking standards outlined in Chapter 3: Land Use of
the Downtown Specific Plan include provisions to reduce on-site parking when the mix of
uses is complementary and can share parking spaces.
The municipal lots also benefit from the shared nature of parking, on a larger scale. The
ratios for off-site parking (whether exempt or provided through an in-lieu arrangement)
account for the different peak demands for different uses, as well as the ability for patrons
to visit more than one use without re-parking. Over the long term, the overlapping demands
of different uses and the ability to share the same spaces in the municipal facilities will
require fewer new public parking facilities than if each use had its own designated parking.
Make Better Use of Existing Parking Facilities
Downtown Burlingame consists of 20 City-owned off-street parking facilities as well as
metered on-street parking located on most local roadways (as shown in Figure 7-2). While
parking can be tight in some areas of Downtown (particularly near active shopping and
dining areas), as a whole there is available parking supply that can be better utilized to
serve near-term needs.
Downtown Specific Plan Circulation and Parking                                  Page 59
In order to make best use of existing facilities to serve current and near-term demand,
strategies can include adjusting parking pricing and time restrictions, implementing
valet/attended parking operations, modifying parking enforcement strategies, implementing
parking permits for residents/employees, introducing a car-share arrangement, and
improving wayfinding and signage for parking facilities. Many of these measures have been
implemented in the past with success, and could continue to be adjusted for further
optimization of existing resources.
Expand Parking Facilities
As Downtown grows, there may be upper limits to how much optimization can be gained
from the existing parking facilities. In order to accommodate some of the demand from new
development (since some will be met on-site), as well as to be able to provide amenities
such as the signature open space proposed for Lot E, one or more parking structures may
be necessary.
Several studies have been completed to determine which city-owned parking lots could
most efficiently accommodate parking structures, and there are several options available. A
couple of choices are discussed below, although the final decisions should be made when
funding is available based on development patterns and projections at that time.
Lot J
Because it is one of the larger lots, Lot J has been recommended for structured parking by
the city’s parking consultants. This location makes sense because it is centrally located, and
because a structure on Lot J could most easily provide the parking that will be needed to
compensate for the loss of Lot E, when it is converted to community open space. In fact,
constructing a parking structure on Lot J and creating a new open space on Lot E should be
thought of as one project with two phases, the first being the construction of the parking
structure. While Lot J is closed during construction, downtown Burlingame would lose 69
parking spaces. However, there is sufficient capacity in Lots L, W and C to temporarily make
up for this loss.
Lots A and A-3
Another potential site for a parking structure is to combine Lots A and A-3 along Donnelly
Avenue, and add an additional story on to the combined structure. At least half of Lot A
should be usable during construction, and the other spaces lost during construction can be
accommodated through existing capacity in Lots C, O, V, M, J, and L.
Howard Avenue Focus Area
The Downtown Specific Plan provides incentives to encourage new mixed use development
along the Howard Avenue. Similar to the parking requirements that have been in place
along Burlingame Avenue, the Specific Plan would exempt ground floor retail, personal
service and restaurant uses on Howard Avenue from on-site parking requirements, and
would allow parking for upper floor commercial uses to be provided off-site through an in-
lieu fee arrangement.
Howard Avenue has on-street parking along its length, and there are four off-street parking
facilities in the vicinity. Lots F and N have traditionally experienced high parking demand
during the weekday peak, whereas Lots G and W have experienced more moderate demand
during the weekday peak and could absorb the additional parking demand associated with
new development. During the weekend peak, all four lots have traditionally been
underutilized, so the additional parking demand associated with new development could be
Downtown Specific Plan Circulation and Parking                                  Page 60

accommodated. If all residential parking is provided on-site, anticipated parking demand
along Howard Avenue can be fully accommodated within existing parking lots.
Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustments
As development occurs in the downtown area, parking and circulation should be regularly
monitored so that adjustments can be made to city regulations and/or facilities as
necessary.

VI.     Next Steps
Begininning in early 2015 the community will be embarking on a comprehensive update of
the General Plan. This will provide an opportunity to consider circulation and transportation
issues in context with any changes to land use and other elements of the General Plan. Any
changes to circulation and transportation policies will be incorporated into the full General
Plan update.

                             LAND USE ELEMENT
OVERVIEW
The land use element describes categories of uses, indicates proposed land use relationships and
indicates proposed land use relationships and identifies in general terms actions needed to
achieve community goals.
For the purposes of this plan land uses are grouped in the following major categories: Residential
Uses, Institutions, Parks, Commercial Uses, Industrial Uses, and Circulation. Each of these
categories is discussed under a separate heading in subsequent sections. These categories and
sub-categories are shown on the plan diagram which portrays general relationships between the
various uses of land and between land uses and circulation facilities. The diagram is not intended
to indicate exact boundaries or extent of the areas. In some instances it may be appropriate for
certain types of use areas to overlap so that uses of different categories actually interpenetrate.
This would be true of office, shopping and service uses, and high density residential uses when
buildings and sites are appropriately designed.
RESIDENTIAL USES
Four categories of residential densities with the following ranges of dwelling units per net
residential acre are included and shown on the plan diagram: low density up to 8 dwelling units
per acre; medium density 9 to 20; medium high density 21 to 50; and high density over 50
dwelling units per acre.
An area northwest of the Burlingame Avenue-Park Road shopping center is designated for high
density residential uses in recognition of its special locational advantages. It has good access to
all forms of transportation and proximity to the major downtown area in Burlingame. The
dominant building type envisaged for this area is multi-story apartment buildings.
Areas for medium high density residential uses are designated around the periphery of the
Burlingame Avenue-Park Road center, around the Broadway shopping center, and as a part of the
complex of activities in the Burlingame Plaza area. In addition, the frontage along most of El
Camino Real is included in this category. The medium high density residential areas in many
instances provide a transition between higher intensity uses and adjoining lower intensity uses.
The typical building type contemplated for the medium high density area is the two to three story
apartment building but higher buildings would also be appropriate.
Medium density areas shown on the plan diagram would be occupied in the main by duplexes
and one and two story garden apartment developments.
City of Burlingame                                L-2                                       General Plan
                                                                                     LAND USE ELEMENT
Low density areas with single-family detached residences, occupy the remainder of the City. For
the most part existing low density residential areas are well maintained and of good quality,
requiring only that present zoning be maintained to ensure protection for the useful life of the
dwellings (20, 30 or more years).
INSTITUTIONAL USES
The following types of institutional uses are provided for: civic buildings, public schools, private
schools and churches, and other quasi-public and private institutions.
          Civic Buildings. The new site for City Hall on Bellevue Avenue, with the main library
          across the corner of the street, provides a locus for other civic buildings and institutional
          activities serving the entire City. No specific recommendations are included at this time
          for additional public buildings, however. Other civic buildings include the United States
          Post Office on Park Road, which is in a good location to serve the downtown district; the
          main library previously mentioned; and branch library on Easton Drive. No specific
          proposals for library expansion are included since this subject is under separate study.
          Public Schools. All existing school sites within the City are recognized on the plan
          diagram except the Pershing School which is recommended to be converted to a
          neighborhood center and neighborhood park. Most of the schools in Burlingame are on
          sites that are too small to provide suitable plants for educational purposes let alone any
          local neighborhood or community use. A special study of the school site and plant
          requirements should be undertaken in collaboration with the Burlingame Elementary
          School District and the San Mateo Union High School District. However, since the City
          is not currently faced with a large increase in school population it would probably be wise
          to defer such a study until the results of the 1970 census are available to provide more
          information on population characteristics and trends and thus better guidelines for
          probable school plant requirements. In addition, the issue of school district unification is
          still not settled and unification could make a considerable difference in the utilization of
          school plants in and around Burlingame.
          Private Schools and Churches. Existing private schools are recognized on the plan
          diagram. In the main these are reasonably well located with good access from arterial or
          collector streets. Existing churches are also recognized on the plan diagram and again, in
          the main, are quite well located in relation to arterial and collector streets. The private
          schools and churches are recognized in this plan primarily to indicate their relationship to
          other uses of land and the circulation system.
          Other Institutional Uses. Other institutional uses including facilities to serve members
          of associations, fraternal organizations, youth groups, social and welfare organizations,
          should be located in or adjacent to the business districts.
City of Burlingame                                  L-3                                        General Plan
                                                                                    LAND USE ELEMENT
          Standards and Requirements. Any new institutional uses serving city-wide or larger
          areas should be located on arterial streets, and preferably adjacent to commercial centers.
          Institutional uses serving a sub-unit of the City should be located on an arterial or
          collector street and in a location providing ready access to the area served. The City
          should establish a new zoning district to apply to all sites on which there are institutional
          or public uses. The regulations for this district should permit the continuance of existing
          uses and prohibit changes in use without City authorization. This would permit the City
          to take appropriate action to ensure that potential sites for parks, and buildings suitable
          for public assembly are not lost to public use.
PARKS
Three classes of parks and open spaces are included in the plan: community parks, neighborhood
parks, and preserves.
Community parks include the three existing park sites - Bayside Park, Washington Park, and
Mills Canyon Park - and a proposed new area for a natural park between Skyline Boulevard and
Junipero Serra Freeway on presently undeveloped land. The areas indicated as preserves include
a steep hillside along Canyon Drive in Burlingame Hills where a scenic easement should be
established to protect existing vegetation and ensure that this beautiful area will remain in its
present wooded condition providing both scenic amenity and protection against erosion and
damage to the creek channel. The other area indicated as a preserve is adjacent to Mills Canyon
Park. In this case it would be most desirable if the lands on the southwest side of the creek were
acquired in fee and added to the park. If this is not possible or practical, a scenic easement should
be acquired to protect existing vegetation in this canyon.
The plan diagram shows a park strip around the Anza Airport Park industrial subdivision and
along the lagoon between that subdivision and Bayshore Freeway. Part of this would be on land
now leased to the City along the lagoon. An easement should be acquired to provide for public
walks along the Bay side of the property. In addition, specific provision should be made for a
pedestrian crossing of the arterial road proposed along the Bay front between the City's park and
the waters of the Bay. Where this road adjoins the park, it should be kept at the lowest possible
elevation to minimize the effect of traffic on the park. This will be discussed in further detail in
the subsequent section of this plan dealing with the waterfront.
          Neighborhood Parks. All existing neighborhood parks are recommended to be
          continued. In addition, new neighborhood parks are recommended in the following
          general locations: in the Easton Drive area between Bernal Avenue and El Camino Real;
          in the Mills Estate area north of Trousdale Drive between Sebastian Drive and Ashton
          Avenue; in the area between Carolan Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard north of Oak
          Grove Avenue; south of Carmelita Avenue near Paloma Avenue; on the Pershing School
          site. As has been done in the past, it is recommended that the City acquire individual lots
          where they become available in these general areas.
City of Burlingame                                   L-4                                      General Plan
                                                                                    LAND USE ELEMENT
          In addition, to augment the small sites of many of the existing neighborhood parks and
          elementary schools, acquisition of adjoining lots is recommended whenever such become
          available. In some instances street closings of very short sections of streets could be used
          to augment existing sites or to link schools and parks together. In some instances such
          closings would increase traffic safety in addition to providing very much needed park
          space.
COMMERCIAL USES
Three complexes of commercial uses are included in this plan: the Burlingame Plaza Area, the
Broadway center, and the Burlingame Avenue-Park Road center. In these centers of commercial
activity three general categories of commercial uses are shown on the plan diagram: Shopping
and Service, Service and Special Sales, and Office Use. In addition to the commercial uses in
these three centers of activity an additional category of commercial use, Waterfront/Commercial,
is indicated along most of the waterfront area.
          Burlingame Plaza Area. This area includes outlets providing convenience goods and
          consumer services to local residents and workers; the Peninsula Hospital and medical
          offices; and other professional-administrative offices. No changes are recommended in
          the pattern of uses presently established. The visual quality of the shopping center should
          be improved and the parking area serving the shopping center needs redesign and tree
          planting to improve functional efficiency and appearance.
          Broadway Center. Outlets in this center now provide convenience goods and consumer
          services for residents in the general vicinity. Although many of the businesses here are
          well established and apparently successful enterprises, better circulation, more parking,
          and better urban design would enhance this center. Separation of vehicular and pedestrian
          circulation and reduction of through-traffic on Broadway is needed. Recommendations
          for improving the traffic circulation pattern are presented in the Circulation Element.
          These include a grade separation for the railroad tracks and improvement of the
          Broadway-Bayshore Freeway interchange to relieve traffic congestion at that point.
          Consideration should be given to creating a pedestrian precinct on Broadway in the
          section between Laguna Avenue and Capuchino Avenue. Additional off-street parking
          should be provided to the rear of present business outlets fronting on Broadway with
          access to such lots from the new streets indicated on the plan diagram. An urban design
          plan should be developed for this center to provide more detailed guidance for future
          changes.
          Burlingame Avenue-Park Road Center. This center includes outlets providing a wide
          range of consumer goods and services for Burlingame residents and residents of adjoining
          communities. It also includes business service establishments, business and professional
          offices, civic buildings, and some residential uses. The following organization of uses
          within the center is recommended: shopping goods outlets should, in the main, be located
          along Burlingame Avenue and Park Road in a pedestrian precinct; convenience goods
City of Burlingame                                  L-5                                       General Plan
                                                                                    LAND USE ELEMENT
          stores, restaurants, and consumer service outlets should not occupy ground level street
          frontage space in the heart of the center but should be in more peripheral locations; the
          frontage of the west side of Chapin Avenue should be limited to office uses; the Service
          and Special Sales area indicated along California Drive and Highland Avenue recognizes
          the existing auto sales and service activities and provides space for expansion of "auto
          row" businesses or other similar kinds of activity; an area between Highland Avenue and
          Park Road is designated for medium high density residential development. This
          downtown center presents a prime opportunity to develop combinations of retail, office
          and residential uses in clusters of appropriately designed structures. Sites on the
          periphery would be appropriate for apartments of single persons and families without
          children particularly those who want the advantages of a location near a center of activity
          and do not wish to own an automobile. Areas designated for shopping and service uses
          along Park and Primrose Roads south of Howard Avenue are appropriate locations for
          office and institutional uses in addition to retail and consumer service establishments.
          Measures to enhance appearance and attractiveness of this area should be given particular
          attention so as to provide an inviting entrance to Burlingame's downtown center.
          Appropriate concepts for physical design and beautification should be applied throughout
          the center. An urban design plan for the entire downtown area should be developed. The
          relationship between future development of the downtown area and rapid transit and other
          aspects of the circulation system are discussed in the Circulation Element of this plan.
          Waterfront-Commercial. The areas indicated on the plan diagram for waterfront-
          commercial uses should be limited to activities that either depend on waterfront location
          or directly benefit from location on the waterfront. Further guidelines for development of
          the waterfront are presented in the Waterfront Element of the plan.
INDUSTRIAL USES
The areas indicated in this category on the plan diagram are intended to continue the present
pattern with occupancy by wholesale outlets, professional and administrative offices, and light
manufacturing plants. The major problems now existing in these areas are inadequate access and
lack of public transportation. Recommendations regarding these problems are included in the
Circulation Element of the plan. It is anticipated that the East Millsdale area will be increasingly
sought as a location for airport-related uses.
PUBLIC FACILITIES
Burlingame has a number of public facilities in addition to its civic buildings. The wastewater
treatment plant, located on Airport Boulevard, provides primary, secondary, and some tertiary
treatment for the city, its sphere of influence (Burlingame Hills) and about half of Hillsborough.
A water distribution system is also provided for this geographical area by the city. Finally, the
city provides trash collection and limited trash disposal on a site adjacent to the wastewater
treatment facility on Airport Boulevard. These disposal facilities serve only city residents and
municipal needs.

COMMERCIAL-RESIDENTIAL MIXED USE
This land use is composed of retail commercial and multiple family residential uses intended to
create a transition between established retail commercial and residential zones. It is intended in
this district that only residential uses may occur on a parcel, or retail commercial with residential
above, so that the sense of residential activity is conserved. Retail uses compatible with
residential uses, however, can serve to meld the adjacent wholly retail and residential areas.
Included in this district are physically unique areas such as the properties with double street
frontage on Edgehill and California Drives.

                                    INTRODUCTION
LEGAL BASIS AND GENERAL OBJECTIVES
California State Government Code Section 65302(g) requires a Noise Element of all city and
county general plans. This code section requires that the Noise Element be expressed in
quantitative terms, showing contours of present and projected noise levels associated with all
existing and proposed major transportation elements. The sources of environmental noise
considered in this analysis shall include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) highways and
freeways, (ii) primary arterials and major local streets, (iii) passenger and freight on-line railroad
operations and ground rapid transit systems, (iv) commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop,
and military airport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all, other ground
facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation, (v) local industrial plants,
including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards, and (vi) other ground stationary noise
sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.
The scope and nature of Noise Elements are outlined as follows by the California Council on
Intergovernmental Relations.
          1.       A statement of general policy indicating the local jurisdiction's general intentions
                   regarding noise and noise sources in the community.
          2.       Desired maximum noise levels by land use categories.
          3.       Standards and criteria for noise emissions from transportation facilities. (It should
                   be noted that control of some noise sources has been pre-empted by State and
                   Federal governments.)
          4.       Standards and criteria for compatible noise levels for local "fixed point" noise
                   sources.
          5.       Guide to implementation.
          6.       Appendix describing methodology of preparation and sources of data.
The three main purposes of the Burlingame Noise Element deal with noise control in planning,
surveillance and enforcement actions. With regard to planning, the objective of the Noise
Element is to present noise level criteria which future planning, zoning and building inspection
processes can utilize to promote maximum compatibility of land uses and activities. With regard
to surveillance, the Noise Element should determine the present noise climate in Burlingame,
predict the noise climate for 1990, and determine what surveillance (monitoring) is necessary to
assure that noise levels do not increase. Additional surveillance may be needed with regard to
specialized noise sources such as the San Francisco International Airport. With regard to
enforcement, the Noise Element should determine which enforcement programs are best suited

                                                                                        NOISE ELEMENT
to the City of Burlingame; that is, where Burlingame should apply its police powers to have the
most beneficial impact on its noise climate.
The Noise Element begins with a background section which is followed by a description and
analysis of existing and future acoustic conditions in the City; a measurement program was
conducted to quantify the existing noise climate. This description is followed by the Planning
Criteria Emissions Section which sets forth suggested planning criteria and standards. The Noise
Abatement and Control Section follows with a description of a wide range of noise abatement
and control programs available to the City. Finally, the Implementation Section recommends
goals, policies and implementation programs thought appropriate for Burlingame considering its
present and future noise climate, its General Plan and its citizen interests.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
The City of Burlingame is highly impacted by noise from five major traffic arteries - Bayshore
Freeway, Southern Pacific Railroad, California Drive, El Camino Real and the Junipero Serra
Freeway. While airport noise most acutely impacts industrial and commercial land uses, it also
affects residential areas adversely. During worst case months in the winter and early spring,
airport noise severely impacts many residential areas. Residential and public facilities (schools,
parks, hospitals) land uses adjacent to the City's major traffic arteries are highly impacted by
noise with the area adjacent to Bayshore Freeway being impacted to the greatest degree. Noise
in these areas immediately adjacent to the arterials is unacceptable from both a hearing
conservation and land use compatibility standpoint. Noise levels in commercial areas are
generally acceptable except in those areas immediately adjacent to major traffic arteries. Noise
levels in industrial areas are generally acceptable.
MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS
In order to attain acceptable noise levels in the future, the following programs are recommended.
          1.       Administrative Review Process - Existing City processes involved with
                   environmental impact review and building plan check, permit and inspection
                   should be altered to include specific noise level planning criteria. Proposed new
                   construction projects and major remodeling projects should be required to
                   conform to specific noise provisions of the State Housing Act; this will require
                   acoustical analysis in many cases.
          2.       Airport Noise Surveillance Program - A two to three year monitoring program
                   is recommended to record especially the worst case noise in Burlingame from the
                   airport. This program would specifically monitor the noise caused by aircraft
                   flights over Burlingame during adverse weather conditions.
          3.       Vehicle Noise Emission Standards Enforcement - An enforcement program
                   should be undertaken to assure that State vehicle noise emission standards are
                   being met by motor vehicles on Burlingame's streets.

          4.       Municipal Vehicle and Maintenance Operations Control, Educational
                   Campaign, Noise Ordinance, and Bayshore Freeway Noise Attenuation
                   Study - are other programs recommended in the Noise Element; it is
                   recommended that any domestic animal noise ordinance program be deferred
                   until San Francisco's recent experience with such a program can be monitored and
                   assessed.

                                   BACKGROUND
AREA COVERED
The City of Burlingame is located in northern San Mateo County approximately 16 miles
southeast of San Francisco. The City's close proximity to San Francisco and its airport together
with the fact that many of its residential buildings are more than 40 years old or predate the
airport has brought pressures for increased density in many parts of the City and for commercial
development along the waterfront near the airport. In future years, some parts of the City will be
developed for the first time and other parts of the City will be redeveloped at higher densities.
This Noise Element of the General Plan will help to assure that future development will be
carried out so as to promote a quieter Burlingame. The entire City was monitored to determine
its present noise climate. Measurement sites covered (i) all of the major sources of noise in
Burlingame - motor vehicles, aircraft and stationary sources, e.g. car washes, (ii) all of the
receptor land uses of noise - residential and public facility (parks, hospitals, schools) land uses,
commercial land uses, and industrial land uses.
FACTORS CONSIDERED
The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) measurement descriptor was chosen most
appropriate to the City of Burlingame; this technique weights (or penalizes) evening (1900-2200)
and nighttime (2200-0700) noise more heavily than daytime (0700-1900) noise to account for the
greater annoyance caused by noise during these periods. In addition to accounting for the
diurnal variation of noise, the choice of this CNEL descriptor also permits comparison with
airport CNEL contours developed by the San Francisco International Airport. Other factors
taken in account in the production of the CNEL contours are vehicle volume and mix (day,
evening and night), average speed, pavement width, vehicle flow characteristics, and
topography. The effect of buildings as noise barriers was not taken into account in contour
production. Development of the planning criteria and implementation sections of the Noise
Element involved consideration of many factors - the Burlingame General Plan, citizen interests
(as indicated by the Burlingame Noise Questionnaire), present and future acoustic conditions,
and current governmental rulings and information on noise-related matters. A bibliography on
sources of information relating to the various aspects of noise is provided in Appendix 8, Part A.

                                                                                      NOISE ELEMENT
                      EXISTING AND PROJECTED
                          ACOUSTIC CONDITIONS
In order to arrive at city-wide goals and determine acceptable land uses which will provide a
pleasing acoustic environment for members of the community, it is necessary to identify present
acoustic conditions and to attain some knowledge of probable future conditions. This was
achieved by taking actual measurements of ambient noise in Burlingame and by the application
of a noise propagation model to predict the noise climate for the years 1975 and 1990. A more
complete description of the methodology used is given in Appendix 8, Technical Part A,
although a brief description is included in the two following sections.
EXISTING ACOUSTIC CONDITIONS
In order to determine the existing Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) in Burlingame
and to characterize spatial and temporal variations, 52 sound level measurements were made.
Measurements were made during rush hour, midday, evening and night and on both weekday
and weekend. The Community Noise Equivalent Level is expressed in decibels on the A-
weighting scale (dBA) and weights evening noise (1900-2200) three times as much as daytime
noise (0700-1900) and nighttime noise ten times as much as daytime noise. Thus, this weighting
of evening and nighttime noise purposely causes CNELs to appear higher than actual evening
and nighttime measurements are; this is done to account for increased annoyance and activity
interference caused by noise during the evening and nighttime periods. The measurement sites
were chosen so as to represent a variety of land uses and zoning types, including residential,
commercial, industrial, school, hospital, parks and open space areas; 15-minute samples were
collected.
The sound level acquisition system used was a Bruel and Kjaer Model 166B/S45 Environmental
Noise Classifier. This noise monitoring instrument registers the time during which noise was
measured in 12 different noise level ranges as well as the total time of the monitoring sample.
The output is a digital readout which is recorded manually in the field. Concurrent observations
of meteorology, traffic and noise source characteristics were made. The instrument was
calibrated before each sampling period.
The A-weighting network was used for all measurements. This network modifies sounds in the
same way as the human ear does, and noise measured on this scale (the dBA scale) correlates
well with human annoyance. The dBA unit is the one most commonly used in describing all
types of community noise sources. In addition, most laws and ordinances pertaining to noise
from highway and stationary sources are expressed in terms of dBA. Table 3-1 shows typical
dBA levels for common noise sources.
The 52 samples, each of 15 minute duration, were taken at 36 different locations in Burlingame;
15 minutes is considered to be a sufficient time period for a statistically valid representation of
both constant noise and noise sources such as traffic streams. Total traffic volume and truck
counts were noted, as well as vehicle speed estimates. The measurement sites are shown
graphically in Figure 3-1.

To obtain estimated CNEL values for all of the measurement locations, five locations were
chosen as representative of the various noise sub-climates in the City and the different land uses
upon which they occur; the location of these sites is also indicated on Figure 3-1. For industrial
land uses, the representative measurement site chosen was along Bayshore Highway between
Malcolm and Mitten streets. This site was chosen for three purposes: (i) it is representative of
industrial land use noise, (ii) it is representative of airport-generated noise which impinges on the
majority of time industrially zoned area of Burlingame, and (iii) it is an area which the
Burlingame General Plan indicates for future development as waterfront commercial. For
commercial land uses, the representative measurement site chosen was along El Camino
immediately west of its intersection with Primrose and Bayswater. This site was chosen (i)
because of its location near El Camino Real - representative of the many well-traveled streets
which traverse all commercial areas in the City, (ii) because of its close proximity to the
downtown commercial area and the traffic entering and exiting this area.

As residential land uses are the most sensitive land uses with regard to noise intrusion, three
separate measurement sites were chosen to represent different residential areas. Noise intrusion
into residential areas of Burlingame takes three forms - little outside intrusion, intrusion from
Bayshore Freeway--from traffic arterials, and from aircraft noise. Along Rollins Road adjacent
to Bayshore Freeway, a measurement site was chosen at its intersection with Dwight Road and
Trenton Way. This is the residential area in Burlingame which is most affected by freeway
noise. Along Trousdale Drive, a measurement site was chosen north of Sebastian Drive in order
to represent residential areas in Burlingame affected by airport noise; this site is located within
the 65 CNEL contour in the Airport Land Use Commission's adopted Interim Airport Land Use
Plan. It should be noted that this area is not located within the 65 CNEL contour in the latest
EIAR published by the San Francisco International Airport. A third measurement site was
chosen on Devereux Drive near its intersection with Balboa Avenue. This measurement was
taken at Abraham Lincoln School and is representative of those residential areas which are not
affected by noise generated outside the area - that is, by noise on an arterial street such as El-
Camino Real, Peninsula Avenue, etc.

Table 3-2(see previous page N-8) presents the results of the actual CNEL measurements taken at
these five representative sites. The computed CNEL values on this table illustrate the range of
noise levels found near various roadways and other noise sources. The CNEL levels are related
to land use and Federally recommended levels in the Planning Criteria and Noise Emissions
Section of this report. To summarize, the freeway residential area is presently at an exterior
noise level which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers harmful to health.
The industrial and commercial area are not substantially quieter. Only the quietest residential
noise levels measured are presently within CNEL levels recommended for single family living.
Utilizing the L evening and L night values from these representative measurement sites, the
CNEL was estimated for the remainder of the sites which were monitored during the day. Table
3-3 presents the results of all the 15 minute roadway noise measurements, including the day,
evening, or night average noise level (Ld, Le, Ln) for the period measured, the L-10 and the
estimated CNEL.
The 52 measurements just described were next utilized to validate a computer model; the
validated model then was used to predict noise propagation.
Basic input information for the model was made up of ground transportation and roadway
characteristics such as Average Daily Traffic (ADT), vehicle mix or percent of trucks, roadway
width and number of travel lanes. The output from the computer run of this model was
translated onto a zoning map of Burlingame in the form of noise impacted areas or contours.
This map of present acoustic conditions in Burlingame is included here as Figure 3-5.
In order to make Figure 3-5 more meaningful, a discussion of Burlingame's major noise sources
and their relative contribution to the City's noise climate is also presented. The City's major
sources of noise are automobile, truck and motorcycle traffic, airport related takeoff, landing and
ground operations, and railroad traffic.
Existing Automobile, Truck and Motorcycle Noise
In Burlingame, automobile, truck and motorcycle traffic noise affects more land area to a greater
degree (higher noise level) than does aircraft noise. Figure 3-2 indicates the Average Annual
Daily Traffic (ADT) on the highways and well-traveled streets in the City. Many properties of
noise cause the traffic on these highways and streets to affect the areas through which they pass.
The number of heavy-duty trucks relative to the total traffic volume (truck mix) is very important
with regard to noise propagation, since trucks, especially diesels, are generally considerably
noisier than cars. Truck noise is also emitted at a greater height (for both tires and engine noise)
than is car noise and is therefore more difficult to abate. Truck mix on Burlingame's streets and
highways is typical of the Bay Area; it varies from two percent in residential areas to eight
percent on Bayshore Freeway to twelve percent on Rollins Road in Burlingame's industrial area.

Existing Airport Noise
Airport noise from San Francisco International Airport takes many forms. The airport contours
shown in Figure 3-5 are the 1975 CNEL Average Annual contours from the San Francisco
International Airport (SFO) Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR). Because these
are average annual contours, they do not reflect the worst-case airport noise which occurs in
Burlingame. Even the 1974 Average Seasonal Day CNEL contours also contained in the EIAR
do not represent the worst case airport noise in Burlingame. These seasonal contours were based
upon runway utilization distributions during the months of May and June; the worst-case months
during which Burlingame is affected by airport noise are historically October, December,
January, February and March.
During these latter five months, southerly and south-westerly winds necessitate takeoff and
landing patterns to shift so that aircraft arrive and depart over the City of Burlingame. The
operations depart from Runway 19 and arrive on Runway 1. According to Landrum and Brown
1974 data utilized in the latest EIAR (3-2), annual departures from Runway 19 totaled 1 percent;
annual arrivals onto Runway 1 totaled .33 percent. More importantly, March was the peak
departure month with 7 percent of total departures from Runway 1, December and February were
peak arrival months with 2 percent of total landings onto Runway 1. Applying these percentages
to the arrival/departure totals for these months, it can be determined that 823 total aircraft
departed from Runway 19 in March, 240 total aircraft arrived on Runway 1 in December and
207 total planes arrived on Runway 1 in February.
The percentage number of flights utilizing this runway pair during worst-case months (relative to
Burlingame) fluctuates according to weather fluctuations each year. For instance, 1972 data
indicates the peak arrival month to be February with 3.58 percent of its total arrivals onto
Runway 1; in March of that year, arrivals onto Runway 1 comprised 1.64 percent of total
arrivals. Historically, the 1974,7 percent figure for March is high. These calculations indicate
that while these worst-case months aren't reflected in the average annual impact of airport noise
in Burlingame and don't show up on average annual noise contours, the City of Burlingame is
more heavily affected by noise for certain months of each year than others. During these
months, some aircraft take off over Burlingame's industrial area, make a left turn over Peninsula
Hospital and fly south above El Camino Real; other aircraft land in approximately the reverse
pattern.
Although the worst-case months were not able to be monitored during this study, many
measurements were taken to assess the airport's contribution to Burlingame's noise climate.
Utilizing the Airport Land Use Commission's (ALUC) adopted CNEL contours for the airport as
a guide, many measurement sites were chosen in the hilly areas of Burlingame on either side of
Trousdale Drive including an area extending toward Hillside Drive east of Sebastian Drive. The
representative airport industrial CNEL site in Table 3-2 had a measured CNEL of 73; the airport
residential CNEL site had a measured CNEL of 68. Estimated CNELs for the residential area
described above were 61, 62 or 63; it should be noted that these are estimates and actual CNELs
might be found different if evening and nighttime measurements were taken at all these locations
and actual CNELs computed. Because of the weighting factors involved in CNEL computation,
City of Burlingame                                N-18                                      General Plan
                                                                                      NOISE ELEMENT
estimation utilizing representative measurement sites is only as accurate as the
representativeness of the sample sites.
The freeway residential CNEL site, while not within ALUC adopted airport contours, indicates
an important property of noise especially in regard to the airport's contribution to the overall
noise climate. This site had a measured CNEL of 76 and it illustrates the masking property of
noise. The masking property comes about when two unequal levels of noise are involved in the
same noise climate. The louder noise will mask the quieter noise especially very near the louder
noise. Thus, Bayshore Freeway noise is generally the major transportation noise that people
living adjacent to the freeway (between Cadillac Way and Peninsula Avenue) hear. Two of the
other representative sites in Table 3-2 also serve to indicate the airport's contribution to the
overall noise climate. While there is approximately a 30 percent difference in ADT between
Bayshore Highway and El Camino Real with Bayshore Highway being the lighter traveled street,
the measured CNELs for these two sites are both 73. This indicates that the airport has the effect
of adding approximately 3 dBA to this site on Bayshore Highway.
Existing Railroad Noise
Railroad transportation noise includes the mechanical clanking and rattling of rolling stock, the
sounds of braking, rail wheel noise, aerodynamic friction, engine noise, whistles and the release
of air brake pressure after the train has stopped. Since the Southern Pacific Railroad passes
through the center of Burlingame directly north of California Drive, it is a significant noise
source in the City. Figure 3-4 indicates the high noise level, short time duration of a single train
pass-by. Twenty-two round trip commuter trains, eight freight trains and eight to ten small
peddler or stop and start trains pass through the City each day. Because of the number of train
operations occurring in each time period of a 24-hour day and because of the high noise levels
propagated by each train, the noise contours on either side of the railroad tracks cover great
amounts of land. For instance, the contour on the south side of the tracks contains the noise
contour resulting from California Drive motor vehicle traffic; that is, the railroad operations
generate more noise than do the motor vehicle operations on California Drive. During

City of Burlingame                              N-19                                         General Plan

                                                                                     NOISE ELEMENT
As is described in the Planning Criteria and Noise Emissions Section, the Environmental
Protection Agency has determined that long-term exposure to noise levels higher than an CNEL
of 70 dBA could result in a loss of hearing. This implies that the areas outside of the dwellings in
the residential areas just described are critical with regard to hearing loss. EPA has also
determined that 55 CNEL is the noise level which protects against activity interference and
annoyance.
The second critical land use heavily impacted by present noise in the City is the Public Facilities
land use including schools, parks, hospitals and other public buildings. As can be seen on Figure
3-5, only Pershing School, Hoover School, Abraham Lincoln School, Burlingame Intermediate
School, Peninsula Hospital and the undeveloped Mills Canyon Park are located in areas where
noise levels are below 60 CNEL. None of these schools are located in a 55 CNEL noise
environment which is the level the State has indicated as compatible with educational land uses.
Commercial land uses are generally within the 65 CNEL outdoor noise level planning criterion
suggested in the Planning Criteria and Noise Emissions Section. Exceptions occur along
California Drive, north of El Camino Real in the Trousdale Drive area and along Bayshore
Highway; CNEL levels of 70 and above occur in these commercial areas of the City. All
industrial land uses are within the 75 CNEL outdoor noise level planning criterion suggested in
the Planning Criteria and Noise Emissions Section. All CNEL noise impacted areas are out-of-
doors; interior noise levels will be 12-25 dBA lower depending on type of building construction,
window type and whether windows are open or closed.
FUTURE ACOUSTIC CONDITIONS
For planning and other purposes, it is useful to have an estimate of the future noise climate.
With this in mind, predicted CNEL noise impacted areas have been developed for the ear 1990
and these levels are presented in Figure 3-6. These noise impacted areas have been predicted
utilizing a noise propagation model; the most important input data was future traffic volumes and
noise characteristics of future vehicle model year mix. Average Daily Traffic (ADT) projections
used assumed a ten percent increase from present in traffic on most highways and streets;
exceptions were Bayshore and Junipero Serra Freeways, Bayshore Highway, the western end of
El Camino Real and Broadway which utilized higher projections developed in the San Francisco
International Airport (SFO) Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR), and Airport
Boulevard which utilized projections performed for Burlingame by the JHK traffic consulting
firm. These exceptions to the ten percent increase are indicated in Figure 3-2. Standard
projections of the noise characteristics of future vehicle model year mix were utilized to account
for the increasingly stringent California noise emission standards (outlined in the planning
Criteria and Noise Emissions Section) and the fact that quieter vehicles will replace many of the
relatively noisy vehicles on the road today. The percent of trucks on the road was assumed to
remain constant.

                                                                                      NOISE ELEMENT
Future Automobile, Truck and Motorcycle Noise
In the future, somewhat quieter automobiles, trucks and motorcycles are expected to replace
relatively noisy motor vehicles now on the road. Largely because of this fact, noise impacted
areas due to motor vehicle sources are predicted to decrease in size even though ADT will
increase in the future. Because of a sizeable increase in ADT predicted for Airport Boulevard as
it becomes developed, this area will encounter increased noise emanating from the boulevard
onto adjacent lands. This fact is of special significance for two reasons: (i) this area is largely
undeveloped at present and therefore noise attenuation measures can be required of and designed
into new developments as they occur, (ii) the proposed Bayside City Park in this area is a land
use upon which noise impaction is a critical factor. While a similar, somewhat larger increase in
ADT might be predicted for Bayshore Highway with regard to its potential for bayside
commercial developments, detailed predictions haven't been made regarding such development.
The prediction utilized for this area is based upon increased traffic caused by SFO expansion.
The point is that Figure 3-6 shows the noise climate along Bayshore Highway decreasing by
1990; this prediction might be greatly different if increased traffic from future waterfront
commercial development was predicted in detail.
In 1990, CNEL (Figure 3.6) noise impacted areas along the majority of highways and streets in
the City will decrease by approximately five dBA. Along Bayshore Freeway, Junipero Serra
Freeway, California Drive, El Camino Real, Howard Avenue and Trousdale Drive, noise
impacted areas decrease in size. Along other streets in the City such as Peninsula, Lorton, Park,
Burlingame, Bellevue, Primrose, Carmelita, Broadway south of El Camino Real, Easton,
Hillside, Adeline, Ray, Skyline, Magnolia and Murchison, CNEL levels decrease by
approximately five dBA from the 65-70 range to the 60-65 range. Areas in which noise levels are
below 60 CNEL enlarge in the most areas in the City and especially in residential areas between
Carolan Avenue and Bayshore Freeway.
City of Burlingame                              N-22                                         General Plan

                                                                                      NOISE ELEMENT
Noise intrusion into residential areas is less intense but many areas still do not meet the Planning
Criteria and Noise Emissions Section planning criterion; the residential area adjacent to
Bayshore Freeway is still the most severely impacted residential area in the City and parts of this
area and other residential areas immediately adjacent major arterials are still seriously impacted
with regard to hearing loss criteria. Public facilities land uses have an improved noise climate in
1990. City Hall, a portion of Washington Park and Cuernevaca Park now have a noise
environment lower than 60 CNEL. All other schools, parks and public facilities buildings except
Burlingame High School, a portion of Washington Park and McKinley School encounter noise
environments approximately five CNEL lower than at present. Commercial land uses in the City
meet the Section Four planning criterion of 65 CNEL except for areas adjacent to Broadway
Avenue, California Avenue, old Bayshore Highway and the area north of El Camino Real near
Trousdale Drive. The industrial land uses have an improved motor vehicle-caused noise climate
in 1990 with the majority of land in this use at 65-70 CNEL, well below the Planning Criteria
and Noise Emissions Section planning criterion of 75 CNEL.
Future Airport Noise
Prediction of future airport noise is not included on Figure 3-6. The reason for this is that one
major assumption upon which the SFO EIAR prediction of future noise climate is based has
recently come into question. This assumption is that all aircraft flying in 1990 (with the
exception of the B-727) will have been retrofitted with noise suppressors, "quiet nacelles" or
"refanned" engines in order to meet Federal Aviation Regulations - Part 36. The recent
recommendation to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by the President's Council on
Wage and Price Stability that the retrofitting noisy jets is not worth the cost and would be unduly
inflationary. In addition to this recent Notices of Proposed Rule Makings (NPRMS) from both
EPA and FAA are
still unresolved. Until these NPRMS (one of which involves the retrofit program) are resolved,
definitive future noise predictions of airport noise cannot be made.
Future Railroad Noise
Future railroad noise is not predicted in Figure 3-6; instead, present railroad noise is indicated.
The reason for this, as with future airport noise, is uncertainty with future events related to the
noise source. Until BART, an upgraded Southern Pacific Railroad or some type of improved
fixed-rail transit extends down the Peninsula, it is assumed that Southern Pacific will continue to
operate at approximately its present level. Until some type of improvements are made on the
existing system, noise will remain approximately the same. Present, at grade segments of BART
propagate noise levels of 70-75 dBA at a distance of 50 feet; this would be a 20-25 dBA
reduction compared- to present Southern Pacific Railroad noise levels. However, if Burlingame
should receive a BART station or maintenance yard, attendant noise from motor vehicle trips to
and from, the station and/or increased station or maintenance yard activity might very well
increase over that noise at the present Southern Pacific Railroad station. This type of possible
noise should be adequately handled by an Environmental Impact report and subsequent required
mitigation measures to deal with such noise.

                   PLANNING CRITERIA AND NOISE
                           EMISSION STANDARDS
In planning for a desired community noise climate, two types of consideration are important.
First, due to existing noise sources which are essentially fixed (such as freeways, railroads, and
airports) certain areas may be unsuitable for some types of land use. It is therefore desirable to
establish criteria by which the planner may determine acceptable land uses for a given site with
respect to noise compatibility. Second, limits must be placed on the noise emissions of
individual sources to ensure that noise levels within any given land use remain within or are
scheduled to descend to some recommended level.
Urban areas in general, and the City of Burlingame in particular (considering its proximity to the
San Francisco International Airport) are often too noisy to permit economically feasible methods
of reducing noise levels to theoretically optimal levels. Because of this fact, these theoretical
levels, the actual noise climate, the General Plan and the wishes of the people of Burlingame (as
determined by the noise questionnaire, Appendix C) were all considered prior to formulation of
the noise level planning criteria presented below.
LAND USE PLANNING CRITERIA
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published the results of its
research regarding noise levels and their effects on people. Table 4-1 summarizes the findings of
this document. The three noise levels it arrives at are 70 dB for hearing loss, 55 dB for outdoor
activity interference and annoyance and 45 dB for indoor activity interference and annoyance.
One of the major activities involved in "activity interference and annoyance" concerns the
maintenance of a noise level low enough so as not to interfere with normal human speech; other
activities are sleep, reading, studying, eating, relaxing, listening to records, tapes or radio,
watching television, and occupation-related activities.

These levels are most probably unattainable in much of Burlingame. A Set of recommended
levels which will provide a reasonable noise climate within the City yet not severely inhibit
development have been derived. The suggested outdoor noise levels suitable to various land use
categories are given in Table 4-2.

The recently adopted State Housing Act (Administrative Code, Title 25, Article 4) requires the
following of non-single family detached residential units:
          "(e)      Noise Insulation from Exterior Sources
          (1)       Location and Orientation. Consistent with land-use standards, residential
                    structures located in noise critical areas, such as proximity to select system of
                    county roads and streets (as specified in 186.4 of the State of California Streets
                    and Highways Code), railroads, rapid transit lines, airports, or industrial areas
                    shall be designed to prevent the intrusion of exterior noises beyond prescribed
                    levels with all exterior doors and windows in the closed position. Proper design
                    shall include, but shall not be limited to, orientation of the residential structure,
                    set-backs, shielding, and sound insulation of the building itself.
          (2)       Interior Noise Levels. Interior community noise equivalent levels (CNEL) with
                    windows closed, attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed an annual CNEL
                    of 45 dB in any habitable room.
          (3)       Airport Noise Source. Residential structures to be located within an annual
                    CNEL contour (as defined in Title 4, Subchapter 6, California Administrative
                    Code) of 60 dB require an acoustical analysis showing that the structure has been
                    designed to limit intruding noise to the prescribed allowable levels. CNEL's shall
                    be as determined by the local jurisdiction in accordance with its local general
                    plan. 1
          (4)       Vehicular and Industrial Noise Sources. Residential buildings or structures to be
                    located within annual exterior community noise equivalent level contours of 60
                    dB adjacent to the select system of county roads and city streets (as specified in
                    Section 186.4 of the State of California Streets and Highways Code), freeways,
                    state highways, railroads, rapid transit lines and industrial noise sources shall
                    require an acoustical analysis showing that the proposed building has been

            It should be noted that neither the Airport Land Use Commission's (ALUC) adopted airport contours nor
the latest San Francisco International Airport (SFO) Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) contours
delineate the 60 CNEL line.
City of Burlingame                                         N-28                                         General Plan

                   designed to limit intruding noise to the allowable interior noise levels prescribed
                   in Section T25-1092(e) (2). Exception: Railroads where there are no nighttime
                   (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) railway operations and where daytime (7:00 a.m. to
                   10:00 p.m.) railway operations do not exceed four (4) per day."
Since most residential structures (with windows closed and single pane glass) have the capability
of reducing noise levels, from exterior sources by 20 dBA, the State's interior standard of 45
dBA should normally be achieved when exterior levels do not exceed 65 dBA. It should also be
noted that implementation of the State act requires that the precise location of the 60 dBA
(CNEL) contour be known.
In certain cases where the functional use of a building is such that windows are not opened and
outdoor areas are not used for any reason other than parking and walking into the building,
outdoor noise levels can be ignored and indoor noise level planning criteria may be appropriate.
Such building uses might include indoor auditoriums, certain public buildings, totally-enclosed
shopping centers, certain self-generative business, professional offices, banks, clinics and motels
without outdoor pool or park areas.
In such cases, the indoor noise level planning criterion should be 45 CNEL. The outdoor noise
level planning criteria chosen assure that the 45 CNEL indoor level will be achieved by the noise
attenuation of regular construction materials. Because the indoor noise level planning criteria
waive the outdoor criteria, it is of utmost importance that building plans and building inspections
be very detailed and extensive to assure that the indoor criterion will be achieved. Improper
choice of materials and/or improper installation of such materials can make them ineffectual.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and EPA have jurisdiction over
occupational noise; OSHA allows a maximum Leq of 90 dB for an eight hour day. In view of
the fact that these agencies are still debating the question of adequate occupational noise levels,
and since OSHA has enforcement authority over these levels, it is recommended that the City of
Burlingame defer to the Federal authorities for consideration of occupational noise produced
indoors.
NOISE EMISSION STANDARDS
Noise emission standards may be invoked for the following purposes:
a.        to regulate any noise source (other than aircraft and motor vehicles operating on public
          thoroughfares) which cause violation of the standards.
b.        to determine the suitability of land to be developed considered as a noise source with
          nearby properties considered as receptors to which the standards apply.
Standards for aircraft and ground transportation noise, Burlingame's two major sources of noise,
have been established by State and Federal government agencies. Burlingame can enforce
ground transportation emission standards through its police department; these standards are
therefore presented here. Table 4-4 presents State standards for motor vehicles operating on

Recommended noise emission standards for construction equipment operating in the City of
Burlingame are listed in Table 4-6. These are to be applicable to the named source whether
operated by individuals, companies, public agencies or other organizations. Enforcement of
these standards are discussed in the Noise Abatement and Control Section of this element in
addition to these specific standards, the following standard should be met:
          No person shall be allowed to cause any noise to be emitted past his/her property
          line in any manner so as to create any noise which would cause the ambient L .0
          noise level to be increased by more than 5 dBA. The procedure for determining if
          this standard is being violated is described in Appendix A in the General
          Appendix Document.
The CNEL noise descriptor was not chosen for this standard (i) because it is not adequate for
measuring peak type annoyance noises for which this standard is designed; (ii) it requires
measurements during the day, evening and nighttime periods which make it prohibitively costly
in terms of enforcement. This standard, being both quantitative and measurable prevents
possible errors of subjectivity involved in the enforcement of a noise ordinance.

                NOISE ABATEMENT AND CONTROL
                                       PROGRAMS
Noise levels in Burlingame can be reduced by controlling the three factors of noise propagation:
1) the source of the noise, 2) the path the noise travels, and 3) the receptors of the noise (the
people who hear the noise). The most effective method of noise control is preventing noise from
being generated; all other methods of noise control limit the area affected by the noise.
However, control of the noise source is often not within the realm of local government
capability. Most often, local governments must concentrate on control over the path or the
receptor of noise. Various programs of noise abatement and control are available. A wide range
of such programs is presented here in order that they may be available for the City of
Burlingame=s consideration and possible implementation either now or in the future.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Existing administrative review processes involving environmental impact and building permits
offer local governments a definite method with which to control noise paths, receptors, and to
some extent, sources. There are several existing administrative processes which may be used to
abate noise:
(1)      Determination of need for an Environmental Impact Report for public and private
          projects;
(2)      Design of scope of work for Environmental Impact Report; and
(3)      Inspection of building plans, and issuance of a building permit
Determination of Need For An Environmental Impact Report
In determining the need to produce an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) pursuant to
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), City staff should follow
these guidelines to determine whether significant potential acoustic impacts may arise from the
project. These guidelines are derivative from the noise standards, noise ordinance and the
applicability of CERA to upheld local environmental standards.
Significant acoustic impact may arise whenever any of the following hold within the planning
time window (usually between 2 and 20 years after construction).
Roadway Alteration or Construction:
The guidelines which follow, for determination of need for an environmental impact report in the
event of roadway alteration or construction, provide a means for evaluating noise increases due
to normal growth in traffic as well as those due to increased traffic attracted by a new roadway.
An EIR is required:

          and above normal traffic growth of a roadway segment where neighboring land use is
          hospital, school, park, open space, residential, professional office or commercial; if
          additional average daily truck traffic in excess of 10% is generated adjacent to the same
          land uses; or if roadway operating speeds will increase by more than 10 mph adjacent to
          the same land uses.
b.        If additional ADT in excess of 30% is generated over any roadway segment; if additional
          average truck traffic in excess of 15% is generated by the project over any roadway
          segment; if roadway operating speeds will increase by more than 20 mph over any
          roadway segment.
c.        If additional or new design capacity in excess of 20% of existing ADT is generated by a
          project over any roadway segment whose, neighboring land use is hospital, school, park,
          open space, residential; if additional design capacity in excess of 30% ADT is generated
          by the project adjacent to any land use.
d.        If other significant roadway operations are altered such as: appreciable upward change in
          uphill grade (>3 sustained for linear distance of 100 meters), significant additional
          congestion where average speeds are already less than 20 mph, or significant altered
          traffic corridors of major traffic-carrying roadways (>10,000 ADT).
Residential Developments:
a.        If the development is greater than 40 dwelling units and meets one or more of the
          following:
          (1)      Adds more than 10 percent to ADT on one or more adjacent roadways;
          (2)      Is adjacent to a roadway of peak hour design capacity or approved planned
                   capacity greater than 1000 vehicle/hour;
          (3)      If the development has inter-unit walls (e.g. apartments, townhouses,
                   condominiums).
b.        If the development is greater than 80 dwelling units.
Hospitals and Schools:
If the development provides for more than 100 new or additional beds or enrollment positions
and either the facility adds more than 10 percent to the ADT on one or more adjacent roadways
or is adjacent to a roadway of peak hour design capacity greater than 1000 vehicles/hour.

Professional Office and Commercial:
If the development adds more than 10,000 square feet of leasable commercial or professional
office space and adds more than 10 percent to the ADT on one or more roadways or is adjacent
to a roadway of peak hour design capacity greater than 1000 vehicles/hour.
Construction Activity:
If the development requires construction activity for more than 30 elapsed days using any
combination of sources of noise listed in Table 4-6.
Recreational or Sports Facilities:
If the development could generate peak arrivals or departures of more than 1000 vehicles/hour.
Other:
If the development introduces a now source of stationary noise or otherwise induces increased
traffic levels, railroad activity, or loudspeaker use such that the noise climate for residential,
hospital, school, park, commercial, professional or open space use may be materially modified.
Design of Scope of Work for Environmental Impact Report
If a project has been determined to require an environmental impact report by having met exactly
one of the conditions specified in the Determination of Need for an Environmental Impact
Report, the environmental impact report shall include the following tasks:
Level 1 - Acoustic Analysis:
a.        Measure existing noise levels for at least two distinct sites appropriate to the time of day
          of sensitive activities for the nearby receptor land uses (Including the project site itself).
b.        Predict future noise using a noise propagation model for the most noise sensitive times of
          day for each land use, and for build and no-build futures. The prediction shall consider
          topography, building locations, diffraction effects, microclimate, traffic conditions
          (including vehicle volume, speed, and mix), and combinations of noise sources. Two
          future years shall be considered; 2 and 20 years after construction.
c.        Derive mitigating measures for abating and reducing noise, including a consideration of
          ways of altering traffic volumes, other traffic operating characteristics, zoning, and a
          consideration of the use of noise barriers. In this sense the proposed project must be
          considered both as a noise receptor and a noise producer.
If the project has been determined to require an environmental impact report by having met two
or more of the conditions specified in the Determination of Need for an Environmental Impact
Report, or if one condition is met with any traffic volume more than twice the threshold traffic
volume specified, then the following tasks shall be included in the environmental impact report:

                                                                                        NOISE ELEMENT
Level 2 - Acoustic Analysis:
a.        Measure noise levels for at least five distinct locations appropriate to the time of day of
          noise sensitive activities for the nearby receptor land uses (including the project site
          itself).
b.        Predict future noise using a noise propagation model for the most noise sensitive times of
          day for each land use, and for build and no-build futures. The prediction shall consider
          topography, building locations, diffraction effects, microclimate, traffic conditions
          (including vehicle volume, speed and mix) and combinations of noise sources. Two
          future years shall be considered; 2 and 20 years after construction.
c.        Derive mitigating measures for abating and reducing noise, including a consideration of
          ways of altering traffic volumes, other traffic operating characteristics, zoning, and a
          consideration of the use of noise barriers. In this sense the proposed project must be
          considered both as a noise receptor and a noise producer. Consider project alternatives
          specifically to mitigate acoustic impacts. Consider trade-offs of noise, air quality, traffic,
          water quality and other impacts in these mitigating actions and project alternatives.
Implementation of the California State Uniform Building Code Acoustical Clearances
As an integral part of the building permit system, the following procedure is recommended for
implementation by the city staff initiation of the program requires the city to appoint a member
of the city staff to administer the acoustical review process which could include review of the
noise elements of the Environmental Impact Statement. Hereafter, the term "city staff" is used to
denote such an administrator. One of his functions is also to determine one or more companies
qualified to perform acoustical analyses until such time as the city may have field measurement
equipment, trained field personnel, and an operational noise propagation model.
Step 1: Review for Adequacy of Data:
The city staff will review plans for proposed buildings which are subject to the provisions of the
State Code, to insure adequate data has been submitted for an acoustical analysis to be
performed. The data submitted must contain:
a.        Name, address and telephone number of project architect.
b.        Project location and plan of final grading, including description and location of any noise
          abatement structures.
c.        Plan view of entire project structure, showing distance from each perimeter wall to the
          property line.
d.        Plans of each wall showing the height of each door and window with respect to final
          grade.

                                                                                        NOISE ELEMENT
e.        Cross sections of walls and roof; additional cross sections for windows and doors and
          their connections to the rest of the structure.
f.        Description of construction and insulation materials for all exterior walls, roof, doors,
          and window.
g.        All acoustical data (or citations thereto) of which the applicant is aware concerning the
          acoustical characteristics of the vicinity of the proposed development or special
          characteristics of the proposed building materials. This data should specifically include
          the location of the 60 CNEL contour as required by State law (see Land Use Planning
          Criteria Section).
Step 2: Acoustical Analysis:
After the city staff reviews the initial project description, and the above data, written notice will
be given to the applicant indicating (i) areas of insufficient data or (ii) a statement that data needs
are adequate and a list of approved acoustical consultants from whom the applicant may obtain
services. Note that two future noise forecast years are required. The acoustical analysis must be
rendered for representative dwellings along each project boundary to assure that traffic or other
external sources which vary around the development perimeter are addressed. The acoustical
analyst will certify compliance of plans with the State Code, or alternatively, lack of compliance,
with recommended abatement measures.
AIRCRAFT NOISE
Aircraft noise emanating both from overhead and ground operations is an important noise
consideration in Burlingame. The principal practical methods available to the City for abatement
of such noise are related to indoor levels. Considering the outdoor life style prevalent in
California, this method of noise abatement is not totally satisfactory; control over the source is
therefore another alternative method for consideration in abating aircraft noise. Since control
over aircraft as a noise source is pre-empted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the City of Burlingame's ability to influence
aircraft noise levels is largely limited to technical, legal and political interfaces with San
Francisco Airport, the FAA and the EPA.
A 1973 EPA report, required by the 1974 Federal Noise Control Act, for aircraft and airport
noise problems concluded that it appears that existing FAA flight and operational controls do not
adequately protect the public health and welfare from aircraft noise. Since this report, EPA and
FAA have been working together on various measures to assure that aircraft noise is abated or
controlled in a timely manner. It should be noted that the final decision to modify or adopt new
regulations for the control of aviation noise is the responsibility of FAA. It is recommended that
Burlingame act in a technical review capacity to insure that (i) airport monitoring sites are in the
most meaningful locations to report the exposure of Burlingame residents to aircraft noise and
(ii) aircraft noise abatement is taking place as quickly as feasible and on schedule with stated
goals and those levels required by law.
City of Burlingame                                 N-38                                       General Plan
                                                                                     NOISE ELEMENT
Airport Noise Surveillance Program
It is recommended that the City of Burlingame require its staff or a noise consultant to
independently assess the noise climate on an annual basis and especially during the January-
February storm, weather season based on the San Francisco Airport's required noise monitoring
data. Utilizing the assessment of 1975 airport noise climate in Burlingame (presented in the
Existing and Projected Acoustical Conditions Section), the annual assessment would give a
technical appraisal of progress toward reduced levels of airport noise. This assessment should
include (i) determining the locational suitability of the SFO Airport noise monitoring system; (ii)
assessing the validity of noise measurements taken at this system's locations in Burlingame; and
(iii) analyzing the thoroughness of data reduction in particular to insure meteorological factors
affecting atmospheric noise propagation.
It is recommended that the City would assign a staff member or consultant the task of keeping
abreast of all airport activities relevant to the City of Burlingame=s noise climate. This person
would be in contact with the City and County of San Francisco Airport=s Commission, the
County of San Mateo Airport Land Use Commission, the San Francisco International Airport,
the Federal Aviation Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of
Bay Area Governments and other Bay Area cities surrounding and impacted by the airport.
This person should bring matters of import to the Planning Commission and City Council in
order that these bodies might consider policy statements, recommendations etc. to be sent to
various governmental organizations for various reasons.
Litigation
The City Attorney for Burlingame should also keep abreast of airport-related litigation in the
State and in the Country. The tracking activity described above could aid the City Attorney in
keeping abreast of litigation, and also might suggest possible avenues of action by the City of
Burlingame with respect to various governmental agencies connected with the airport. The
results of the noise consultant's annual monitoring of aircraft noise may constitute grounds for
litigation.
All of the above recommendations for staff participation in aircraft noise related activity could
be (at the City's discretion) combined with tasks of a Noise Enforcement Officer also responsible
for enforcement of other aspects of the noise element.
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION NOISE
There are many possible noise control and abatement programs to deal with surface
transportation noise. The administrative review process covered above is one method of dealing
with such noise; other methods will be outlined below.
City of Burlingame                                N-39                                     General Plan
                                                                                     NOISE ELEMENT
Truck Routes
Since trucks are generally the noisiest vehicles on the road, establishment and strict enforcement
of truck routes in the City could serve to lower noise levels in noise sensitive areas. It must be
realized that such enforced truck routes will cause increases in noise on the subject streets and
hardship for truck drivers with tight time schedules. For this reason, existing somewhat out-of-
date truck routes should be reassessed with both truck freight time schedules and noise sensitive
areas taken into account. After such consideration, truck routes may be redesignated with
educational campaign and leniency period set up after which strict enforcement should take
place. After a period of one to three months, a review should be undertaken and modifications in
the truck routes made to alleviate unforeseen problems.
Vehicle Remission Standard Enforcement
The enforcement of vehicle noise emission standards presented in the Planning Criteria and
Noise Emissions Standards Section can help to reduce the number of illegally loud vehicles
operating on Burlingame streets. This would require assignment of one police officer (part or
full-time); this person would need to be trained to use at least a small inexpensive noise meter
(less than $500) which the City would purchase. For instance, the City of Palo Alto has had
great success with such a program. Such a police enforcement officer might also respond to
noise complaints not involving vehicles. Such complaints as barking dogs or loud music might
be found to be illegally noisy depending upon which noise standards are finally agreed upon for
inclusion in a City Noise Ordinance. Alternatively the City might rely on consulting support for
measurement and technical assistance to reduce the time and training demands on a police
officer.
Rerouting Traffic/Neighborhood Traffic Plans
A study of traffic rerouting schemes could be employed to adjust the noise climate (via traffic
routes) to the City's wishes. Neighborhood traffic plans utilizing such techniques as traffic
diverters and dead end streets might be employed to assure that through traffic does not utilize
short-cuts through residential areas. The City of Berkeley has recently adopted a city-wide
traffic plan aimed at forcing through traffic onto major arterials. Such a plan should take into
account the potential increases in noise due to such a shift as well as the decreases.
Encourage Quiet Transit
Encouragement and actual implementation of mass transit and carpool systems (buses or BART
type systems) has potential in terms of decreasing the number of noise-producing vehicles on the
road. Progress on these systems may be limited by available capital and coordination with other
agencies.
City of Burlingame                              N-40                                       General Plan
                                                                                      NOISE ELEMENT
Municipal Vehicle Noise Control
The City should set a good example, especially prior to any educational campaign, by making
sure that all municipal vehicles are as quiet as possible. This is especially true of City vehicles
operating at noise-sensitive hours such as street-sweepers.
Reduce Roadway Speeds
By reducing the speed of traffic flow, there will generally be a reduction of the sound levels,
emanating from those roadways. Selective enforcement along problem roads, possibly by the
same enforcement person as discussed above in the Surface Transportation Noise Section, could
be of great value.
Noise Barriers
In the event that a noise standard is exceeded, various mitigating and abatement measures are
available for implementation. These involve various levels of expense and effectiveness. A list
of possible abatement measures appears in Table 5-1. Some of the more practical measures are
discussed in more detail in Appendix A of the General Plan Appendix Volume. It should be
noted that some of the measures in Table 5-1 may be cost prohibitive; others may not provide the
effectiveness required. Each particular noise problem will need to be dealt with individually by
a competent acoustical analysis firm in order for the suitable method to be chosen. In addition,
most abatement measures, such as barriers and insulation need to be custom designed to meet the
individual needs (in terms of effectiveness) of the problem. Aesthetic, urban design
considerations must be kept foremost in mind with regard to acoustical barriers; there are many
examples of poorly designed walls in the Bay Area.

UPDATING THE NOISE ELEMENT
The Noise Element should be updated to account for current traffic levels, land uses, and source
characteristics whenever any of the following occur:
          (1) The entire General Plan is updated.
          (2) Major traffic additions or rearrangements exist compared to the base year of 1975.
          (3) Major new industrial sources are introduced.
          (4) Major rail traffic increases are made.
          (5) 1980 is reached or a population of 35,000.
At that time, the data base should be assessed, new forecasts made, the ordinance reviewed and
planning procedures updated.
City of Burlingame                                N-42                                     General Plan

NOISE ORDINANCE AND CONTROL OF OTHER NOISE SOURCES
Various noise ordinances have been reviewed. The model ordinance developed by the League of
California Cities appears to be the best approach for the City of Burlingame. Any final noise
ordinance enacted by the City should address other noise sources such as barking dogs, loud
music and parties, maintenance operations carried out by the City, etc. Provisions for the control
of such noise sources are contained in the League of California Cities Model Ordinance.
Enforcement of any noise ordinance will require that a city staff person be assigned as a noise
enforcement officer at least part-time. Allocation of staff time to such an enforcement program
will depend upon the City's overall resources. The City may wish to adopt a noise ordinance
which covers only those noise sources considered most annoying to the Burlingame populace;
such a selective noise ordinance would serve to focus staff time in those areas where it is most
needed.

                              IMPLEMENTATION:
                POLICIES, GOALS AND PROGRAMS
The following goals, policies and implementation programs are recommended for adoption by
the City of Burlingame based upon results of a recent Noise Questionnaire (described in
Appendix C) as well as a knowledge of present and future acoustic conditions throughout the
City, an understanding of present land use, and consideration of the General Plan.
DECLARATION OF POLICY
The City of Burlingame declares a policy of excluding and prohibiting all annoying, excessive
and unnecessary noises from all sources which are subject to its regulatory, administrative and
police powers. The City takes notice that for certain intensity levels, noise is detrimental to the
health, welfare and enjoyment of the citizenry as well as detrimental to the quality of the
environment. The City takes special notice that it is the penetration of unwanted sound from
sources not controllable by an individual household that deserve the highest priority in order to
insure each person's right to peaceful surroundings.
POLICY GOALS
The policy goals of city-wide noise control are to:
N(A): Preserve peaceful noise conditions in the City where they do exist.
N(B): Reduce annoying levels of noise for existing situations; aircraft, motor vehicle and
          domestic animal noise were identified by a Noise Questionnaire to be the most annoying
          at present.
N(C): Achieve a peaceful acoustic environment in portions of the city to be developed.
N(D): Consider use of existing city and inter-governmental processes to accomplish noise
          control.
N(E): Arrive at resultant implementation programs which are consistent with State and Federal
          guidelines and which are (i) legally valid, (ii) not unduly costly, and (iii) do not impose
          undue hardship upon residential property owners and community business interests.
N(F): Foster in the citizens of all segments of the City an assurance that their concerns with
          unwanted sound levels are of importance to the City, and publicize the existence of
          avenues by which these problems can be quantified and mitigated.

                                                                                              NOISE ELEMENT
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS
There are many possible implementation programs which the City could employ to improve the
acoustic conditions within its boundaries; a wide range of such programs is presented in the
Noise Abatement and Controls Section. The following programs are recommended by Earth
Metric for the City of Burlingame considering the City's noise climate, General Plan and citizen
interests. The highest priority programs are discussed first including a discussion of potential
problems with their implementation.
N(1) Consider Adoption of Administrative Review Process
The specific content of this program is outlined in detail in the Administrative Review Process
Section under Noise Abatement and Controls. It involves two basic processes already
established in the City: the environmental impact review process and the building permit plan
check and inspection process. Regarding the environmental review process, very specific
guidelines are given in the Administrative Review Process Section under Determination of Need
for an EIR and Design of Scope of Work for an EIR which will aid the Planning Department in
(i) its determination of the need for an environmental impact report with regard to noise impacts
of certain projects, and (ii) the design of the scope of work for environmental impact reports
assessing various types and magnitudes of acoustic impact. Regarding the building plan check,
permit and inspection process, the Implementation of the California State Uniform Building
Code Acoustical Clearance title under the Administrative Review Process Section outlines
specifically (i) the type of acoustic data which should be required of all proposed buildings
which are subject to the provisions of the State Uniform Building Code (the State Housing Act
specifically requires that the precise location of 60 CNEL line be determined) 2 and (ii) the
contents of the required acoustic analysis to be performed by acoustic consultants or a staff
member trained in acoustic analysis.
This recommended administrative review process can be built upon the City's existing process
with more specific guidelines and procedures relating to acoustic impacts of proposed projects
and buildings. The City may require a conditional use permit if proposed projects, buildings,
subdivision maps, tentative parcel maps or recordings do not meet the outdoor noise level
planning criteria in Table 4-2. It may require more time on the part of city staff especially
during its initial phase-in period. Depending upon the amount of follow-up time available in the
Building Department, an acoustic check could be added to the existing building inspection
process. This would require a short course for building inspectors in order that they might
become familiar with inspection techniques used to assure that the proper type of acoustic
materials have been installed and that they have indeed been installed properly. Improper
installation of insulation materials can render them useless. Problems for the City with the
administrative review process would probably center around staff time constraints and small
processing problems expected during the first few months.
          2
            The City of Burlingame should request both ALUC and SPO to identify the 60 CNEL line in order that
State Housing Act provisions relating to airport noise might be enforced in the City.
City of Burlingame                                      N-45                                          General Plan
                                                                                     NOISE ELEMENT
N(2) Airport Noise Surveillance Program
The airport noise surveillance program is discussed in detail in the Aircraft Noise Section of
Noise Abatement and Control. It is recommended that this program be instituted for a period of
two to three years. Each year, airport noise would be monitored during the storm weather season
to obtain a running record of the worst-case noise (relative to Burlingame) caused by that source.
 The monitoring program would consist of approximately 20-25 measurements per year; some 24
hour measurements might be necessary.
Depending upon the outcome or trends monitored by such a survey, subsequent action by the
City could take many different courses. The Planning Commission and/or City Council could
address letters to various organizations responsible in one way or another for the control of
airport noise; these organizations are listed in Aircraft Noise Section. One good application of
these yearly surveys would be to use them as a check to see that the San Mateo County Airport
Land Use Commission adopted CNEL contours are correct and up-to-date relative to
Burlingame; these adopted contours should tend to overestimate rather than underestimate the
areas exposed to airport noise. The fact that Burlingame has such an on-going airport
surveillance program should, in itself, assure responsible noise monitoring by other
governmental agencies.
N(3) Consider Vehicle Noise Emission Standards Enforcement
The vehicle emission standards enforcement program is presented in the Surface Transportation
Noise Section under Noise Abatement and Control. The recommended program would work in
the following way; during one week per month for a period of three to four months, one police
officer and one noise consultant (with noise monitoring equipment) would work together. This
team would choose and set up the monitoring equipment on a suitable street. The street chosen
should have enough traffic to provide a good sample of vehicles but not so much traffic as to
prevent or seriously hamper the police officer from stopping and citing illegal vehicles. As
vehicles pass by, the noise consultant would tell the police officer which of them violated the
standard; the police officer would then stop and cite the identified vehicles.
This program is recommended for many reasons. It helps to ease the Police Department
personnel into the rather technical noise field instead of having them thrust into it immediately
by being responsible for the operation of newly-acquired noise monitoring equipment. The
Police Department personnel can slowly become accustomed to the noise equipment and
terminology while being initially responsible for stopping and citing illegally-noisy vehicles. In
addition, the City in general, and the Police Department in particular can slowly gain a working
knowledge of this type of enforcement program and the minor problems involved. One possible
problem the City should be aware of is related to citizen reaction; even though over 70 percent of
the people responding to the Noise Questionnaire advocated limited to strong control for
automobiles, trucks and motorcycles, there may be some adverse citizen reaction to such a
vehicle noise emission enforcement program, especially from those people cited for violation.
There are many positive reactions which could also occur; one illegally-loud vehicle can annoy
many people. This program could be specifically focused at trucks and/or motorcycles; these
vehicle classes are the noisiest on the, road and citizens surveyed were highly in favor of strong
control over them.
City of Burlingame                               N-46                                     General Plan
                                                                                       NOISE ELEMENT
N(4) Consider Municipal Vehicle and Maintenance Operations Noise Control
This program is recommended in order that the City set a good example, of noise abatement by
assuring that all city operated vehicles conform to the standards listed in Tables 4-4, 4-5 and 4-6.
In addition to this, the City should make a concerted effort to assure that all of its maintenance
operations such as street repaving, tree trimming, sewer and park maintenance are constructed in
the quietest manner possible and avoid noise-sensitive hours (evening and nighttime) whenever
possible. This probably should not require significant extra staff time but will require constant
attention and possible financial outlay for modification of noisy equipment.
N(5) Educational Campaign
It is recommended that consideration be given to an educational campaign to describe to the
citizenry of Burlingame their noise climate and what they can do to change it. One or a series of
small pamphlets and bumper stickers could be designed to educate the public about the major
contributors to the noise problem, the major methods of dealing with noise and the small
things which every citizen can do to help lower the noise climate of the City and Bay Area in
general. Such pamphlets could be consumer-oriented, advising citizens who to insulate, where
to get a better vehicle muffler and how much they should pay for these various items. Such
pamphlets could be sent out with utility bills and passed out to churches and libraries.
N(6) Consider Adoption of Noise Ordinance
After review of several noise ordinances including one from the airport noise impacted City of
Inglewood, the League of California Cities Model Noise Ordinance was chosen as best for
Burlingame. It is a general noise annoyance ordinance which has provisions covering
miscellaneous noise sources such as loud amplified equipment and fans; two sources covered, of
special interest to Burlingame, relate to animals and fowl, and train horns and whistles. The
ordinance should be studied in detail with deletions made according to the wishes of the City.
For instance, the animal and fowl section might be deleted until San Francisco's Experience is
monitored and analyzed as mentioned below in the domestic animals program.
N(7) Updating of the Noise Element
The noise element should be updated to account for current traffic levels, land uses, and source
characteristics whenever any of the following occur: the entire General Plan is updated; major
traffic additions or rearrangements exist compared to the base year of 1975; major new industrial
sources are introduced; major rail traffic increases are made; or 1980 is reached or a population
of 35,000. At that time, the data base should be assessed, new forecasts made, the ordinance
reviewed and planning procedures updated.
N(8) Bayshore Freeway Noise Attenuation Study
The City should consider a study regarding the costs and effectiveness of construction of a noise
barrier, or the insulation of existing houses, and apartments along Bayshore Boulevard from
Cadillac Way on the north to Peninsula Avenue to the south; noise barriers and insulation are
City of Burlingame                               N-47                                       General Plan
                                                                                     NOISE ELEMENT
discussed in the Surface Transportation Noise Section under the title of Noise Barriers, and Part
A of Appendix 8. Bayshore Freeway along this length causes very great noise impacts to be
imposed upon the residential area. Immediately adjacent to Bayshore Boulevard and the
Freeway; this is the residential area in Burlingame impacted most by noise as can be seen on the
maps in the Existing and Projected Acoustic Conditions..
A detailed acoustic analysis would be required to ascertain whether or not an effective noise
barrier wall could be designed or effective insulation materials installed in existing dwelling
units along this section of Bayshore Freeway(US 101). Topography, height of existing and
future housing along Bayshore Boulevard, the great numbers of vehicles which utilize Bayshore
Freeway daily, the great percentage of trucks which use the freeway and many other factors must
be studied in detail in order to assess the effectiveness and proper design of such a wall. A wall
might also act to protect this residential area from air pollution. As most land along Rollins
Road in this area is already developed with two story apartment buildings, noise insulation of the
existing structures would seem to be the most effective way of protecting these dwellings from
the noise; this is especially true of the second story apartments which will not be protected by a
one story wall. Insulation for noise would also act as insulation from cold in the winter and heat
in the summer.
With regard to Bayshore Freeway in general, local legislators, city officials and city staff should
utilize their influence to urge Caltrans to improve existing freeway design (including
interchanges) in Burlingame. Freeway noise contours and actual measurement sites contained in
this Element define the extent of those noise problems along, Bayshore Freeway
N(9) Domestic Animal Noise
A program or ordinance relating to domestic animal noise is not recommended at this time.
Presently, the City of San Francisco is instituting such a program; their program operates as
follows. A dog barking or whining for a period of ten minutes is considered a nuisance and a
citizen witnessing such an occurrence can register a complaint with the Police Department. An
officer is then sent out to bear witness to the same occurrence and to see that the dog is not
barking or whining for good reason (i.e. burglar). If it is found to be a nuisance, a citation
(carrying approximately $15 -$500 fine) can be issued to the dog's owner. An amendment
currently pending would allow the police officer to issue a citation without himself bearing
witness if a total of two complaints are received from two separate nearby residences.
Considerable adverse citizen reaction is very possible with the institution of such a program.
One complaint encountered in San Francisco is that citizens do not want police services allocated
to this type of enforcement. It is recommended that Burlingame defer institution of such a
program until further results of San Francisco's experience can be monitored and evaluated.

                                                                                   OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
                                      INTRODUCTION
This proposed open space element has been developed in response to requirements of the State
Legislature embodied in the Planning and Zoning Law. Article 10.5, Title 5 of the Government
Code which requires each city and each county to prepare and adopt by June 30, 1973, an Open
Space element for the comprehensive and long-range preservation of open space lands within its
jurisdiction. The Open Space Element is required to include an action program indicating
programs the City Council intends to pursue in implementing its open space plan. According to
the state law open space land is any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially
unimproved and devoted to an open space use and which is designated on a local, regional or
state open space plan as any of the following:
          (1)      Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited to,
                   areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat for
                   fish and wildlife species; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study
                   purposes; rivers, streams, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, and watershed
                   lands.
          (2)      Open space used for the managed production of resources including, but not
                   limited to, forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic
                   importance for the production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of
                   ground-water basins; marshes, rivers and streams which are important for the
                   management of commercial fisheries; and areas containing major mineral
                   deposits, including those in short supply.
          (3)      Open space for outdoor recreation including, but not limited to, areas of
                   outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park
                   and recreation purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and
                   streams; and areas which serve as links between major recreation and open-space
                   reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and
                   scenic highway corridors.
          (4)      Open space for public health and safety including, but not limited to, areas which
                   require special management or regulation because of hazardous or special
                   conditions such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains,
                   watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required for the protection of
                   water quality and water reservoirs and areas required for the protection and
                   enhancement of air quality.
The Goals and Implementing objectives, Part I of the City General Plan adopted by the City in
1969, provide the local policy context for applying the state legislative directive to Burlingame.
City of Burlingame                                  OS-2                                       General Plan
                                                                               OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
In formulating this Open Space Element, open space was viewed as a general three-dimensional
resource made up of all the space above the surface of the earth and water not occupied by
structures. Open space thus includes large and small spaces above predominantly open public and
private lands and between and above buildings. State and Federal definitions emphasize that size
is not a limiting factor for open space, nor is public ownership of all open space intended.
Further, the definitions clearly recognize that open space serves a variety of purposes.
Burlingame's open space resources were viewed as potential components of a general system of
open spaces and evaluated in relationship to the State criteria and definitions and city goals and
objectives. As appropriate, land areas were identified as open space lands serving one or more of
the open space functions identified by the State. In addition, needs and opportunities for other
forms of open space were evaluated and other open spaces were identified as necessary for
health, safety or the quality of life. This system of open spaces is proposed for preservation
through a variety of methods, including regulation and public acquisition in fee or lesser interest.
THE OPEN SPACE ELEMENT AS PART OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The Open Space Element is intended to be supplementary to previously adopted General Plan
elements. In case of any conflict, the Open Space Element is intended to supersede previously
adopted material but only to the extent of the conflict.
The Open Space Element includes three divisions--Division 1 -Definitions and Policies and
Action Program; Division II -Open Space Proposals; Division III - Plan Diagram. The Open
Space Element, when adopted, will become part of Part II of the General Plan.

                                                                                 OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
                        DEFINITIONS AND POLICIES
DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL CONCEPTS
Open Space
For the purpose of this element of the General Plan, open space is defined as all of the space
above the surface of the earth or water which is not occupied by structures. Open space,
therefore, is essentially three-dimensional. It is given definition by buildings and other structures,
land forms, and prominent vegetation.
The concept of three-dimensionality is particularly important in open space planning for
Burlingame because of the physical situation of the City extending from the Bay to the Skyline.
Both hillside and flat land sections of the City are given specific recognition in this element of
the plan, with policies intended to protect and enhance the open space resources and the quality
of views to and from the hillsides.
A system of open spaces is proposed including a network of large and small spaces (preserves,
parks, street space, yards, and other spaces) extending over the cityscape between and above
buildings, trees, and other topographic features. This system of open spaces is considered to be
made up of components of three general scales - very large (macro), intermediate, and small
(micro). Macro open space serves a city-wide or regional public; intermediate open space serves
a segment of the city; and micro open space serves a local or individual need. These components
are defined as follows:
          1.       Macro-Scale Open Space - Spaces where the sense of openness is extensive;
                   views encompass large expanses of water or undeveloped or primarily
                   undeveloped land and afford a sense of considerable distance.
          2.       Intermediate-Scale Open Space - Spaces of intermediate scale ranging in size
                   from 3 to 30 acres, and varying in character from natural open space areas to
                   extensively landscaped spaces within large developments, the unifying element
                   being the sense of openness in the middle ground with definite background limits
                   to the view.
          3.       Micro-Scale Open Space - Spaces that are of a small or intimate nature where the
                   observer is intimately confronting the limiting structures and is precluded from
                   viewing beyond these immediate limits. Attention is usually focused on the detail
                   of form, texture and color of foreground objects and limiting structures.
Open Space Lands
Within the general three-dimensional open space system are particularly significant open spaces -
those resulting from open space lands. These are the open spaces that relate most specifically to
City of Burlingame                                 OS-4                                       General Plan
                                                                                          OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
the categories of open space lands defined in the state law 1 where open space land is defined as
any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space
use and which is designated on a local, regional or state open space plan as any of the following:
          1.         Open space for preservation of natural resources.
          2.         Open space used for the managed production of resources.
          3.         Open space for outdoor recreation.
          4.         Open space for public health and safety.
General Open Space
This category includes the balance of the open spaces in the planning area (city plus adjoining
areas important to the city) proposed in this element of the General Plan to be preserved as open
space.
POLICIES/OBJECTIVES
This element of the General Plan is intended to provide additional means of securing the
Community Goals and Implementing Objectives included in Part I of this General Plan. The
specific objectives of this element of the plan are to:
OS(A):               Preserve existing open space and open space lands to the fullest extent
                     practicable, with spaces ranging in size from regional scale to small open spaces
                     on individual lots.
OS(B):               Increase privacy, amenity and safety, and assure provision of light and air.
OS(C):               Preserve the important vistas, such as the hillside leading to the Skyline Ridge as
                     seen from the Bay plain, and the Bay as seen from the hillside.
OS(D):               Provide open space for recreational needs and for the preservation of sites of
                     historical and cultural significance.
OS(E):               Protect and maintain those areas necessary to the integrity of the natural processes
                     with special emphasis on, but not limited to, the water regimen and air quality.
OS(F):               Protect and preserve open spaces which are vital as wildlife habitat and areas of
                     major or unique ecological significance.

City of Burlingame                                        OS-5                                           General Plan
                                                                                  OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
OS(G):             Maintain open space to shape and guide development and to enhance community
                   identity.
OS(H):             Establish the basic framework for a continuing action program designed to protect
                   valuable and limited open space resources.
ACTIONS/PRINCIPLES
OS(1): Areas that contribute to the maintenance of a quality living environment for both local
                   and sub-regional residents should be preserved as open space. Areas that fall into
                   this category include:
                   a.       Areas of visual dominance - Skyline Ridge, Canyons, Bay.
                   b.       Visual corridors.
                   c.       Areas of special ecological significance (wildlife and vegetation).
                   d.       Areas of cultural and historic significance.
OS(2): Areas hazardous to the public safety and welfare should be retained as open space. Areas
                   that fall into this category include:
                   a.       Slopes generally over 30 percent.
                   b.       Areas of identified instability.
                   c.       Streams and their flood plains.
OS(3): Conservation easements, open space zoning and other land use regulations should be used
                   to prohibit development on unstable terrain, water channels, flood plains,
                   excessively steep slopes and other areas determined hazardous to public welfare
                   and safety.
OS(4): Open spaces should be linked together visually and, where possible, physically to form a
                   system of open spaces.
OS(5): A variety of vistas should be provided and preserved ranging from the small enclosed
                   private views to the more distant views shared by many people.
OS(6): Both public and private efforts should be directed to preserving historical landmarks
                   which have open space value.
OS(7): In the design and execution of all new development, owners and developers should be
                   required to preserve open space to the fullest extent possible.

OS(8): Measures should be taken to improve the quality of spaces for the pedestrian along
                   roadways so the pedestrian can feel safe and comfortable while using these
                   spaces.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
The actions needed to implement the open space plan are described with each proposal. Taken
together these recommendations for implementation constitute a general action program.
Implementing actions fall in three general classes:
          1.       Regulation through zoning with interim emergency action recommended in some
                   cases.
          2.       Acquisition of easement rights by gift or purchase.
          3.       Acquisition in full fee by purchase, or gift.
Some actions need to be taken rather immediately while others can be deferred for reasonable
time periods. Therefore, a time phased sequence of actions should be formulated after the open
space element is adopted.
The following criteria are suggested to provide guidance in assigning priorities:
          •        Probability of development which would usurp the proposed open space use.
          •        Importance of the particular open space to the total open space program.
          •        Community need for early use of the area.
          •        Probability of acquisition by another body which would have the same open space
                   objectives.
The program should be flexible, however, so that the City can move rapidly when circumstances
are advantageous. Public acquisition includes any feasible means whereby beneficial use may be
obtained, including gift, permit, license, lease, lease-back, purchase, life-estate or any
combination.

                            AND ACTION PROGRAM
THE OPEN SPACE SYSTEM
Key components in the open space system are the Bay and the watershed lands of the City of San
Francisco. These open spaces provide Burlingame's superb setting. They are linked, visually, by
the air space which extends over the City and is so important to the enjoyment of the views of the
Bay and the more distant hills. Other large (macro-scale) components include the larger city
parks, wooded canyons, and major rights-of-way for freeways, major streets, and the railroad.
Smaller components (intermediate scale) include the smaller city parks, creeks, and important
street rights-of-way. The micro-scale components of the system include the city mini-parks, and
private yards and courts.
The index, following, summarizes the proposals and identifies the primary and secondary open
space uses provided by each open space area. In subsequent text the open spaces comprising the
system are discussed under two principal headings: General Open Space; and Open Space Lands.
For those open space proposals shown on the Open Space Element Plan Diagram, the number
following the caption is the key number appearing on the Plan Diagram and in the index.
GENERAL OPEN SPACE
Air Space Over the City
This is the pervasive general open space that, in a strict sense, includes all open spaces. However,
for the purposes of the action program, this component of the open space system
is considered to be a residual - that is, all open space other than that included in the more specific
proposals set forth below.
Air space defined in this way provides the following open space uses:
          -         health and safety, by providing light, air, and privacy; and
          -        recreation by permitting views of nearby and distant points, adding amenity and
                   providing visual enjoyment.
Implementation:
          The air space should be protected through zoning regulations controlling building height,
          bulk and coverage. Where necessary for particular purposes, easements should be
          secured. An urban design plan should be developed to provide the basis for establishing
          the specific controls needed to protect the air space, giving particular attention to
          developing new height, bulk, and coverage regulations for the area outboard of Bayshore
          Freeway.

                                                                                   OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Rights-of-way to Provide Links
To provide a connected system of open space lands, it is proposed that the open space qualities of
selected streets, alleys, and easements be enhanced and given special protection. Streets and
other rights-of-way of particular importance are indicated on the Plan Diagram. Of these, the
following are of city-wide or regional importance:
          -        Bayshore Freeway: U.S. 101
          -        El Camino Real
          -        Junipero Serra Freeway: I-280
          -        California Drive-Southern Pacific RR R/W
          -        PG&E and Drainage R/W (18) - The portion of this R/W in Millsdale Industrial
                   Park is a combination drainage right-of-way and a PG&E right-of-way for power
                   lines and towers. The portion in the Edwards Industrial Park and Marsten Road
                   area is a PG&E easement. It is an open space resource, and measures to enhance
                   its usefulness and improve its appearance should be explored.
Implementation:
          Maintain and improve the open space and visual qualities of the designated streets and
          rights-of-way by maintaining and, where necessary, enhancing the quality of street trees
          and other planting. Review front yard setback requirements and determine if additional
          regulations are needed to prevent encroachment into existing open spaces. Underground
          utilities along streets. Review street lighting and "street furniture" to determine how
          visual quality can be improved. Where feasible, acquire easements in locations selected to
          provide pedestrian links to open space lands. Particular attention should be given to
          securing a link from Hayward Drive to Mills Canyon Park site. When appropriately
          located property is offered for sale in the normal course of events, consideration should
          be given to acquisition.
Usable Private Open Space for Each Dwelling Unit
An objective in all new development should be to secure some open space for the use of
residents on each parcel. This is particularly important where higher density buildings replace
lower density buildings since existing general open space is encroached upon in the process.
Implementation:
          Revise zoning regulations to require usable open space in conjunction with each
          dwelling. Give consideration to incentive provisions providing density bonus for highly
          usable space such as well designed balconies or courts.
City of Burlingame                                 OS-11                                       General Plan
                                                                                  OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
OPEN SPACE LANDS
San Francisco Bay (5)
This is an open space resource of immense importance to the region and the City, and a portion
of the Bay is within the corporate limits of Burlingame. The City and County of San Francisco
holds title to the area between the Airport and East Millsdale. The balance is claimed by West
Bay Community Associates, a private corporation (these titles are now in litigation). The Bay and
its shoreline are under the jurisdiction and protection of the Bay Conservation and Development
Commission as well as Burlingame. The City maintains control through its Tidal Plain District
zoning regulations. The tidelands and waters of the Bay should be retained in open space use for
resource protection and recreation. No fill or structures should be permitted for purposes other
than to protect public safety, enhance wildlife habitat or improve public access.
Implementation:
          Support the BCDC San Francisco Bay Plan and collaborate with BCDC in preparing
          more precise plans for the Bay and its shores. Review the T-P zoning district regulations
          and, if feasible, strengthen the controls to provide additional protection for this valuable
          open space. More definite limits should be established to restrict areas within which any
          landfill or structures permanently affixed to the land can be authorized as conditional
          uses by special permit. Extend limits of T-P zoning district to include all tidal waters.
Bayside Park (12)
Develop Bayside Park as the major open space link between the land mass and the open waters
of the Bay. Preserve the open space quality by keeping building coverage to the minimum needed
to assure public use and enjoyment of the site.
Implementation:
          A park development plan and program is needed for this area. To preserve open space
          character, limit building coverage and building height. Creative design is essential.
Inner Lagoon (6)
This area includes the lagoon between the Bayshore Freeway right-of-way and Anza Pacific
properties and is a significant open space resource. It is part of Bayside Park and should be
retained in open space use since it serves several important functions. It receives storm drain
waters and is important to public safety. It is an integral part of the visual corridor. With
appropriate development it can provide other outdoor recreation opportunities including
shoreline walks and small boating. One area next to the freeway lands is now used as a roadside
rest. The shallow waters of the lagoon, if protected from pollution, can contribute to the
enhancement of marine and aquatic life. At present, the area is visually unattractive, and
imaginative design solutions are needed to enhance visual qualities and amenity. A long range
City of Burlingame                                OS-12                                        General Plan
                                                                                 OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
goal should be removal of the PG&E transmission lines and towers. In the interim, development
should be designed to mitigate the adverse impact of these towers and transmission lines.
Implementation:
          Prepare a development plan for the lagoon and its borders as part of Bayside Park.
          Institute, or continue, a program to monitor water quality in the lagoon to identify any
          measures needed to correct and prevent pollution. Develop an urban design scheme that
          would create an open space continuum from the buildings on the frontage road south of
          the Bayshore Freeway to future structures in the Anza Pacific lands north of the Inner
          Lagoon.
Outer Lagoon and Adjacent Park (16)
This area comprises part of the state lands under lease to the Anza Pacific Corporation. Aside
from sites designated for restaurants, this area, including the Lagoon, should be kept in open
space use.
Implementation:
          Apply open space zoning or designate, in a specific development plan, lands to be kept
          open or essentially open around the Lagoon.
Anza Pacific, Adjacent Inner Lagoon (17)
This area, or its equivalent, privately owned, should be kept essentially open to provide a
continuum of open space from the inner lagoon to the Bay. It should be part of a broad corridor
between the inner and outer lagoons and adjacent park lands.
Implementation:
          Zone this portion, or its equivalent, of the Anza Pacific holdings for open space use, or
          designate it for open space use in a specific development plan for the Anza Pacific
          holdings. This is primarily a matter of building location within an overall development
          plan.
Shoreline Lands (east) (19)
These open space lands along the shoreline are, in part, protected by public easements. The visual
quality of the shoreline should be improved and a system of walks and bicycle paths developed
for outdoor recreation and to provide public access to the Bay and the lagoons.
Implementation:
          Formulate a comprehensive development plan for the shoreline area, highlighting
          pedestrian and bicycle uses. Most desirably this plan would be part of a comprehensive
City of Burlingame                                OS-13                                      General Plan
                                                                                 OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
          plan for the entire area north of Bayshore Freeway (as recommended in the Waterfront
          Element of the General Plan). In the interim, establish special shoreline zoning
          regulations to control use of the shoreline and adjacent lands; include requirement for
          building setbacks from the Bay.
Shoreline Lands (west) (20)
Although BCDC has jurisdiction 100 feet inland from the shoreline, much of the Shoreline Lands
(west) have already been developed. Increased public use and enjoyment of the
shoreline can only come about by having adequate public access points to the shoreline and along
it and by insuring that the land uses are compatible with the aquatic environment.
Implementation:
          Apply a shoreline zoning regulation along the band extending inward from the shoreline.
          Require public access in conjunction with all new development. The existing waterfront
          commercial zoning regulations should be revised to restrict uses allowed in this area to
          those requiring waterfront location or providing increased public access to the Bay.
City of San Francisco Watershed Lands (7)
Matching the waters of the Bay and the shoreline areas in importance to Burlingame is this
magnificent natural preserve lying just west of the City. It serves three functions: health and
safety by protecting the watershed through management control and by providing space for water
storage; outdoor recreation by providing outstanding scenic views and opportunities for nature
study, hiking and riding; resource protection by providing wildlife habitat and protecting soil and
vegetative resources.
Implementation:
          Maintain liaison with the City of San Francisco Water Department. Monitor actions of the
          San Francisco Public Utilities Commission related to policy or projects for the watershed
          lands. Request referral of all such matters to the City for information and review with
          particular attention to environmental impact reports.
Skyline Park (15)
This is a proposed new city park adjacent to Junipero Serra Freeway. Its primary open space
function would be outdoor recreation. In addition to providing low intensity informal recreation
opportunities for nearby residents, the area is an important part of the scenic corridor for
Interstate 280. It is thus of regional as well as local importance. It also contributes to health and
safety by decreasing noise impact from the freeway. Preservation of natural resources is a
secondary function.
City of Burlingame                               OS-14                                       General Plan
                                                                                  OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Implementation:
          Obtain use of these lands through negotiations with the City and County of San
          Francisco.
Mills Canyon Park (14)
This is a City owned park site. It is situated in a steep canyon and has some excellent native
vegetation. Because of its physical characteristics it should be retained as a natural preserve for
limited low intensity, informal recreational activities including walking, nature study and other
activities permitting enjoyment of the area. Points of access are presently very limited and
additional access is needed.
Implementation:
          Formulate a plan for protection and limited development of this site. Restrict activities in
          the park to those consistent with its character as a natural preserve. Acquire easements in
          several locations to provide more access from the west side of the park; also from
          Hayward Drive.
Mills Canyon Hillside (8)
These two areas adjacent to the Mills Canyon Park site are comprised of the rear portions of
private parcels of land which are used for single family residences. These hillside lands are still
of much the same character as Mills Canyon Park and should be kept as open space to serve three
functions: preservation of resources by maintaining vegetation and preventing erosion; health and
safety by preventing construction on lands of questionable stability (identified as an area
moderately susceptible to landslides by USGS); providing recreation by enhancing the visual
quality of Mills Canyon Park.
Implementation:
          Acquire conservation easements by gift or purchase covering the rear portion of parcels
          abutting on Mills Canyon Park. Where parcels are undeveloped, consider acquiring parcel
          in full fee to add to Mills Canyon Park.
Sisters of Mercy/Mercy High School
This site includes substantial open space which is a valuable resource and should be retained.
The existing open space is an adjunct to existing building and includes an extensive stand of live
oaks and other vegetation which should be preserved. In addition to resource preservation, the
site adds to the visual amenity of the local area and thus, even without public access, provides a
form of recreation.
City of Burlingame                                OS-15                                      General Plan
                                                                                 OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Implementation:
          Advise San Mateo County of Burlingame's interest in retaining the open space qualities
          presently existing on this site; prezone with regulations permitting the existing use to
          continue but limiting the extent of any expansion. Such pre-zoning should be done as a
          part of pre-zoning of other lands in the City's sphere of influence. Explore the possibility
          of entering into an agreement with Sisters of Mercy to permit limited public use of the
          grounds with particular attention to obtaining a pedestrian and bicycle path along Mills
          Creek as a link to Mills Canyon Park.
Creek Systems
Three of Burlingame's creeks are recommended for special protection for open space: El Portal
Creek, Mills Creek and Easton Creek. Although the natural regimen of these creeks has been
disturbed by development in their watersheds and by channeling and culverting in their lower
reaches, they still have important functions to perform. These creeks and their branches are
important to health and safety, visual amenity (recreation) and resource protection (habitat
and vegetation). Mills Creek and Easton Creek also provide a greenway system of native trees
and plants linking headwater canyons with other open spaces in the lower reaches. Maintaining
the visual linkage is important. Pedestrian access in selected locations to link parks and school
grounds would enhance the usefulness of these facilities to the public. Care would be needed to
avoid infringing on privacy of homes located along the creeks.
Implementation:
          Establish special zoning regulations to protect the creek channels and banks and the
          vegetation along the creeks. Study the feasibility of obtaining pedestrian links: 1), along
          Mills Creek (northern branch) between the Burlingame Intermediate School and Davis
          Drive; and 2), along Mills creek and through the Sisters of Mercy grounds to connect
          Mills Canyon Park to Hoover Avenue. To assist in protecting the streams, request that
          jurisdictions with control over upstream areas (San Mateo County, Hillsborough, San
          Mateo City, and Millbrae) submit to Burlingame, Environmental Impact Reports covering
          any projects in their portions of the watersheds of streams flowing through Burlingame.
Easton Creek and Canyon Drive Area (10)
This area is similar in character to the Mills Canyon Hillside (Area 8). It includes the rear
portions of residential lots, many of which have been developed. Because the area is heavily
wooded with native vegetation, it is important for resource conservation. Preservation in the
present state is also important to health and safety since these lands are steep and of questionable
stability and of doubtful suitability for building construction (classed as "Moderately Susceptible
to Landsliding" by USGS with some evidence of existing landslide deposits). If existing
vegetation were removed, the lands would be subject to erosion and peak runoff and downstream
siltation and damage would be increased. In addition to resource preservation and protection of
health and safety, these wooded hillside lands, because of their scenic quality, provide a form of
outdoor recreation.
City of Burlingame                                OS-16                                      General Plan
                                                                                OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Implementation:
          In pre-zoning, establish appropriate open space and conservation regulation to protect this
          area. If necessary, acquire conservation easements to preserve its openness and natural
          character.
Hoover School/Shinnyo-en Temple and Canyon (11)
This area provides open space functions similar to Easton Creek and Canyon Drive area and
should be retained in essentially its present condition. Because of topographic and geologic
limitation it appears generally unsuitable for additional residential development.
Implementation:
          Establish Conservation and Open Space zoning to inhibit infringement upon the open
          space character. Public acquisition is recommended to permit limited public use of lands
          in the canyon. Continue arrangements with the school district for recreational use of the
          Hoover School site.
Washington Park and High School (13)
This is a designed and structured area for organized activities. Although it is intensively used for
both outdoor and indoor recreation, it has retained an open space character. The combined area
provides a most important open space resource as a part of "downtown" Burlingame. Its
importance will increase in the future if residential densities continue to increase.
Implementation:
          Limit any further structural development through City policy and open space zoning.
          Continue arrangement with the school district permitting public use of the school
          grounds. Give particular attention to maintaining the major trees and other plant materials
          on this site.
Eastmoor Road City Park (21)
This is an existing City park, small, but an important green area on California Drive. It is
recommended that the park be expanded by acquiring adjacent lots when feasible as they come
on the market.
Cuernavaca Park (23)
This is an existing neighborhood park. In addition, it provides an observation point for viewing
the San Francisco Bay area.
City of Burlingame                                OS-17                                     General Plan
                                                                                OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Vest-Pocket Parks
Continue development of vest-pocket parks within the City to serve nearby residents where no
other park space is near.
Implementation:
          Initiate a comprehensive plan for a park scheme to determine the placement of vest-
          pocket parks. Acquire selected parcels in areas in need of parks. Design and build parks
          on these parcels in accordance with the needs and outstanding traits of the area.
Ray Park and Lincoln School (22)
This combined school and park site provides an important open space resource for this part of the
City. Its location on Mills Creek with an extensive length of creekside vegetation enhances its
open space qualities. Further building upon the school site should be restricted to preserve open
space.
Benjamin Franklin/Burlingame Intermediate Schools (24)
This combined school site is an important open space for all of northern Burlingame. Its open
qualities should be preserved. It could become a more important part of the open space system if
a connecting link to Mills Canyon Park were developed along Mills Creek.
Other School Sites
In addition to the school sites discussed above and identified on the Open Space Plan Diagram,
all school sites in the City contribute some measure of open space. However, many of the sites
are over-crowded with structures. The City should continue arrangements with the school district
for the joint use of school yards and should review any proposed addition to buildings.
Implementation:
          In order to review all planned changes upon the school sites, establish a public lands
          zoning district. In cooperation with the school district, create comprehensive designs for
          each school site and adjoining lands to improve usefulness for education and to better
          serve the general public. Acquire individual lots adjacent to school sites where prudently
          possible.
Institutional Lands
Some of the other institutions (both public and private) provide significant open space. In some
cases, in addition to the primary function, it may be possible to provide for some open space
activities in harmony with the primary use. Peninsula Hospital (Area 25 on the Plan Diagram)
has the largest site of any institutional use in the City. Only a small portion of the site is
occupied by buildings and the open space quality should be preserved and enhanced. This site is
City of Burlingame                                OS-18                                       General Plan
                                                                                 OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
of particular importance because it can provide an "open space" contrast to the more highly
developed commercial lands on the north side of El Camino Real.
Implementation:
          To maintain the existing open space on the institutional sites, establish a special form of
          open space zoning. Where appropriate, acquire access rights for the people to open spaces
          and develop quiet recreational pursuits appropriate and supplemental to the particular
          institution.
Burlingame Plaza (26)
At present this open space is a poorly arranged, unattractive series of parking lots. The planting
in the divider along El Camino Real is very inadequate. Although the entire center - buildings,
use, and parking areas - needs re-evaluation leading to improvement in function and appearance,
much can be done with the open space itself (parking areas). This space should be re-designed as
an attractive plaza with appropriate and adequate landscaping within which automobile parking
would be accommodated. A well designed plaza in this location would provide an attractive
entrance to Burlingame. Ideally, this plaza and the open space areas on the Peninsula Hospital
site should be considered together with some unifying design elements. These open spaces would
provide a marked contrast to the character of El Camino further north, a contrast to the
intensively developed commercial property north of El Camino, and an introduction to
Burlingame's residential areas.
Broadway Center
This shopping area needs more open spaces to provide amenity. When off-street parking is
developed, the basic design should include adequate planting, walks and other landscape features
to enhance their appearance.
Burlingame Avenue Commercial Area
This area includes the business district and the civic buildings. An overall urban design scheme is
needed to improve functional efficiency, visual quality and amenity in this area of concentrated
activity. The street space, as indicated on the Plan Diagram, if properly handled can provide a
unifying element and open space to contrast with buildings. Other significant open spaces in this
area include the grounds at City Hall, the yards and courts around the post office and a number of
parking lots. City Hall, the post office, and the old City Hall site are either well landscaped or at
least relatively attractive. Although the grounds at the post office are visually attractive, they are
not developed in a manner providing any other public use. Minor additions including benches
and walks would increase the utility of this open space. Every effort should be made to provide
maximum public use and enjoyment of the limited open space in this general area.

Courts and Plazas in Business Districts
Existing open spaces in the business districts should be retained to the fullest extent possible and
their character enhanced through appropriate landscaping. Open parking lots should be treated as
plazas and courts to provide visual enjoyment in addition to their primary function. Courts,
plazas and usable roof space should be incorporated in new development to the fullest extent
possible. Attractive walks and benches for "sitting out" should be included wherever feasible in
areas open to public access.
Implementation:
          Formulate urban design plans for each business district; identify City owned or controlled
          lands for City improvement; encourage private owners to improve existing privately
          owned open spaces; review and revise zoning and other land use controls to require, or
          through incentives encourage, provision of attractive open space in connection with all
          new developments.

                                    INTRODUCTION
OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this element is to introduce public safety considerations in the planning process,
and to consider means by which loss of life, injuries, damage to property, and economic or social
disruption may be reduced within the City of Burlingame.
Hazards of special concern are: fires, floods, the breakdown of essential public services and
utilities, landslides and limited other geologic events. The intent is to begin a coordinated
program that will more precisely define these hazards, determine a level of acceptability, and
propose implementation measures to reduce those hazards that exceed an agreed maximum level
of risk.
The following are recommended policy objectives:
         S(A): Identify existing natural and man-made safety hazards, and devise a reasonable
                   assignment of responsibility for their correction or reduction which will be within
                   limits of economic acceptability.
         S(B): Increase public understanding of safety issues so that unnecessary risk may be
                   avoided.
         S(C): Identify any urgently needed implementation measures or new legislation.
         S(D): Set safety goals consistent with the goals of other elements of the Burlingame
                   General Plan.
LEGAL BASIS FOR THE SAFETY ELEMENT
1.       State Planning Law
California Government Code Section 65302.1 requires: "A safety element for the protection of
the community from fires and geological hazards including features necessary for such
protection as evacuation routes, peak load water supply requirements, minimum road widths,
clearances around structures, and geologic hazard mapping in areas of known geologic hazard."
2.       CIR Guidelines
The legislature in 1972 directed the Council on Intergovernmental Relations to draft advisory
guidelines for General Plan Elements. The most pertinent excerpt from G.C. Section 3421.1
reads: "in connection with its responsibilities under Section 3421.1, the Council shall develop
and adopt guidelines for the preparation and content of the mandatory elements required in city
and county general plans by Article 5 (commencing with Section 65300) of Chapter 3 of Title
7."
City of Burlingame                                 S-2                                       General Plan
                                                                                      SAFETY ELEMENT
SUMMARY OF SAFETY STUDY FINDINGS
1.        Fire hazards in Burlingame can be rated as ''minor.'' Life loss potential is also slight,
         concentrated in older multi-story dwellings and apartments.
2.        The City's three existing fire stations provide good geographic coverage. Numbers of full
         time, trained Fire Department personnel are higher than average for California cities of
         equivalent population and properties to be protected.
3.       Emergency communications are good, both for citizens reporting fires and between staff
         within the council. Burlingame is one of the few cities which has complete coverage by a
         street fire alarm box system.
4.        Burlingame participates in a County-wide Mutual Aid Program for large scale fires and
         related emergencies.
5.        There is a hazard from extensive, shallow flooding in the lower areas of the City, given
         high tides and strong winds or power interruption to pumping stations.
6.        A minor hazard from local flooding presently exists along the principal drainage channels
         in the Millsdale Industrial Park, and along several of the creeks that cross the alluvial
         areas of the city.
7.        Although the City water system is rated by the Insurance Services Offices as a class two
         system, there are some concerns with it. A major earthquake could leave the City with
         only one day's supply of potable water. Fire fighting requirements could deplete this
         reserve to a negligible quantity within hours, leaving residents without a dependable
         source of drinking water. Repairs and replacements are not being made within the context
         of a master water scheme and agreed priorities. A consulting engineering study is to
         investigate these concerns in 1975-76.
8.        Historically, Burlingame has experienced few landslides. Soil instability will probably be
         confined to limited areas of the western hills already known to be unstable.
9.        Expansive soils underlie several districts of the city, and pose a hazard to many buildings.
         Soil instability and subsidence in these areas pose additional potential problems.
10.       Procedures that would allow the city to respond promptly in the event of nuclear attack or
         a civil disturbance are described in the present emergency operations plan. Other natural
         disasters are treated only in outline form, and could be usefully reviewed.

                                                                                     SAFETY ELEMENT
MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SAFETY STUDY
1.        Older high rise buildings and buildings with extensive floor areas require a greater degree
         of built-in fire protection.
2.        Present state law requires that all new dwellings and multi-dwelling units be protected
         with smoke activated fire alarm devices. The desirability of a municipal ordinance
         extending this requirement to existing structures, especially apartments and hotels, should
         be reviewed.
3.        There are large sections of the City that have combustible roofs which, under a
         combination of adverse conditions, could cause a major catastrophic fire. Requirements
         for fire-resistive roofing, perhaps on a replacement basis, warrant further study.
4.        Review dyke levels along drainage channels in the industrial area; recommend minimum
         acceptable elevations, and prepare cost estimates for the required work.
5.        Consider preparation of a 100 year flood protection plan in compliance with Federal
         requirements. Secure from Federal Insurance Agency an updating of federal flood prone
         area map.
6.       A study of the City's water system should be made, and a master plan prepared which
         will identify priorities for future improvements. This could be accomplished by the
         consulting engineering study agreed for 1975-76.
7.        The practicality of connections to the Millbrae and San Mateo water systems for
         emergency supplies should be reviewed, together with the reactivation of older wells
         within Burlingame that are presently capped.
8.        The public health dangers inherent in a breakdown of the City's sewer system should be
         estimated, and steps taken to reduce risks from pollution of the water supply system and
         San Francisco Bay.
9.        Hazards in the hill areas from potential future earth and mud slides should be evaluated.
10.       The City's present emergency operations plan should be supplemented with a program of
         priorities for restoring public services and utilities, conducting rescue operations, and
         clearing emergency travel routes.

                                    BACKGROUND
AREA COVERED
This Safety Element is focused on the City of Burlingame, with recommendations directed to
local responses. It is recognized, however, that many of this City's natural and man-made
hazards are common to other urban areas of the San Francisco Peninsula.
The broader context of safety issues is reviewed in the Countywide Seismic Safety-Safety
Element, which describes many common hazards and helps establish the context for the issues
and implementation programs described in this report.
FACTORS CONSIDERED
Concern for public safety involves many issues. The principal ones identified in this element are
fire, flooding, non-seismic ground failure, landslides and mudslides. To the limited extent that
data is available an analysis will be made of hazards likely to induce or be induced by a
breakdown of essential public services and utilities. The City's present Emergency Operations
Plan will also be reviewed.
The principal public safety issue not considered in this element is the role of law enforcement
agencies, and the crime prevention aspects of land use development - such as planning for
"defensible space.'' State guidelines declare this issue as optional, and it is considered that it
could only be included in a superficial way in this first draft of Burlingame's Safety Element. It
is the City's intention to review this topic during the coming year and to prepare findings and
recommendations for inclusion in a future amendment of this report.
INFORMATION SOURCES
In addition to the County of San Mateo's study of regional safety hazards, this element has drawn
on a report prepared by Gage-Babcock & Associates, Inc. for the Local Agency Formation
Commission of San Mateo County. The report presents detailed findings on fire hazards and fire
protection throughout the County, including assessments of life and property loss potentials,
available fire suppression services, fire insurance gradings and recommendations for priority
improvements.
The Burlingame Fire Department contributed a useful report on local conditions, with an
evaluation of priorities and a suggested fire safety improvement program. Other safety issues -
flooding, drainage and water supply - were outlined in a report prepared by the Public Works
Department, based on engineering records and experience.
This first Safety Element of the Burlingame General Plan highlights the more obvious and
known safety hazards. Additional studies will be necessary to produce a more comprehensive
and thoughtful evaluation.

                                                                                               SAFETY ELEMENT
                                         SAFETY HAZARDS
FIRE
Fire hazards in Burlingame are moderate to slight. Large property loss potentials are considered
to be less than the County average, with most industries of the "clean" type and only small to
moderate size. Many potential problems are offset by installed automatic protection systems.
Life loss potential is also below the County average, concentrated in older multi-story apartment
buildings.
While the City's more serious fires are likely to occur in the industrial area, the commercial areas
and the older apartment districts; a great number of smaller fires occur in single family homes.
Recognizing this as a general pattern, a recent State law requires that all new dwelling units -
single family homes as well as apartments and condominiums - must be protected with smoke
activated fire alarm devices.
The Burlingame Fire Department has an enviable record of public service. Their role and
performance has been commendable. The City Council, since Burlingame's incorporation in
1908, has placed the problem of fire protection high on its priority list. The results to date are:
         1.        Three well located, well equipped fire stations.
         2.        Fire fighting apparatus and equipment of modern design, well maintained by Fire
                   Department mechanics.
         3.        Complete city coverage by a street fire alarm box system.
         4.        Well trained personnel, capable of efficient operation. There is also a Cadet and
                   Auxiliary Program that assures the Department of additional personnel in major
                   emergencies.
         5.        The Department participates in a County-wide Mutual Aid Program for large
                   scale emergencies, and supplements this with Automatic Aid if required. 1
         6.        A well established fire prevention program is in continuous operation.
Burlingame ordinances and laws relating to fire protection and prevention are more advanced
than 90% of the cities on the San Francisco Peninsula. However, for older high rise buildings
without sprinkler systems and buildings with extensive floor areas, City codes should be
         1
            Mutual Aid is a system of agreements worked out between neighboring cities to cover precise situations
of mutual assistance. Automatic Aid is an automatic response by the closest fire company regardless of political
boundaries or mutual aid agreements.
City of Burlingame                                      S-7                                             General Plan
                                                                                       SAFETY ELEMENT
reviewed to assess the need for a greater degree of built-in fire protection. This is important for
two reasons: one, increased life and property protection; and two, cost savings in Fire
Department operations.
It is of interest to note that while total costs of operating a fire service have increased over the
past fifteen years, measured in "current" dollars, the actual costs measured in "constant"
(inflation discounted) dollars have been nearly stable. This is likely to change: amendments
made by the 1974 Congress to the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act will gradually reduce
firemen's allowable duty hours, and require an increase in personnel from the present average of
3.50 to between 4.20 and 5.25 to keep one fireman on duty. This highlights the need to look at
the alternative of improved built-in fire protection in both new and certain older buildings rather
than continuing to rely heavily on manual firefighting.
When fire does occur, an adequate supply of water is essential. Although Burlingame's water
system is rated by the Insurance Service Offices as a Class 2 system, there are some concerns
with it. A detailed study should be made of its capacity and its vulnerable aspects. Repair and
replacement work should fit into a master water plan, with priorities clearly identified.
The City's regional water supply is also at risk. The San Francisco Water Department, which
supplies Burlingame with water from an extensive system of reservoirs, has estimated that an
earthquake of 6 or more on the Richter scale would so damage their equipment that water to their
customer cities on the Peninsula would be shut off for an indefinite period. Burlingame would
then face the problem of one day's reserve of potable water, supplemented by three minor wells
that presently supply the High School. Fire fighting requirements could deplete this reserve to a
negligible quantity within hours.
Hot summer weather and high winds pose another hazard: a general conflagration covering
several city blocks. There have been no fires of this type anywhere in San Mateo County in
recent history. But the hazard exists, and in certain circumstances could be beyond our Fire
Department's ability to bring under immediate control. This hazard exists in large sections of the
single family residential districts of the city where combustible roofs predominate.
A related fire hazard exists in the relatively inaccessible Mills Canyon. In dry weather a minor
grass fire could possibly spread to trees and then to homes, if not brought under control quickly.
The Fire Department is aware of this potential danger, and has a program to spray weed control
chemicals in a pattern forming fire breaks throughout the wilderness area.
FLOODING
Large areas of the Millsdale Industrial Park lie just above the height of the average high tide on
San Francisco Bay. Given a higher than average tide and strong winds, these areas are
susceptible to extensive but shallow flooding. Properties recently developed in the C-4 District
along Bayshore Highway have had their average grade raised and tend to form a modest
"seawall." Undeveloped properties have left gaps in this system, and settlement of new fill will
gradually reduce the effectiveness of the present barrier. Benefits and costs of completing a

                                                                                                      SAFETY ELEMENT
seawall system should be prepared, together with a recommendation for the minimum acceptable
elevation for future shoreline improvements.
Other sources of flooding in the industrial area are the dykes along the principal drainage
channels. Water levels fluctuate with the tide and with storm runoff from the western hills.
Inadequate original dyke construction levels, and some settlement, have allowed the minor
hazard of local flooding to threaten a number of properties.
Good drainage during storm conditions depends on two additional factors: one, emergency
pumping; and two, storm drainage and storage or ponding capacity. Present pumping capacity is
modest, and lacks an adequate emergency power source. Ponding capacity is largely limited to
the City's "inner lagoon," between Bayshore Freeway and Anza Pacific property. A potential
additional area is the 140' wide PG&E right-of-way that runs at a low elevation through the
Rollins Road industrial area.
Extensive other areas of the City would be flood prone during the once in 100 year storm. 2
Existing defenses would likely be overtopped with such a storm, and structures and utilities
throughout the industrial district, Burlingame Grove, Villa Park and parts of the original
Burlingame Land Company subdivision would be affected. No estimates are available on the
likely direct costs from water damage, or the indirect costs from economic disruption.
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
The immediate danger that can occur from an inadequate water supply during a fire has been
mentioned already. A second principal hazard is pollution to the supply.
Burlingame buys its water from the City of San Francisco, which pipes it down from the Sierras.
Treatment and the major regional reservoir system are the responsibility of San Francisco. With
a local reservoir capacity approximately equivalent to only one day's needs, Burlingame's
principal function is that of a distributor and retailer. Pollution, if it occurs, will most likely be
from faults in the distribution system.
Many of the City's water mains are more than thirty years old, and susceptible to leaks. And
while a loss of water is an annoyance, a more serious problem is the possible penetration into the
system of sewage, garden fertilizers and chemicals. Modern more tightly sealed water mains,
operated at higher pressure, would reduce this hazard.
Low water main pressures affect the City in another way: they restrict more intensive residential
and commercial redevelopment. In a few of Burlingame's older districts, these low pressures
jeopardize even those densities permitted by the present Zoning Ordinance and Map.
         2
            Precise limits to areas subject to a flooding hazard are not available. For this report information was
abstracted from Lee and Lugo, Flood-Prone Area, U.S.G.S. Water-Resources Investigation 37-73 (Sheet 3). The City
recognizes, however, that these are preliminary findings and need to be reviewed on a parcel by parcel basis before
any attempt is made to implement a hazard abatement program.
City of Burlingame                                          S-9                                                General Plan
                                                                                   SAFETY ELEMENT
A third principal hazard with the City's water system is the present unavailability of alternative
sources in an emergency. Should the San Francisco Water Department be unable to supply the
cities of the Peninsula with water for any period, a major crisis would exist. An alternative
source, if only of a temporary nature, is needed. One possible solution was considered ten years
ago, when the City had access to nine capped wells. It was agreed that these wells should be
refurbished and made ready for emergency supplies. However, no action has yet been taken to
implement this decision.
Emergency water supplies to critical facilities also need to be assessed. For example, Peninsula
Hospital has only a 15 minute water supply. The Board of Directors has discussed the sinking of
two new wells, but financial constraints have prevented the implementation of the idea. Two
years ago the Hospital's supply main burst and the City operated water tankers to meet their
priority needs until repairs were made. This type of rescue operation could hardly be repeated
during a widespread, general disaster.
The sanitary sewer system poses equally great hazards. In the older districts of town the system
is largely assembled from brittle pipes with rigid joints. Unequal settlement causes leaks. More
extreme settlement occurs where the trunk sewers cross Baymud to the Wastewater Treatment
Plant. Misalignment could cause sufficient leakage or blockage to constitute a major public
health hazard.
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Landslides are a non-seismic hazard in Burlingame's western hills. Many of the natural factors
that promote landsliding, such as steep slopes, poorly consolidated bedrock, and occasionally
heavy rainfall, are known to exist in certain areas.
Some recent land developments may have increased the natural hazards; adding structures and
fill to marginally stable slopes, removing natural vegetation, improperly handling rainwater
runoff or simply watering lawns on unstable slopes will increase the danger of an earth or mud
slide. In general, where slopes are steepened or their moisture content increased, a higher
landslide potential is created.
An area with a history of landsliding should be of special concern, as most landslide activity
seems to recur within or adjacent to such zones. And within sensitive areas, the mitigation of one
natural hazard can sometimes increase another. For example, chemical spraying by the Fire
Department in the Mills Canyon Wildlife Area to form fire breaks may contribute to erosion, and
increase the potential for landslides.
As more specifically set forth in the Seismic Safety Element, soil instability settlement,
liquefaction and expansive soils - is a further hazard. However, incomplete information makes it
difficult to establish the extent of the potential problem.
OTHER DISASTERS
City of Burlingame                                S-10                                     General Plan
                                                                                     SAFETY ELEMENT
As addressed in the City's Emergency Operations Plan, "disasters" include civil disturbances -
bomb threats, sniper fire and riots - and natural emergencies. The more serious natural
emergencies have been described in preceding sections of this report.
Civil disturbances are mainly a police function, with defined roles for crowd containment, bomb
search and removal, emergency traffic control, and evacuation of endangered areas.
State guidelines declare this to be an optional issue in the Safety Element of a General Plan. It is
not proposed that the role of law enforcement agencies and the crime prevention aspects of land
use development be included in this first draft. Rather, it is the City's intention to review this
topic during the coming year and to prepare findings and recommendations for inclusion in the
emergency operations plan and in a future amendment of this Safety Element.
Coordination in time of emergency between City departments and other government agencies
and utilities is an additional concern. Responsibility for solutions to many disasters is presently
assigned to non-city agencies. For example, both PT&T and PG&E have full time engineers in
their Sacramento O.E.S. offices who take charge when emergencies occur. Both companies have
their own plans, are well organized and get plenty of disaster work, especially in the winter.
As a second example, the clearance of principal travel routes in emergencies is the responsibility
of the California Highway Patrol. They have plans showing emergency travel routes and check
points on all state highways.
The City has little impact on what the above three organizations do in time of disaster. We tell
them what is wrong; they go in an take care of it. This presumes our local problems have some
priority if there is a widespread disaster, and their men and equipment can be made available.
Coordination with parallel City departments is also presumed.
FURTHER STUDIES
Other safety hazards which will receive further study during the coming year are:
         1.Broken power transmission lines.
         2.Train derailment
         3.Airplane crash
         4.Fuel spill
         5.Fallen trees
City of Burlingame                               S-11                                        General Plan
                                                                                     SAFETY ELEMENT
                               CONCEPT OF RISK
In an attempt to give assistance to cities, the Council on Intergovernmental Relations has
composed guidelines which may be used in preparing a Safety Element. A central feature of
these guidelines is the concept of "acceptable risk."
Acceptable risk is defined as the level of risk below which no specific action by local
government is deemed necessary, other than making the risk known and suggesting remedial
measures for the public to take if they desire on their own to lessen the risk. In more general
terms, the concept means that local government must come to a conclusion concerning the
efforts which should be made to reduce a certain hazard.
As a local example, fire resistant roofs are required on Burlingame's public buildings, and in the
industrial and commercial districts of the city. Apartments are also subject to the policy. But a
single family house can have a roof of wood shingles. This has been considered an "acceptable
risk," one taken knowingly by the homeowner, and unlikely to jeopardize others. However, new
facts, financial circumstances or Fire Department procedures may cause the Council to judge that
such a roof is an "unacceptable risk," and prohibit it by ordinance.
Flooding in the industrial area is another example. Little life loss potential exists; damage has
always been limited to modest spoilage and inconvenience. Yet other cities consider any
flooding to be unacceptable, and have prepared dykes and installed pumps to safeguard
properties from all but a 100 year storm. The City may decide that extra expenditure on flood
prevention is justifiable, and establish a capital improvement item to implement the work over a
period of several years.
The many safety hazards identified in the previous section need to be reviewed within the
framework of acceptable-unacceptable risk. A policy position is a necessary first step. But a
necessary second step is a public commitment to: one, adopt an ordinance to limit private
actions; and two, budget for the expenditure of public funds to implement the adopted policy.

                                IMPLEMENTATION
FIRE
S(1): Survey older high rise buildings, and recommend ways that owners can provide a greater
         degree of built-in fire protection.
S(2): Survey older buildings with extensive floor areas, and recommend ways to increase fire
         safety.
S(3): Review desirability of a municipal ordinance requiring smoke activated fire alarm
         devices in existing buildings; determine types of building to which this should apply.
S(4): Evaluate existing hazard of combustible roofs in the City's residential areas; if
         unacceptable, propose ways to reduce the degree of risk.
S(5): Consider an education program to encourage all homeowners to install home fire
         detection systems. Consider an ordinance requiring all such systems installed in the city
         meet National Fire Protection Association standards, and requiring that all vendors and
         installers be required to obtain a permit before selling or installing such a system.
S(6): Review pros and cons of more extensive Mutual Aid and Automatic Aid agreements.
S(7): Consider establishment of a city fire service surtax on structures appreciably below
         present fire code standards. The assessment should be related to higher Fire Department
         costs needed for increased service to buildings without built-in protection.
S(8): Develop a clearly defined Fire Protection Strategy for adoption by the City Council. The
         report should include: policy statements, strategic objectives and tactical means to
         prevent, detect and control fires.
FLOODING
S(9): Review need for increased protection from high tides and storms on the Bay; estimate
         benefits and costs.
S(10): Recommend minimum acceptable elevation for future shoreline improvements; consider
         means to bring older, lower sites up to this standard.
S(11): Review dyke levels along the principal drainage channels in the industrial area;
         recommend minimum acceptable elevations, and prepare cost estimates for the required
         work.

         (e)Burlingame Creek in 200 block Primrose Road
S(12): Increase the City's emergency pumping ability with an independent power source; review
         need for additional pumps.
S(13): Affirm general policy to maintain PG&E right-of-way as emergency ponding reservoir;
         consider ordinance to prohibit development incompatible with this policy.
S(14): Prepare qualitative evaluation of ponding capacity of City's "inner lagoon".
S(15): Review impact of 100 year flood on Burlingame; consider preparation of plan and
         estimated cost of improvements to protect property with recommendations to meet
         situation and satisfy recent Federal requirements.
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL
S(17): Prepare detailed study of City's existing water circulation system; establish trouble points
         and recommend priorities for any immediate work required.*
S(18): Review desirability of connections with the cities of Millbrae and San Mateo for
         emergency supply. Consider wells and alternative sources to temporarily replace City of
         San Francisco water.
S(19): Evaluate hazard from failure of the City's two water reservoirs, and the need for
         emergency power supply for system's two water pumping stations; review need for
         additional pumping capacity.
S(20): Reassess hazards from pollution and infiltration of toxic substances into the water supply;
         recommend ways to reduce these hazards.
S(21): Evaluate compatibility of densities and maximum height limits presently allowed by the
         Zoning Ordinance with water system capacities.*
S(22): Review sewerage system capacity and condition; establish trouble points and recommend
         priorities for improvements.

                           NEGATIVE DECLARATION
The City of Burlingame does not have an adopted Safety Element of the General Plan. The
adoption of this element will, of its self, impose no environmental impact on the City or its
surroundings. The existence of the Safety Element of the General Plan, as opposed to no such
element, will provide guidelines for the enhancement of public safety, the reduction of risks to
acceptable levels, the improvement of response capability in a major disaster or emergency, and
the upgrading of codes and regulations to protect lives and property throughout Burlingame.

                                       INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE
The Scenic Roads and Highways Element is intended to provide for the protection and
preservation of attractive views from scenic routes for the enjoyment of the public and to
enhance the scenic qualities of Burlingame. The element, consisting of text and a map, is a guide
for actions needed to carry out this purpose.
The policy objectives for maintaining scenic roads and highways are:
         SR(A):To retain a system of arterials and local roads that are beautiful and useful to local
                   residents.
         SR(B): To harmonize roads and highways with adjacent land use and roadside
                   development.
         SR(C): To enhance the traveler's "view from the road."
LEGAL BASIS FOR THE SCENIC ROADS ELEMENT
1.       State Planning Law
California Government Code Section 65302(h) requires a Scenic Highways Element as part of a
comprehensive long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city and of
any lands outside its boundary which may bear some relation to the planning. The code
requirement is as follows:
         "The plan shall include a Scenic Highway Element for the development,
         establishment, and protection of scenic highways pursuant to the provisions of
         Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 260) of Chapter 2 of Division I of the
         Streets and Highways Code."
In Section 260 of the Streets & Highways Code the intent of the Legislature is expressed as:
         "... in designating certain portions of the state highway system as State scenic
         highways to establish the State's responsibility for the protection and
         enhancement of California's natural scenic beauty by identifying those portions of
         the State highway system which, together with the adjacent scenic corridors,
         require special scenic conservation treatment. It is further declared to be the
         intent of the Legislature in designating such scenic highways to assign
         responsibility for the development of such scenic highways and for the
         establishment and application of specific planning and design standards and
         procedures appropriate thereto and to indicate, in broad statement terms, the
         location and extent of routes and areas requiring continuing and careful
City of Burlingame                                 SR-2                                    General Plan
                                                             SCENIC ROADS AND HIGHWAYS ELEMENT
         coordination of planning, design, construction, and regulation of land use and
         development, by State and local agencies as appropriate, to protect the social and
         economic values provided by the State's scenic resources."
Section 263 of the Code includes Route 280 from Route 17 in Santa Clara County to Route 80
near First Street in San Francisco as a portion of the State Scenic Highway System.
Furthermore, Section 154 of the Code provides that the State Department of Transportation shall
encourage the development of County Scenic Highways when such county highways meet
prescribed standards for official scenic highways. When properly approved as County Scenic
Highways these routes may be included on maps and other publications. As of this time the
County of San Mateo is preparing a Scenic Roads Element of the San Mateo County General
Plan.
2.       CIR Guidelines
The Legislature in 1972 directed the Council on Intergovernmental Relations to draft advisory
guidelines for General Plan Elements. These guidelines indicate the Scenic Highways Element is
the initial step leading toward official designation as a scenic highway.
Consideration may be given to special features such as city entrances, bayfront arterials and
important natural or landscaped and beautified arterials. Inclusion of bike paths within a scenic
highway corridor may also be considered.
The guidelines suggest identification of scenic corridors, policies and programs to enhance and
protect them.
SCOPE AND NATURE
The primary emphasis of the Scenic Roads and Highways Element is on the designation of State
Highway Routes as "scenic" routes. The County of San Mateo Scenic Road Element recognizes
the importance of a system of scenic roads throughout both rural and urban areas. There are
many other scenic roads within the City of Burlingame and surrounding areas that offer pleasant
visual experiences. All scenic routes merit protection.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
The Scenic Roads and Highways Element relates directly to the Open Space and the Circulation
Element and indirectly to the Land Use Element. It is also related to urban design, beautification,
landscaping, street trees and review of signs and buildings.

                                                             SCENIC ROADS AND HIGHWAYS ELEMENT
                                    BACKGROUND
AREA COVERED
The Scenic Roads and Highways Element of the Burlingame General Plan extends beyond the
city limits to include adjacent unincorporated territories. The Junipero Serra Freeway, Route
280, which is located within the San Francisco PUC Watershed lands is immediately adjacent to
the Burlingame City limits at Skyline Boulevard and Trousdale Drive. Burlingame is a portion of
the scenic corridor along the crest of hills west of the urbanized area. This corridor includes
Route 280 and Skyline Boulevard, the two lane scenic highway which preceded the freeway.
DEFINITION OF TERMS
Scenic Corridor: The visible land area outside the highway right-of-way and generally
described as "the view from the road."
Official State Scenic Highway and Official County Scenic Highway: Scenic highways
officially designated by the Scenic Highways Advisory Committee after application from local
jurisdictions and only if on list of eligible highways found in Section 263 of the Streets and
Highways Code.
Rural Designated Scenic Highway: A route that traverses a defined corridor within which
natural scenic resources and aesthetic values are protected and enhanced.
Urban Designated Scenic Highway: A route that traverses a defined visual corridor which
offers an unhindered view of attractive urban scenes.
Scenic Connector: A segment of a scenic route where abutting properties are commercially or
industrially zoned.

STATE SCENIC HIGHWAY MASTER PLAN DESIGNATED ROUTES
Interstate Highway 280 traverses the western edge of the Burlingame Planning area. Because of
its location in the established City and County of San Francisco Watershed, these lands are
designated as permanent open space. The corridor for this freeway is proposed as an Official
State Scenic Highway. In Burlingame only residential and public uses will be permitted to abut
the Watershed.
COUNTY OF SAN MATEO SCENIC ROADWAY
Skyline Boulevard has been designated as an Official State Scenic Highway south from the Half
Moon Bay Road, Route 92. The link along Route 92 down to Crystal Springs Lakes and the
portion of Skyline Boulevard that extends north from Route 92 to Black Mountain Road might
also be designated a Scenic Roadway. From Black Mountain Road north to Trousdale there is a
frontage road that includes portions of the route that was previously Skyline Boulevard.
There is one County Scenic Road that permits a loop trip through the City of Burlingame. It is
designated on the map. The route follows Skyline Boulevard to Canyon Road, down a narrow
winding county road to Easton Drive and via Easton Drive to El Camino Real; then southeasterly
out of Burlingame into the City of San Mateo to Crystal Springs Road; and then return to
Skyline Boulevard via Crystal Springs Road.
El Camino Real from Easton Drive to Murchison Drive and Skyline Boulevard from Canyon
Road to Trousdale deserve the same consideration and protection as other county scenic roads.
OTHER SCENIC ROUTES
There are a number of alternate scenic roads between Skyline Boulevard and El Camino Real
that have segments in Burlingame: Chateau Drive, Ralston Avenue, Hillside Drive and
Trousdale Drive.
These collector streets are shown as arterials in the adopted Part III General Plan Diagram. It is
proposed that the City of Burlingame protect the visual quality of these local roads and the
corridors through which they pass.
Actually the last four blocks of Trousdale from Sequoia Drive to California Drive may be called
a scenic connector. The abutting property is zoned commercial and it is improved with office
buildings and retail stores.

Airport Boulevard is another scenic connector except the portion within Bayside Park and along
the shoreline of San Francisco Bay. Other local streets that have scenic qualities worthy of
recognition and protection include Occidental Avenue, Ray Drive, Bellevue Avenue,
Burlingame Avenue (east of Myrtle) and segments of California Drive.

        ACTION/IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
SCENIC HIGHWAYS
SR(1): The City of Burlingame recommends that Interstate Highway 280 be designated as a
         State Scenic Highway, because of the beauty of the countryside through which it passes,
         and because of the relative sensitivity and skillfulness of its design.
SR(2): El Camino Real, state highway Route 82, is a scenic highway where views from the road
         are contained. The Burlingame portion of this historic road is lined with huge elm and
         eucalyptus trees that form a tunnel of foliage. These heritage trees give Burlingame a
         distinctive image. The segments of El Camino Real where abutting property is zoned first
         commercial are defined as scenic connectors. Commercial buildings and signs along El
         Camino Real should receive design review and satisfy all municipal codes. Trim abutting
         properties along the road provide a scenic character and add to the Burlingame image.
SR(3): Except where traffic hazards might be created, median strips, traffic islands, and excess
         highway rights-of-way should be landscaped.
SCENIC ROADS
SR(4): The County of San Mateo proposes the loop via Skyline Boulevard, Canyon Road,
         Easton Drive, El Camino Real and Crystal Springs Road back to Skyline Boulevard be
         designated a County Scenic Roadway and part of the proposed Scenic Road System.
SR(5): Explore fully all practicable regulatory approaches intended to protect views along scenic
         highways and Burlingame's scenic routes.
SR(6): Consider a program to provide appropriate identification for Burlingame's scenic routes:
         highways and roads for motorists; routes, lanes and separate paths for bicyclists.
ENHANCEMENT
SR(7): Utility lines should be undergrounded wherever possible; and sensitively sited where
         placement must be aboveground.
SR(8): Plant materials should be used to screen or hide objectionable views.
SR(9): A design study should be prepared to include a San Francisco Bay viewscape plan for
         Airport Boulevard from Broadway to Coyote Point Drive.

                                                            SCENIC ROADS AND HIGHWAYS ELEMENT
SR(10):An integrated plan for hiking, riding and bike trails should be coordinated with the
         scenic road system. Plan for separate bike paths to be constructed along scenic road and
         highway routes whenever and wherever economically feasible, reasonable and practical.
SR(11):Previously adopted General Plan Elements express as public policy the other actions
         needed to help carry out this Scenic Roads and Highways Element.
                       NEGATIVE DECLARATION
The City of Burlingame does not have an adopted Scenic Highways Element of the General
Plan. The adoption of this element will, of its self, have no environmental impact on the City or
its surroundings. Adoption of the Scenic Roads and Highways Element of the General Plan will
provide policies and guidelines for protecting attractive views from scenic highways and scenic
routes in and adjacent to the City of Burlingame.

                                        INTRODUCTION
GENERAL OBJECTIVES
Natural seismic hazards exist in Burlingame because of the City's proximity to two major active
earthquake faults: the San Andreas Fault running north to south through the hills in the west; and
the Hayward Fault, fifteen miles to the east. Earthquakes cause damage, but the risks of loss of
life and property can be reduced with a willingness to require high standards of new construction
and a careful review of older buildings, existing hazards and emergency action procedures.
The following are recommended objectives for the Seismic Safety Element:
         1.       Identification of those areas of the City where special seismic hazard potentials
                  exist.
         2.       Identification of measures, in addition to those already in effect, that will reduce
                  unavoidable risk, and thus future injuries and loss of lives.
         3.       Improved community capacity to respond promptly and effectively in the event of
                  a major earthquake.
         4.       Increased public understanding of seismic safety so that unnecessary risk may be
                  avoided (see also Safety Element 1 ) .
LEGAL BASIS FOR THE SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
1.       State Planning Law
California Government Code Section 65302(f) requires: "A Seismic Safety Element consisting
of an identification and appraisal of seismic hazards such as susceptibility to surface ruptures
from faulting, to ground shaking, to ground failures, or to the effects of seismically induced
waves such as tsunamis and seiches.
"The Seismic Safety Element shall also include an appraisal of mudslides, landslides, and slope
stability as necessary geologic hazards that must be considered simultaneously with other
hazards such as possible surface ruptures from faulting, ground shaking, ground failure and
seismically induced waves."
         1
           The Seismic Safety Element is closely related to the Safety Element. Both are concerned with the hazards
of unstable geological conditions and their effects on personal injuries and property damage. The Safety Element,
however, stresses the relationship of other natural hazards to public safety.
City of Burlingame                                       SS-3                                           General Plan
                                                                            SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
2.       CIR Guidelines
The legislature in 1972 directed the Council on Intergovernmental Relations to draft advisory
guidelines for General Plan Elements. The most pertinent excerpt from G. C. Section 3421.1
reads: "In connection with its responsibilities under Section 3421.1, the Council shall develop
and adopt guidelines for the preparation and content of the mandatory elements required in city
and county general plans by Article 5 (commencing with Section 65300) of Chapter 3 of Title
7."
SUMMARY OF SEISMIC SAFETY FINDINGS
1.       Burlingame has no known major active faults within the city limits. The San Andreas
         Fault Zone, however, lies immediately west of the city.
2.       The Serra Fault, a low potential active fault, bisects the western hills (see Plate 1).
3.       The alluvial deposits overlaying bedrock, and particularly the baymuds under recent fill,
         intensify ground shaking in those areas due to the average earthquake.
4.       Soil instability due to earthquake induced landsliding would probably be confined to
         limited areas of the western hills already known to be unstable (see Plate 3).
5.       Hazard from loss of soil stability and subsidence due to liquefaction in the event of a
         large quake may be present in areas of alluvial deposits, but the degree of risk has not
         been established.
6.       Inundation hazard of developed Baylands by tsunamis is limited to the immediate
         shoreline (see Plate 5).
7.       The great majority of single family homes in Burlingame will not constitute a major risk
         to their residents in an earthquake.
8.       Multi-storied, multi-family structures are likely to be considerably more vulnerable to
         damage under similar conditions in a major earthquake.
9.       Many older commercial structures, especially those of masonry construction, may be
         hazardous in a moderate to severe earthquake.
10.      City and County disaster planning at present does not make extensive provision for major
         earthquake disasters.

MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS OF SEISMIC SAFETY
1.       Consider developing a "balanced risk" policy that relates seismic hazards to acceptable
         risk by building type and intensity of use.
2.       Require that new development incorporate seismic hazard mitigation measures to reduce
         risk to an acceptable level.
3.       Establish procedures that could be used to reduce seismic risk in existing buildings.
4.       Review and update the City's disaster preparedness plan.
5.       Improve interjurisdictional cooperation and communication in regard to seismic safety.
6.       Advocate seismic safety educational programs for schools and promote greater general
         public awareness of all types of geotechnical hazards.
7.       Periodically update and refine this element to enable it to achieve its general objectives.

                                                                           SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                   BACKGROUND
AREA COVERED
This seismic safety study is focused on the City of Burlingame, with recommendations directed
to local responses. It is recognized, however, that the natural hazards leading to local seismic
and geologic problems are shared with both the County and other areas of this State. The
Countywide Seismic Safety-Safety Element describes these hazards and helps establish the
context for the physical limits set in this report.
FACTORS CONSIDERED
This Seismic Safety Element will treat identified seismic hazards due to faults, ground shaking
effects, ground failures, seiches and tsunamis, and mudslides that may occur as the result of
seismic activity. To the limited extent that data is presently available, an analysis could be made
of the existing older buildings in Burlingame to assess their susceptibility to damage. The risks
inherent in other structures and potential disruption to the City's underground utilities will also
be reviewed. The planned response to public safety and economic aspects are additional major
factors to be considered in this element.
INFORMATION SOURCES
In addition to the County of San Mateo's review of regional seismic hazards, this element has
drawn on a report prepared for Burlingame by Howard F. Donley & Associates on the Geologic
Fault Hazard Zone in the Western Hills of the City. The report identified the location of the
Serra Fault, a low potential active fault within the terms of the Alquist-Priolo Act, and suggested
procedures that could be used to reduce risk of damage from future fault movements.
The City's Building Department contributed a number of soils reports on bayland properties that
have been recently filled. Other data was drawn from the Basic Data Contribution series
published jointly by the U. S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey and by the U. S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development as a part of their San Francisco Bay Region
Environment and Resources Planning Study Project. These documents and others are listed in
the bibliography at the end of this element.

                                                                           SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                  SEISMIC HAZARDS
ACTIVE FAULTS
San Andreas Fault is one of the more active in California and stretches for 650 miles north-to-
south. It was responsible for the San Francisco 1906 earthquake, and the less severe 1957 quake
that damaged Daly City. It may mark the boundary between the Pacific and North American
plates of the earth's crust. Its position just west of Burlingame avoids the hazard of surface
rupture within the city, but threatens major ground shaking and ground failure in future.
Hayward Fault lies about fifteen miles to the east of Burlingame at the base of the East Bay hills.
Historically, this fault has produced the most moderate-sized earthquakes in the Bay Area and
future ones could be sharply felt here.
Serra Fault is a minor thrust fault that runs from Millbrae through Burlingame, passing under the
western end of Mariposa Drive and moving south via Mills Creek to Kenmar Way and into the
town of Hillsborough. Consider to have common roots with the San Andreas Fault, it is assumed
to be potentially active and poses future problems of surface rupture and damage to any structure
built over its path. Little risk to life is anticipated.
GROUND SHAKING
The major cause of damage during an earthquake is ground shaking, with frequency and
amplitude of motion dependent on local geologic conditions. Sites on bedrock tend to have
sharp, high frequency jolts with little amplitude, while sites on deep alluvium receive lower
frequency shocks but suffer movement with high amplitude.
Recent regional studies have suggested that the response of certain soils such as "baymuds" to
earthquakes will also vary according to the depth of soil and the magnitude of the quake. Thus,
ground accelerations of smaller quakes are magnified as much as three times over the
acceleration bedrock, whereas ground accelerations of a large quake (7.5 or more on the Richter
scale) would be reduced to a value below that of the underlying bedrock. 2
Burlingame's industrial area and waterfront commercial district are on fill over "baymud" and
may be subject to both unequal settlement and increased accelerations from most local
earthquakes. The additional potential for damage from liquefaction and sliding is also present
for those buildings with inadequate foundations.
LANDSLIDES
Many of the natural factors that promote landsliding, such as steep slopes, poorly consolidated
bedrock, and occasional heavy rainfall, are present in Burlingame's western hills.

           Redwood City, General Plan: Seismic Safety Element, pg. 8.
City of Burlingame                                    SS-7                                General Plan
                                                                           SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
Some recent land developments may have increased the natural hazards; adding structures and
fill to marginally stable slopes, removing natural vegetation, improperly handling rainwater
runoff or simply watering lawns on unstable slopes will increase the danger of a landslide. In
general, where slopes are steepened or their moisture content increased, a higher landslide
potential is created.
An area with a history of landsliding should be of special concern, as most landslide activity
seems to recur within or adjacent to such areas.
SOIL STABILITY
Four broad groups of soils exist in Burlingame:
         1.      Baylands: extensive fill over the "baymud" of the historic marshlands.
         2.      Alluvium Plains: gravel, sand, silt and clay deposits under the Town of
                 Burlingame, Corbitt Tract, Burlingame Park and the lower portions of the Easton
                 Addition.
         3.      Foothill Band: "Merced Formation" sandstone, siltstone and claystone, with some
                 slope wash and ravine fill of gravel, silt and clay.
         4.      Western Hills: primarily sheared Franciscan rocks of a variety of types, including
                 graywacke-sandstone, chert, greenstone, serpentine and blueschist, often held in a
                 softer matrix of clay materials.
Under seismic conditions most Burlingame soils are reasonably stable. Exceptions include the
Baylands and the limited areas of the hills where unstable slopes and possible surface rupture
from the Serra Fault make local hazardous conditions. Incomplete information makes it difficult
to establish the extent of the possible hazard on the alluvium plains and baylands from
liquefaction, where a loss of strength suddenly occurs because of excess pore pressure under
seismic shock conditions: this hazard is limited to alluvial soils underlain by lenses of water-
bearing sands and gravels.
INUNDATION OF DEVELOPED AREAS
"Tsunamis" are seismic sea waves, often called tidal waves. Burlingame's position on the
southwest shore of San Francisco Bay effectively shields the city from these major ocean waves.
However, secondary waves would cause limited inundation of the lower baylands.
"Seiches" are earthquake induced waves in lakes and reservoirs. There may be a limited hazard
from such waves in the "inner lagoon" between Bayshore Freeway and Anza Pacific Corporation
property. Extensive other areas of the city are subject to a 100 year flood. Damage from such
storms is likely to exceed inundations of seismic origin, and affect structures and utilities
throughout the industrial district, Burlingame Grove, Villa Park and parts of the original
Burlingame Land Company subdivision.

The State Joint Committee on Seismic Safety has observed that "the works of man loom as the
principal cause of earthquake (risk)... and in a seismic region like California, every significant
structure can be expected to undergo at least one major earthquake in its lifetime. Every
structure should be made as secure against shaking or ground failure as is practical."
WOOD FRAME BUILDINGS
The majority of buildings in Burlingame are one- and two-story timber construction. Such
buildings can be expected to perform fairly well during a moderate quake, and many would
survive a large one. Those built to the requirements of the 1933 or later editions of the Uniform
Building Code have a high resistance to seismic forces, and although they may be damaged in a
severe earthquake, human casualties will likely be minimal.
There are two significant possible exceptions to the above:
         1.      Wood frame dwellings constructed, on steep hillsides where ground failure may
                 cause such intense local stress on the foundation and structure that a general
                 collapse occurs.
         2.      Wood frame apartments built above a one-story parking garage. The masonry
                 walls of the garage are often a weak link, and subject to local failure.
MASONRY BUILDINGS
Masonry buildings in Burlingame are concentrated in the city's shopping areas and industrial
district. Many of these buildings are new and strongly reinforced. However, many of the older
structures would be badly damaged in a moderate quake, with older open-front commercial
buildings receiving severe glass damage and some degree of roof failure. A severe quake could
collapse unreinforced masonry walls (pre-1933 construction) and encourage major roof failure
and consequent loss of life in these structures.
OTHER STRUCTURES
Hospitals, fire and police facilities are especially critical, with the requirement that they must
survive a strong earthquake and continue to supply the emergency services that Burlingame
would need immediately afterward. The Seismic Disaster Preparedness Section of this element
reviews the role of earthquake response planning.
Public schools are another sensitive facility, and have been the focus of a recent State program to
upgrade their safety. New schools, and those older schools reinforced to current code
requirements, have had the best performance record of all major structures in recent California

                                                                            SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
earthquakes. Private schools are not generally constructed to the same standards, and the
potential for casualties is correspondingly larger.
Minor structures, such as swimming pools can create unnecessary risks if they are badly located
and under designed. A pool in the hills which breaks and empties may cause a mudslide, with
further damage if there is a house or utility lines in the path of the mud flow.
PUBLIC UTILITIES
Water: buried water pipes generally have a good record even in heavy quakes, providing no
strong shear forces develop.
Electricity: a major quake could result in a 50% loss of service for 24 hours. PG&E is not
responsible for emergency power supply.
Natural gas: most gas pipelines traverse bay mud areas, with the consequent risk that ground
distortion during an earthquake could rupture a pipe and cause a partial pressure failure.
Sanitary and storm sewer systems: older sewerage systems, with rigid joints coupled with
brittle piping, can expect major damage. A further problem is likely to exist where trunk sewers
cross bay mud to disposal plants.

                                                                             SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                           BALANCED RISK POLICY
The two central questions to any review of seismic hazards are: How much loss of life and
property damage are we willing to risk in future tremors? What costs are we willing to bear to
reduce these risks? The objective of this section of the Seismic Safety Element is to develop an
approach to a policy that will answer these questions, and make clear the values of the City
Council to the general community that may be expected to share these costs.
HAZARD VS. RISK
The terms "hazard" and "risk" are often used interchangeably. Yet each has a specific, separate
meaning:
         Seismic hazard is defined as "expected occurrence of future adverse seismic event."
         Seismic risk is defined as "expected consequences of future seismic event."
Earthquakes do occur, and cannot be prevented. But the consequences of an earthquake-- loss of
life, property damage, social and economic disruption-- can be made less severe. Earthquake
hazards can be studied, while seismic risks can be reduced with better methods of construction
and future patterns of land use.
Certain generalities can be noted:
         1.      Risk is a part of everyday life as all activities have some risk associated with
                 them.
         2.      Minimizing risks often results in higher construction costs. A decision is needed
                 on the balance between construction costs and risk levels acceptable to the
                 community.
         3.      Some risks are taken unknowingly. The public should be aware of the seismic
                 risks it takes in certain situations.
         4.      With existing structures, risks can be reduced by relocation, demolition, physical
                 alteration or changing the use of these structures.
VOLUNTARY VS. INVOLUNTARY RISKS
Where people have little or no choice as to the structures they occupy, the seismic risk ought to
be extremely low. Examples of such structures include schools, hospitals, libraries and other
places of public assembly. In the case of private structures, the presumption is that somewhat
higher risks are acceptable when these risks are knowingly taken.
City of Burlingame                                 SS-17                                    General Plan
                                                                            SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
 BALANCED RISK POLICY
 Safeguards from seismic risk are designed into most new construction through earthquake
 standards in the Uniform Building Code. Average earthquake forces are estimated, safety factors
 added, and design coefficients produced that are applied to new buildings. However, if a severe
 earthquake strikes closer than expected, the structure may fail despite the code and its standard
 factor of safety.
 A recent code change adopted by the City of Long Beach adds a new criterion: what does the
 community judge to be a "tolerable death risk"? Presented with a risk range of one death per
 100,000 people per year exposed, to one per 10,000,000, the City Council decided on a death
 risk of one death per million people per year exposed for all existing buildings. This recognizes
 that buildings intensively used, and likely to be in use for many years, should be stronger than
 other structures with modest occupant loads. For example, a hospital occupied by thousands of
 people twenty-four hours each day, to be used for 50 years, should have a higher earthquake
 resistance than a single-story warehouse occupied by a half-dozen people eight hours each day
 for 10 years. Using present codes, the risk of death per person exposed will be higher in the
 hospital than in the warehouse. The risks should be at least equal, and perhaps favor the hospital
 on the theme of voluntary/involuntary risk.
 Four factors can be assembled into an earthquake risk policy:
           1.     Number of people using a given building per day.
           2.     Expected life of the building.
           3.     "Critical facility" judgment on building's importance to the community.
           4.     Evaluation of the seismic or geologic hazards in the environs of the proposed or
                  existing building.
 Implementation of the balanced risk policy would require:
           1.     Assign an "importance factor" to a building.
Average Daily Exposure                  Expected Building

                        2) Foundation investigations to determine and estimate differential
                        settlement potential; 3) Detailed fault and/or landslide analysis.
                 (D)    All of the above, plus dynamic ground and structural response, and

         This approach to seismic and geologic hazards has the advantage of recognizing the use,
         location and expected life of a building, and could supplement present earthquake codes
         to maintain safety standards measured on a risk-exposure basis. It could be applied to
         both new and existing structures. Applied to older buildings, it would provide an
         objective basis for a renovation program by property owners, improving the more
         dangerous buildings first.

                        DISASTER PREPAREDNESS
The term "seismic disaster", as used in this element, means significant and widespread damage
of buildings and infrastructure as the result of an earthquake. A "disaster" does not necessarily
imply casualties but means that the effects of a seismic disturbance have seriously disrupted the
normal life and economy of the city.
CITY OF BURLINGAME EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN
The County of San Mateo and twenty of its cities comprise the San Mateo Operational Area
Civil Defense and Disaster Organization. This organization works with State and Federal
counterparts and is headquartered in Redwood City. Its operational plan outlines the roles of the
County and the several cities in the event of a natural disaster, and is intended to provide
coordination, leadership and area-wide communications.
The City of Burlingame has a complementary Emergency Operations Plan. Originally prepared
as a civil defense handbook, concerned with enemy attack and nuclear fallout, the plan has
recently been expanded to include "natural disasters" - windstorms, floods and fires - and in a
minor way, seismic and geologic events. However, with recent advances in State and County
knowledge of earthquake response planning, several of the fundamental concerns of
Burlingame's Emergency Operations Plan should be amended and brought up to date. Task
priorities during a seismic disaster should also be more clearly identified within the
organizational responsibilities already specified in the Plan.
EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE PLANNING
The State Office of Emergency Services recommends that local earthquake emergency plans
include provisions for:
1.       An organization which:
         (a)     Has assigned emergency functions to intrajurisdictional agencies to perform field
                 operations;
         (b)     Has personnel designated and trained to perform specific tasks both within the
                 control center and the damaged area;
         (c)     Controls and coordinates field operations from a predesignated, earthquake-
                 resistant control center;
         (d)     Has communications to all operating field forces and with higher and lower levels
                 of government, to exchange operational information;

                                                                            SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
         (e)     Has a staff to prepare and disseminate essential public information; and
         (f)     Conducts exercises to perfect and test plans and procedures.
2.       Pre-earthquake preparations which:
         (a)     Consider vulnerable structures in relationship to their effect on emergency
                 operations;
         (b)     Have outlined areas subject to inundation due to the failure of dams, and
                 developed plans and procedures for rapid notification and evacuation of people
                 from such areas;
         (c)     Identify and inventory available essential resources;
         (d)     Establish procedures for obtaining mutual aid;
         (e)     Insure continuity of emergency communication systems, including augmentation
                 of operating agency radio communications with Radio Amateur Communications
                 Emergency Services or other organized volunteer emergency radio capability; and
         (f)     Insure continued operation or rapid restoration of essential public utilities.
3.       Post-earthquake operations which:
         (a)     Provide rapid surveillance and assessment of the damaged area;
         (b)     Search out and rescue people trapped in damaged structures of isolated danger
                 areas;
         (c)     Conduct medical triage for the injured;
         (d)     Provide first aid in the damage area and transport injured to emergency medical
                 facilities;
         (e)     Provide necessary fire prevention, firefighting and lifesaving services in
                 devastated or threatened areas;
         (f)     Clear debris from transportation routes into and away from damaged areas;
         (g)     Evacuate or direct people from danger areas to locations providing relative safety,
                 shelter, and sustenance;
         (h)     Provide traffic supervision and control along established evacuation routes, and
                 security for evacuated areas;
         (i)     Care for displaced people;

                                                                              SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
         (j)     Remove, identify, and preserve dead for future disposal;
         (k)     Provide for reuniting families;
         (1)     Provide for informing victim's relatives outside of area;
         (m)     Relieve hardship and expedite rapid and orderly reconstruction and
                 redevelopment;
         (n)     Prepare and disseminate essential public information through the news media;
         (o)     Prepare and maintain a log of operations; and
         (p)     Develop a procedure for cooperating with qualified earthquake investigators.
PUBLIC AWARENESS
Unlike many other natural disasters, an earthquake gives little or no warning before it strikes. It
is important, therefore, that preparations be taken by the public before the event to reduce the
risk, of damage and loss of life. Precautions include:
         1.      Potential earthquake risks in the home should be corrected.
         2.      Supplies of food and water, a flashlight, a first aid kit, and a battery-powered
                 radio should be set aside for use in emergencies.
         3.      One or more members of the family should have a knowledge of first aid
                 procedures because medical facilities nearly always are overloaded during an
                 emergency or disaster, or may themselves be damaged beyond use.
         4.      All responsible family members should know how to turn off the electricity, water
                 and gas.
Public awareness of seismic hazards and risks should be encouraged whenever possible. And
with the recognition that some damage will occur, in spite of all precautions, the State's Joint
Committee on Seismic Safety has recommended that all new borrowers who are purchasing
residential structures should be required by lending institutions to have earthquake insurance,
just as is now the case for fire insurance.

                                                                            SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
                                IMPLEMENTATION
Since Seismic Safety is a new element of the Burlingame General Plan, it should be looked upon
as a first phase in a continuing process of research, refinement and implementation. The
following actions are recommended to begin this process.
POLICIES
         SS(A): Consider developing a "balanced risk" policy that relates seismic hazards to
                 acceptable risk by building type and intensity of use.
         SS(B): Require that new development incorporate seismic hazard mitigation measures to
                 reduce risk to an acceptable level.
         SS(C): Institute a continuing program of evaluating existing structures with a high risk
                 rating, a high intensity occupancy and those critical facilities that must survive a
                 severe earthquake.
         SS(D): Encourage the reduction of risks associated with the more dangerous existing
                 buildings through action programs, including renovation and occupancy
                 reduction.
         SS(E): Consider an ordinance requiring the preparation of internal emergency response
                 plans for facilities housing dependent populations.
         SS(F): Define a policy for properties over or immediately adjacent to the Serra Fault.
         SS(G): Periodically update and refine this element to enable it to achieve its general
                 objectives.
         SS(H): Consider the establishment of a Seismic Safety Committee to assume
                 responsibility for the implementation of this element.
         SS(I): Consider selecting a qualified geotechnical firm to advise the city during the
                 implementation period of the larger seismic safety projects.
SS(J): Consider establishing procedures to make available to the public all known, pertinent
geotechnical data regarding their property, and other reports of a more general nature on city-
wide seismic hazards.
ACTIONS:
SS(1): Implement agreed programs to improve or abate existing dangerous buildings.
         SS(2): Survey major structures to determine the need for a parapet ordinance (applying
                 to parapets, signs, marquees and general, ornamentation).

         SS(3): Consider placing fault movement gauges along active fault traces to monitor
                 activity.
         SS(4): Review and update the City's disaster preparedness plan.
         SS(5): Assess need for additional earthquake and flood insurance on City property and
                 facilities.
         SS(6): Improve interjurisdictional cooperation and communication in regard to seismic
                 safety.

NEGATIVE DECLARATION
In 1973 San Mateo County initiated coordinated planning studies with local cities for those State
mandated General Plan elements that address technical problems of a regional nature. Seismic
safety, air quality, noise, public safety and scenic highways were mentioned as possible topics
for joint review.
A work program was drafted for a completion date of September 20, 1974, with costs and staff
time budgeted on a shared basis. After further review a more limited objective was agreed:
preparation of a countywide combined Seismic Safety-Safety Element. Individual cities would
contribute on a per capita basis towards the costs of the technical input, and then would be free
to add a supplement that would focus the broad report on local issues. In mid-1974 the County
Board of Supervisors requested and received an extension of the completion date to September
20, 1975, from the Council on Intergovernmental Relations. With the completion of the County
Planning Department's first draft of the general report, City staff began study of the local
problems and special issues that a Burlingame Seismic Safety Element should assess. This
report is the result of these efforts, and reviews seismic and geologic findings at a city scale. A
number of new policies are recommended for adoption into the General Plan, and possible
implementation steps are described that could reduce many of the earthquake associated risks
that presently exist in Burlingame. The Countywide Seismic Safety-Safety Element should serve
as a companion report to this local Seismic Safety Element, and be used as background for the
technical terms and regional profiles necessary for an understanding of geologic and seismic
safety issues.
The City of Burlingame does not have an adopted Seismic Safety Element of the General Plan.
The adoption of this element will, of its self, have no environmental impact on the City or its
surroundings. The existence of the Seismic Safety Element of the General Plan, as opposed to
no such element, will provide guidelines for the enhancement of public safety, the reduction of
risks to acceptable levels, the improvement of response capability in a major earthquake, and the
upgrading of codes and regulations to protect lives and property throughout Burlingame.
