 DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION
 The Vallejo Housing Element is organized into six main sections: an overview of the key sections
 of the Housing Element, an Introduction to the Housing Element, the City’s public participation
 efforts, a review of the previous Housing Element, the City’s Housing Needs Assessment
 including demographic information, and finally the City’s Housing Element Goals, Policies,
 and Programs. The Housing Element also includes the following appendices to accompany
 the document: Appendix A – Vacant Residential Land Inventory and Sites Map; Appendix B
 – Public Comment; Appendix C – Stakeholders Included in Outreach Efforts; and Appendix D
 – Properties in Foreclosure.
 OVERVIEW
 The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of its
 current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing
 to meet those needs at all income levels. The importance of compliance lies in the legal
 responsibility the City has to maintain a certified Housing Element, which protects the City
 against litigation and its associated costs, and allows the City to be more competitive for State
 grant funds.
 Housing is a high priority for the City of Vallejo as a means to balance the community as
 it evolves. Vallejo has a high proportion of older rental housing stock, and housing prices
 are generally somewhat lower in the City than in other Bay Area communities. Vallejo is
 committed to a balanced housing plan that accounts for the wide range of issues that affect
 the housing needs of its citizens. In developing this plan, the City recognizes that housing can
 be defined in a variety of ways including:
         Housing as a safe shelter to an individual or family, an investment, or sense of identity
         Housing comprises neighborhoods, community identity, sense of place, history, culture,
          and diversity
 The City has worked conscientiously to develop a Housing Element that reflects these
 definitions and to strive for a community where an economically and socially balanced
 and diverse community can become a reality. The City is committed to making a diligent
 effort to address all the housing needs in the community. As such, the policies and
 programs contained in this Element are an expression of the statewide housing goal of
 “attaining decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family.” More
 importantly, this Element reflects the City’s desire to address its unique housing needs in a
 manner that creates a more balanced community.
 During the last Housing Element cycle, the City experienced considerable financial hardship,
 including filing for bankruptcy, as well as wholesale structural reorganization. The associated
 budget and staffing constraints have made it very difficult for the City to obtain many of the
 goals outlined in the previous Housing Element. The City is home to a considerable number of
 subsidized housing units and faces significant challenges concerning the concentration of
 poverty, property maintenance, and the provision of services.
 Currently there are 1,849 assisted housing units in the City and approximately 350 housing units
 in foreclosure. A detailed list of affordable housing units can be found in Tables 29 and 30, and
 a complete list of foreclosed housing properties can be found in Appendix D.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                             1

 The City is beginning to emerge from this difficult period with renewed optimism, as its fiscal
 health improves and it undertakes a comprehensive update of its development regulations,
 including the City’s entire General Plan and Zoning Code (Propel Vallejo). The Propel Vallejo
 Initiative, of which this Housing Element Update is a part, is intended to catalyze the
 revitalization of Vallejo, improving its ability to provide housing for all income levels within the
 Community.
PUBLIC OUTREACH
 Propel Vallejo
 The Propel Vallejo planning initiative is currently underway. This large-scale effort includes a
 General Plan Update, the creation of the Sonoma Boulevard Specific Plan and a City wide
 Zoning Code update. A key component of the Propel Vallejo process has been public
 outreach. The General Plan Working Group was appointed to represent the community in
 creating a General Plan document that is responsive to neighborhood and community goals,
 conditions and guiding principles.
 Specific to the Housing Element update, the City conducted a kickoff meeting in July of 2014,
 and a public workshop on October 23, 2014. The workshop solicited community input on three
 topics: constraints to housing, programs and local resources, and special needs. Participants
 provided critical community feedback. The Housing Element was also discussed at the
 December 15, 2014, Planning Commission meeting.
 REVIEW OF PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS
 Vallejo has made progress toward achieving one-time and ongoing goals set in the existing
 Housing Element for the period 2007 to 2014. As required by HCD, the report includes an
 extensive review and analysis of the programs contained in the Element.
 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW
 In accordance with State law, the Housing Needs Assessment describes local housing,
 economic, and demographic conditions, and summarizes constraints to the development
 of housing affordable to all income levels and special needs populations. In addition, the
 Housing Needs Assessment demonstrates the City’s progress toward meeting its Regional
 Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) and shows capacity to meet the remaining allocation
 with appropriately zoned vacant or underutilized land.
 Demographic Characteristics
         According to the U.S. Census, in 2000 Vallejo had a population of approximately 116,760. In
          2010, the population decreased to 115,942
         The 2012 median household income in Vallejo was estimated at $60,764.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                             2

         The median age for the City of Vallejo was 37.9 in 2010, which is an increase from the 2000
          median age (34.9). Similarly, the County’s median age in 2010 was slightly lower than the
          City’s, at 36.9.
         From 2000 to 2010 the persons per household decreased in Vallejo from 2.9 to 2.82.
         Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of Vallejo’s population in the 55 to 64-year-old age
          group grew most rapidly, increasing its share from 8 to 14 percent of the total population, a
          68.5 percent increase.
         The number of employed Vallejo residents represented nearly 25 percent of Solano County
          employment
         Special Needs Housing – HCD requires an assessment of housing for certain special needs
          groups, such as large families, the elderly, persons with disabilities, single-parent households,
          farmworkers, schoolteachers, and homeless persons.
 Housing Affordability by Household Income
 Housing and rental prices in Vallejo are considerably lower than in other jurisdictions in Solano
 County, and the City remains a relatively affordable place to live in the Bay Area. More
 information is presented in the Housing Affordability and Cost section of the Needs Assessment,
 beginning on page 47.
 Affordability is based on the following assumptions: a household spending 30 percent or less
 of its total household income for shelter; the maximum household income levels established
 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and HCD; and maximum
 affordable sales prices based on a 10 percent down, 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 7 percent.
         Rental Housing –- Median rental prices in Vallejo range from $1,236 to $1,551 for a two- or
          three-bedroom apartment and $1,300 to $1,585 for the same size single-family home rentals.
         Homeownership in Vallejo is slightly lower in 2012 (55%) than Solano County (59%), but is on
          par with the Bay Area overall (54%)
         Vallejo has a higher percentage of residents living in poverty than Solano County and the
          Bay Area, at 18.6% in Vallejo versus 14.6% in Solano County and 11.7% in the Bay Area.
 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
 The first step in addressing State housing needs is the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA),
 which is mandated by California Government Code, Section 65584. HCD allocates RHNA
 numbers to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), which allocated projected
 housing needs to Vallejo. Vallejo’s RHNA for the 2015–2023 planning period is 1,362 units for all
 four income categories. Vallejo’s RHNA target for the planning period January 31, 2015 to
 January 31, 2023 for each of the four household income groups is: very low-income (283 units),
 low-income (178 units), moderate-income (211 units), and above moderate-income (690 units).
 Based on building permits issued since January 2014 the City has already produced 17 units,
 leaving a remaining need of 1,345 units.

 Land Availability
 In order to determine which current land is available to meet the RHNA for the City, HCD
 considers existing land zoned for residential single- and multi-family development. The report
 provides an extensive analysis of land availability in Vallejo. There are currently enough
 appropriately zoned sites to accommodate up to 1,429 units, which is 84 units more than the
 remaining need of 1,345 units.
 Constraints on Housing Availability
 The report provides an analysis of how the City’s regulatory framework and market factors
 may constrain housing development by evaluating development fees, land use
 designations and zoning codes, land and construction costs, and the availability of housing
 financing.
 Goals, Policies, Programs
 The proposed Goals, Policies, Programs, and Objectives contained in this Housing Element
 Update have been modified from the prior Housing Element based on findings in the Housing
 Needs Assessment, the review of the previous Housing Element and input from the Community.
 For this Housing Element planning period, the Goals and Policies of the previous Housing
 Element remain largely intact. Certain programs and other elements have been added,
 modified, or deleted based on a review of progress to date and in coordination with the goals
 and intent of the Propel Vallejo Initiative, currently underway. The Goals of the Housing Element
 are as follows:
         Goal A – Facilitate Production of Housing to Accommodate Vallejo’s Fair Share of the
                    Regional Housing Demand.
         Goal B – Increase the Range of Affordable Housing Opportunities.
         Goal C – Improve and Preserve the City’s Existing Supply of Affordable Housing.
         Goal D – Increase Homeownership Opportunities.
         Goal E – Encourage Housing to Meet the Needs of the City’s Special Needs Population.
         Goal F – Provide Housing Choice for Vallejo Residents.
         Goal G – Build and Maintain Quality Residential Environments and Where Necessary
                    Substantially Rehabilitate the City’s Aging Housing Stock.
         Goal H – Guide Development of Balanced Neighborhoods.
         Goal I – Promote Energy Efficiency.

 INTRODUCTION
 PURPOSE
 The purpose of the Housing Element is to establish a comprehensive, long-term plan to
 address housing needs in the City of Vallejo (hereinafter “Vallejo”).
 AUTHORITY
 Along with seven other mandated elements, State law requires that the Housing Element be
 a part of Vallejo’s General Plan. As mandated by State law, the Housing Element contains
 an extensive Housing Needs Assessment that evaluates local conditions and needs with
 regard to housing demand, supply, and affordability. Further, based on the Housing Needs
 Assessment, Housing Element law requires that Vallejo establish a set of Goals, Policies, and
 Objectives with regard to housing in the local community and specify a series of programs and
 activities that the City will implement in order to work toward achieving its goals.
 HOUSING ELEMENT PLANNING HORIZON
 The Goals, Policies, Objectives, and implementation programs are intended to guide the
 City’s actions in the arena of housing during the 8-year Housing Element planning period that
 extends from January, 2015 through January, 2023.
 HOUSING ELEMENT INCOME LEVELS
 There are a variety of housing terms contained within this Housing Element. Generally, housing
 is considered “Affordable” if a household pays no more than 30% of household income on
 housing costs (rent or mortgage). Household income levels are based on U.S. Census data
 and are used to identify the housing needs for various income levels in the City of Vallejo
 (Area). Based on 2013 5 year American Community Survey estimates for Vallejo’s median
 income ($58,371), income levels are categorized as follows:
 Very Low Income Household: Households with an income no greater than 50% of the Area
 Median Income (AMI) or $29,186.
 Low Income Household: Households with an income between 50% and 80% of AMI, or $29,186
 and $46,697.
 Moderate Income Household: Households with an income between 80% and 120% of the AMI,
 or 46,697 and $70,045.
 Above-Moderate Income Household: Households with an income above 120% of the AMI or
 $70,045.
 A complete glossary of housing terms and definitions is provided by the Federal Department
 of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and can be accessed on their website:

 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
 Housing Element law requires the City to make a diligent effort to facilitate the participation
 of all segments of the community during the preparation its Housing Element Update. In
 addition to a comprehensive outreach effort as part of the larger city-wide Propel Vallejo
 planning initiative, the City has attempted to engage a variety of citizens and housing
 stakeholders by holding a community workshop and public hearings open to the public. A
 more detailed description of each effort is discussed below.
 PROPEL VALLEJO
 The Propel Vallejo planning initiative is currently underway. This large-scale effort includes a
 comprehensive General Plan Update, the creation of the Sonoma Boulevard Specific Plan and
 a City wide Zoning Code update. A key component of the Propel Vallejo process has been
 public outreach. The General Plan Working Group was appointed to represent the community
 in creating a General Plan document that is responsive to neighborhood and community
 goals, conditions and guiding principles. The SPWG also assists in community outreach,
 encouraging business owners, property owners, and the community at-large to participate in
 the process.
 COMMUNITY WORKSHOP
 A community workshop was held on October 23, 2014 to increase public awareness about the
 update as well as gather public input to inform the goals, policies and programs of the Housing
 Element. Approximately 40 community members attended the meeting. The City noticed the
 meeting through various channels, including posting flyers on its message board, advertising
 on its website, reaching out to various stakeholder groups via email, and coordination with the
 Propel Vallejo General Plan and Specific Plan Working Groups, from which several members
 attended. Appendix C identifies the persons and groups receiving notification to attend
 community outreach events and receiving the Public Review Draft for review and comment.
 The Workshop consisted of a presentation outlining the Housing Element Update, including a
 discussion of the required components and fielding questions from the community. A series of
 breakout groups were then convened to discuss certain topic areas, including Special Needs,
 Local Resources and Programs, and Constraints to Housing. Meeting facilitators took notes at
 each group, and a meeting summary was created and posted on the City’s website. The
 Housing Element addresses input received at the workshop. Public comments are provided in
 Appendix B.
 In addition to the community workshop, the Housing Element was discussed at a publicly-
 noticed and advertised study session at the December 15, 2014, Planning Commission
 meeting. At that study session, staff presented an overview of the Housing Element and
 facilitated a dialogue with the Planning Commission and public.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                         6

 PUBLIC COMMENT DURING THE HCD 60-DAY REVIEW PERIOD
 During the 60-day HCD review period, the City made the Draft Housing Element available
 on for public viewing at City offices and on the City website, and notices were made on
 Facebook and Nextdoor (the City’s social network for neighborhoods), in the City Manager’s
 next Bi-Weekly report and Vallejo News. The City also notified the General and Specific Plan
 Working Groups, and other interested stakeholders, as listed in Appendix C. A letter was
 received from Legal Services on Northern California. The City responded to the letter and
 made several revisions to the Housing Element.
 PUBLIC HEARINGS
 A Public Review Draft of the 2015 – 2023 Housing Element was released on March 11, 2015. The
 Housing Element was presented and discussed at the Planning Commission hearing on April 6,
 2015, and May 4, 2015. Modifications were made based on Planning Commission input. The
 City Council is scheduled to adopt the Housing Element on May 26, 2015. Public comments are
 provided in Appendix B.
 STATE CERTIFICATION
 Upon adoption by the City Council, the City will submit the adopted update to HCD for review.
 HCD staff will then determine whether the adopted Housing Element update substantially
 conforms to State law. Assuming that HCD certifies the Housing Element as being in
 compliance with State law, the City’s responsibility will then be to implement the programs
 and policies adopted in the document.

 REVIEW OF PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS
 Vallejo has made progress toward achieving one-time and ongoing goals set in the existing
 Housing Element, which has been effective since 2009. To the extent possible, the section
 below summarizes Housing Element results from 2009 through January 2015. The following
 section provides a brief description of Vallejo’s effectiveness in implementing programs to
 achieve objectives set in the previous Housing Element, with recommendations based on as
 to whether previous Housing Element programs should be continued, modified, or
 discontinued.
 From 2007 to 2014, the effects of the economic recession greatly impacted the City’s ability to
 finance and support many of the goals, policies, and programs of the previous Housing
 Element. However, recent strides and the efforts to reform the City’s structure and
 comprehensively update its development regulations make it poised to make significant
 progress on implementing existing and new policies and programs.

          development incentives, including higher densities, expedited
          permit processing to projects that include pedestrian linkage
          amenities, and density bonuses to projects that include affordable
          or senior housing, to encourage the development of mixed-use
          projects and continue to provide financial subsidies, including but
          not limited to, fee deferrals.
         Encourage lot consolidation for mixed-use developments by
          providing technical assistance to developers to facilitate
          negotiations between property owners.
         As sites become available, establish a protocol to monitor
          development interest, inquiries, and progress toward mixed-use
          development. Periodically re-evaluate approach and progress.

            single-room occupancy units. Currently, single-room occupancy
            units (SROs) are not explicitly allowed in the Zoning Ordinance.
            The City will add a definition of SRO to the Zoning Ordinance and
            also provide a zone where SROs will be permitted.

   a housing cooperative is formed when people join with each other on a
   democratic basis to own or control the housing and/or related
   community facilities in which they live. Usually they do this by forming a
   not-for-profit cooperative corporation. Each month they simply pay an
   amount that covers their share of the operating expenses of their
   cooperative corporation. Personal income tax deductions, lower turnover
   rates, lower real estate tax assessments (in some local areas), controlled
   maintenance costs, and resident participation and control are some of

 NEEDS ASSESSMENT
 OVERVIEW
 This Needs Assessment represents the first step in preparing the Housing Element Update
 for Vallejo. The purpose of the Housing Needs Assessment is to (1) describe local housing,
 economic and demographic conditions, (2) summarize governmental and non-
 governmental constraints that discourage housing development, (3) assess the demand for
 housing for households at all income levels and for housing suitable for special needs
 populations within Vallejo, and (4) assess the capacity to accommodate Vallejo’s fair share of
 the regional housing need. The Housing Needs Assessment is intended to assist Vallejo in
 developing realistic goals and formulating rational policies and implementation programs to
 address local housing problems.
 To facilitate an understanding of how the characteristics of the incorporated parts of Vallejo
 proper are similar to, or different from, other nearby communities, this Housing Needs
 Assessment presents data for Vallejo alongside comparable data for Solano County and in
 some cases, for the San Francisco Bay Area as a whole.
 This Needs Assessment incorporates data from numerous sources, including the United
 States Census, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the State of California,
 the State Department of Finance (DOF), and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
 Development (HUD). While the 2010 Census is still considered the most reliable source of
 demographic information, it has now been five years since the data was collected and
 therefore the validity of the numbers has lessened. To correct this, the City has used American
 Community Survey (ACS) estimates when appropriate. Unlike the decennial U.S. Census, which
 surveys the entire population every ten years, ACS surveys a sample of the population every
 year.
 DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
 This section presents information regarding changes in the characteristics of population and
 employment in Vallejo between 2000 and 2010.
 Population
 According to the U.S. Census, in 2000 Vallejo had a population of approximately 116,760. In
 2010, the population decreased to 115,942. Using U.S. Census data, Table 1 below compares
 the populations from 2000 and 2010 in Vallejo with those in Solano County and the San
 Francisco Bay Area based on 2000 and 2010. The average annual compound population
 growth rate in Vallejo between 2000 and 2010 was -0.07 percent. Compared with Vallejo’s
 declining population, Solano County and the Bay Area populations increased, with average
 annual growth rates of 0.47 and 0.53 percent, respectively.
 Households
 A household is defined as one or more people living in a housing unit. Based on household
 data provided by the U.S. Census, there were 40,559 households in Vallejo in 2010. As shown in
 Table 1, between 2000 and 2010 the number of households grew at a slower rate than both
 Solano County and the Bay Area. Annual average household growth rates in all of Solano

      Projected Population Growth
      As shown in Table 2 below, ABAG anticipates population growth in Vallejo will be slower than
      both Solano County and the Bay Area Region, averaging 0.43 percent average annual
      growth between 2010 and 2020. Overall, ABAG estimates that Vallejo will accommodate a
      total of 5,058 new residents over the 10-year period.
      Projected Household Growth
      The number of households in Vallejo is expected to grow at an average rate of 0.41
      percent annually between 2010 and 2020. ABAG projects the growth rate in the Bay Area will
      be double that of Vallejo (0.85 percent annually). ABAG projects the number of Solano County
      households to grow an average of about 0.63 percent annually. In terms of overall numbers,
      ABAG anticipates the formation of 1,701 new households in Vallejo between 2010 and 2020.

 Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of Vallejo’s population in the 55 to 64-year-old age
 group grew most rapidly, increasing its share from 8 to 14 percent of the total population,
 a 68.5 percent increase. This same age group grew rapidly in Solano County as well. In
 Vallejo, the group with the greatest decline in the share of population was 35 to 44 year olds,
 which declined from 16 to 13 percent of the total population between 2000 and 2010, a -21.9
 percent decrease.

 The U.S. Census divides households into two different categories, depending on their
 composition. Family households consist of two or more related persons living together.
 Non- family households include persons who live alone or in groups of unrelated individuals. As
 shown in Table 6 below, 71.3 percent of Vallejo households were family households in 2000.
 By 2010, the percentage of family households declined by 1.6 percent, to 68.5 percent.
 Households identified as married with children had the greatest decline of 23.9 percent
 between 2000 and 2010, while single parent and non-family households both increased by 13.4
 percent and 12.5 percent respectively.

 Household Tenure & Vacancy
 According to 2010 U.S. Census data, 60 percent of occupied housing units were owner
 occupied and the remaining units (40 percent) occupied by renters. According to the
 Department of Finance, the 2014 residential vacancy rate in the Vallejo was 8.7 percent
 compared to 7.0 percent for Solano County.
 Household Income
 Table 7 below displays the 2014 State income limits for Solano County. The income limits are
 determined by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for each
 county in the State of California. The area median income (AMI) for a 4-person household is
 $82,601. The income category that households fall into is dependent on the household size and
 income. For example, a 3-person household that earns $20,000 would be considered extremely
 low income, meaning that the household earns 27 percent of AMI for a 3-person household
 ($74,350).

  abbreviated for “area median income.” 2014 4-person AMI is $82,600.
 The 2012 median household income in Vallejo was estimated $60,764. Table 8 shows the
 distribution of 2012 household incomes. The majority of household incomes in Vallejo are
 clustered among households earning between $35,000 and $99,000, which represents
 approximately 45 percent of all family households. Households earning more than $99,999
 represent 25 percent and those earning less than $35,000 represent approximately 30 percent
 of all family households.
 The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) estimates that there were 6,200
 extremely low-income households in 2011. Presented later in the discussion of the City’s fair
 share housing allotment, ABAG projects that through 2014 the City will need to plan for an
 additional 283 very low-income households. Based on State law methodology, 50 percent, or
 142 units of its very low-income housing allocation are attributed to the extremely low-income
 category.

 Employment Trends
 Table 9 below provides a summary of the number of employed residents as well as
 employment by industry sector and the total number of jobs in each sector. ABAG provides
 employment estimates for Vallejo, all of Solano County, and the Bay Area for the year 2011. As
 shown in Table 9, the number of employed Vallejo residents represented about 28 percent of
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                    29

 the Solano County employment. The distribution of employed Vallejo residents is categorized
 into 13 employment sectors. The three sectors with the highest percentage of employed
 Vallejo residents are educational, health, and social services, professional scientific,
 management, administrative, and waste management services, and retail trade. These three
 sectors are also prominent in both Solano County and the Bay Area, but the County and
 Region show varying employment trends. The Manufacturing employment sector is the third
 largest employment sector In Solano County and the Bay Area Region. The number of
 employed residents outnumbered the total number of jobs in Vallejo, indicating that the City
 exported more labor than it imported. In 2011, the number of employed residents was 51,505
 while the number of jobs in Vallejo was 30,096. According to the Association of Bay Area
 Governments, the total number of employed residents will continue to be greater than the
 number of jobs.

     As shown in Table 10, ABAG projects Vallejo to experience a 36 percent increase in the number
     of employed residents between 2010 and 2040. Over that thirty year period, Vallejo is expected
     to add 11,519 employed residents, for an average annual rate of increase of 1.04 percent.
     Overall, ABAG estimates employed residents will increase to 47,550 in Solano County and
     373,310 in the Bay Area between 2010 and 2020.

     Existing Housing Conditions
     This portion of the Needs Assessment evaluates the existing housing conditions in Vallejo,
     including an analysis of the types of housing units found in Vallejo, as reported by the California
     Department of Finance.
     Housing Stock Characteristics
     Similar to other cities in the region, the majority of Vallejo’s housing stock is single-family,
     accounting for 67 percent of the total housing stock in 2013. According to the Department of
     Finance approximately 65 percent of the City’s housing units are in buildings with five or more
     units and 11 percent are in buildings with two to four units. As shown below in Table 11, Vallejo
     has a similar proportion of multi-family units as Solano County, where the proportion of dwellings
     in buildings with five or more units also represents 14 percent of the County’s total housing
     stock. The Bay Area has larger proportions of dwellings in buildings with five or more units (25
     percent) than Solano County and the City of Vallejo.
     From 2000 to 2013, housing production in the County overall outpaced the City, averaging 1.1
     percent annual growth compared to 0.6 percent annual growth for Vallejo. Vallejo’s housing
     distributions by type remained relatively constant from 2000 to 2013 with single-family
     detached homes accounting for 69 and 67 percent, respectively, of the City’s housing stock.
     The proportion of detached single- family units in Solano County increased on average each
     year between 2000 and 2013 by approximately 1 percent and accounted for 72 percent of
     total housing units in 2013.
   City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                            31

      The Bay Area has a considerably larger percentage of multi-family units than the City and the
      County. The counties of Alameda, San Francisco, and Santa Clara make up a large proportion
      of the multi-family units accounted for in the Bay Area inventory. Solano County’s inventory of
      multi-family units is comparable to other similar “greenbelt” counties in the Bay Area.

      Overcrowding
      Data on housing overcrowding are available from the American Communities Survey in the
      form of statistics regarding the number of persons per room in occupied housing units. Table 12
      below provides the most recent available overcrowding data for Vallejo. A housing unit is
      considered to be overcrowded if there is between 1.01 and 1.5 persons per room.
      Housing units with more than 1.5 occupants per room are considered to be severely
      overcrowded. Overcrowding can also be measured by persons per bedroom. Vallejo Housing

 Authority uses the standard of 2 people per bedroom for housing programs, however the U.S.
 Census or American Community Survey does not report this data.
 In total, 94.5 percent of Vallejo’s occupied housing units have 1.0 or fewer persons per room
 and 5.5 percent would be considered overcrowded. Of all the units in Vallejo, 4.3 percent
 have between 1.01 and 1.50 persons per room and 1 percent have more than 1.50 persons
 per room. These statistics indicate that Vallejo had a slightly higher percentage of households
 living in overcrowded conditions compared to Solano County, where approximately 3.8
 percent of households lived in overcrowded conditions.
 When broken out according to tenure, overcrowding occurs in relatively equal amounts
 between renter- and owner-occupied units. As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, tenure refers
 to the distinction between owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units. About 1.8
 percent (905) of Vallejo’s owner households have 1.01 or more persons per room, while
 approximately 3.1 percent (1,305) of the renter households have 1.01 or more persons per
 room. In Solano County, 1.5 percent of owner households and 2.4 percent of renter households
 have greater than 1.01 persons per room. Based on this information, it appears that Vallejo
 would benefit from development of additional affordable rental units sized for larger
 households (e.g., three bedrooms or more).

 Physical Conditions of the Housing Stock
 This section analyzes the age of Vallejo’s housing stock. Table 13 below provides a summary of
 the projected age of the City’s housing stock. Table 14 through Table 18 shown on the following
 pages provide findings from the American Community Survey 2012 data. A large portion of
 Vallejo’s housing stock was constructed prior to 1999 (91 percent), of which 25 percent were
 constructed between 1960 and 1979. Homes that are more than 30 years old will generally
 need rehabilitation in order to preserve the safety and shelter provided by the home. Homes
 built prior to 1970 are identified as possible homes needing rehabilitation. This means that
 Vallejo’s older housing stock, which makes up the majority of the City’s entire housing stock,
 may be in need of significant rehabilitation in order to preserve the safety and living standards
 of residents.

 This section assesses the conditions of housing within the incorporated area of Vallejo.
 Through this analysis, the Economic Development Department and the Housing and
 Community Development Division will be able to develop strategies for preserving existing
 neighborhoods and communities.
 Housing Conditions
 The housing conditions survey is used as a tool for the City to evaluate the condition of its
 housing stock and to determine the need for housing programs to assist residents in
 maintaining the condition of their homes.
 The latest C i t y - w i d e Housing Condition Survey was conducted in 2008 and included a
 random sample of 2,819 residential housing units in the City a n d b u i l t upon a previous
 housing condition survey performed in 2001. Based on the number of code enforcement cases
 initiated in 2013, the data collected in 2008 is still generally representative of the housing
 conditions in Vallejo. However, given the economic downturn endured by the City, conditions
 may have worsened since 2008. Code-enforcement and improved housing conditions remain
 a priority and are addressed in the Goals, Policies and Programs of this Housing Element
 update.
 Definition of Housing Conditions
 SOUND – A unit that appears new or well maintained and structurally intact. The foundation
 should appear structurally undamaged and there should be straight roof lines. Siding,
 windows, and doors should be in good repair with good exterior paint condition. Minor
 problems such as small areas of peeling paint and/or other maintenance items are allowable
 under this category.
 MINOR – A unit that show signs of deferred maintenance or which needs only one major
 component, such as a roof.
 MODERATE – A unit in need of replacement of one or more major components and
 other repairs, such as roof replacement, painting, and window repairs.
 SUBSTANTIAL – A unit that requires replacement of several major systems and possibly
 other repairs (e.g., complete foundation work, roof structure replacement and re-roofing, as
 well as painting and window replacement).
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                      34

 DILAPIDATED – A unit suffering from excessive neglect, where the building appears
 structurally unsound and maintenance is nonexistent, not fit for human habitation in its
 current condition, may be considered for demolition or at minimum, major rehabilitation will be
 required.
 Detailed Survey Results
 Many of the homes surveyed in Vallejo were categorized as sound or minor. Less than one-
 half of 1 percent of the surveyed units were found to need substantial repair or were found
 to be in dilapidated condition. Table 14 below summarizes the overall condition of all of
 the homes surveyed in the City. Ninety (90) percent of the homes surveyed in Vallejo were
 in sound condition or needed minor repairs. Roughly 9 percent of the remaining homes
 surveyed were in moderate condition, which means they are in need of one or more major
 repairs, such as a roof replacement and window repair or replacement. Less than 1 percent of
 the homes surveyed fell into the substantial or dilapidated categories. These homes require
 many repairs and replacements that often include structural needs (i.e., roofs or foundations)
 in the case of the substantial category and complete replacement for those in the dilapidated
 category.

 Almost all of the City’s single-family homes were in sound condition or needed minor repairs.
 Table 15 below illustrates that 90 percent of the single-family homes surveyed were in sound
 or minor condition; little maintenance, if any, was needed. Nine (9) percent of the homes
 required moderate repairs. A total of 12 (less than 1 percent) units were found to be in need of
 substantial repair and 3 were in dilapidated condition.

 Similar to the single-family housing types, duplexes fared well in the survey, with 74 percent in
 sound condition. Many fewer required repairs, with 21 and 24 units needing minor and
 moderate repair, respectively. Very few duplexes required major rehabilitation or replacement
 as shown in the Table 16.

 Table 17 below depicts the condition of the multi-family structures surveyed. A slight majority
 of multi-family units (52 percent) were observed in sound condition requiring very minor to no
 repairs. One quarter (26 percent) of the multi-family structures surveyed needed minor repairs
 or one major repair, and 22 percent were found to need the moderate level of repairs.

 Property owners not in compliance may be fined, have a lien placed on the property, or
 the City can charge the property owner its costs to repair or clean up the problem. In 2013,
 the City initiated 141 Code Enforcement cases.
 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
 Special populations can require nonconventional housing types that both serve as shelter and
 provide services to their residents. Many special populations are on fixed incomes and have
 limited ability to absorb increased housing costs. In addition, special populations are often
 unable to find appropriate shelter due to their living condition. This section estimates the extent
 of various special housing needs populations found in Vallejo and discusses their housing
 needs.
 Large Family Households
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development defines a large family as one with
 five or more members. Often, large low-income families live in overcrowded conditions and,
 due to the presence of minor children, require affordable child care. Most conventional
 apartment complexes do not have four-bedroom apartments and many apartment
 developers dedicate only a small portion, if any, of their unit mixes to three-bedroom units
 suitable for families. Lacking means to purchase larger homes, many low-income families are
 forced into smaller dwelling units and overcrowded conditions.
 According to the 2010 U.S. Census as shown in Table 18 below, approximately 15 percent of
 the households in the City are considered large (6,304 of 40,559 households in Vallejo),
 As shown in Table 19 below, approximately 24 percent of occupied units in Vallejo contained
 four or more bedrooms The 2011 American Community Survey estimates, there are
 approximately 9,568 occupied housing units with four bedrooms or more in Vallejo.
 Considering the large estimated supply of units (9,568) with four or more bedrooms in Vallejo
 and the number of large households (6,304), there appears to be a sufficient supply of large
 housing units to accommodate housing demand for large family households. However, as
 discussed in subsequent sections of this Needs Assessment, the majority of single-family units
 suitable for large families will only be affordable to households near or above HCD’s moderate-
 income limits. As such, the City will continue to promote larger units in rental and affordable
 housing developments, as appropriate.
 The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines “Family” as any of the following:
      A. One or more persons living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit;
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                           38

       B. The occupants of a residential facility serving six or fewer persons and licensed by the
            director of the State Department of Social Services. For the purposes of this definition,
            "six or fewer persons" does not include the licensee, nor members of the licensee's family
            nor persons employed as facility staff.
   According to HCD, three considerations are key to the definition of “Family”:
  1) Jurisdictions may not distinguish between related and unrelated individuals, 2) The definition
  may not impose a numerical limit on the number of persons in a family, and 3) Land use
  restrictions for licensed group homes for six or fewer individuals must be the same as those for
  single families.
  The City’s current definition of “Family” is in compliance with State law and best practices, and
  this will be maintained as the City undertakes the comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Update.

 Elderly
 The elderly population often requires special housing to accommodate part-time or full-time
 care and is also more likely to have lower incomes than the population in general. Simple
 requirements can include modifications to doors and steps to improve accessibility, and
 installation of grab bars to make bathing, toileting, and other daily activities safer. Single-story
 homes are often desirable because stair climbing can be difficult for the elderly. Housing such
 as apartments or condominiums that do not entail high maintenance requirements can also
 be beneficial as the elderly continue to age and become less able to perform extensive home
 maintenance work on their own. The elderly are also commonly on fixed incomes while
 expending more of their income on medical care, meaning that affordable housing is often
 needed.
 According to the U.S. Census as shown in Table 20 below, in 2010 there were approximately
 13,999 persons 65 years and older, or 11 percent of the total residents, living in Vallejo. From
 2000 to 2010, the senior population in Vallejo grew by roughly 1 percent annually. With
 population growth in the upper age groups, increasing needs for supportive housing for the
 elderly can be expected.

 As reported by Bay Area Association of Governments and shown in Table 21, there were 7,900
 elderly households in the City in 2011. Roughly 35 percent of all elderly households (2,769) in
 the City earned less than $30,000 annually in 2011. In Solano County, roughly 17 percent of all
 elderly households earned less than 30 percent MFI. The distribution of elderly households in
 each income category is similar in the County and the City for households earning between
 31 and 80 percent MFI. The City has a higher percentage of elderly households earning less
 than 30 percent MFI and a lower percentage of elderly households earning more than 81
 percent MFI.

 According to the U.S. Census in 2010, 60 percent of Vallejo residents lived in owner-occupied
 housing while 40 percent lived in rental housing. In the age category 65-74, 76 percent of
 seniors lived in owner occupied housing versus 24 percent who rented. In the age category
 75-84, 72 percent lived in owner occupied housing verses 28 percent who rented. With
 population growth in the upper age groups, increasing needs for supportive housing for the
 elderly can be expected.
 Persons with Disabilities
 Disabilities can take many forms and have numerous implications for housing need. Many
 disabled people can live in conventional housing without any modifications or with only minor
 modifications, while some disabled people require substantial modifications and/or on-site
 care to maintain everyday living, and others may need occasional assistance but do not
 require everyday care. Accessible units are more expensive to build and can include features
 such as ramps, extra-wide doors, handrails, lowered counters, raised toilets, and a variety of
 other accessibility features. While costs for accessible housing are higher than for conventional
 housing, the disabled population tends to earn less. According to a study prepared for the
 State Independent Living Council, disabled persons are more than three times more likely to
 be unemployed and the disabled persons who work full time average 20 percent less in annual
 earnings compared to the overall full-time working population. In addition, disabled persons
 are more likely to live alone. Approximately 21 percent of disabled persons live alone
 compared to 2 percent of the general population and another 27 percent live in group settings
 compared to 5 percent of the general population. Overall, many disabled persons demand
 smaller units compared to the population overall and would benefit from accessible and
 affordable units.
 Table 22 below shows 2011 ACS estimates for the total number of persons with disabilities
 aged 18 to 64 years by employment status. Of this age group, there were approximately 7,177
 persons with disabilities reported in the City and 21,550 persons with disabilities in the County.
 Approximately 7 percent of the population between the ages of 18 and 64 in the City
 reported to having a disability and being either unemployed or not in the labor force. The
 majority of these persons with disabilities (6 percent) are not in the labor force while only 1
 percent are in the labor force and unemployed. In comparison to the County percentage
 of persons with disabilities between 18 and 64 years (8.7 percent), the City shows a similar
 trend of 9.7 percent persons with disabilities.

 According to the 2013 Performance Report, NBRC served a total of 7,700 individuals within
 Napa, Solano, and Sonoma County as well as from other surrounding areas. The majority of
 these consumers (35 percent) are between the ages of 22 and 51 years. Similarly, consumers
 between the ages of 6 and 21 years made up 34 percent of the total individuals served within
 2013. The State of California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) provides data on
 consumers of its Regional Centers and Early Start program by zip code. The most recent data
 available is from March 2015 and indicates 1,238 persons with developmental disabilities in
 Vallejo were using its services. It is necessary to note that this total is derived from zip codes that
 include addresses associated with American Canyon. In zip codes for which Vallejo is
 recognized as the “Default” City by the U.S. Postal Service, 1,081 persons with developmental
 disabilities were using DDS services in March of 2015.
 Housing Services
 NBRC is the placement agency for the consumers it serves. Priorities for living arrangements
 for consumers with developmental disabilities are for independent living options in the
 community, these values are set at the State level with a priority that people with
 developmental disabilities live in their own homes. Although NBRC does not directly provide
 housing for its developmentally disabled service population, they do provide supported
 and independent living services including referrals and placement with the assistance of a
 third party agency. According to NBRC’s Director of Client Services, there is an acute need

 for affordable housing to serve the developmentally disabled in Solano County. Based on
 individual service need housing opportunities can include market rate housing, affordable
 housing, and transitional shelters.
 Because there are generally no special programs or ‘set-asides’ for this special need
 community, housing options are limited to licensed care homes, to affordable housing
 options, e.g. housing vouchers. In both cases, this means that the developmentally disabled
 are competing with the general population for limited housing opportunities. To help
 address the housing needs for Vallejo’s developmentally disabled population, the City will
 meet with service providers such as NBRC annually to discuss opportunities to expand
 supportive housing and assist in their housing services provided for Solano County residents.
 In addition, according to the 2010-2015 Consolidated plan, the Vallejo Housing Authority
 administered 2,246 units of Section 8 Existing Housing in the City.
 Single-Parent-Headed Households
 Single-parent-headed households with children tend to have a higher need for affordable
 housing compared to two-parent family households in general. There are 27,788 family
 households (see Table 6) in the City, of which 1,162 are households with children h e a d e d
 b y a f e m a l e with no spouse present.
 According to 2010 U.S. Census, 32 percent of female-headed households with children living
 in Vallejo are below the poverty level. In addition, single-parent-headed households with
 children are more likely to need child care since the parent is often the sole source of income
 and the sole caregiver for children in the household.
 The U.S. Census Bureau establishes the level of poverty thresholds each year, and in 2014,
 a single parent with two dependent children earning less than $19,073 would be considered
 to be in poverty. These households would have a significant need for affordable housing and
 assistance with child care and job training services.
 Farm Workers
 Some farm workers tend to have special housing needs due to the seasonal nature of their
 work along with their need to migrate based on seasonal farm worker demand. Vallejo does
 not have a large agricultural industry, if any, but may provide housing to laborers who work in
 Napa County. According to ABAG, Vallejo has approximately 281 agriculture or mining jobs
 within its city limits. These jobs are likely to be landscaping jobs rather than agriculture
 production employment. Because these types of jobs are essentially urban in nature, it is
 assumed that there are not significant special housing needs for farm workers in Vallejo. To the
 extent that such jobs would likely involve laborers who may earn relatively low wages, the
 needs of these workers would be similar to those of other lower-income Vallejo households.
 Schoolteachers
 According to the Vallejo City Unified School District (VCUSD) J-90 report, there were 756 full-
 time employees of VCUSD in the 2012-13 school year. The average salary for teachers in the
 district during this school year was $57,757. Teachers’ salaries tend to vary based on the number
 of years of experience and educational attainment. The salary range for VCUSD teachers was
 between $37,186 and $71,305. Teachers at the beginning of their career (credentialed and un-
 credentialed) earn a lower salary, because the pay scale is primarily dependent on years of
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                         45

 experience. Teachers who have earned a bachelor’s degree and have completed 60 units of
 education beyond a bachelor’s degree earn a minimum of $55,019. According to household
 income guidelines published by HCD, an un-credentialed or credentialed first-year
 schoolteacher with one dependent would be considered to be slightly below the low-income
 limit earning less than $37,186 a year. As discussed in subsequent sections regarding housing
 affordability, a household would need to earn over $81,033 per year — above VCUSD’s first-
 year teacher salary — to be able to purchase a typical single-family home in Vallejo. In
 addition, a starting VCUSD teacher would need to overpay (pay more than 30 percent of
 his/her gross monthly income) for the typical one- or two-bedroom apartment in Vallejo. In
 summary, housing opportunities for VCUSD schoolteachers are limited considering existing
 salary levels and local housing market conditions. This situation could adversely affect the
 District’s ability to successfully recruit and retain high-quality teachers, and may suggest a
 need for the City and the District to collaborate on strategies to provide housing assistance,
 particularly to entry-level teachers, so that they can afford to live in the community they serve.
 Families and Individuals in Need of Emergency Shelter/Homelessness
 The Consolidated Plan is a HUD-required plan for all communities that receive formula
 allocations of federal housing and community development funds. The Vallejo Housing
 and Community Development Division produced the Consolidated Plan in consultation with
 local service providers, community activists, and affordable housing developers to create a
 5-year community development strategy for HUD-related activities in Vallejo. As part of
 the Consolidated Plan, Vallejo identified the estimated need and inventory for shelter,
 transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, and permanent housing for families
 and individuals. According to the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, there is a demand in Vallejo
 for approximately 53 emergency shelter beds for homeless individuals and 36 emergency
 shelter units for homeless families; 14 transitional housing units for individuals and 25 for families;
 and 27 supportive permanent housing spaces for individuals and 61 units for families.
 Within the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, the City has placed a high priority on eliminating
 chronic homelessness in the City. The City has been a member of the Solano County
 Continuum of Care (COC) since the COC was established in the County. In 2004 the COC
 contributed over $600,000 to assist with placing homeless persons in transitional and supportive
 housing. In order to address the need of homeless persons, the City is securing funding to assist
 in the establishment of twelve units of permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless
 families with children. In addition, emergency support facilities/services will be provided
 annually to 500 homeless persons.
 Solano County has a 10-year Plan addressing homelessness for the 2008 to 2018 time frame.
 According to their most recent data (2014), Solano County has approximately 1,295 homeless
 persons. The County is aware that there may be an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 persons who are
 homeless at any point in time and for whom statistics were not captured at the time of this
 count. Solano County has 179 beds year round in emergency shelters, 118 beds year round in
 transitional housing, and 99 beds year round in permanent housing. Even with these 396 beds,
 Solano County is looking at a need for over 3,000 homeless persons at any one time in the
 County. The Consolidated Plan assumed Vallejo’s 2014 population represented approximately
 28 percent of Solano County’s total population and used this proportion to discern the number
 of homeless persons in the City from the overall County results. According to this method,
 approximately 363 of the 1,295 homeless persons would be Vallejo residents. However, a 2014
 “Point in Time” survey of homeless individuals conducted by Community Action Partnership of
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                              46

 Solano (CAP Solano) estimated there to be 642 homeless persons in Vallejo in 2013. While
 portions of the homeless community are visible, a segment of the population may not, as some
 persons and families may live with friends or in motels or less-visible places.
 Solano County has ten strategies addressing homelessness:
         Discharge planning and decrease the number of people of being discharged into
          homelessness by 25 percent;
         Create new permanent housing beds for homeless and chronically homeless persons;
         Increase percentage of homeless persons staying in permanent housing over 6 months
          to 71 percent;
         Increase percentage of homeless persons becoming employed by 11 percent;
         Ensure that the Continuum of Care has a functional Homeless Management
          Information System (HMIS) with 90 percent of the shelters and housing projects actively
          participating;
         Improve access to mainstream resources by 25 percent;
         Chronically homeless individuals will be fully engaged in the continuum of services
          and housing available to them;
         Chronically homeless people are forced to live on the street until permanent housing
          or affordable housing is available;
         Ensure sufficient outreach to homeless, at-risk families and non-chronically homeless
          individuals and provide for their basic needs;
         Further strengthen self-sufficiency supports for homeless people moving out
          of homelessness.
 In Vallejo, homeless persons can find assistance at the Christian Help Center, the Renaissance
 Family Center, the House of Acts, Hope Haven Center, the Harvest House, the Fighting Back
 Organization, the Family Resource Network, the Rosewood House, the Global Center for
 Success, and the Salvation Army. The Christian Help Center is currently in the process of
 expanding the number of beds for homeless individuals to approximately 100.
 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND COST
 This section of the Needs Assessment provides information on the current affordability and cost
 of housing in Vallejo. This information is important, because it reveals the extent to which the
 private housing market is providing for the needs of various economic segments of the local
 population. This information on housing market conditions is combined with demographic
 information of the local population to identify those segments of the population that face
 difficulties securing affordable housing that does not cause a housing cost burden for them.
 Housing Affordability by Household Income
 Table 23 below displays the maximum rents and sales prices, respectively that are affordable
 to extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income households.
 Affordability is based on the following assumptions: a household spending 30 percent or less of
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                         47

 their total household income for shelter; the maximum household income levels established by
 HUD and HCD; and maximum affordable sales prices based on 30-year fixed rate mortgage
 at 5 percent.

 Rental Rates
 In October 2014, LWC collected online market data for single-family and multi-family homes in
 Vallejo from Trulia and Craigslist, shown below in Table 24. A total of 115 units were evaluated,
 which consisted of 56 apartments and 65 single-family homes. According to the findings of
 the research, the median rental price is $1,585 per month for a three-bedroom single-family
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                         48
 home and $1,551 for a three-bedroom apartment. The median price is $1,236 per month for
 a two-bedroom apartment and $1,300 for a two-bedroom single-family house. No one-
 bedroom single-family homes or five-bedroom apartments were found and are therefore not
 represented in the data.
 Comparing the rental rates in Table 24 with the maximum monthly rental rates affordable to
 the income levels described in Table 23, extremely low-income and very low-income
 households do not earn enough income to afford the monthly rental rates described in Table
 24. For example, an extremely low-income three-person household can afford $558 per
 month on rent and the median rental price for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,236. The
 average rental rates for single- family homes are much higher than for apartments, and
 therefore single-family homes are also not affordable to extremely low-income and low-
 income households. Low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income households do earn
 enough income to afford the median rental rates of all bedroom sizes for apartments. However,
 only the moderate- and above moderate-income households can afford the rental rates of
 single-family homes.

 Single-Family and Condominium Home Sales Prices and Trends
 Data Quick is a division of MDA Lending Solutions and provides recent home sales activity
 and reports concerning recent real estate activity, which is used by industry professionals,
 research firms, and lending institutions. As seen in Table 25 below, in the three zip codes data
 was reported, the median sales price of homes increased significantly over the previous year.
 In zip code 94590, the median sales price increased by approximately 40 percent. The recent
 trend in increasing median sales prices in the housing market is not unique to Vallejo and
 Solano County. As seen in Table 26 below, the Bay Area experienced an increase in median
 sales home prices of 14 percent.
 Table 23 above ill us tra tes the maximum affordable sales prices that lower income
 households can afford. Although the median home price may be in reach of some
 households, others may find difficulty qualifying for mortgages due to tighter lending
 requirements, including employment verification, credits scores, and minimum down
 payments.

   Overpayment
   Households that pay between 30 and 34 percent are considered to be burdened by the cost
   of housing, while those paying more than 35 percent of median income are considered to
   be severely burdened by housing costs.
   Generally, renters tend to have much higher rates of overpayment than owners. This is not the
   case in Vallejo. Table 27 indicates the number of overpaying households as a percentage of
   total occupied households. A higher percentage of owner occupied households (26.8
   percent) are considered cost burdened than renter occupied households (19.9 percent).
   Lower-income households are defined as those in the low-, very low-, and extremely low-
   income groups. Lower-income households (both renter and owner occupied) combined
   represent over 31 percent of all households in Vallejo.

   As shown in Table 28, the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), based on
   2007-2011 ACS data, estimates that there were 16,390 lower income households in Vallejo in
   2011, of which 6,200 were of extremely low-income (ELI). The majority of extremely low income
   households rented, with 4,595 renter households compared to 1,605 owners. Of the 4,940 lower
   income households severely overpaying (more than 50% of income), 4,355 fall into the
   extremely low income category. Overall, 18,495 households are overpaying in Vallejo, or 45.7%
   of all households in the City.

 Affordable Housing Units at Risk of Conversion to Market Rate
 State law requires local Housing Elements to include an inventory of affordable housing
 developments that could be at risk of converting to market rates during the 10-year period
 of the current Housing Element planning period and of the one period that follows the
 adoption of the Element. For those units found to be at risk of conversion, the Housing Element
 must estimate the cost to preserve or replace the at-risk units, to identify the resources
 available to help in the preservation or replacement of those units, and to identify those
 organizations that could assist in these efforts.
 City staff had previously prepared an inventory of affordable housing developments in
 conjunction with the preparation of the City’s HUD Consolidated Plan, which required a
 similar analysis of units at risk of conversion to market rates. That inventory serves as the basis
 for this analysis; however, certain information contained in the Consolidated Plan has been
 updated.
 Inventory of Existing Affordable Units
 Table 29 below shows the inventory of existing affordable housing developments in Vallejo.
 This table also indicates the earliest dates of termination of affordability restrictions for each
 of the listed projects. As shown in the table, many of the projects had multiple funding
 sources that contribute to project affordability. Typically, this included some form of

   subsidized mortgage financing in conjunction with project-based Section 8 certificates,
   through which HUD agreed to subsidize the rents for a specified number of units that would
   be made available to Section 8- eligible low- or very low-income households. Typically, the
   property owners cannot “opt out” of the project-based Section 8 affordability contracts
   unless they pay off any HUD- insured/subsidized mortgages associated with their properties.

 Units at Risk of Conversion
 The affordable housing developments at risk of conversion to market rate during the next 10
 years include three projects, for a total of 287 units (See Table 31). City records indicate that
 these projects are subsidized through HUD financing and/or have regulatory agreements that
 will expire within the next 10 years. (Note: This assumes that HUD will continue to offer property
 owners renewal of their project-based Section 8 contracts during this time period. Although
 HUD’s ability to continue these contracts is subject to congressional appropriations, HUD staff
 has indicated that they expect the agency will continue to have the resources necessary to
 continue these contracts.)

 Cost of Replacing At-Risk Units
 Generally, the cost of preserving assisted housing units is estimated to be significantly less than
 replacing units through new construction. Preserving units entails covering the difference
 between market rate and assisted rental rates. New construction tends to be less cost efficient
 because of the cost of land, which is often a limiting factor in the development of affordable
 housing.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                         55

 Preservation
 An analysis of the cost to preserve at-risk units includes determining the cost to acquire
 and rehabilitate the at-risk project as well as determining the monthly subsidy necessary to
 preserve affordability. In the event that the affordability terms expire on the units in the
 three at-risk properties and the owners of the projects decide to convert the rental rates of
 the units to be equal to or more than the fair market rental rates, interested parties
 (nonprofit, for profit) may purchase and rehabilitate the property in order to maintain the
 affordability of the units. Purchasing the at-risk units depends on the owner’s willingness to sell,
 interested parties to purchase the project, and available funding assistance.
 In November 2014, Loopnet.com listed a 16-unit multi-family apartment complex for $1,850,000,
 which equates to $115,626 per unit. Similar multi-family projects listed on Loopnet in the City
 have a similar per unit cost. Approximately, the total cost to acquire and preserve the at-risk
 units (287) through purchasing the at-risk projects would be $33,184,662 (determined by
 multiplying the total at-risk units by the average purchase price per unit). In the event that the
 owners of each of the three projects do not preserve affordability restrictions following the
 termination dates, it will be necessary for interested parties to purchase the existing projects
 and subsidize rent to the tenants to ensure affordability restrictions, allowing access to shelter
 for low- income families.
 Following the acquisition and rehabilitation of the units, the ongoing cost to preserve
 affordability is determined by identifying the gap (subsidy) between the assisted rent and
 the market rent. The market rent is based on the results from the LWC rental survey and found
 in the previous Table 24. The exact subsidy is difficult to estimate because the rents are
 based on a tenant’s income and therefore would depend on the size and income level of
 the household. Table 25 through Table 28 shown previously summarized the affordability
 situation in the City.
 Following are some general examples of expected subsidies:
         An extremely low-income person can only afford up to $435 per month and the market
          rental rate in the City for a one-bedroom unit is $878 per month. The subsidy needed
          would be approximately $443 per month or $5,317 per year.
         A very low-income family of three can afford $930 a month and the market rent in the
          City for a two-bedroom unit is $1,236. The subsidy would be approximately $306 per
          month or $3,672 per year.
         A low-income family of four or larger would most likely find it difficult to find suitable
          housing. To avoid overcrowding, a large low-income family would need to find a single-
          family unit, and these rents are generally higher than those for multi-family units. A family
          of four could afford up to $1,425 per month, and the market rent for a three-bedroom
          unit is $1,585. The subsidy would be approximately $160 per month or $1,920 per year.

 Replacement
 Another option for ensuring that the number of affordable units is preserved as current
 affordable units become at risk is to develop a new affordable housing project to replace
 the units lost to conversion. The methodology used to determine the estimated cost of
 building a new multi-family project is to use the cost of construction of a recent multi-family
 project as the basis for determining the estimated cost of a new project. In 2007, the
 construction of Avian Glen apartments (87 units) was completed and it became available
 to low-income residents. The total cost to construct Avian Glen was $16,050,433, which
 equates to $184,487 per unit. When affordability restrictions expire and the units are
 converted to market rate, and if the owners are unwilling to sell the complex in order to
 preserve affordability, the units will need to be replaced. The cost to replace the units is
 determined by multiplying the per- unit cost of $184,487 from the Avian Glen project by the
 151 at-risk units, which is equal to $27,857,537.
 It is not likely that all of the units considered to be at risk will convert to market-rate units. Of
 those that do convert, the likelihood of the need to replace the units will be much lower
 than the probability that through negotiation and additional funding the units will be
 preserved.
 Financial Resources Available to the City to Assist in Preservation
 Clearly, the costs to preserve or replace housing units that rent at levels significantly below
 market rates are substantial. Fortunately, Vallejo has already successfully preserved a
 significant number of affordable housing units that were at risk of conversion. Nevertheless, the
 City must still consider what resources are available to help preserve or replace those units
 so that lower- income tenants are not displaced in the event that the projects are converted
 to market rates.
 The City has access to a range of different funds that could potentially assist in a preservation
 effort including:
         CDBG Entitlement;
         HOME Entitlement;
         Mortgage Revenue Bonds;
         State Grant Programs;
         Federal Grant Programs;
         Low Income Housing Tax Credits; and
         HUD Housing Choice Vouchers.

 Affordable Housing Developers and Property Managers Interested in Participating in
 Preservation Projects
 In many cases, the City will find it advantageous to collaborate with private affordable
 housing developers or managers to develop and implement a viable plan to preserve
 affordable housing units. Private developers can often bring additional expertise and access
 to funding, such as tax credits. The California Department of Housing and Community
 Development maintains a list of affordable housing developers and property managers who
 have expressed an interest in working with local communities on preservation of affordable
 housing projects. This database lists organizations that are interested in working in any
 county within the State of California, including such well-known affordable housing providers
 as Mercy Housing, Inc. and EAH, Inc. The database also lists numerous organizations that have
 expressed interest in working on preservation projects in Solano County in particular. This list
 includes such organizations as Affirmed Housing, Vallejo Housing Collaborative, Bridge
 Housing Corporation, Las Palmas, Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition, Solano Affordable
 Housing Foundation, and Solari Enterprises. The organizations listed above are but a few of
 those listed in the HCD database that Vallejo might consider as potential partners in the event
 it becomes necessary to assemble a team to preserve an affordable housing project whose
 conversion to market-rate housing is imminent.

 ABAG projects that Vallejo should plan for 283 very low income housing units between 2015
 and 2023. Based on State law methodology, the City estimates that 50 percent of its very low-
 income housing allocation are extremely low-income households. Therefore, it is projected that
 142 households will be extremely low-income.
 Housing Unit Construction
 Local governments may take credit for units permitted since the January 1, 2014, against the
 RHNA. Based on building permit data, 17 permits have been issued. These units are assumed
 to be market rate, and therefore apply to the above-moderate income category. The units
 have been credited toward the City’s RHNA as the first step to determine the remaining need
 of housing units in each income category.

 Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development
  A key provision of State Housing Element law is a requirement that each local jurisdiction make
  available a sufficient quantity of land, with appropriate zoning and adequate infrastructure,
  to accommodate its local fair share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) during
  the 8-year planning period. The objective is to ensure adequate sites for new housing
  construction affordable to all economic segments of the community. Local jurisdictions must
  ensure sites are available for housing affordable to extremely low, very low-, low-, and
  moderate-income households as well as above moderate-income households. The State has
  generally held that the most appropriate way for local jurisdictions to provide adequate sites
  to meet the need for lower-income households is to provide land zoned for higher-density
  multi-family housing. Particularly in urban areas where land is expensive, high- density housing
  construction allows developers to reduce development costs by building more units on a given
  site.
  As part of this Housing Element, the City has updated the inventory of vacant residential land,
  including mixed-use sites with potential for residential development. The inventory is used to
  assist developers with identifying developable land as well as to provide City staff with a tool
  to monitor RHNA progress between housing element updates.
  The complete inventory of vacant land can be found in Appendix A and provides a list of
  vacant residential parcels in the City. This inventory was developed using GIS data from the
  City and the County Assessor, as well as a site-by-site review of larger opportunity sites with City
  staff. The remainder of this section summarizes the inventory of land available in Vallejo to
  accommodate anticipated housing demand and discusses the appropriateness of this land
  supply to meet the housing needs of households of various income levels.
  Vacant Land & Realistic Capacity
  Table 34 below identifies vacant land by zoning category, as well as the densities assumed to
  determine the unit capacity for each site in the inventory. As shown in the Table, the City has
  adequate sites to accommodate the RHNA with a realistic capacity of 2,474 units (remaining
  RHNA 1,345). The sites and zoning are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

 ** Density averaged across all vacant sites in each zone.
 ***Assumes 50% of land area attributed to residential use in MUPD. See below.
 Vacant Low Density (Single Family) and Medium Density Residential Land
 The City has identified approximately 86.7 acres of vacant land zoned Low Density Residential
 (LDR) to accommodate single family homes, and 31.4 acres of vacant land zoned Medium
 Density Residential (MDR) to accommodate a mix of lower and medium density housing types
 (364 and 408 units, respectively). Land zoned at lower densities are more likely to serve higher
 incomes and are therefore allocated to meeting the needs of moderate and above moderate
 income households.
 There are 254 vacant sites zoned LDR (86.7 acres). Sites less than 5,000 square feet in area,
 which is the minimum per-unit lot size allowed in the Zoning Code, were excluded. Larger sites
 (above 1 acre in size) were assumed to subdivide at a development density of 4 dwelling units
 per acre (DU), which is less than half of the maximum allowed density of 8.7 in LDR zones.
 The City currently has 14 sites totaling 31.4 acres of MDR land. Maximum densities in the MDR
 zone are based on a minimum lot area per dwelling unit of 2,500 SF, which equals 17.4 dwelling
 units per acre. The realistic capacity of vacant MDR parcels was determined by assuming a
 development intensity of 13 units per acre, which is evidenced by existing projects in MDR
 zones. The sites included in the vacant land inventory are of sufficient size and geometry such
 that parking and open space requirements do not impact the ability to achieve development
 densities of 13 units per acre.
 Secondary units may also be developed in the LDR zone. Secondary units can provide
 affordable housing by design and assist homeowners in meeting housing and living costs.

 Mare Island Specific Plan
 The Mare Island Specific Plan was adopted in March 1999 and last amended in July 2007.
 The Specific Plan creates a job generating and financially sustainable vision and guiding
 policy document that respects historic preservation and provides for the redevelopment of
 Mare Island. The Specific Plan was vested by the Mare Island Development Agreement
 in 2001. As listed in Table 34, a vacant site exists south of Flagship Drive on Mare Island,
 providing 2.86 acres of residential land at 13 units per acre. Due to the current property
 ownership structure and previous residential development in the Specific Plan area, the City
 anticipates market rate development on this site. Therefore the Housing Element assumes any
 development would accommodate moderate and above moderate income households
 Waterfront Planned Development Master Plan
 The Waterfront Planned Development Master Plan was adopted in October of 2005. The
 overarching objective of the Master Plan is to complement the Downtown Specific Plan
 to regain the historic place as the heart of the community. The Master Plan represents the
 zoning for all three Waterfront Districts (Northern, Central, and Southern Districts) and outlines
 key design criteria and minimum standards for development in the districts.
 The vacant land listed from the Waterfront Planned Development in Table 34 is comprised of
 2 vacant parcels located in the Northern and Southern Districts of the Waterfront. The City
 is currently working with a developer on an agreement for the complete development
 of the Waterfront Master Plan Area. As identified in the Master Plan, the Northern site is
 suitable for 175 town homes and podium units, resulting in a density of roughly 16.2 units per
 acre. Per the Master Plan, the site in the Southern District is envisioned for high-density
 residential condominium buildings totaling 650 units. The City anticipates these units to be
 market-rate, and are therefore applied towards the RHNA allocation for moderate and
 above moderate income levels.
 Vacant High Density Multi-Family Land
 The City has identified 15.3 acres (18 parcels) of vacant land zoned High Density Residential
 (HDR) with a maximum allowed density of 27 dwelling units per acre per the Zoning Code.
 However, the residential real estate market in Vallejo has yet to recover from the decline during
 the recession. In addition, Vallejo has traditionally been a suburban community with low and
 medium density housing. Therefore, based on historical trends and current market conditions,
 it is anticipated that the HDR sites may not build out at maximum density and 22 dwelling units
 (80% of maximum density) was established as the realistic development capacity for those
 sites.
 According to HCD, the City of Vallejo’s default density to accommodate housing for lower-
 income households is 30, slightly above the City’s current maximum. To achieve this default
 density, the City proposes Program A 1.1.4: High Density.
 Mixed Use Planned Development (MUPD)
 A considerable amount of vacant land exists in the Mixed Use Planned Development (MUPD)
 zones. A MUPD designation means that the land is associated with an approved development
 plan that can accommodate a mixture of uses. A number of these vacant MUPD sites fall within
 Specific Plan areas that allow and support residential uses at a variety of densities.
 Consequently, vacant MUPD land is capable of developing units across all income levels. As
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                           62

  shown in Table 34, approximately 17 acres of vacant land are available for mixed-use
  development at a variety of densities.
  Adopted in 1996, the White Slough Specific Plan was developed to preserve and protect
  habitat in anticipation of impacts from the construction of State Route 37. The Specific Plan
  calls for high density residential and retail uses and does not limit residential density.
  Specifically, a 13.1-acre parcel located within the White Slough Specific Plan (Site # MUPD-1,
  Appendix A) could provide a significant amount of affordable housing. Based on a
  conservative assumption that 50 percent of the land area would be attributed to residential
  development, and 30 dwelling units per acre, this site alone could provide 196 high-density
  units.
  While it is likely that a high percentage of vacant MUPD land be used for residential
  development, the realistic capacity calculation conservatively estimates a 50 percent split
  between residential and commercial uses. The market analysis being conducted the General
  Plan indicates that anticipated growth in demand for commercial uses can largely be
  absorbed by existing commercial land in the City. Because of excess commercial land in the
  City, it is likely that MUPD sites will be developed with primarily residential uses.
 There are no known environmental or site constraints that would limit development below levels
 evaluated in Table 34.
  Feasibility Analysis of Affordable Housing Densities
  The City’s default density to accommodate housing for lower-income households is 30 units
  per acre. While there is no density limit in MUPD, the HDR has a maximum density of 27 units per
  acre. As discussed below, there are several examples of projects that have developed at lower
  densities.
  In 2007, Affirmed Housing Group developed Avian Glen, an 87-unit multi-family project in
  Vallejo. The project was developed on a 4.22-acre site, resulting in a density of 21 units per
  acre. Avian Glenn is 100 percent affordable and provided 7 units affordable to extremely
  low-income households, 19 units affordable to very low-income households, 59 units
  affordable to low-income households, and 2 manager units, which are not rent-restricted.
  The project was developed in a planned development zone (PDR) and is an example of
  meeting market demand for affordable housing developments in a PD zone.
  In 2008, BRIDGE Housing was also contacted and indicated that 20 units to the acre is the
  most economical way to develop in the City of Vallejo. At densities higher than that, wood
  frame is no longer an option and a concrete podium would be required, making the project
  much more expensive to develop. In 2008 BRIDGE constructed Cottonwood Creek
  apartments, which are affordable to very low-income households in nearby Suisun City. This
  project has 94 units and was constructed on a 4.55-acre site, equating to a density of 20.7
  units per acre.
  While these projects were built in the late 2000’s, they reflect the most recent affordable PD
  housing development in and near Vallejo.

 Additional Planning Efforts to Increase Housing Capacity
 The City is currently developing the Sonoma Boulevard Specific Plan, which will introduce
 zoning flexibility in uses and allow for higher density residential development along the City’s
 central commercial corridor. On large mixed-use lots, resultant densities may be over 80 units
 per acre.

 Environmental Constraints
 The City of Vallejo, located on the San Pablo Bay, has moderate topography and hillside
 development, and is in the vicinity of known active faults, namely the San Andreus and
 Hayward Faults. While these environmental constraints may impact some new construction in
 the City, nearly all of the residential sites identified in the vacant sites inventory are infill sites
 surrounded by existing development, and potentially exempt from the California
 Environmental Quality Act. Specifically, all high density residential sites with potential for low
 and very low income levels are urban infill sites, surrounded by and with access to existing roads
 and other development and infrastructure, and are not impeded by significant topography or
 other restrictive landscape features. With building mitigation measures readily applied through
 application of building codes and mitigation measures identified through the CEQA process,
 environmental constraints do not pose a significant constraint on the feasibility of housing on
 these sites. Still, as unforeseen environmental constraints may impact development on a site-
 by-site basis, these factors are taken into account in the calculation of realistic capacity, as
 described above.

 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING AVAILABILITY
 Local government has few direct influences on housing production cost factors. The one
 direct cost affected by local agencies is fees. Lot improvement costs are indirectly influenced
 by local standards for streets and other site improvements. Planning densities also indirectly
 affect housing costs. These examples represent constraints to housing production that local
 government can influence, to some extent, by policies and regulations. Among these are
 land use and development controls, building codes and enforcement, site improvements,
 fees, and local processing and permit procedures.
 Land Use Controls
 The City’s land use controls offer limited options for new construction of low- and moderate-
 income housing. The City’s primary control over where housing can be constructed is the
 City Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance includes nine categories for residential
 development, ranging from single-family homes to multi-family dwellings at up to 27 units per
 acre. With PDR zoning, densities can and do exceed this figure when density bonuses are
 granted for provision of certain features such as affordable units, senior units, open space or
 recreation facilities for nonresidents, or interior pedestrian trails or bicycle paths which connect
 with city trails and paths.
 Residential Use Types in a Variety of Zones
 The City Zoning Ordinance allows residential units to be constructed in a variety of zones.
 Table 36 provides a list of the residential use types and a description of each of them as
 defined by Zoning Ordinance Section 16.06. The Zoning Ordinance defines a residential use
 type as a structure that includes “the occupancy of living accommodations on a wholly or
 primarily non-transient basis; but exclude institutional living arrangements which provide
 twenty-four-hour care to seven or more persons and those providing forced residence,
 such as asylums and prisons.” It should be noted that the City is completing a comprehensive
 update of the Zoning Ordinance. However, consistent with State law, the City will not propose
 changes to the code that would result in a net loss of residential units or prohibit the City from
 meeting its RHNA need.

 Live/Work
 The live/work residential use type is limited in residential districts to buildings that were originally
 constructed for commercial uses or buildings that have been legally converted for commercial
 uses. The Zoning Ordinance differentiates the live/work use type from typical home
 occupations by allowing the “work” component to (1) include employment of persons not
 living in the residential portion; (2) occupy more than 20 percent of the floor area and 400
 square feet of the premises; (3) have a separate designated access or private entrance
 specifically for the business use; (4) include alterations or features not customarily found in
 residential dwelling units; (5) have window displays; (6) sell articles not produced on the
 premises; and (7) have limited signage on the premises. In addition to the above, a minor use
 permit allows food handling, processing, or packing.
 Zoning Districts
 Part II of Title 16 of the Zoning Ordinance identifies and describes the basic zoning districts in
 the City. Table 37 below describes the basic zones in the City, provides the number of
 residential units that are allowed to be built per acre, and identifies instances in which
 residential use types (as described above in Table 36) are allowed. The Zoning Ordinance
 describes residential density per acre by defining the total number of units allowed per lot and
 the minimum lot size allowed. The permitted dwelling units per acre in Table 37 were
 determined by calculating the total number of units allowed per lot and the total number of
 lots allowed per acre, as determined by the minimum lot size allowed (in square feet) and
 divided by 43,560 (total square feet in an acre). For example, in the High Density Residential
 (HDR) district, the minimum size for each lot is 1,600 square feet, which means that the
 maximum number of lots allowable in an acre is slightly more than 27.
 The zoning districts for Rural Residential (RR) and Low Density Residential (LDR) are split into
 subcategories, which have been defined in Table 37. In the RR district, there are four
 subcategories that establish differing densities in order to accommodate the transition from
 the higher-density zones in the urban core and agricultural zones located in the outskirts of the
 City. There are three subcategories in the LDR zone, each with differing densities, which
 implement the Land Use Element of the City’s General Plan to establish neighborhoods in which
 residents have access to living in lower-density residential neighborhoods.
 The Medium Density Residential (MDR) district offers a variety of housing types, including single-
 family and multi-family dwelling units. The General Plan Land Use Element establishes the MDR
 district as a district within the central city that is higher in density and can be supported by the
 current level of urban services provided. The High Density Residential (HDR) district offers a
 variety of housing options, similar to the MDR district. The HDR district establishes the intent of
 the General Plan Land Use Element, which aims to complement large urban service areas
 (shopping centers, parks, large employment centers, etc.) with high-density residential
 development.
 The RR, LDR, MDR, and HDR zones are the primary zones in which the variety of residential uses
 are allowed. However, residential uses are allowed in select commercial and shopping
 center districts, subject to the approval of an appropriate use permit.

 Residential Development Standards
 Table 38 below provides a summary of the City’s residential development standards as set forth
 in the Zoning Ordinance. The residential development standards are created to ensure that
 the overall health, safety, and welfare of the community are protected while ensuring that the
 vision, goals, and policies of the General Plan are achieved.
 Minimum lot size: Minimum lot sizes range from 20 acres in the RC district to 5,000 square feet
 in the low-, medium-, and high-density zones. Minimum lot sizes do not impose a constraint for
 the development of housing.
 Minimum dwelling unit size: The City does not directly impose a minimum dwelling unit size
 in each of the residential zones. However, the City does impose a minimum lot area for
 each dwelling unit in the MDR and HDR zones. The minimum lot area per dwelling unit is 2,500
 square feet in the MDR zone and 1,600 square feet in the HDR zone.
 Maximum height: With the exception of the HDR zone, the maximum building height permitted
 in all residential zones is 35 feet. The maximum building height allowed in the HDR zone is 75
 feet, which allows for the construction of higher-density projects by employing the land to the
 maximum allowed use established in the zoning code. As defined in Section 16.04.560 of the
 Zoning Code, "Structure height" means the maximum vertical distance, measured from finished
 grade or original grade, whichever is the lowest point, between the lowest point on the site
 covered by any portion of the building to the topmost point of its roof.
 Minimum yard setbacks: Minimum yard setbacks for projects in the MDR and HDR districts are
 15 feet for the front, 5 feet for the side, and 5 feet for the rear. For each story in excess of two
 in the MDR and HDR district, the side and rear setback increases by 2 feet, which minimizes
 the total developable area of the site. However, projects can take advantage of multi-story
 development, which provides an opportunity to achieve higher-density development suitable
 for affordable housing development.
 Maximum lot coverage: The lot coverage of main building structures ranges from 2 percent to
 60 percent of the lot size. In the RC zone, the maximum amount of lot coverage for the
 main building is 2 percent of the lot, in the RR it is between 7.5 and 2.5 percent, in the
 LDR it is between 50 and 12 percent, and in the MDR and HDR it is 60 percent.

 Planned Development Zoning
 Conventional zoning regulations and their associated site development standards can
 sometimes preclude development of certain parcels where special conditions are present
 that make development difficult. The City has utilized Planned Development (PD) zoning to
 provide flexibility in meeting zoning requirements for unique projects or sites. The PD zoning
 also facilitates mixed-use development by allowing the development of mixed residential
 and nonresidential uses as an integral unit. The PD zoning designation allows flexibility of
 design for sites that are not being utilized due to special circumstances, which prevent them
 from being developed through the conventional application of regulations of the Zoning
 Ordinance. The PD zoning designation can allow for density bonuses for provision of low-
 or moderate-income housing, senior housing, open space or recreation facilities for
 nonresidents, or interior pedestrian trails or bicycle paths which connect with city trails and
 paths. Avian Glen, a recently constructed affordable housing complex, utilized the PD zoning
 process to expedite the plan approval phase.
 Planned Development Residential (PDR)
 Chapter 16.106 (Planned Development Residential District) of the Municipal Code
 implements the policies of the Vallejo General Plan, which call for the establishment of the
 specific residential areas where flexibility of design and development of land is appropriate.
 These areas will be conducive to creative and experimental methods of land development,
 including the application of new technologies or the innovative application of existing
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                        74
 technologies relating to resource conservation. These areas will also facilitate the
 development or redevelopment of land, which is not being utilized due to special
 circumstances, which prevent its development or redevelopment through the conventional
 application of the regulations of the zoning district.
 Development in the PDR zone is subject to the density standards set forth in the General
 Plan and is not subject to Section 16.79 (Multi-dwelling and Condominium Project
 Development Standards) of the Municipal Code. However, residential projects developed
 with housing units affordable to lower- and moderate-income households are awarded
 density bonuses at a rate of two units for every affordable unit constructed. Site development
 standards of projects in the PDR district are established through either an approved master
 plan or unit plan and are exempt from Section 16.75 (Site Development Standards), which
 allows developers to utilize a variety of technologies that would not otherwise be permitted
 in ‘traditional’ developments. In addition, PDR development provides developers with an
 opportunity to utilize sites that would not otherwise be suitable for residential development
 under basic zoning regulations. The PDR district does not constrain the development of lower-
 income housing development, rather it encourages and promotes such development. As
 previously mentioned, Avian Glen was developed in a PDR designation and is an example
 of meeting market demand for affordable housing developments in the PDR zone. Avian Glen
 is an 87-unit multi-family project in Vallejo that was developed on a 4.22-acre site, resulting in
 a density of 21 units per acre. Avian Glenn is 100 percent affordable and provided 7 units
 affordable to extremely low-income households, 19 units affordable to very low-income
 households, 59 units affordable to low-income households, and 2 manager units, which are
 not rent-restricted.
 Mixed Use Planned Development (MUPD)
 Chapter 16.112 (Mixed Use Planned Development District) of the Municipal Code intends
 to create and establish regulations for a mixed-use district, in which residential, commercial,
 and/or industrial uses are developed as an integral unit. All uses shall complement and
 enhance each other and their diversity shall be unified by an overall design concept. The
 intent of this district is to implement the policies of the Vallejo General Plan, which call for the
 establishment of specific areas where flexibility of design and development of diverse land
 use is appropriate for the benefit of the City as a whole. These areas will be conducive to
 creative and experimental methods of land development, including the application of new
 technologies or the innovative application of existing technologies relating to resource
 conservation. These areas will also facilitate the development or redevelopment of land,
 which is not being utilized to its best advantage due to special circumstances, which
 prevent its development or redevelopment through the conventional application of the
 regulations of the Zoning Ordinance.
 Development standards for projects in the MUPD zone are the same as those described
 for projects in the PDR district. The difference is that mixed-use projects will typically yield
 fewer residential units due to a mix of uses developed in a mixed-use project. However,
 the PDR process encourages developers to submit project plans for sites that include
 residential uses for sites that the basic zoning code may constrain. The MUPD district does not
 constrain residential development, rather it allows for market forces to develop residential
 units, which may have been constrained by the basic zoning regulations.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                            75

 As discussed, the PDR and MUPD process provides developers with flexibility from zoning
 standards that possibly constrain the development of sites with unique characteristics, such
 as sites that are sloped or have unique shape. The following exemptions apply to PDR and
 MUPD development.
 16.70 – Screening and Landscaping. For sites in which development is constrained by the
 characteristics of the site (topography and shape), it can be difficult for developers to comply
 with screening and landscaping regulations. Screening includes such things as fences,
 walls, berms, or plantings. The City finds that this requirement can sometimes make
 development infeasible or inconsistent (increasing development cost) with surrounding uses.
 Both the PDR and MUPD districts provide flexibility to mitigate screening and landscaping
 constraints. Landscape regulations include the number of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation
 required as part of development approval. The City has found that landscape regulations
 make some sites difficult to develop due to the unique characteristics of a site, and the PDR
 and MUPD process provides flexibility to minimize site constraints so that the site can be
 developed to its maximum use.
 16.75 – Site Development Standards. The PDR and MUPD process is intended to allow
 developers opportunities to maximize the potential of sties that would otherwise be hindered
 by the current zoning regulations. The City finds that the characteristics (mostly slope and
 surrounding uses) of some sites require a higher degree of flexibility to maximize development
 potential, thus the PDR and MUPD process allows for such flexibility by exempting projects from
 site development standards that would otherwise constrain development. For example,
 minimum open-space standards may be difficult to achieve due to the shape of a site,
 which means residential development may not be maximized on the site. The PDR and
 MUPD process provides developers with the flexibility to develop sites that because of their
 characteristics are constrained by the zoning code, thus the constraints are waived.
 16.79 – Multifamily/Condominium Standards. The PDR and MUPD process exempts
 developers from the MF/Condo development standards with the exception of condo
 conversions (16.79.050–16.79.070). Though development applications are reviewed based on
 the standards that developers define in applications regarding MF/Condo projects,
 developers are provided flexibility from the zoning code, so long as the application addresses
 the anticipated needs of residents and the surrounding community. For the most part,
 PDR/MUPD development applications occur within areas subject to specific plans and
 developers are encouraged to apply based on the goals of the specific plan. Once again,
 the PDR and MUPD process provides flexibility from the zoning code (it constrains development
 on some sites due to the site characteristics). Such development standards may increase
 allowed density if the specific plan calls for higher density.
 Permitted Uses
 Table 39 below displays zoning districts that allow residential construction and the types
 of residential construction allowed. The zoning code explicitly establishes the required permits
 for each residential structure to be constructed. Residential use type construction is allowed
 in 12 different zones within the City and permitted as either a permitted use (PU), a permitted
 use with limitations (PU-L), a minor use permit (UP-MN), or a major use permit (UP-MJ). Permitted
 uses are allowed by right. For example, in Table 39, family residential use types are allowed
 by right without limitations in the Resource Conservation (RC), RR, and LDR districts. In all other
 instances, residential development is allowed by permitted use with limitations, a conditional
 minor use permit, or a conditional major use permit.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                           76

 Use Permitted with Limitations
 The zoning code defines which types of permitted uses are allowed with limitations. The intent
 of these provisions is to establish restrictions on certain uses to better reflect the purpose and
 intent of the district in which they are permitted. In the MDR and HDR zones, the family
 residential use type is permitted by use with limitations. The limitations that apply to the
 residential use type in the MDR and HDR zones are defined by Zoning Ordinance Section
 16.57.020. The limitations for the family residential use type in Subsection A of Section 16.57.020
 establishes that all multiple dwelling structures comprising three to eight dwelling units are
 subject to review by the Planning Division according to Site Development Plan Approval. A
 permit for occupancy will not be issued by the City until the Planning Division has determined
 that the proposed development meets the requirements of the Site Development Plan
 Approval. Subsection A of Section 16.57.020 also establishes that any proposed family
 residential development consisting of nine or more units must be reviewed by the Planning
 Commission subject to the standards established for authorizing a conditional use permit.
 Subsection BB of Section 16.57.020 also establishes the approval requirements for the
 construction of live/work units in which the project is subject to permitted use with limitations.
 As shown in Table 39, live/work construction is permitted with limitations in the RR, LDR, MDR,
 and HDR zones. Live/work occupancies in residential zones are limited to buildings that were
 originally constructed or had been previously legally converted for commercial purposes,
 subject to approval of a minor use permit.
 Second family residential construction is permitted with limitations in the RR, LDR, and
 MDR districts. Subsection DD of Section 16.57.020 establishes the approval limitations to which
 second family residential construction are subject and are in accordance with Section
 65852.2 of the California Government Code. Second family residential units are discussed
 further in the “Second Dwelling Unit” section below.
 Conditional Use Permit
 As shown in Table 39, the Zoning Ordinance establishes the instances in which a
 conditional use permit (CUP) is required for project approval. The required CUP is either
 minor or major, depending on the zoning district in which the use type will be constructed.
 A minor use type requires public notice but not a public hearing, while a major CUP requires
 both public notice and public hearing.

 Emergency Shelters
 California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
 with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
 months or less by a homeless person.”
 In effect since January 1, 2008, Senate Bill (SB) 2 (Cedillo, 2007) requires the City to allow
 emergency shelters without any discretionary action in at least one zone that is appropriate
 for permanent emergency shelters (i.e., with commercial uses compatible with residential or
 light industrial zones in transition), regardless of its demonstrated need. The goal of SB 2 was to
 ensure that local governments are sharing the responsibility of providing opportunities for
 the development of emergency shelters. To that end, the legislation also requires that the
 City demonstrate site capacity in the zone identified to be appropriate for the
 development of emergency shelters.
 Effective April, 9, 2015, the City’s Zoning Ordinance has been updated to be in compliance with
 SB-2, updating the definition of Emergency Shelter to reflect the appropriate Government Code
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                               78

 (Section 16.06.490), and allow Emergency Shelters by-right in Intensive Use Zones (Section
 16.34.030). The Intensive Use zoning district (IU) was determined as most appropriate for
 emergency shelters as it contains capacity for at least one Emergency Shelter, and
 encourages community-level commercial uses along major thoroughfares so these areas
 have adequate transit access and are likely to be close to neighborhood services and
 amenities. Intensive Use Zones are located throughout the City, and there are a number of
 potential sites for Emergency Shelters. Potential sites include two vacant parcels over one half
 acre in size near the intersection of Solano Ave with the Curtola Parkway, and a vacant parcel
 over several acres large adjacent the Food for Less grocery store in the northern section of
 Sonoma Boulevard. In addition, multiple vacant or underutilized IU sites exist in other areas of
 the City, such as the Couch Street corridor from Mississippi Street to Redwood Street.
 SB-2 allows for objective development and management standards which are designed to
 encourage and facilitate the construction of or conversion to an Emergency Shelter. In
 compliance with SB-2, the following summarizes the development standards set for Emergency
 Shelters in the City (Section 16.57.020):
         Emergency Shelters shall conform to all property development standards of the zoning
          district in which it is located.
         The length of stay of an individual client shall not exceed six (6) months within a twelve
          (12) month period.
         The maximum number of beds shall be 50 unless a major conditional use permit is
          approved for additional beds.
         External lighting shall be provided for security purposes.
         No more than one Emergency Shelter shall be permitted within a radius of 300 feet from
          another. Exceptions may be granted for significant physical features that act as barriers.
         Parking shall be designed to provide security for residents. No on street parking shall be
          allowed, and bicycle parking provided.
         Other site and building design standards such as the provision of adequate storage for
          personal belongings, client waiting/intake area, screening of outdoor toilets, restrooms
          and donation/collection bins.
         Submission of a Management and Operation plan for review and approval by the
          Planning Manager.
 Transitional and Supportive Housing
 Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the California Health and Safety Code as
 rental housing for stays of at least six months but where the units are re-circulated to another
 program recipient after a set period. It may be designated for a homeless individual or family
 transitioning to permanent housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group
 housing and multi-family units and may include supportive services to allow individuals to gain
 necessary life skills in support of independent living.
 Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the California Health and Safety Code as
 housing with linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay and occupied
 by a target population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income
 person with mental disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                           79

 whose disabilities originated before the age of 18). Services linked to supportive housing are
 usually focused on retaining housing, living and working in the community, and/or health
 improvement.
 SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing types be treated as residential uses and
 subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
 same zone. Both transitional and supportive housing types must be explicitly permitted in the
 Municipal Code. Transitional and supportive housing is not explicitly defined in Vallejo’s zoning
 code, though it can be interpreted as a residential use type under “group residential.” The
 zoning code defines group residential as “the residential occupancy of dwelling units by
 groups of more than five persons who are not related by blood, marriage or adoption, on a
 weekly or longer basis. Typical uses include occupancy of sorority houses, retirement homes or
 boardinghouses.” The only residential zone in which group care (7 to 12 persons) are allowed
 is in the HDR zone with a major CUP. Also, under the civic use type classification, the City defines
 group care facilities as a use in which “services provided in residential facilities licensed by the
 Director of the State Department of Social Services to serve seven to twelve persons, or in
 facilities authorized to provide day care services for seven to twelve persons, but excluding
 those uses classified under Major Impact Services and Utilities. Typical uses include halfway
 houses, intermediate care facilities, or day nurseries.”
 Effective April, 9, 2015, the City’s Zoning Ordinance has been updated to be in compliance with
 SB-2, updating the definitions of Transitional and Supportive Housing to reflect the appropriate
 Government Code and treating these uses as other residential uses in the same zone.
 Extremely Low-Income Households
 Assembly Bill (AB) 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and analysis of existing
 and projected housing needs of extremely low-income households. The existing need is
 demonstrated in Tables 7 and 28, and the projected need is shown in Table 32. Elements
 must also identify zoning to encourage and facilitate supportive housing and single-room
 occupancy units (SROs).
 Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs
 including but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness,
 persons with substance abuse problems, and persons with mental illness or developmental
 disabilities. The City’s Municipal Code does not explicitly define SRO housing. According to
 the Housing Resource Center, an SRO is defined as a type of residential hotel offering one-
 room units for long-term occupancy by one or two people. SROs may have kitchen or bath
 facilities, but not both. The City plans to update the current zoning code to define an SRO
 as well as establish provisions for allowing the development of SROs according to AB 2634 (see
 Program A 3.1.1)
 Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance
 The City is does not currently have an inclusionary housing ordinance. In light of the Palmer
 case rulings, the City does not seek to develop an inclusionary housing ordinance. The City is
 instead exploring the development of a housing impact fee and/or a commercial linkage fee,
 based on best practices and successful examples in other jurisdictions (See Housing Element
 Programs B 2.1.2 and B 2.1.3).
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                            80

 Second Dwelling Units
 The City has defined a second dwelling unit as a second family residential unit “which means
 an additional dwelling unit constructed or adapted within, onto, or apart from an existing
 dwelling unit on a single-family residential lot.” The zoning code explicitly allows for a second
 family residential unit to be allowed so long as the proposed construction of the unit meets the
 criteria set forth in the zoning code. The criteria established does not constrain the
 development of second units, and according to the ministerial review of the application,
 design portions of the criteria may be unmet in the event that the unit provides for housing
 permanently disabled persons. Features such as ramps and alterations to doors and windows
 that do not meet the architectural design standards may be approved in the event that the
 dwelling unit provides housing compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for
 disabled persons.
 Second dwelling units are allowed in the RR, LDR, and MDR zones as a permitted use with
 limitations. Ordinance 16.57.020 (DD) establishes that for requests for second dwelling units that
 meet the requirements of the limitations, second dwelling unit construction is approved
 following a ministerial review.
 The zoning code is in compliance with AB 1866 (second unit legislation) and promotes the
 construction of suitable ADA-compliant housing for disabled persons in the City in need of such
 housing.
 Housing for Persons with Disability
 As part of a governmental constraints analysis, Housing Elements must analyze constraints
 upon the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with
 disabilities. Housing Element law requires each jurisdiction to analyze potential governmental
 constraints to the development, improvement, and maintenance of housing for persons with
 disabilities, demonstrate local efforts to remove any such constraints, and provide for
 reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities through programs that remove
 constraints.
 The City ensures that new housing developments comply with California building standards
 (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal requirements for accessibility.
 Reasonable Accommodation
 The City currently abides by all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) building requirements but
 does not have a codified reasonable accommodations procedure as required by Chapter
 671, Statutes of 2001, Senate Bill 520. This legislation requires jurisdictions to identify whether they
 have an established reasonable accommodation procedure that allows for the application
 and permitting of necessary accessibility retrofits for persons with disabilities. Jurisdictions must
 also analyze whether their current procedure for processing these types of requests may be a
 constraint to the ability of persons with disabilities to acquiring the necessary accommodations.
 The City will codify a reasonable accommodation procedure as stated in Program E 1.1.5.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                81

 Mobile Home Residential
 Government Code Section 65852.3 (a) requires jurisdictions to allow the development of
 factory- built and mobile home units with the same development standards applied to stick-
 built housing (family residential). As shown in Table 39, the City’s Municipal Code allows mobile
 home residential units in a mobile home park with a major use permit in the LDR, MDR, and HDR
 zones. Family residential development in the LDR zone is allowed as a permitted use, and in
 the MDR and HDR zones family residential is allowed as a permitted use with limitations. The
 City will implement Program D 1.1.5 to amend the Municipal Code to clarify that a single mobile
 home or a manufactured house is currently allowed by right in the LDR zone.
 ZONING AND LAND USE
 Permits and Processing
 As described in the section regarding second dwelling units, the City considers second
 dwelling units as permitted uses with limitations. Part DD.k of Section 16.57.020 allows the
 planning manager to exempt required limitations regarding the construction of second
 dwelling units in the event that the proposed construction will include installation of
 features that facilitate access for persons with limited mobility, for example, the approval
 of ramp installation that allows the design to deviate from second dwelling building
 standards, given that the ramp provides increased access for persons with limited mobility.
 Allowing exemptions from the zoning code to construct second dwelling units that are built
 with features that increase access for persons with limited mobility provides incentives for the
 construction and use of second units as a use type that effectively provides housing for
 persons with disabilities in a non-group setting by removing the constraint.
 Building Codes
 Ordinance 12.01.010 of Title 12 of the City’s Municipal Code established the adoption of the
 2012 California Building Code Standards, which includes required building provisions for
 persons with limited mobility within all newly built structures in the City.
 The City regularly adopts the International Council of Building Officials (ICBO) recommended
 building and housing codes. By adopting these building codes, the City aligns its building
 standards with those used by most other jurisdictions. This should help to facilitate the
 construction and rehabilitation of housing in Vallejo because it allows builders familiar with the
 construction standards in other communities to easily work in Vallejo. It should help to increase
 the pool of building contractors who will work in Vallejo, which should in turn ensure that
 construction costs remain as reasonable as possible.

 Development Standards
 The City has adopted site development standards for all structures constructed in the City. Site
 development standards have been adopted and are enforced in order to ensure that the
 development of property within Vallejo achieves the following:
          Makes a positive contribution to the existing development on neighboring properties.
          Ensures that new or altered structures are compatible and harmonious with the design
           and use of existing structures on neighboring properties.
          Respects the existing views, privacy, and access to light and safety of neighboring
           properties.
          Does not adversely affect neighboring properties, with “adversely affect” to mean
           to impact in a substantial, negative manner the economic value, habitability, or
           livability of these properties.
 Table 38 above summarizes the basic site development standards in each of the residential
 zones as described in the Zoning Ordinance. In addition to the site development standards
 described in Table 38, residential projects constructed in the City requiring either a conditional
 use permit or a site development approval plan are subject to site development standards
 described in the Zoning Ordinance. One- and two-family structures are subject to meeting the
 site development standards established by Ordinance 16.75.040, which requires that the
 structure meet standards concerned with architectural treatment, circulation/access, and
 utilities. The site development plans for constructing one- and two-family residential units do
 not place a constraint on the development of such units and achieve the goals set forth by
 the City.
 Multi-family and condominium dwellings are also subject to site development standards
 beyond those described in Table 38. As presented in Table 39, all proposed projects with nine
 units or more, including the conversion of condominium projects, are subject to approval of a
 conditional use permit. Multi-family residential projects that require a site development plan
 must demonstrate that they will be in compliance with Ordinance 16.79.030, which requires
 design standards compatible with adjacent low-density residential projects, circulation, open
 space, solid waste disposal, and laundry facilities.
 According to Table 39 projects in all zones are subject to similar review, meaning that the
 standards do not place an unreasonable constraint on the development of multi-family
 structures.
 The construction and conversion of condominium projects are subject to the site development
 standards described in Ordinance 16.79.040. All projects that meet the development standards
 are allowed to be developed or converted in all residential zones by obtaining the required
 permit. In addition to complying with the development standards for each district described
 in Table 39 the following development standards apply: separation from other structures, open
 space, storage, sound transmission, laundry facilities, utilities, traffic, declaration of covenants,
 and subdivision ordinance requirements. Development of condominium projects is not
 constrained through the application of these development standards.

 Planned Development Zone Standards
 As discussed previously, the City provides developers of residential construction with an
 alternative to the above site development standards by offering building permits through the
 Planned Unit Development (PD) process. The PD process intends to implement the policies of
 the Vallejo General Plan which calls for the establishment of the specific residential areas
 where flexibility of design and development of land is appropriate. The PD process offers
 applicants an opportunity to develop residential uses in areas that have unique characteristics
 (this opens up residential development rather than constraining it). The PD process also
 promotes the development of innovative land uses. The PD review process applies to the
 following residential use types: family residential, guest residential, and second family
 residential.
 All projects proposed under the PD permit procedures are subject to the following standards:
 size/location of the site, circulation patterns, topography, preservation, and relationship to
 surrounding area, mix of use types, architecture, public improvement, development intensity,
 landscaping, and the intent and purpose of the proposed development.
 The PD process provides an alternative for developers to pursue in instances that a proposed
 property has conditions that would make it difficult and/or expensive to develop.
 Residential Parking Requirements
 The City’s residential off-street parking requirements are shown below in Table 40.
                                                      TABLE 40

       One-Family Dwelling                                     2 spaces per unit
       Condominiums and Apartments
       Studio                                                  1 space per unit
       One-Bedroom                                             1.5 spaces per unit
       Two-Bedroom or larger                                   2 spaces per unit
       Guest Parking                                           1 space per 5 units
      Sources: City of Vallejo Zoning Ordinance, 2014
 The City’s parking standards do not make a distinction between types of units — attached
 or detached — or potential occupants such as the elderly or disabled which may generate
 a lower demand for parking spaces. The current standards are quite typical of most cities and
 do not present any additional requirements that would inhibit development on their own.
 Nevertheless, unnecessary parking space requirements could serve to increase project
 development costs for developments built for seniors or as transit-oriented development. As
 a remedy, according to Section 16.62.105 of the City’s zoning code, parking requirements
 for senior citizen housing and other facilities serving senior citizens may be reduced up to 50
 percent by the Planning Manager. The requirements may a l s o be reduced when a
 developer can demonstrate that other forms of transportation will be used, including
 walking, bicycling, and transit.

 Permit Fees
 Vallejo building, development impact, and planning fees are shown in the following Tables 41,
 42, and 43. Based on a record of building permits issued in 2014, a 1,832 square foot home with
 three bedrooms and two bathrooms was valued at $217,993.10 and the total fees paid were
 $21,808.54. In the same year, the developer of a 48-unit apartment complex valued at
 $11,996,901 paid $650,362.68 in fees, which equated to $13,549.21 per unit. Compared to the
 fees established by jurisdictions in and around Solano County, Vallejo’s fee schedules are
 similar and do not place an unreasonable constraint on developers’ ability to construct new
 housing in the City.
 Building permit fees are based upon the Uniform Building Code and are set at levels designed
 to offset the City’s cost to monitor building construction activities. This is common practice in
 most jurisdictions.

 Permit Processing
 The building permit review and approval process can have an effect on housing costs.
 Lengthy processing of development applications can add to construction costs. Expediting
 review of developments that will offer lower- and moderate-income housing could be an
 incentive. Normally, building permit approval of single-family housing units in an area zoned
 for single-family housing development requires the approval from the Planning Division, the
 Building Division, Fire Prevention, Public Works, and from the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood
 Control District, and would typically take 10 to 12 weeks, assuming no special site or
 environmental conditions requiring additional mitigation or study. Normally, construction of
 a multi-family housing complex in an appropriately zoned area would follow the same
 regulatory approval process and timeline.
 Generally, the City’s entitlement process is reasonably quick; however, the requirement
 that multi-family housing projects of more than eight units first obtain a conditional use permit
 that must be approved by the Planning Commission, even if located in the High Density
 Residential (HDR) zone, can become a constraint to the development of affordable
 housing. Housing advocates have expressed to the City that the additional layer of a
 public hearing fails to facilitate development of affordable housing on parcels appropriately
 zoned for such use.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                        89

 The Planning Division indicates that the time for staff to process a project of eight or fewer units
 is generally 45 to 60 days and that, by comparison, the time to process a conditional use permit
 for a project of nine or more units is generally much longer, depending on the level of
 environmental review, staff workload, and scheduling of Planning Commission meetings. The
 added length of time for projects requiring a major conditional use permit approval can be
 further extended if City staff determines that community meetings are necessary or the
 project is appealed to the City Council.
 Multi-family projects larger than eight units may take more time to process due to the potential
 complexity of design and construction. To simplify the entitlement process, Program A 3.1.1
 proposes to revise the municipal code to remove the use permit requirement for multi-family
 projects larger than eight units.
 On/Off-site Improvements
 Chapter 15.06 of the City’s Municipal Code establishes the general regulations governing
 the required on- and off-site improvements of subdivisions. The purpose of the provisions
 required for subdivision development is to ensure the orderly growth of the City and to protect
 public health and safety. Upon approval of a final subdivision map, the City may accept a
 dedication of real property as a means to satisfy required site improvements, including
 streets, alleys, drainage, and other public easements. There is a selection of improvements
 that must be provided through real property dedications (identified below). In the event that
 the City does not accept proposed dedications, it is the responsibility of the subdivider to
 provide the site improvements. The following are required site improvements:
         Streets – The width and alignment must be in accordance with any City Council-
          approved street master plan. In the event that a master plan does not apply, it is
          the responsibility of the Public Works Director to establish the improvement standards.
         Public Transit – Dedications for public transit services (bus turnouts, benches, shelters,
          landing pads, and similar items) must be made for subdivision requests in which
          the maximum density allowed according to the General Plan would allow 200 or more
          units.
         Bicycle Paths – Subdivisions with 200 or more parcels may be required to provide
          additional dedications for the development of bicycle paths, depending upon the
          direction of the City Council.
         Sidewalks – The Public Works Director must approve plans to ensure sidewalks will
          be installed to grades, locations, widths, and cross-sections.
         Blocks – The maximum length allowed for each block is 1,000 feet and must be sufficient
          for a maximum layout of two rows of lots according to the provisions of the applicable
          zoning requirements.
         Easements – The City Council may order that dedications are provided for the
          installation of utilities, planting strips, and other public purposes. In the event that
          the subdivider provides the dedication to an agency other than the City, the agency
          is responsible for implementation.
         Sanitary Sewers – The subdivider shall provide all on-site and off-site sanitary sewer
          facilities determined necessary by the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                           90

         Storm Drainage – The subdivider shall provide all on-site and off-site storm drainage
          facilities determined necessary by the Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District.
         Water Mains and Fire Hydrants – Water mains and fire hydrants of design, layout,
          and locations approved by the Public Works Director connecting to the city water
          system shall be installed in accordance with the water ordinance of the City.
         Gas and Electric Facilities – The subdivider shall provide all on-site and off-site gas
          and electric facilities determined necessary by the public utilities company providing
          service.
         Communication Facilities – The subdivider shall reimburse a telephone corporation
          and/or cable television system for all costs for the replacement, undergrounding,
          or permanent or temporary relocation of existing facilities of a telephone corporation
          and/or cable television system required by the subdivision.
         Mail – The subdivider of a residential subdivision shall provide locations for mail delivery
          boxes in accordance with U.S. Postal Service requirements.
         Landscaping – Landscaping must remain consistent with the zoning code.
          Landscaping, including street trees, shall be installed along all streets, highways,
          freeways, and other public rights-of-way which are part of or which border a
          subdivision.
         Street Lighting – The subdivider may be required by the Public Works Director to
          dedicate easements for street lighting and to install such lighting.
 Upon approval of the City’s subdivision ordinance, the ordinance was determined to be
 consistent with the City’s zoning code and General Plan. In addition, the ordinance is
 consistent with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. The on- and off-site improvement
 requirements do not unreasonably constrain the development of new housing. The site
 improvement requirements are necessary to ensure that the public health and safety of all
 residents is protected and that the growth of the City is orderly.
 Parkland Dedication and Fees
 Chapter 3.18 of the City’s Municipal Code - Land Dedication and Fees for Park and
 Recreational Purposes, includes procedures and establishment of fees for the provision of parks
 and recreational land to serve the City’s residents. The City provides parks based on need
 determined in the General Plan and the goals and policies of the Vallejo Recreation District,
 generally via fees and/or parkland dedications, and in accord with the Quimby Act. A
 developer, owner or builder may request that the project dedicate an improved park or
 recreational site rather than dedicating land and/or fees in lieu of land and paying park
 impact fees and the City may also provide partial credit for the provision of private Open
 Space. The location of parkland is determined by the Development Services Director in
 consultation with the greater Vallejo Recreation District. The City provides credit for parkland
 dedications, to be made concurrent with approval of the final subdivision map, based on a
 fair-market value determination per acre of land.

 Infrastructure Availability
 Vallejo staff indicated that the City’s current water and sewer capacity will allow for General
 Plan buildout and should not be a concern in the immediate future. Vallejo also implements a
 development fee program that collects funds from new development to pay for infrastructure
 to support that growth. Developers pay school impact, road, and fire mitigation fees. Overall,
 Vallejo anticipates development will not be inhibited due to either a lack or shortage of
 supporting infrastructure.
 To comply with Senate Bill (SB) 1087, the City will immediately forward its adopted Housing
 Element to its water and wastewater providers so they can grant priority for service allocations
 to proposed developments that include units affordable to lower-income households.
 Opportunities for Energy Conservation
 With respect to residential construction, opportunities primarily take the form of construction of
 new homes using energy-efficient designs, materials, fixtures, and appliances, or retrofitting
 existing homes to be more energy efficient (e.g., weather stripping, upgrading insulation,
 upgrading to more energy-efficient fixtures and appliances). At a minimum, new housing
 construction in Vallejo must comply with the State of California Title 24 energy efficiency
 standards. These requirements are enforced through the building plan check process. The City
 has established Program I 1.1.1 to create partnerships with local utility programs that assist
 residents with saving on energy cost through increased energy efficiency. The City has also
 established Program I 1.1.2 as a measure to adopt the State’s Green Building Code, which will
 focus on improving the efficiency of residential structures through design and construction.
 In addition to the design and construction of individual buildings, the development industry is
 becoming increasingly aware of opportunities for energy conservation at the site planning
 level and even at the community planning level. New developments are increasingly being
 planned so that building orientations will take advantage of passive solar energy benefits.
 Larger-scale land use planning is increasingly considering the benefits of compact urban form
 (i.e., higher densities) as a means to reduce auto dependency for transportation, and the
 benefits of mixed-use land use patterns to make neighborhoods more self-contained so that
 residents can walk or bicycle to places of work, shopping, or other services. Compact urban
 development patterns also are necessary to improve the effectiveness of buses and other
 forms of public transit. If effective public transit is available and convenient, energy will be
 conserved through reduced auto use. Program H 2.1.4 encourages transit-oriented
 development, which takes advantage of site location near transportation services, thus
 reducing residents’ dependency on automobile usage. The City should consider incorporating
 these or other sustainable development principles into new developments that are planned in
 Vallejo as well as provide incentives for builders to construct residential structures that minimize
 energy usage.

 NON-GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING AVAILABILITY
 Major factors within the private market system that contribute to the direct sales prices
 and rental costs of new housing include land costs, construction costs, and the availability of
 financing.
 Land Costs
 While there is limited vacant residential land available for sale in Vallejo, a few properties
 were located within the City for which asking prices were quoted. According to Zillow, an
 online resource advertising undeveloped residential land for sale in the City, land prices vary
 between $74,000 and $1,800,000 per acre, a median cost of $380,000 per acre. Fairfield,
 which is a neighboring jurisdiction, currently contains land that is selling for slightly less than
 land in Vallejo. In Fairfield, vacant land ranges from $57,000 to $1,200,000 per acre, a median
 cost of $229,000 per acre. The higher cost of land in Vallejo relative to Fairfield may be
 attributed to the location, however a considerable number of factors influence land values,
 including improvements and market timing. Geographically, Vallejo is at the eastern fringe
 of the Bay Area, located approximately 18 miles west from Fairfield. The cost of available
 land in the City is not considered a constraint on housing production.
 Construction Costs
 Building-Cost.net is an online resource that provides construction cost estimates based on
 the calculations used in the National Construction Cost Manual. According to Building-
 Cost.net, the approximate cost of constructing a 1,700 square foot single-family home is
 $269,631. The estimate assumes average quality building materials and also includes a
 contractor’s markup as well as indirect costs. The total indirect cost and contractor markup
 for the construction of the home is $39,799 and the total direct cost is $229,832. Direct costs
 include estimates for material costs ($100,760), labor costs ($125,554), and equipment costs
 ($3,506). Impact fees and permit fees are not calculated in the costs of construction, because
 the market is not responsible for administering those fees; instead, it is the City that imposes
 such fees. Construction costs alone are not considered a constraint to making affordable
 housing available.

   Availability of Financing
   Table 44 displays data regarding home loan totals for the City of Vallejo for 2011 through 2013.
   The Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) provides data reported by
   lending institutions as required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). Over the 3-year
   period reported in Table 48, 55 percent of all loan applications in Vallejo were approved.
   As seen in the table, loan activity in Vallejo increased significantly between 2011 and 2013. In
   2011, the percentage of approved loans was 48.6 percent. The total number of approved
   loans as a percentage of total loans in the City increased by 7.4 percent to 56 percent by 2013,
   which is reflective of more lenient lending practices and more available credit.

 GOALS, POLICIES, PROGRAMS
 This section of the Vallejo Housing Element explains what the City seeks to accomplish with
 the implementation of the Housing Element in the pursuit of nine broad Goals. The City has
 established these Goals in consideration of its own local needs and priorities and its
 obligations under State Housing Element law. A series of Policies are listed under each Goal.
 These Policies will guide City actions to help achieve the associated Goals. Along with each
 Policy, there are one or more Programs that state specific accomplishments that the City can
 use to measure its progress toward meeting its Goals. A summary of specific quantified
 objectives required by State law follows the Goals, Policies, and Programs. It should be noted
 that during the previous Housing Element cycle the City of Vallejo experienced considerable
 financial hardship and a large scale reorganization. The resulting budgetary constraints and
 staffing issues made it difficult for the City to accomplish many of their housing goals.
 CHANGES IN GOALS, POLICIES, PROGRAMS FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
 Although modifications have been made to update timelines, account for changes in
 Redevelopment Law, and to clarify language, the Goals, Policies, and Programs below
 generally remain intact from the previous Housing Element.
 GOAL A – FACILITATE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING TO ACCOMMODATE VALLEJO'S
 FAIR SHARE OF THE REGIONAL HOUSING DEMAND.
 Policy A.1: The City of Vallejo strives to provide opportunities for the development of new
 housing adequate to meet its share of the increasing regional demand for
 households at all income levels.
 Program A 1.1.1: Housing Element Annual Review
 Annually, the City will prepare an analysis of its progress in implementing the Housing Element,
 for submittal to the City Council and to the California Department of Housing and
 Community Development. If necessary, the City will undertake appropriate actions to
 expand the inventory of available sites to accommodate the unmet need.
 Responsible Party:        Planning Division
 Time Frame:               Annually
 Funding Source:           General Fund
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                       95

 Program A 1.1.2: Vacant Land Inventory and RHNA Monitoring
 The City of Vallejo will continue to maintain a vacant land inventory for residential, commercial,
 and industrially zoned parcels. In considering development applications and/or pending
 changes in local land use policy, the City of Vallejo will place a priority on activities (i.e.,
 expedite permits when possible) that support the City’s ability to meet its unmet share of the
 regional housing need. As part of this monitoring process, the City will track projects that are
 approved on a site with a lower density than that identified in the Vacant Land Inventory, and
 assess its continued ability to accommodate the RHNA. Should the project result in a shortfall
 in sites of appropriate densities, the City will identify additional sites to replenish the Inventory
 and/or use the specific planning and planned development process to ensure remaining
 needs can be met by future residential developments.
 Responsible Party:         Planning Division
 Time Frame:               City staff will review list annually to ensure enough land to meet the City’s
                           RHNA allocation through the 5th cycle planning period and update site
                           information as projects are approved through the Planning Division.
 Funding Source:           General Fund
 Program A 1.1.3: Mixed-Use Development
 The City will continue to encourage and facilitate the residential development in mixed-use
 zones, particularly units affordable to extremely low-, low- and very low-income households.
 The City will consider in the General Plan update, Sonoma Boulevard Specific Plan, and Zoning
 Ordnance update providing more flexibility for mixed-use development with residential units
 on the ground floor of certain commercial areas (except for storefronts abutting the public
 sidewalk) or under certain conditions.
 The City’s vacant land inventory described in Program A 1.1.2 will include a listing of mixed-use
 and high density sites appropriate for residential uses. This inventory will be made available to
 interested developers, including affordable housing developers, to facilitate and encourage
 them to propose development on these sites.
 The City will continue to facilitate the construction of residences in the mixed-use
 developments and high density by doing the following:
         Discouraging the development of exclusively commercial projects, in areas designated
          for mixed-use.
         Continuing to provide marketing materials on the City’s website that delineate site
          opportunities for mixed-use and provide technical assistance for interested developers.
          Technical assistance includes assisting interested developers with obtaining property
          owner/representative information and information on the available development
          incentives (Program A 2.1.1).
         Complete form-based design standards for Sonoma Boulevard Specific Plan and other
          areas as appropriate to provide developers a predicable path to entitlement of mixed-use
          projects.
City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015                                96

         Encourage lot consolidation for mixed-use developments by providing technical
          assistance to developers to facilitate negotiations between property owners.
         As sites become available, establish a protocol to monitor development interest,
          inquiries, and progress toward mixed-use development. Periodically re-evaluate
          approach and progress.
 Responsible Parties:      Planning Division, Housing and Community Development Division
 Time Frame:               Complete form-based standards by 2016, update Zoning Ordinance by
                           2016, provide marketing materials, assistance, and update vacant land
                           inventory- ongoing.
 Funding Source:           General Fund and Grant Funding
 Program A 1.1.4: High Density
 The City will increase the density of High Density Residential (HDR) designated parcels from 27
 to 30 units per acre. This will occur in conjunction with the Zoning Code update process.
 Responsible Parties:      Planning Division, Housing and Community Development Division
 Time Frame:               By December 2016
 Funding Source:           General Fund and Grant Funding
 Policy A.2: Convert vacant infill land and surplus, vacant nonresidential properties to
 housing and mixed use where feasible, economically desirable, and compatible.
 Program A 2.1.1: Underutilized Commercial Land Conversion Program
 The City, through the comprehensive General Plan and Zoning Code update, will expand
 opportunities for residential and mixed-use development. Through this process the City will offer
 regulatory incentives, such as expedited permit processing for projects that contain an
 affordable housing component. The City will also promote the availability of both the
 underutilized sites and regulatory incentives through the use of the City’s website, during pre-
 application meetings, and during other relevant community outreach workshops/meetings.
 Lastly, the City will monitor the supply of underutilized sites and evaluate whether the incentives
 described above are providing the necessary catalyst to ensure that development is occurring
 consistent with the RHNA needs. As necessary, the City will make changes to this program to
 ensure that infill development remains a realistic and viable development strategy.
 Responsible Party:        Planning Division
 Time Frame:               Study and site inventory will be completed by December 2015.

 Policy A.3: Monitor, remove, or mitigate governmental constraints to the production of
 housing within the City of Vallejo.
 Program A 3.1.1: Removal of Governmental Constraints
 The City will review local regulations to remove or mitigate constraints on the production of
 housing, where possible. These include:
      a) Remove the regulation requiring a major conditional use permit for multi-family
          housing developments with nine or more units.
      b) Currently “group residential” facilities under five persons are permitted with a CUP in
          High-Density Residential. The City will allow licensed group homes and other
          residential care facilities with six or fewer residents by right in residential zones
          accordance with State law.
      c) Assembly Bill (AB) 2634 requires the City to identify zoning to encourage and
          facilitate housing suitable for extremely low-income households, which includes
          supportive housing and single-room occupancy (SRO) units. As part of the Zoning
          Ordinance Update, the City will add a definition of SRO a n d identify a zone, or zones
          where SROs will be allowed.

 Policy A.4: Promote a variety of housing types, including rental and ownership
 opportunities for moderate- and above-moderate income households.
 Program A 4.1.1: Housing Marketing and Promotion
 Encourage and facilitate the development of housing that is affordable to households with a
 wide range of incomes, particularly in the downtown area, by updating land use policies and
 regulations and marketing and branding the City as an investment opportunity for moderate
 and above moderate income households.

 Funding Source:           General Fund
 GOAL B – INCREASE THE RANGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES.
 Policy B.1: The City of Vallejo strives to increase the range of housing opportunities for
 all residents, including those unable to afford market-rate housing within the community.
 Program B 1.1.1: Section 8 Rental Subsidy Program (Tenant-Based)
 Continue to apply to HUD for vouchers for extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
 households, making extremely low-income households a priority. The Vallejo Housing
 Authority will continue the owner outreach efforts, including t h e Family Self-Sufficiency
 Program, a property manager meetings, regular presentations to the Solano Board of
 Realtors, and participation in the Napa/Solano Advisory Chapter of the California
 Apartment Association. In addition, the Housing Authority will continue to contract with
 gosection8.com, an online landlord listing service to attract new landlords.
 Responsible Party:        Vallejo Housing Authority / Housing and Community Development
 Time Frame:               Apply for vouchers as they are made available; outreach efforts are

 Policy B.2: Provide financial or other forms of assistance for the development of
 affordable housing units.
 Program B 2.1.1: Below-Market-Rate Financing Program (New Construction)
 Continue to utilize available tax-exempt bond financing, CDBG and HOME funds, Housing
 Authority reserves, and other resources to provide financial assistance for housing affordable
 to extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households. Funds will be prioritized for extremely
 low-income housing based on project feasibility.

 Time Frame:               Apply for affordable housing funds annually
 Funding Source:           State/Federal grant funds and programs
 Program B 2.1.2: Housing Impact Fee
 The development of market rate housing may attract higher income households, which may
 in turn create lower paying jobs in the service and retail industries, resulting in demand for
 affordable housing. Housing Impact Fees are fees exacted from developers to ameliorate
 some of the housing impacts generated from new, market-rate housing and are typically
 based on an assessment, or ‘Nexus’ study of the extent to which the development of new
 market-rate housing generates additional demand for affordable housing, The City will explore
 the feasibility of adopting a Housing Impact Fee that would assist in meeting Vallejo’s “fair
 share” of Regional Housing Needs Allocations. Some of the elements in the Housing Impact
 Fee could include:
         Minimum number of units threshold of 25
         Nexus study to calculate appropriate fee
         Creation of an affordable housing trust fund to be used to preserve and expand the supply
          of affordable housing
 Responsible Party:        Planning Division
 Time Frame:               Present to City Council for consideration and feedback by December 2016.
 Funding Source:           General Fund
 Program B 2.1.3: Commercial Linkage Fee
 Commercial Linkage Fees (also known as ‘Jobs-Housing’ fees) are fees exacted from
 developers to ameliorate some of the housing impacts generated from commercial projects.
 The City will explore the feasibility of a Commercial Linkage Fee that would provide an
 additional source of funding for affordable housing based on demand from construction of
 new commercial developments and the types of employment generated. Linkage fees can
 vary by development type, fee level, exemptions, options/thresholds, terms of payment, and
 results. Some of the elements in the Housing Impact Fee could include:
         Minimum square footage for commercial building subject to fee is 100,000

 Time Frame:               Evaluate and consider a Jobs/Housing Nexus Analysis by June 2017.
 Funding Source:           General Fund, to fund initial exploration.
 Program B.2.1.4 Low-Moderate Income Housing Funds
 Continue to support very low- and extremely low- income housing development with RDA
 Successor Agency funds and proactively seek new funding sources for the development of
 affordable housing. These funds will be administered by the Vallejo Housing Authority and
 coordinated with private and non-profit developers to guide development in targeted areas.

 GOAL C – IMPROVE AND PRESERVE THE CITY’S EXISTING SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE
 HOUSING.
 Policy C.1: Cooperate with other governmental, for-profit, and nonprofit entities to ensure
 that no lower-income residents are adversely impacted by the conversion of existing
 affordable housing projects to market-rate rents.
 Program C 1.1.1: Conversion Monitoring and Response Program
 The Housing and Community Development Division annually monitors the status of units at risk
 of conversion to market rates through the State-mandated process for owners to provide
 notice of planned conversions. If notice is received by the City, the City will immediately
 contact qualified and interested nonprofit organizations to begin developing plans to
 preserve, acquire, or replace the affordable units and notify tenants of affected properties of
 their rights, potential date of conversion, and options. The City will consider additional
 outreach such as hosting workshops and distributing updated information on the web. The City
 will immediately investigate the status of Ascension Arms to ascertain the risk of conversion to
 market rate, and take immediate action to prevent conversion.
 Responsible Party:        Housing and Community Development Division
 Time Frame:               Ongoing; the City will contact owners at least two years prior to expiration
                           date to determine the best approach to keep the units affordable.
 Funding Source:           Annual monitoring, Housing Authority Funds. Assistance with property

 MEANS TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENCY WITH REMAINDER OF GENERAL PLAN
 The City has conducted a review of the proposed Housing Element Update and determined
 that the proposed Update will not create any inconsistencies with the City’s other General Plan
 elements. The City will ensure consistency among General Plan elements as they are updates
 and/or revised, in accordance with State law.
 Based on the policies and programs outlined above, Table 45 illustrates the quantified
 objectives that represent a reasonable expectation of the maximum number of new housing
 units that will be developed, rehabilitated, or conserved and the number of households that
 will be assisted over the next 8 years. The City should be able to facilitate the construction of
 1,151 new units, assist with the rehabilitation of 5-10 units, and work with nonprofits and property
 managers to conserve units that may convert to market-rate rents.

City of Vallejo Housing Element 2015-2023 Update / Adopted May 26, 2015

Subject:       Request for Planning commission Housing Update Hearing
Date:          Friday, March 27, 2015 2:55:37 PM
 Ms Ouse
I am requesting that the Planning Commissioners receive maps ( which I
 understand already exists) showing the concentration of current
 affordable housing in Vallejo (which I had previously requested for the
 study session) and if it exists a map showing the average Household
 income/levels of poverty in the different part of Vallejo. It would be
 helpful if they are included in the Housing Element document.
As several of us at the study session had mentioned the desire to have a
 background section about affordable housing in Vallejo, I am also
 requesting that a background section be created for us to review at the
 hearing. I realize that Staff does not want to poke HCD but I think it is
 hypocritical not to include this information.

 Ms. Ouse
I am requesting that the attached document be provided to the other
 Commissioners and be added to the Staff Report . It is critical that an
 overview be part of the Housing Element.
Robert Schussel PhD.
Background about Vallejo Housing and its affordability
Vallejo has one of the highest rates of poverty in the Bay Area and a correspondingly low AMI (Area
Median Income=$63,166). Vallejo has a higher percentage of residents living in poverty (27% more) than
Solano County and 59% more than San Francisco.
There are 7 to 10 census tracts where poverty levels are 25% or more. These census tracts are also
where a significant number of proposed sites for low income housing is shown. HUD lists 8 qualified
census tracts (on the west side of town-- 50 percent of households have an income less than 60 percent of the
AMGI that are qualified census tracts).
Despite this, housing for lower incomes residents is significantly more affordable in Vallejo than much of
the Bay Area .Median rentals are $1,183 and median family incomes for Vallejo is $63,116. In fact many
of Marin’s poor would be classified as being above Vallejo’s AMI.
Of the 19.9% of renters who are overpaying for their residences (paying more than 30% of income for
resident) nearly 70% are in the very low income category. This suggests that with the exception of those
with incomes less than $17,400 (1 person) to $24,792(4 person) can afford renting in Vallejo. Clearly
Vallejo is much more affordable than most areas in the Bay Area. It also should be noted that less than
1.5% live in severely overcrowded conditions.
Vallejo Housing Authority has over 2,300 vouchers
Multifamily complexes in Vallejo particularly the larger ones have been problematic. Calls for service to
the Vallejo Police Department (see chart) have been extremely high in the past and amenities and
services to residents are lacking even when the multifamily complex has been subsidized.
 One example is Marina Vista which in a 2008 HUD performance review listed as the primary service
offered to residents was free meals at School for their children. Until very recently little if any services
for residents were available at Marina Vista.
 Sereno Village and Avian Glen are two of the newest multifamily complexes. It is believed that the
extremely high number of calls for service when they both opened were due to lack of adequate
security, management and services for residents. In the case of Sereno Village various agencies helped
obtain grants for this complex. In other instances the Developer only wanted to offer services to
residents for 5 years even though subsidized/affordable units were required for up to 50 years.

                                    Over the past 5 years there has been a significant decline in the number of
                                                  Calls for Service at Rent restricted complexes.
                                    Well managed rent restricted properties like Seabreeze have CFS similar to
                                                           non restricted rent complexes

Hi Andrea,
Please see what can be done to include Brendan Riley’s suggestion to expand the
  Multi-Family Crime-Free Program to include single family rental units. He submitted
  text during public commenting at the hearing on March 23rd.
It’s a reasonable request as a policy statement for a Goal Program, from which a
  future ordinance could eventually follow. This should not have an adverse effect on
  the legal requirements of the housing element as it pertains to affordable housing
  issues.
The idea could potentially be included to the following Program with just a few words:
Program G 4.1.2: Crime Prevention Program (Crime Free-Multi-Housing Program)
Or as an additional Program under Goal G.
ANOTHER BIG ISSUE:
Regarding the issue of Balanced Neighborhoods - Goal H, we can expect further
  citizen input as several people have approached me with their concerns that the
  scope of “Balanced Neighborhoods” needs to be expanded to acknowledge the
  existing deplorable near-ghetto conditions in certain areas of town, particularly the
  downtown census tract.

The housing element must somehow acknowledge this undesirable condition in
  Vallejo, and provisions should be made to halt the continued worsening of the
  situation as well as policies to help fix the unbalanced situation that has proven to be
  an unhealthy economic nightmare for everyone concerned. It’s reasonable to
  promote the Downtown Area as an exception where all affordable housing is
  provided only to seniors and disabled in a safe walkable environment.
I find it difficult to accept our city attorney’s interpretation that law prevents any action
  whatsoever to acknowledge, control, or fix the existing unbalance, particularly in the
  downtown census tract. I was told that a group of citizens intend to pursue this
  problem with authorities in Sacramento and present further details in upcoming
  hearings. It’s difficult to imagine that the law can be so restrictive as to promulgate
  the problem.
I would prefer to think the city attorney’s office is diligently trying to find legal ways to
  deal with and fix this problem. If it can’t be fixed, and stated as a Policy Goal, there is
  no serious hope for revitalization and we will continue to have decent and deserving
  low-income residents living in concentrated near ghetto conditions, such as 201
  Maine, along with additional low and very low income families saturating the
  downtown area.
Thanks,
Tony

I have reviewed your comments and will continue this conversation  this evening or tomorrow
  morning.  Reminder, this is a state mandated general plan paper exercise.  The carrot for this
  exercise is transportation dollars from the state and some other available housing money once the
  city’s housing element is certified by HCD (Department of Housing and Community Development). 
  The basic requirements are that you show how  and where the city can produce “affordable”
  housing, which is not defined as only subsidized housing.  It requires the city to provide policies and
  potential programs that can assist in achieving the city’s “fair share” affordable housing numbers,
  very low, low and moderate, which were determined by ABAG who uses a formula that includes
  jobs and other area census data.  
 
I am on my way out the door to a meeting and I am not sure exactly when I will return to my office
  this afternoon.  I will send comments.  Have you looked at other cities’ certified housing elements to
  see how Vallejo’s compares? T

Hi Theresa--
Am marking Tony Adams, a member of the Planning Commission, in on this email. He is very
  supportive of the effort to expand crime-free programs to individual rental properties in
  Vallejo, and to adopt other reforms that will stop the existing situation of poverty ghettos that
  cause so many problems in the city. Time is of the essence since the Planning Commission's
  next -- and final --discussion of the city's housing element plan is April 6. From there, the plan
  goes to the city council for adoption. Again, would welcome your thoughts on this.

Brendan, thank you for follow-up.  I will review and get back to you.  The Crime Free Multi-housing
 program is universal and it can be applied in many different ways.  Take a look at the basic program
 that most municipalities with the program use.  I’m not sure exactly what the hold-up is in Vallejo.  It
 may be cost.  The program is usually funded through the city and police department budgets and
 managed by the police department.  If they had neighborhood policing they could easily coordinate
 both programs.  We can discuss in more detail later.  T

Subject: crime-free programs in Vallejo
 
Hi Theresa--
We spoke briefly at the Vallejo Planning Commission meeting. Would like your thoughts on
  how to get an expanded crime-free program, to include individual rental properties as well as
  multi-unit projects, on the books in Vallejo. I'm on the city's working group updating the
  Vallejo general plan, but that's future stuff and we need something now.
thanks,
Brendan Riley

here's the material I handed out to the commission:
 
Statement of Brendan Riley, 720 Georgia St., Vallejo
Crime-free programs of the sort in place at the 201 Maine St.

 Marina Vista housing project should be mandatory for all
 multi-housing projects in Vallejo. These programs make it
 easier for landlords to evict problem tenants and, more
 importantly, improve the quality of life for the entire
 surrounding neighborhood.
In addition to requiring such programs for multi-unit housing
 projects, they should be at a minimum encouraged and promoted
 by the city for owners of all other rental housing. Again,
 such programs help the landlords and, more importantly,
 enhance the quality of life for neighbors.
These crime-free programs are supported by city staff, but the
 agency that has the job of implementing and expanding them
 lacks the staff to do so. For city leaders to fail to
 adequately budget for these programs is shortsighted and only
 serves to continue a high level of crime and other problems
 that reflect badly not only on specific neighborhoods but the
 entire city as well.
Besides such programs, the city needs to stop permitting high
 levels of subsidized housing in large multi-housing units. The
 Marina Vista project is the principal contributor to a
 subsidized housing level of nearly 60 percent of all rental
 property in the downtown Vallejo area.
The city council recently endorsed a bond funding plan for the
 Seabreeze apartment complex in South Vallejo, and that plan
 allows for a HUD-subsidized level of up to 39 percent of all
 apartments in the complex. While Seabreeze owners say they
 will work to reduce that level, there is no guarantee that
 will happen. The level of subsidized housing in such projects
 shouldn't exceed 20 percent, and the city should actively work
 to spread subsidized housing throughout the city rather than
 restrict it to certain areas -- thereby creating poverty zones
 with numerous, predictable social problems.
While there may be an argument that caps on subsidized housing
 can't be imposed, this is something that should be explored
 fully and not just accepted as fact. Vallejo has gone far, far
 beyond any goal of subsidized housing advocates who seek to
 ensure that low-income families have adequate housing at
 modest rates. This is not an argument against subsidized
 housing, which is a good and necessary concept. But when you
 have subsidized housing levels at well over half of the rental
 housing stock in specific neighborhoods -- a reality in the
 downtown Vallejo and St. Vincent's Hill neighborhoods -- you
 have gone too far. These high levels have a near-ruinous
 impact on neighborhoods, and they must be lowered.
Suggested amendments

Policy A.3: Monitor, remove, or mitigate governmental
 constraints to the production of
housing within the City of Vallejo.
Program A 3.1.1: Removal of Governmental Constraints
The City will review local regulations to remove or mitigate
  constraints on the production of
housing, where possible. These include:
a) Revise the regulation requiring a major conditional use
  permit for multi-family
housing developments with nine or more units to a minor
  conditional use permit.

Require the Planning Commission to expedite action on major
  conditional use permits for multi-family housing developments
  with nine or more units, providing such developments are in
  alignment with a goal of dispersing such developments around
  the city rather than concentrating them in a particular area.
 
 
 
b) Currently "group residential" facilities under five persons
  are permitted with a CUP in
High-Density Residential. The City will allow licensed group
  homes and other
residential care facilities with six or fewer residents by
  right in residential zones
accordance with State law .
c) Assembly Bill (AB) 2634 requires the City to identify zoning
  to encourage and
facilitate housing suitable for extremely low-income
  households, which includes
supportive housing and single-room occupancy (SRO) units. As
  part of the Zoning
Ordinance Update, the City will add a definition of SRO and
  identify a zone, or zones
where SROs will be allowed.

GOAL B – INCREASE THE RANGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

 OPPORTUNITIES.
Policy B.1: The City of Vallejo strives to increase the range
 of housing opportunities
for all residents, including those unable to afford market-rate
 housing within the
community. The city should focus on increasing housing
 opportunities for those unable to afford market-rate housing
 on areas of the city where the amount of existing subsidized
 housing is 20 percent or less of all housing.
Program B 1.1.1: Section 8 Rental Subsidy Program (Tenant-
Based)
Continue to apply to HUD for vouchers for extremely low-, very
 low-, and low-income
households, making extremely low-income households a priority.
 The Vallejo Housing
Authority will continue the owner outreach efforts, including
 Family Self-Sufficiency Program,
a property manager meetings, regular presentations to the
 Solano Board of Realtors, and
participation in the Napa/Solano Advisory Chapter of the
 California Apartment Association.
In addition, the Housing Authority will continue to contract
 with gosection8.com, an online
landlord listing service to attract new landlords. The Housing
 Authority's goals shall include an effort to disperse those
 qualifying for vouchers into housing throughout the city and
 thereby achieve a balance by avoiding high concentrations of
 subsidized housing that are known to exist in certain areas.

 Community

 target and help rehabilitate
existing multi-family complexes, and expand the program to
 include single-family rental homes. As part of the program,
 the City shall work with the Police Department to evaluate
 existing multi-family complexes and existing single-family
  rental homes and provide rehabilitation and surveillance
  requirements (deleting recommendations) to address crime and
  safety and to promote the
 
implementation of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design
  (CPTED) strategies.

Subject: Proposed Goal H Policy Addition to Draft Housing Element
Andrea,
Please circulate this note to the Planning Commissioners and please include it in the
  packet for the April 6th Planning Commission Hearing. If after reviewing the proposed
  Policy and the three corresponding Programs, please determine if can be included in
  the Draft Housing Element presented to the Planning Commission. That would be
  most helpful. Otherwise, it should be discussed at the April 6th hearing and be
  considered for inclusion as appropriate.
The Draft Housing Element needs to accurately address problematic conditions in
  Vallejo by declaring the following measures:
a) Acknowledge current unbalanced conditions that are detrimental to everyone by
  including a background statement in the body of the Draft Housing Element.
b) Promote programs to reduce conditions of over-concentration of affordable housing
  thereby preventing it from getting worse in already supersaturated census tracts.
c) Take affirmative actions to correct unbalanced neighborhoods in census tracts
  currently supersaturated with affordable housing by identifying and allocating land
  elsewhere in the city for potential affordable housing projects.
The following additions need to be added as “Programs” within a new “Policy” in the

 Draft Housing Element to further clarify specific conditions and needs of the City.
GOAL H – GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF BALANCED NEIGHBORHOODS.
Policy H.4: The City of Vallejo will promote a healthy balance of housing within
 neighborhoods and among census tracts by encouraging a well-designed mix
 of affordable and market-rate housing.
Program H 4.1.1: Balanced Concentration of Housing
Within census tracts already oversaturated with affordable housing, the City will
 establish a standard set of criteria to provide clear guidelines for housing project
 proposals that will improve the balance of affordable and market-rate housing.
Program H 4.1.2: Balanced Distribution of Housing
The City will establish a standard set of criteria to provide clear guidelines to
 encourage affordable housing projects be developed in neighborhoods having a
 comparatively low proportion of affordable housing. The City will endeavor to insure
 sufficient land is identified and made available in areas currently with low affordable
 housing levels, by rezoning or setting design criteria standards that will encourage
 such development.
Program H 4.1.3: Balanced Development of Housing Projects
The City will establish a standard set of criteria to provide clear guidelines to
 encourage specific housing projects be financed and developed to provide an
 appropriate mix of affordable and market-rate housing units within all proposed
 projects.
_________________________________________
NOTES ON ALIGNMENT WITH GENERAL PLAN – Currently being developed
The Housing Element is an integral part of the general plan and must be in alignment
 with the overall goals of the general plan and its Guiding Principles.
GENERAL PLAN – COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE
GUIDING PRINCIPLE 4. Caring and Equitable Community   (underlining by myself)
Vallejo treats everyone with compassion, dignity, and fairness and supports stable,
 diverse neighborhoods. It is a caring community where everyone has access to
 services, jobs and housing and shares in the vitality and prosperity of the
 community.
GPWG Stated Intention:
1. Stable, diverse neighborhoods include balanced neighborhoods with a healthy mix of
 affordable and market-rate housing. No neighborhood or census tract should have an
 inordinate amount of affordable housing compared with all other neighborhoods in the city.
Thank you,
Tony Adams

Subject: For Planning Commissioner Packets April 6 Meeting
Planning Commissioners,
Please note the language on page 59 of the draft Housing Element.
Why is 'at risk of conversion' made the issue, when much more serious is the issue of
  poverty-saturated census tracts in Vallejo?
On page 59, three affordable rental units are listed as "at risk of conversion". We
  must be held accountable for creating slum census tracts and convert these housing
  units (Ascension Arms and Casa de Vallejo) into mixed-income housing to
  help reduce the poverty in heavily-subsidized census tracts, dispersing displaced
  residents within lower census tracts.
HUD GUIDELINES PROHIBIT SLUMS, which are created at the 40% poverty level
  (see map one on attachment and HUD data below) We must reduce our 59% census
  tract if we are to ever become a healthy city.
Data to support: 
“Most analysts …use 40-percent poverty as the level above which a
  neighborhood is clearly a ghetto, slum, or underclass neighborhood.
By the early 1990s HUD was already using this rule of thumb, for example, in a
  proposed site and neighborhood regulation that would have prohibited the
  construction of new assisted housing projects in such areas. …

At the other end of the spectrum, the target neighborhoods under the Moving to
  Opportunity (MTO) demonstration—the neighborhoods to which the MTO
  experimental families must move—have poverty rates below 10 percent. This
  definition was chosen because the national poverty rate is approximately 10
  percent….
.For a national benchmark against which to assess the performance of the voucher
  programas a whole, HUD has chosen a 20-percent poverty rate, on the assumption
  that neighborhoods with between 10- and 20-percent persons in poverty still basically
  function as middle-income neighborhoods.” Pages 3-4
http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol5num2/khadduri.pdf
 
"...Analysis of the processes through which members of poor families interact with
  neighbors
and neighborhood-based institutions may show that the income diversity within a
census tract is more important than either the poverty rate or the average income in
  the
tract." Page 4  http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol5num2/khadduri.pdf

improving on the City’s existing physical, social, and economic conditions, but also to
promote sustainability and improve the efficacy of non-automobile transportation in
Vallejo.
The Council directed that a communitywide inclusive process be utilized using both
proven and innovative outreach strategies. Accordingly, a multifaceted, two-year
campaign of public engagement, ranging from face-to-face to entirely digital input
opportunities, brought involvement from community members who represent a broad
cross-section of interests and cultural concerns, and ensured participation from all
population sectors of the city, including underserved communities.
Based on the City Council direction and broad community input, the specific objectives
of the General Plan Update include:
•   Focusing future growth to foster a vibrant Downtown/Waterfront District, strong job
    centers, livable neighborhoods, thriving neighborhood corridors, and retail/
    entertainment clusters that draw visitors from the city and the region.
•   Preserving and enhancing the natural, historic, and scenic resources that make
    Vallejo special.
•   Establishing Vallejo as an attractive place to live, work, shop, and enjoy time off.
•   Providing a balance of employment and housing opportunities locally.
•   Attracting and supporting investment for rehabilitation and new development that
    builds the tax base and provides fiscal stability to fund municipal services.

•  Focusing development and redevelopment near existing and planned transit
   facilities including the Ferry Terminal and Vallejo Transit Station, to make it easier
   and more convenient for residents and people who work in Vallejo to use transit.
•  Strengthening and enhancing connections between neighborhoods and key
   destinations in the community.
•  Providing a range of options for getting around Vallejo, including alternatives to the
   automobile such as biking, walking, and transit.
•  Fostering a stable and diverse local economy built on local strengths in the
   manufacturing, health and life sciences, higher education and tourism sectors.
•  Helping to build strong connections between residents, businesses, community
   groups, and City officials, and encouraging active participation in civic life.
•  Increasing personal safety and emergency preparedness.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Propel Vallejo: General Plan 2040 is built around a series of goals, policies, and actions
that describe what needs to be done to achieve the community’s vision for the future.
“Goals” are end-states; they describe what the community wants to accomplish to
resolve a particular issue or problem. Policies and actions guide day-to-day decision-
making so that there will be continuing progress toward the attainment of goals. Goal,
policy, and action are further defined as follows:
•  Goal: A general, overall, and ultimate desired outcome toward which the City will
   direct effort during the 25-year timeframe of the general plan.
•  Policy: A specific statement that regulates activities in the City, guides decision-
   making, and directs implementing actions to achieve a goal. General Plan policies

AMENDING THE PLAN
Finally, the General Plan is intended to be as dynamic as needed by the Vallejo
community. State law allows up to four general plan amendments per mandatory
element per year. Requested amendments in California tend to be proposed by land
owners seeking to change the land use designation for specific properties. In addition,
the City could amend the General Plan in response to changes in growth and market
demand or for other policy reasons.
Although much of the General Plan represents regulatory guidance and is subject to
this limitation, many items in the General Plan are provided for informational purposes
only. Items included for illustrative purposes, such as photographs, figures, and maps,
do not establish General Plan policy and do not require a formal General Plan
amendment to update or revise; their purpose is to help make the plan more user
friendly. Similarly, typographical corrections and parcel boundary changes may be
made without a formal General Plan amendment. However, modifications to figures
that reflect State or City regulation, such as the General Plan Land Use Map (Map
PF-5) or Circulation map (Map MTC-3) could require a General Plan amendment.
As time passes, the City may find it desirable to revise portions of the General Plan to
reflect land use map changes or other changing circumstances. It generally is
recommended that the City comprehensively review the plan every five years to
determine whether it still reflects the community’s values, as well as the city’s physical
and economic conditions. State law requires California’s Office of Planning Research to
publish the names of jurisdictions with general plans older than 10 years and to notify
the respective City Councils of these jurisdictions.

PLANNING FRAMEWORK
Vallejo is a vibrant and diverse community, located in the San Francisco Bay
                                                                                                     2
Area at a gateway to the inner Bay Area and the Napa Valley. Blessed with scenic
natural beauty and a rich history, Vallejo is the largest city in Solano County and the
tenth largest in the Bay Area (with 118,000 residents in 2016). This chapter presents
the planning context for the Vallejo General Plan, summarizing local history, existing
land use, major recent planning initiatives, and the process for developing the plan. It
also outlines the vision for Vallejo in 2040, encapsulated in the General Plan Land
Use Map.
PLANNING AREA
The city encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles, framed by San Pablo
Bay and the Napa/Sonoma Marshes on the west, the Carquinez Strait to the south,
and unincorporated Solano County open space lands to the northeast (see Map
PF-1). The General Plan considers land within the city limit as well as surrounding
land the City may annex in the future, known as the Sphere of Influence (SOI).
Determined in conjunction with the Solano County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO), the SOI is an area of approximately 4.5 square miles that could
be provided with City services in the future and can therefore be considered as a
potential future boundary of Vallejo. In the future, a General Plan amendment would
address these areas if and when the City considers annexing these areas. Together,
the city limit, unincorporated County islands within the community, and the SOI
comprise the Planning Area.

acres of land to the United States, and for three years the city was the seat of State
government. In the early days, growth was slow, in part because of a shortage of
building materials, but with the establishment of the first west coast US naval facility on
Mare Island in 1854 and the arrival of the transcontinental railroad in 1870, the
population and the local economy began to grow.
With the addition of fill into the Mare Island Strait in the later 1800’s, Vallejo’s main
street moved shoreward from Alameda Street (now also Broadway Street to the north)
to Sonoma Street (now Sonoma Boulevard). The waterfront played a pivotal role in
the history of the city, and its commercial importance brought prosperity to Vallejo.
Figure PF-1 depicts the street pattern during this time period. Rail connections to
agricultural areas made Vallejo the nation's largest wheat shipping port in the late 19th
Century, and in the early 20th Century shipbuilding activities on Mare Island were
spurred by the Spanish American War, the opening of the Panama Canal, and World
War I. The Navy became the primary engine of the local economy during World War II,
and the local population swelled from 20,000 residents in 1940 to nearly 90,000 in
1945, as the shipyard workforce expanded.
Development in the early 20th Century was concentrated near the waterfront, across
the Strait from the shipyard. The downtown area was largely rebuilt with two and three
story buildings between 1910 and 1920; however, the development of highways and
freeways began to change the local land use pattern. State Route (SR) 37, running 21

development of Vallejo's suburban neighborhoods, including Glen Cove with over
9,000 homes, Northgate with more than 2,000 homes and 2 million square feet of
commercial and business development, and Hiddenbrooke with approximately 1,400
homes around a championship golf course. With new residents and constrained
highways, direct ferry service between Vallejo and San Francisco resumed in 1986.
The economic downturn of the 1990s and the closure of the Mare Island Shipyard in
1996 brought the need to reorient the local economy. Activity in the downtown area
generally continued to decline over the next two decades, but Vallejo's strategic
location and the legacy of excellent transportation connections to the region provide a
strong foundation on which to rebuild. Recent investments in the downtown and
waterfront area, including development of the Vallejo Station inter-modal transit
complex, support downtown revitalization and continue to recognize the waterfront as
a critical asset for the community. Attraction and support of a now thriving population

                                                   In 2012, the Vallejo City Council initiated a robust public process to comprehensively
                                                   update the General Plan and develop a renewed vision for the future of the city. A
                                                   critical first step in the process was a community-wide effort to develop Guiding
                                                   Principles. In the spring of 2014, a broad spectrum of community members
                                                   contributed their energy and ideas either in person at one of four public workshops
                                                   held in different locations around town, or via the City's online forum. Collaborating
                                                   successfully with local community organizations, the City also took extra steps to
                                                   include high school students, residents of South Vallejo, and members of local
                                                   community groups in the conversation to make sure everyone had a voice in the
                                                   process. This outreach resulted in the development of 19 Guiding Principles that were
                                                   translated into goals for the General Plan Update and also served to guide

neighborhoods, employment centers, districts, gateways to the community, and the
network of neighborhood corridors that connects the city. It also offers a variety of
opportunities for to reinforce the roles of these community land use pillars, such as by
adding shopping and employment near housing-rich areas and preserving and
expanding housing in close proximity to commercial areas.
 •   Residential neighborhoods form the basic fabric of the community. These are
     areas of the city characterized primarily by housing, parks, and community
     facilities. Neighborhood boundaries are based on the historic development
     pattern, subdivision boundaries, and local tradition. Each neighborhood in Vallejo
     has its own distinct character, defined by the buildings, streets, and public places,
     as well as by the people who live there. The older residential neighborhoods
     closest to downtown, typically built before 1940, tend to have a more walkable
     grid street pattern with a broader mix of housing types and some small
     storefronts occupied by local businesses. Newer residential neighborhoods
     outside the historic core tend to have more auto-oriented, curvilinear street
     patterns with detached, single family homes.
 •   Employment centers are areas of the city with significant concentrations of
     businesses and jobs. They tend to be well-served by public transit and
     transportation infrastructure, providing employees with a range of commute
     options. While the primary focus of activity in these areas is employment, they
     also provide public open spaces, plus cafes and daily services catering to the
     lunchtime and after-work needs of employees:

rights-of-way. Assisted living facilities and neighborhood-oriented retail are conditional
uses in this designation requiring permits. Co-location of multiple public facilities on a
single site is encouraged where it will increase access to community services while
offering cost savings and other benefits to community service providers. The
maximum permitted FAR in the PF designation is from 0.1 to 1.0, determined on a
case-by-case basis in consideration of the neighborhood context.
GENERAL PLAN AND THE DEVELOPMENT CODE
The General Plan land use designations anticipate and accommodate both
conventional and form-based zoning districts to govern improvements to property.
Conventional zoning tends to favor a particular land use, and accordingly applies
within Residential; Business and Industry; and Community designations. Mixed Use
areas, including older Residential areas, are generally better suited to form-based
zoning, which emphasizes the placement and design of buildings, as opposed to land
use, and therefore tends to be more applicable in more urbanized areas.
Table PF-1 describes the overall relationship between the General Plan and the Zoning
Code, referred to as the Development Code. Table PF-2 describes prevalent
development patterns in Vallejo and associated zoning approaches—either
conventional or form-based.
2-22 Vallejo General Plan 2040

TABLE PF-1 General Plan Relationship to Development Code
 The General Plan establishes a broad vision and framework for land use in Vallejo, and provides policies and actions to manage development through 2040. The
 Development Code (previously titled Zoning Code) implements the Plan with specific standards that regulate development today. The two must be internally consistent. The
 functions of these two planning tools are presented below.

TABLE PF-2 Development Pattern and Corresponding Development Code
 Neighborhoods in Vallejo include those developed with a traditional street-grid pattern, such as Downtown and its surroundings, as well as other areas that reflect a
 curvilinear pattern, such as eastern Vallejo. The City’s Development Code incorporates both Form-Based and Conventional zoning districts and regulations that
 accommodate both types of land use patterns.

COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE
A community starts with its people. They need to be healthy, safe, and
                                                                                                    3
engaged for the community to thrive. This chapter addresses a range of issues related
to community well-being and includes strategies for strengthening bonds between
community members. Community bonds are the foundation for positive change.
When people are connecting with one another and making choices to improve their
lives and their community, it builds a sense of belonging that enhances the overall
health and livability of the community. The focus of this chapter is on fostering a
climate of collaboration and opportunities for collective impact. It is organized around
five key goals that represent the priorities of Vallejoans: Healthy Community; Safe City;
Strong Community Bonds; Active Participatory Community; and Caring, Equitable
Community.
Community well-being is also addressed in other chapters of the plan. Factors affecting
well-being such as access to natural open space, quality of the built environment, and
land use compatibility are addressed in Chapter 4, Nature and Built Environment.
Economic vitality, education, training, and employment are addressed in Chapter 5,
Economy, Education, and Training. Active transportation and roadway safety are
addressed in Chapter 6, Mobility, Transportation, and Connectivity. Where policies and
actions in other chapters in the plan have co-benefits that will help achieve the goals
of this chapter, connections with those chapters are highlighted and cross-referenced.

Vallejo is a culturally and ethnically diverse community. Nearly one in three residents
was born outside of the US, and the population has a nearly equal share of Hispanic,
White, African American, and Asian (largely Filipino) residents, as shown in Chart CP-1.
As noted in Table CP-1 and Chart CP-2, Vallejo also has a growing young adult
population, with the proportion of residents between the ages of 18 and 35 increasing
much faster than the Bay Area as a whole since 2000, and the level of educational
attainment, while lower than the Bay Area average, is improving. These factors
represent strengths on which to build. With lower household incomes than
households in the County and region, a challenge for community building in Vallejo
will be to empower all community members so that they can share more equally in
regional prosperity in the future.                                                                  Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.

high crime areas. As Vallejo grows in the coming years, the challenge will be to remain
alert and responsive to changes that influence crime prevention efforts.
Design of the built environment can also help prevent crime, reduce the fear of crime,
and improve the quality of life in urban areas. Research has shown that the most
effective deterrent to criminal activity is the risk of being caught, and design of public
spaces that places more eyes on the street and limits access points can create safer
environments. Strategies for Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
(CPTED) include locating windows to overlook sidewalks and parking lots, increasing
pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and selectively installing fencing, landscaping, or lighting
to control access. Well-maintained buildings and grounds also signal alert, active
owners and can deter criminal activity.

The City has adopted a standard of 4.25 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents for
planning purposes and requires developers to provide parkland or pay impact fees of
equivalent value when new homes are approved. Table CP-2 shows an inventory of
Vallejo parks, together with existing acreage. With 921.17 acres of parks and open
space within the city limit, Vallejo is meeting its parkland standard.
The distribution of parkland throughout the community is relatively balanced. As
shown on Map CP-3, most residents live within a half-mile walk of a park or school
facility. GVRD has identified underserved neighborhoods and will pursue park
development to address those needs as funding is available in the future. Community
engagement and partnership is key to achieving the vision of this Plan; the following

 ENVIRONMENT
Goal NBE-1:	 Beautiful City: Preserve and enhance the natural, historic, and scenic resources that
             make Vallejo special.
Goal NBE-2:	 A Place Where People Want to Be: Establish Vallejo as an attractive place to live, work,
             shop, and enjoy time off.
Goal NBE-3:	 Pride in Identity: Nurture distinct districts and neighborhoods that contribute to a sense
             of local pride.
Goal NBE-4:	 Iconic Waterfront: Make the waterfront a centerpiece of the community and the region.
Goal NBE-5:	 Hazard Protection: Protect life and property from natural and human-made hazards.
NATURE AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Vallejo's local setting is a major asset for the community. The urbanized area of the
                                                                                                             4
city is ringed by important areas of natural open space, wetlands, and rolling grassland
hills. Waterways, so integral to the character of the community, provide opportunities
for scenic, recreational, and commercial enjoyment, and Vallejo's historic role as a
State capital and a cradle of industry in northern California have left a legacy of
valuable cultural heritage. Careful stewardship of all these resources is essential for a
beautiful, thriving city. The focus of this chapter is on preserving and enhancing these
assets and managing growth in a way that strengthens sense of place and builds local
pride in identity. The chapter is organized around five key goals that represent the
priorities of Vallejoans: Beautiful City, A Place Where People Want to Be, Pride in
Identity, Iconic Waterfront, and Hazard Protection.
Aspects of resource stewardship and growth management are addressed in other
chapters of the plan. Air quality, clean water, and access to green space are addressed
in Chapter 3, Community & People. Restoration and revitalization of cultural and
historic resources for tourism and economic development is addressed in Chapter 5,
Economy, Education, and Training, along with City-led sustainability initiatives.
Chapter 6, Mobility, Transportation, and Connectivity addresses growth management
by promoting transit-oriented development and eco-mobility. Where policies and
actions in other chapters in the plan have co-benefits that will help achieve the goals
of this chapter, connections with those chapters are highlighted and cross-referenced.

The natural and physical environment around us has a direct impact on mood and
sense of well-being. Access to nature, whether outside the city or in urban green
spaces, can have a calm, restorative impact, and well-designed buildings and public
spaces can be inspiring. The following policies and actions are designed to enhance
the natural and urban environment in Vallejo and the Planning Area.
NATURAL RESOURCES
Natural resources include not only the plants, trees, animals, fish, birds, and
microorganisms present in the urban and natural environment around us, but also the
water, soil, habitats, and ecosystems that make up the ecological community in which
we live. The richer the diversity of life around us, the greater the opportunity for
healthy living, economic development, and adaptive responses to new challenges such
as climate change.

damage to structures and foundations not designed to resist the forces generated by
earthquakes. Underground utility lines are also susceptible where they lack sufficient
flexibility to accommodate the seismic ground motion. With a seismic event of this
magnitude, most parts of Vallejo are expected to experience “very strong” shaking.
Under certain circumstances, ground shaking can temporarily transform an otherwise
solid, granular material to a fluid state. This process is known as liquefaction, and
generally occurs in areas with moist, fine-grained sediment or fill. Liquefaction is a
serious hazard because it can cause buildings to subside and suffer major structural
damage. Liquefaction is most often triggered by seismic shaking, but it can also be
caused by improper grading, landslides, or other factors. Parts of the planning area are

Goal EET-1:	 Strong, Stable, and Diverse Economy: Cultivate a strong, stable, and diverse local
             economy.
Goal EET-2:	 Good Jobs, Education, and Training: Promote workforce development to build the local
             economy.
Goal EET-3:	 Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Successful Local Businesses: Foster innovation

Goal EET-4:	 Sustainable Economic Development: Pursue economic development that enhances
             equitable local wealth growth, improves quality of life, and respects the natural environment.
ECONOMY, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING
Prosperity for Vallejo means a local economy that creates well-paying jobs,
                                                                                                               5
revitalizes the downtown and neighborhoods, and grows revenues to pay for critical
public services. The purpose of the Economy, Education, and Training chapter is to
establish a framework under the General Plan that empowers Vallejo to undertake
bold economic development, education, and training initiatives that will position
Vallejo as an appealing location in the dynamic San Francisco Bay Area region.
Enhancing Vallejo’s presence as an economic hub depends on retaining, supporting,
and attracting a diverse range of businesses that will sustain the local economy despite
the whims of market forces. It also requires preparing the local workforce for
meaningful employment, including through professional and vocational programs for
young Vallejoans. Finally, the city’s success as an economic engine requires nurturing
local innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, while ensuring that business activities
benefit the community and the environment.
Vallejo’s economic development and prosperity also involves a variety of initiatives
addressed in Chapter 4, Nature and Built Environment and Chapter 6, Mobility,
Transportation, and Connectivity. Where policies and actions in other chapters in the
plan have co-benefits that will help achieve the goals of this chapter, connections with
those chapters are highlighted and cross-referenced.

 Valley’s path-breaking environmental and energy initiatives by targeting and
 attracting businesses developing new technologies and products to save energy and
 lower humanity’s impact on the environment. This is one way of thinking about
 sustainable economic development, but there is another meaning too: the benefits

facilitate this sharing through both educational and funding-assistance programs.

Goal MTC-1:	Regional Transportation Hub: Make Vallejo a regional transportation hub for people and
            goods.
Goal MTC-2:	Mobile Community: Enhance local transportation options and maintain a safe,
            convenient, and sustainable local transportation system.
Goal MTC-3:	Interconnected Community: Improve connections within and between Vallejo’s
            neighborhoods for all travel modes.

MOBILITY, TRANSPORTATION, & CONNECTIVITY
Vallejo is uniquely positioned as a gateway to the inner Bay Area and the Napa

Valley, with excellent access by road, rail, and water. These connections to the region,
highlighted on Map MTC-1, offer a variety of strategic advantages. Locally, freeways
and arterials provide quick access through town, but improving connections between
neighborhoods and destinations in Vallejo is a key consideration for the future. Closing
gaps in the bicycle and trail network, improving the pedestrian realm, and expanding
the range of efficient, safe, and easy options for getting around will enhance the
quality of life for all community members. The focus of this chapter is on
strengthening physical connections to the region and within the community. It is
organized around three key goals that represent the priorities of Vallejoans: Regional
Transportation Hub, Mobile Community, Interconnected Community.
Aspects of connectivity and mobility also are addressed in other chapters of the plan.
Factors affecting social connections and access to community services are addressed in
Chapter 3, Community and People. Visual connections and interrelationship with land
uses are addressed in Chapter 4, Nature and Built Environment. The economic
advantages of Vallejo's regional connectivity and the benefits of improved mobility
within the community are addressed in Chapter 5, Economy, Education, and Training.
Where policies and actions in other chapters in the plan have co-benefits that will help
achieve the goals of this chapter, connections with those chapters are highlighted and
cross-referenced.

REGIONAL GOODS TRANSPORT
International trade, transportation, warehousing, and logistics are important drivers of
the regional economy, and the MTC’s Regional Goods Movement Plan outlines a long
range strategy to promote the effectiveness of these “industries of opportunity.”
Vallejo’s location within the regional goods movement infrastructure (seaports, air
cargo airports, rail lines and terminals, and highways) includes seaport connections to
the Port of Oakland, the nation’s fifth-highest volume port for container traffic, the Port
of West Sacramento, and the Port of Stockton. Currently, there is limited materials
transfer and shipping, mostly related to marine contractors performing work in other
Bay Area locations. The infrastructure on Mare Island continues to support ship repair
and the transportation of commodities and materials. South of downtown, a wharf at

The local transportation system should promote mobility and accessibility for all users,
with a focus on traffic safety and convenient, efficient travel between destinations in
Vallejo. Enhancing mobility and connectivity for transit, bicycles, and pedestrians will
also help reduce congestion and pollution while improving public health.
SAFE STREETS
Traffic safety for all users of the street system is a top priority in Vallejo. Education for
motorists and bicyclists is critically important for promoting roadway safety and
ensuring informed behavior on shared street systems. Additionally, the identification of
high-collision intersections is key to reducing collision rates. Data in the Statewide
Integrated Traffic Records System indicates that collisions in Vallejo tend to be
concentrated on Sonoma Boulevard, Broadway Street, Alameda Street, and Tennessee
Street, which are some of the most heavily travelled roadways in the city. The majority
of bicycle collisions involve riders between the ages of 8 and 16 around schools, while

   has the priority. Of the competing modes, the pedestrian mode is most important,
   since almost all transit trips begin and end with a walking trip.
•  Sonoma Boulevard – Designated as State Route 29 and owned and operated by
   Caltrans, Sonoma Boulevard is a key north-south connector in Vallejo that connects
   I-80 to SR 37 and points north in Solano and Napa counties. While vehicular (auto,
   bus, and truck) modes have traditionally been the priority on State Routes, Caltrans
   has adopted a Complete Streets program that mandates a balanced modal
   approach to planning for all state routes, and the Sonoma Boulevard Specific Plan
   identifies a variety of development features to support non-vehicle travel along the
   corridor between Curtola Parkway and Redwood Street.

INTRODUCTION
The General Plan is intended to be an accessible and user-friendly tool to engage the
community in its implementation. The General Plan update process included a robust
outreach process that informed the development of goals, policies, and actions, which
resulted in identification of two communitywide unifying subjects that are especially
key to achieving the vision encompassed in the Plan: Arts and Culture and Community
Health. This index provides a tool for community members, project applicants, City
staff, and partner agencies to easily and efficiently locate those key topics and identify
the interrelationships among them.
