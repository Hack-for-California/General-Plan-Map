CHAPTER 3: CIRCULATION
                       ELEMENT
Introduction
The Circulation Element is second only to the Land Use
Element in terms of importance to the community. It has
a significant impact on the residents of Firebaugh because
it delineates the routes by which people will travel within
and through Firebaugh. The Element also identifies the
different types of circulation routes in the community,
such as roadways, bikepaths and railroads. Other modes
of transportation are also addressed, such as pedestrian     Section 65302 (b) of the State
(walking), and air travel.                                   Government Code indicates that the

improvements be consistent with the General Plan             facilities.
(Friends of “B” Street.et.al. v. City of Hayward, et. al.,
106 Cal. App. 3d 988 {1980}), there must be a correlation
between the circulation and land use elements. Generally,
correlation is achieved by using the same population and
land use projections for each element.
The Firebaugh Circulation Element is composed of four
sections. They are:
1)      Existing conditions;
2)      circulation map;
3)      circulation goals, policies and action programs; and
4)      roadway cross-section designs.

Existing Conditions
In addition to the information contained in this chapter,
additional circulation information is also provided in Part
2 (Community Profile”), of the General Plan.
Early Circulation System
Firebaugh’s original road system was based on a grid
pattern that was laid out parallel and perpendicular to the
railroad. The original townsite features a grid running
between 13th Street on the south and the Poso Canal on
the north, the railroad on the west and the channel of the
San Joaquin River to the east.
The early streets had rights-of-way of 80 feet and alleys
that were 20 feet wide. Each block generally measured
400 feet by 300 feet.
                                                                                                        Map 3-1

roadways has been constructed in the                                                                                         Po

– four lanes, median divider, curbs, gutters, sidewalks,
parkways and shade trees.
Two other roadways are classified as “Arterials” in
Firebaugh:
-        Nees Avenue intersects Highway 33 in the center
         of the community and proceeds west out of city
         limits and connects to Interstate 5, about 18
         miles west of Firebaugh.           This roadway
         generally features one travel lane and a parking
         lane in each direction.
-        13th Street connects to Highway 33 one block
         south of Nees Avenue and proceeds east across
         the San Joaquin River into Madera County,
         where it becomes Avenue 7-1/2. This roadway
         generally features one travel lane and a parking
         lane in each direction. Taken together, Nees
         Avenue and 13th Street combine to form an east-
         west regional route through the City.
Other major roadways are classified as “Collector”
streets. Major east/west collectors in Firebaugh include:
-        Bullard Avenue
-        Morris Kyle Drive
-        Saipan Street
-        Behymer Avenue
Major north/south Collector roadways include:
-        Washoe Avenue
-        O Street
-        P Street
-        Clyde Fannon Road
-        Lyon Avenue
-        P Street
Local Roadways
Local roadways provide for internal traffic movement
within residential neighborhoods. Adjacent property has
direct access to these types of roadways. Local roadways
typically contain two travel lanes and two parking lanes.

Alleys
Alleys provide rear access to residential dwellings in
older neighborhoods and to commercial buildings in the
downtown area. Typically, many alleys contain above-
(electricity and CATV) and below-ground utilities (sewer
and water lines). They also serve as a route for trash
pickup.
Firebaugh has an extensive alley system – primarily in the
central downtown area. Most of the alleys are 20 feet
wide and are unpaved.
Railroads
Firebaugh is traversed by the Fresno-Los Banos branch of
the Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad parallels (and is
west of) Highway 33. The railroad currently has light
volumes of traffic (one to two trains per day) primarily
carrying agricultural goods. There is only one street
crossing of the railroad in Firebaugh – at Nees Avenue.
This single crossing is a concern, particularly from an
emergency response perspective. If a train were stopped
on the tracks, emergency vehicles would have to find
some other way to cross the railroad in the event of an
emergency.
Public Transportation
The Fresno County Rural Transit Agency (FCRTA)
generally provides transit services Monday through
Friday during regular business hours to the elderly,
disabled, low-income, and general public within each of
the thirteen rural incorporated cities of Fresno County,
including Firebaugh.
Firebaugh Transit (operated by FCRTA) provides
multiple scheduled round trip inter-city service through
Firebaugh, Mendota and Kerman to the Fresno-Clovis
Metropolitan Area (FCMA).          The service operates
between the hours of 7:45 AM and 5:45 PM Monday
through Friday.
Air Service
Firebaugh Muncipal Airport is a general aviation airport
owned and operated by the City of Firebaugh. The airport
features one runway that is about 60 feet wide and 3,100
feet long. This facility is used primarily by agricultural

spraying (crop duster) services and also houses several
private aircraft. There is no airline service to the airport.
Airline service is available at Fresno-Yosemite
International Airport (FYI), located in Fresno, about 40
miles east of the city. FYI provides regularly scheduled
passenger and freight service and it furnishes private and
company aircraft hangars and tie-downs.
Bike Paths and Trails
Formal bike paths and pedestrian trails in Firebaugh are
limited to the existing 3/4 mile long trail along the San
Joaquin River, north and south of the 13th Street Bridge.
This trail also has an on-street spur that runs along the
south side of 9th Street between the Q Street (adjacent to
the river) and O Street (to the plaza at West Hills               Aircraft parked at Firebaugh Airport
College). Other than that, most streets have four foot
wide sidewalks for pedestrians.           Residents of the
community have expressed their desire for more
pedestrian facilities in Firebaugh.

ISSUE ONE: Traffic
Even if a roadway is operating at a Level of Service
(LOS) A, which means that traffic flows freely along the
street with little or no congestion, people may still
                                                               1      Traffic
complain that there is too much traffic on the street -
especially if it is their neighborhood street. While it is
difficult to improve on a roadway that has a LOS of A,
the city can embrace goals that will minimize traffic
impacts on the community.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Ensure that streets in Firebaugh are not
       congested.
II.    Ensure that traffic on Firebaugh’s streets
       operates in an efficient and safe manner.
III.   Provide for long-term financing for street
       construction and maintenance.
       1.     A level of service C will be the desirable
              minimum service level in Firebaugh at
              which arterial and collector segments will
              operate. A level of service of B will be the
              desirable minimum service level in
              Firebaugh at which intersections will
              operate.
              a.      The City will program into its 5-year
                      capital budget street improvements
                      that will ensure the specified LOS is
                      not exceeded in the city limits. Funds
                      for these street improvement projects
                      will come from gas tax and
                      transportation funds.

ISSUE TWO: Arterials
Firebaugh has three roadways that are designated
arterials:
-
-
      Highway 33;
      Nees Avenue; and
                                                                                                      2                                                 Arterials
-     13th Street (which transitions to Avenue 7-1/2 in
      Madera County).
Arterial roadways carry the greatest amount of traffic in
Firebaugh. These roadways carry traffic that may be
traveling at a high rate of speed and they may carry a
significant amount of truck traffic, which makes these
roadways noisy. Because of these characteristics, the
design, location and types of land uses developed
adjacent to these roadways must be carefully planned.
Most persons in Firebaugh will travel on an arterial at
least once a day. Travel efficiency on these roadways is
important for two reasons:          (1) congested traffic
conditions cause the traveler to be late to their destination
and (2) congestion creates greater amounts of air
pollution, already a significant environmental problem in                                                                       Map 3-3
the Valley. Traffic that moves smoothly and efficiently

   3.   Left turn lanes should be constructed on
        arterials where they intersect with other
        arterials or collectors.
        a.      The City Engineer and Public Works
                Department will coordinate to ensure
                that left turn lanes are installed as
                development occurs. For already-
                developed neighborhoods, the City’s
                circulation impact fee should be set to
                fund installation of left turn lanes.
        Time Frame:         Construct left turn lanes in
                            established areas within
                            five years. Review and

   4.   Driveways that intersect with arterials
        should be kept to a minimum and, if
        possible, should be reduced or eliminated
        when development occurs along an arterial
        roadway.

                the Planning and Engineering
                Departments        will     discourage

   5.   Curbing at the intersections of arterial and
        collector streets should be painted red at
        least 50 feet in all directions from the corner
        curb radius in order to provide sufficient
        sight-line for traffic pulling into the
        intersection and to ensure the safety of
        pedestrians (see Figure 3-2).
        a.      The Public Works Department will
                ensure that curbing is properly
                painted.

Next to arterials, collectors carry the greatest amount of                                                                         Map 3-4

Goals, Objectives, Policies
I.    Provide efficient and safe circulation access to
      all parts of Firebaugh.
      1.     Collector roadways will be constructed
             consistent      with      street   cross-section
             illustrations contained in Figure 3-3 of the
             Circulation Element. Flexibility may be
             provided to allow for the installation of
             landscaped       median       dividers,   where
             warranted. The City recognizes it is not
             always possible to attain the street design
             standards contained in Figure 3-3, because
             of existing development or other constraints
             along portions of the roadway.
             a.      The City’s standard specifications
                     manual shall be revised to show street
                     cross section that are illustrated in
                     Figure 3-3. Until that time, the
                     design standards in Figure 3-3 shall
                     be utilized.

   2.   Driveways that intersect with collectors
        should be kept to a minimum and, if
        possible, should be reduced when
        development occurs along this type of

ISSUE FOUR: Local Streets and Lanes
Local streets (sometimes referred to as “Residential
Streets”) are perhaps the most important roadways in a
community. These are the streets that most people live
                                                                  4          Local Streets and

on. They form the nucleus of the neighborhood. Well-
designed, local streets can be an asset to the
neighborhood. Poorly-designed and situated local streets
can become a nuisance, and worse, a safety hazard.
Local Street Design
Recent studies have suggested that current street design
standards may be creating dangerous streets. Wide
residential streets tend to encourage higher speeds,
making streets less safe. Properly-designed, narrower
streets cause drivers to slow down.
                                                                Figure 4-5: A Tale of Two Streets…
In addition, current design standards do not require street
trees. Research indicates that heavily-shaded streets
further cause drivers to slow down. In addition, shaded
streets generate much less heat, thereby helping to cool
the neighborhood. Shaded pavement also tends to last
longer. Finally, studies have shown that well-maintained
shady streets have higher property values.
Traffic on local streets can also be made safer through
shorter block lengths – less than 600 feet in length.
Studies have found that long blocks tend to cause
motorists to drive faster to reach the next intersection.
                                                               Current street design standards (shown
Subdivision Street Patterns                                    above) result in wide, unshaded (hot) streets
                                                               where traffic is likely to speed. Proposed
Most new subdivisions are designed with circuitous street      standards (below) create shady, cool,

traffic (which in turn, theoretically reduces noise and
improves safety). While well-intentioned, these designs
usually result in circuitous travel patterns that concentrate
traffic onto certain entry/exit streets within individual
subdivisions.
The end result are neighborhoods where residents are
required to use the automobile to make all of their trips
around a community. Walking and cycling become
frustratingly inconvenient.
Older neighborhoods in the original parts of cities were
designed almost exclusively using a grid (or modified

subdivisions were almost unknown in city design until the

1950’s.
Properly designed, subdivisions designed with a better-
connected roadway pattern can improve circulation by
providing a variety of routes for motorists, pedestrians
and bicycles.      If the connectivity is fine enough,
automobile traffic is diffused so that individual streets are
not over-impacted by traffic. A well-connected street
pattern also gives emergency responders multiple routes
to gain access to a site.
Requiring narrower, tree-lined streets can work to further
slow vehicle speeds. In fact, all of these design
techniques must “go together”. Other mechanisms such
as shorter block lengths, roundabouts and stop signs can
further tame neighborhood traffic.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Revise local street standards to ensure
       residential streets are safe and effective.
II.    Require subdivision designs that utilize highly
       connected street patterns, limiting cul-de-sacs to
       situations only where necessary.
       1.     Design standards for Local Streets are
              shown in Figure 3-7. Blocks shorter than
              600 feet may utilize narrower streets, with a
              right of way of 56 feet and 32 feet of
              pavement. Except where approved by the
              City Engineer, no block shall exceed 800
              feet in length.
              a.      The City’s standard specifications
                      manual shall be revised to show street
                      cross section that are illustrated in
                      Figure 3-7. Until that time, the
                      design standards in Figure 3-7 shall
                      be utilized.                                Subdivisions should be designed with a

                                                                               5                          Intersections
Simpler methods like adding turn lanes or stop signs can
work well in a small community like Firebaugh.
Another way of controlling intersections is the modern
roundabout. For hundreds of years Europe and Mexico
have used roundabouts to control traffic at intersecting
streets. Modern roundabouts are now being used in a
number of American communities, as an effective way to
control traffic at intersections. In addition, the interior
portion of the roundabout can be designed to include a
visual feature, like landscaping, trees or even a fountain
or statue.     The City should consider the use of
roundabouts, particularly at the intersection of local
streets within new development.

ISSUE SIX: Truck Traffic & Industrial Streets
Truck traffic can adversely affect a community and
specifically residential neighborhoods because of the
noise and vibrations they generate. Further, heavy trucks
                                                                6     Truck Traffic &
                                                                      Industrial Streets
can damage local roadways because of their weight.
However, trucks are an essential ingredient for the local
economy in terms of employment and movement of goods
and products. In Firebaugh, the local economy would
collapse if packing houses, cold storage plants and other
non-agricultural industries could not receive trucks at
their locations.
The parking of trucks is a particularly challenging issue.
Firebaugh has a number of residents who drive trucks but
have no place to park them – except along major
roadways, such as Highway 33. The community has
voiced concerns about the negative appearance of
numerous large trucks parked along the highway and
would like to seek a more attractive solution for this issue.
The Circulation Element also establishes an “Industrial
Street” design standard.          Streets incorporating this
standard are intended to be constructed to serve future
development in Firebaugh’s Industrial zones.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.      Establish truck routes through Firebaugh that
        are safe and not disruptive to residential
        neighborhoods, schools and businesses.
II.     Facilitate the movement of truck traffic through
        and around Firebaugh.
        1.     Identify truck routes on the Firebaugh
               Circulation Element map.
        2.     Prohibit through-truck traffic on streets that
               are not identified as truck routes.
               a.     The Public Works Department shall
                      install truck route signage.

ISSUE SEVEN: Parking
The success of commercial businesses is often dependent
                                                               7
upon parking. Parking must be in close proximity to the
business, it must be safe, and should well designed - good           Parking
lighting, wide stalls, shaded, and easy access.
For other uses, such as public facilities, churches,
apartments and industries, adequate on-site parking is
important so as to ensure that surrounding land uses are
not adversely impacted by persons parking their vehicles
in front of other establishments or residences.
At the same time, project must be designed so that
parking does not visually dominate or degrade the site.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Provide adequate         public    parking    in  the
       downtown.
II.    Ensure that adequate off-street parking is
       provided by new development.
III.   Encourage the joint use of parking lots. Certain
       types of businesses closely located can share a
       single parking lot. For instance, an office open
       during the day may be able to share a common
       parking lot with a restaurant open only during
       the evening. In that way, less land is needed to
       be devoted to parking and overall expenses to
       operate businesses can be reduced.
IV.    Design parking lots that are safe, visually
       pleasing and convenient.
       1.      Off-street parking for new developments in
               the downtown shall be located to the rear of
               buildings (or to the side of buildings, where
               they can be adequately screened).
       a.      The to-be-prepared Design Guidelines shall
               illustrate properly designed downtown
               parking lots.

ISSUE EIGHT: Bikepaths and Pedestrian Pathways
                                                                     Bikepaths and
Bicycling and walking are important forms of
transportation. In a small community like Firebaugh,
bicycling or walking can provide a realistic way to make
                                                              8      Pedestrian
                                                                     Pathways
meaningful trips around the community. For example, the
downtown is easily reached by a relatively short bicycle
ride, and by walking for many neighborhoods.
When added to the local bike and pedestrian traffic
generated by school-aged children, it is important to
properly locate and design Firebaugh’s bikepath and trail
system.
By encouraging residents to walk in Firebaugh, personal
contact is promoted. This interaction makes for a more
close-knit community in addition to promoting a more
healthy lifestyle.
The way new subdivisions and commercial developments
are designed and laid out is critical to making walking and
cycling feasible. Subdivisions with numerous cul-de-sacs
and perimeter walls that enclose streets can make walking
and cycling less feasible, because residents must walk or
cycle longer distances to get to their destination. When
this happens, people tend to prefer to use their
automobiles. This situation can be reversed by requiring a
highly connected pattern of streets in new development.
Walking and cycling can be further encouraged by
requiring street trees for shade.
Firebaugh has the advantage of having the San Joaquin
River along the east side of the City. This waterway
presents the opportunity to create a pathway along the
river for use by pedestrians, bicyclists and even persons
who ride horses. The City has already constructed the first
portion of a pathway along the river. Extending this
pathway is of critical importance.
Finally, the numerous irrigation canals that traverse the
City make Firebaugh a city of water. In the past,
development has “turned its back” on these canals,
making these waterways a neglected part of the
community.        Some valley cities have seized the
opportunity to make irrigation canals a part of the City’s
open space and recreation system by requiring new
development to “front onto” canals, with the installation
of walking trails and landscaping paralleling canal banks.
This Circulation Element proposes that future

Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Encourage residents to walk and ride bikes for
       good health as well as for environmental
       reasons.
       1.    Develop a trail and bike path plan for the
             City of Firebaugh.
             a.     The Circulation Element map
                    designates bike routes and pedestrian

                    bike and pedestrian pathways that are
                    designated on the Circulation
                    Element Map, where the development
                    abuts the route of the pathway. For
                    other portions of pathways, apply for
                    state and federal funds to finance the
                    construction of the pathway system.

transit may be the only means of travel. For a person who
is concerned about polluting the air, riding a bus or bike
may be their way of minimizing an impact on the
environment.

                      loading zones at appropriate locations.
                      Loading zones should be shaded with
                      shelters and/or shade trees. Consider
                      designating marked loading zones in

ISSUE ELEVEN:             Traffic Calming, Landscaped
Medians and Street Trees
Some of the great streets in the world are distinguished by
landscaped medians or a boulevard of street trees. These
                                                                11         Traffic Calming
features “soften” the appearance of the street, provide
shade and cooling for pedestrians and provide a positive
image. Studies have shown that lands along tree-shaded
streets frequently enjoy higher property values.
Firebaugh has started on its own “great boulevard” with
the landscaped median on Highway 33. Additional
landscaping improvements are scheduled to be installed
on this street in the near future. Over time this street will
mature into a beautiful tree-shaded avenue. Highway 33
will hopefully be able to serve as a model for how to
design and landscape other streets in Firebaugh.

        streets in Firebaugh.

ISSUE TWELVE: Airport
Firebaugh owns and operates the Firebaugh Municipal
Airport. Situated on approximately 24 acres, the airport
features one runway approximately 3,100 feet long and 60
                                                               12      Airport
feet wide. The runway is lighted but has no control
tower. Typical users include crop dusters and other
private passenger craft.
The airport represents an important circulation feature of
the City and also an economic tool. However, as a land
use feature, the airport can be a poor neighbor, in terms of
noise and safety concerns. In addition, the location of the
airport prohibits any kind of residential expansion (and
hampers commercial development) on the west side of the
city. The General Plan Committee voiced its desire to see
the City undertake an analysis of relocating the aiport
further to the west. This would reduce noise and aircraft
accident exposure to the City and allow for greater
residential development on the west side of the
community. The City of Coalinga serves as a precedent,
having relocated its airport away from the urban area in
the early 1990’s
I.     Continue to maintain the airport to provide
       appropriate and adequate airport facilities

ISSUE THIRTEEN: Railroad
The Fresno-Los Banos line of the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad runs through Firebaugh, west of State Highway
33. This track provides for the transportation of primarily
                                                                13                                      Railroad
agricultural goods and commodities. Typically one
freight train per day passes through Firebaugh. In this
fashion, the rail line is an important economic asset to the
community.
While the railroad offers an economic benefit, it functions
as an impediment to growth in the community by
restricting street crossings. This retards effective street
circulation in the community because only one street
(Nees Avenue) crosses the railroad in the central part of
the community. In addition to constraining circulation,
this raises an emergency access concern – if a train were
stopped on the railroad, emergency vehicles may have to
find another route to cross the tracks.
The railroad, combined with the airport and industrial
areas, also precludes residential and commercial
development to the west.
                                                                                                         Map 3-7

Introduction
Open space, parks, and recreation facilities enhance the
quality of life in a community. The creation and
preservation of these types of resources is an important     California Government Code
part of providing for the needs and welfare of a             Section 65302 lists the
community. Conservation of open space takes planning         requirements for Conservation
for the future. If these areas are not planned for at the    and Open Space Elements.
present time and set aside for the future, a city runs the
risk of losing them to development.
Open space lands are undeveloped areas that provide a
low density perception in an urban area, define the edge
of a community, and provide the sight lines that allow
long distance vistas to the mountains of the Coast Range,
agriculture fields, or other local view-points. Most people
think of open space as park areas, but a large portion of a
city's open space is provided by residential yard areas and
right-of-way along streets. The legal definition of open
space land is found in California Government Code
Section 65560 (b).
A park is an open area that provides an assortment of
recreation and leisure opportunities for a community. A
park can include community recreation parks, community
centers, and other publicly-owned outdoor recreation
areas. Parks can supply active as well as passive
recreation opportunities. Activities can range from family
picnics to organized sporting events.
One of the primary purposes of parks is to contribute to
Firebaugh's quality of life. The City accomplishes this
through the provision of convenient, well-equipped and
maintained sites and facilities, conservation of natural
resources, and a comprehensive and quality program of
recreational activities and services for all citizens of the
community.

                                                                     DRAFT Chapter 4: Conservation,

The Element
The open space portion of this Element identifies lands
that are appropriate for open space and parks acquisition
as well as the development of recreation programs on
these lands. The Element establishes goals, policies,
action programs and standards for the conservation and
treatment of open space.
California Government Code Section 65560 defines open
space as land that can be used for any of the following
uses:
•       Conservation of natural resources.
•       Managed production of resources.
•       Outdoor recreation.
•       Preservation of lands for the purpose of protecting
        the public's health and safety.
Specific requirements of the conservation portion of the
Element are identified in Government Code Section
65302 (d). This portion of the element includes "the
conservation, development and utilization of natural
resources, including water and its hydraulic force, forests,
soils, rivers and other waters, wildlife, and other natural
resources." Items that are addressed in this category
include the conservation of:
•       View opportunities
•       Soils
•       Water
•       Agricultural lands
•       Mineral resources
•       Air quality
•       Wildlife habitat
State law (AB 170) requires cities to amend their General
Plans to include an air quality element. Firebaugh has
opted to include the air quality element as a part of this
conservation element.
The Parks and Recreation Element is an optional
component of the General Plan. This Element identifies
existing and potential recreational opportunities within the
community. Since it is closely related to the City's open
space system, integration of the three portions (open
space, conservation and parks/recreation) into one
element makes good planning sense.

Existing Conditions
The City of Firebaugh is located on the floor of the San
Joaquin Valley, on the east side of the channel of the San
Joaquin River. The terrain is very level (except for the
banks of the river, which drop about ten feet in some
locations). Within the urban area, the land drops very
slightly from south to north and from the west to the east
along the river. The mountains of the Coast Range rise to
heights of 2,000 to 4,000 feet about twenty miles west and
southwest of Firebaugh.
The City is entirely surrounded by agricultural land mixed
with farmhouses and small ranches. The surrounding
agricultural land lends the effect of a greenbelt around
Firebaugh.
Discussed below are specific issues relating to the

issues can also be found in Part 2 (Community Profile) of
the General Plan.

Courthouse Park is located on the east side of O Street,
north of 14th Street. This small park occupies a little over
one-half acre and features grassy play areas, shade trees
and benches.
In addition to these parks, the City owns substantial
undeveloped land along the San Joaquin River which is
designated for open space. The City has also begun to
develop a pedestrian trail along the San Joaquin River.
Currently this path runs nearly 3/4 mile from Firebaugh
City Park in the south to 9th Street in the north. The City
has voiced its strong desire that this trail be expanded
further along the river.
Residents of Firebaugh also have available athletic fields
and facilities on the campuses of schools operated by
Firebaugh Las Deltas Unified School District.
Sports Programs
The City has a limited sports program. Swimming
lessons are available in the summer. Little League, Babe
Ruth, and men’s baseball teams are active in the spring
and summer.

Mendota Wildlife Area is located southeast of Mendota
(about ten miles southeast of Firebaugh) and is a wildlife
area maintained by the California Department of Fish and
Game. Covering over 12,000 acres (almost 20 square
miles) this facility offers bird watching, hiking and
seasonal hunting and fishing opportunities.

California Aqueduct Fishing Access is located on the
bank of the Delta-Mendota Canal about five miles south
of Firebaugh and provides several miles of fishing access
along the canal. This facility is administered by the State
Department of Water Resources.
Recreational opportunities are also available east of
Firebaugh in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Kings
Canyon and Sequoia National Parks are located east of
the City on State Highway 180. Camping, hiking, fishing
and sightseeing are the main activities in these parks.
Outside the parks are public lands administered by
Sequoia National Forest. Recreational opportunities
include hiking, camping, and hunting.
To the west of Firebaugh, the Bureau of Land
Management administers thousands of acres of publicly
accessible wilderness lands in the Coast Range
mountains, including Panoche and Tumey Hills, Griswold
Hills and Clear Creek Management area. Closer to
Firebaugh, two ecological reserves are located on
Highway 180, between Mendota and Kerman. These are
the Alkali Sink Preserve and Kerman Ecological Preserve.
While public access is not permitted, these areas preserve
several hundred acres of native valley lands.
Future Needs
A primary objective of this Element is the establishment
of criteria that will guide the acquisition and development
of future open space areas for Firebaugh. These standards
should be realistic and represent the actual amount of area
and facilities necessary to meet the needs and desires of
the community. These open spaces can be provided in a
variety of ways, and do not necessarily need to be under
the control of the City to meet Firebaugh's needs.
State Government Code Section 66477 (b) authorizes
cities to require developers subdividing land to dedicate
land for park and recreation uses, at a rate of 3-1/2 acres
per 1,000 residents.
Each jurisdiction can require that a maximum of five
acres of open space be set aside per one thousand
residents if the current land use exceeds the three acres
per thousand standard. There has been interest expressed
by residents in increasing the ratio of park land to five
acres per 1,000 residents.

Park acquisition must strike a balance between use and
the maintenance available to sustain the park. A city may
have 10 acres of open space per 1,000 persons; however,
if this acreage is not maintained properly, its value as
usable open space may be greatly diminished. As                                        Table 4-1

along the San Joaquin River. The
river and its ground water system provides a relatively
stable source of ground water for the City. Water quality
has generally been good though manganese and iron have
exceeded public health requirements in the past. Water
from the wells is treated to reduce contaminants.
In terms of surface water, the San Joaquin River conveys
water from snowfields in the Sierra Nevada range about
80 miles to the east. Because of Friant Dam located
northeast of Fresno, much of the natural flow of the river
has been reduced. However, the Delta-Mendota Canal
delivers water from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta

northwest of Firebaugh to the Mendota Pool about eight
miles southeast of the City. This supply provides water
flow in the river past Firebaugh throughout the year.
Without this flow the river would be dry during most
months.
There are also numerous surface irrigation canals in the
vicinity of Firebaugh, primarily operated by Central
California Irrigation District. Canals in and near the City
include Poso, Main, Helm, Outside and Firebaugh
Wasteway. While these canals provide critical irrigation
supplies they can make urban development difficult.
Most of them are too large to pipe, they are expensive to
bridge and they can also present safety hazards. At the
same time, waterways in Firebaugh may present an
opportunity for the creation open space corridors.
Agricultural Resources
Firebaugh is surrounded by thousands of acres of
producing cropland. Agricultural lands have provided a               The leading crops grown in the

City. As Firebaugh continues to grow, the surrounding
agricultural lands are taken out of production to
accommodate residential, commercial, and industrial
growth.
In 1965, California adopted the Williamson Act to
address the loss of agricultural lands due to urbanization.
The Williamson Act provides property owners with a
reduction in their property tax if they agree to maintain
their land in agriculture for a ten-year period. This
ensures, at least for the near-future, that agricultural lands
will remain undeveloped, thereby continuing agricultural
production as well as enhancing the sense of open space
around Firebaugh. Map 4-4 shows properties within the
Firebaugh Planning Area that have a Williamson Act
contract.
Super Williamson Act (Farmland Security Zones)
In 2000, the California adopted the Farmland Security
Zone program (also known as the “Super” Williamson
Act). This program is also aimed at preserving farmland

In addition to inventorying these species, the element
must plan for their preservation. Additional information
on biotic resources may be found in Part 2 (Community
Profile) of the General Plan.
A biotic survey prepared for the General Plan update
indicated that the overwhelming bulk of the planning area
has been severely disturbed from its natural state by
urbanization and intensive agricultural activities.
The primary exception are lands along the San Joaquin
River. The river and its banks support a relatively intact
riparian forest that provides cover and a transportation
corridor primarily for birds.
Air Quality

include an air quality element component within their
General Plans. This requirement recognizes that the San          Figure 4-1. The San Joaquin River and

critically important for each community to undertake
actions to help reduce this problem. Air quality can be
affected by the growth and development of cities. Since
the General Plan establishes policies on how and where
growth will occur, it is a logical place to establish
carefully selected policies regarding air quality.

atmosphere help disperse pollutants, while conditions that
cause the atmosphere to stagnate allow pollutants to
concentrate.     Local climatological effects, including
topography, wind speed and direction, temperature,
inversion layers, precipitation, and fog can exacerbate the
air quality problem in the Valley.

winter are in the 50s, but highs in the 30s and 40s can
occur on days with persistent fog and low cloudiness.
The average daily low temperature is 45ºF.
The vertical dispersion of air pollutants in the Valley is
limited by the presence of persistent temperature
inversions. Solar energy heats up the Earth’s surface,
which in turn radiates heat and warms the lower
atmosphere. Therefore, as altitude increases, the air
temperature usually decreases due to increasing distance
from the source of heat. A reversal of this atmospheric
state, where the air temperature increases with height, is
termed an inversion. Inversions can exist at the surface or
at any height above the ground, and tend to act as a lid on
the Valley, holding in the pollutants that are generated
here.

CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND GREENHOUSE
GASES
The California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the
federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have
established criteria air pollution standards in an effort to
protect human health and welfare. Geographic areas are
deemed "attainment" if these standards are met or
“nonattainment” if they are not met. Nonattainment
status is classified by the severity of the nonattainment
problem, with marginal, moderate, serious, severe, and
extreme nonattainment classifications for ozone.
Nonattainment classifications for PM range from
marginal to serious.

  federal and California standards. However, like
  airborne NOx, suspended SOx particles contribute to
  the poor visibility that sometimes occurs in the

  Lead – Lead (Pb) is a metal that is a natural
  constituent of air, water, and the biosphere. Lead is
  neither created nor destroyed in the environment, so
  it essentially persists forever. The health effects of
  lead poisoning include loss of appetite, weakness,
  apathy, and miscarriage; it can also cause lesions of
  the neuromuscular system, circulatory system, brain,
  and gastrointestinal tract.
  Gasoline-powered automobile engines were a major
  source of airborne lead through the use of leaded
  fuels. The use of leaded fuel has been mostly phased
  out, with the result that ambient concentrations of Pb
  have dropped dramatically. Lead concentrations
  were last systematically measured in the SJVAB in
  1989, when the average concentrations were
  approximately five percent of the state lead standard.
  Though monitoring was discontinued in 1990, lead
  levels are probably well below applicable standards,
  and the SJVAB is designated in attainment for lead.

AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA
The District, the ARB, the U.S. National Park Service,
and the Santa Rosa Rancheria in Lemoore operate an
extensive air monitoring network to measure progress
toward attainment of air quality standards. There are
seven monitoring stations in Fresno County and one in
Madera County. Conditions in Firebaugh are best-
represented by stations in Madera and Fresno.          The
Madera Pump Yard monitors ozone, while the First Street
station in Fresno monitors PM-10 and PM-2.5. Table 4-
4 summarizes air quality data from these locations since
the year 2000. The table shows that the Madera Pump
Yard station has experienced violations of the State ozone
standard every year except for 2000. The year 2002 saw
the most days with violations (21 days). The First Street
station in Fresno monitors particulate matter and has also
experienced excedences of the State PM-10 standard,
ranging from 16 days in 2001 to 5 days in 2004.
According to California Air Resources Board and the
federal Environmental Protection Agency, there have
been no excedences of air quality standards at area
stations that are representative of Firebaugh (Fresno and
Madera) for other critera pollutants (CO, NOx, SO or
lead).

below to reflect the source of emissions or the purpose of
the estimate.
     Area Source – Area source emissions are from
     sources that are not regulated by the District, or are
     individually so small that they may not be included in
     the District’s survey system. These small sources
     may not individually emit significant amounts of
     pollutants, but when aggregated can make an
     appreciable contribution to the emission inventory.
     Examples of these area sources are residential water
     heating and use of paints, varnishes, and consumer
     products. Emissions from these sources are grouped
     into categories and calculated based on surrogate
     variables.
     Of the more than 500 area-wide source categories
     established by the ARB, the District is responsible for
     estimating emissions from approximately 100.
     Emissions for the remaining categories are estimated
     by either ARB or the Department of Pesticide
     Regulation (DPR).                                             Source: Air Quality Impact Assessment for the 2030 Firebaugh General

     Point Source – Facilities that have valid District
     permits are called point sources. Refineries, gas
     stations, dry cleaners and industrial plants are
     examples of point sources in the District. The
     District’s Technical Services Division collects and
     maintains a database with detailed information on
     each point source that submits data. Almost all
     facilities emitting greater than 2.5 tons/year of any air
     pollutant are included. The District’s database
     contains information for more than 4,000 facilities.
     Data on the activity, seasonal variations, and hours of
     operation are collected from each facility each year
     through a survey process. Emissions are calculated

Environmental Review – The California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) was enacted by the state legislature
in 1970 and has been amended on numerous occasions. It
applies to government initiated plans, projects, and
regulations as well as to private projects requiring
discretionary approval from a state or local agency.
Under CEQA, a local planning agency is designated as
the lead agency for most private development projects.
CEQA requires the lead agency to conduct an “initial
study” to determine if a project may have a significant
adverse impact on the environment. Lead agencies are
required to consult with and request comments from
responsible agencies, agencies that exercise authority over
resources, which may be affected by the project. The lead
agency may choose to require or not require the measures
suggested by the responsible agency. Projects with
significant adverse impacts require the lead agency to
prepare a report referred to as an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR). Projects that will not have a significant
effect, or projects that are modified to avoid significant
effects, require the lead agency to prepare a Negative
Declaration.
CEQA allows lead agencies to disapprove a project if
necessary to avoid one or more significant effects on the
environment.      The planning agencies’ authority to
disapprove projects compels developers to include
measures in the project to reduce significant
environmental impacts.

Goals, Objectives and Action Plans
This section of the Element lists goals, objectives and
action plans related to parks, open space, recreation and
conservation.
ISSUE ONE: Parks and Open Space
There are currently four parks in Firebaugh:
-        Firebaugh City Park located at Q and 15th Streets
                                                                    1       Parks and Open
                                                                            Space
         (13.6 acres);
-        Maldonado Park located at Clyde Fannon Road
         and Thomas Conboy Avenue (6.6 acres);
-        Andrew Firebaugh Historic Park, located on the
         north side of 13th Street east of P Street (17.3
         acres).
-        Courthouse Park located on the east side of O
         Street north of 14th Street (0.6 acres)
Using the current population figure for Firebaugh of
6,680 residents, the city has a parkland to population ratio
of 3.9 acres of parkland per 1,000 people – comfortably
above the current standard of 3.5 acres per 1,000
residents.
By the year 2030, using “medium” population projections
detailed in the Land Use Element of the General Plan,
Firebaugh’s population is projected to be 11,795 persons.
Using the standard of 3-1/2 acres of parkland per 1,000
people, Firebaugh should attempt to set aside 10.5 acres
of open space by the year 2030. Using the standard of                   In 2007, Firebaugh had
five acres per 1,000 residents, Firebaugh should set aside              approximately 38 acres of
about 21 acres by the year 2030.                                        developed park land.
As discussed in the Land Use Element (page 2-13), there
are three recently-approved subdivisions that will be
                                                                        This works out to a ratio of
adding nearly 15 acres of public parks when fully                       3.9 acres of park land per
developed. As such, Firebaugh is well on its way to                     1,000 residents
meeting its future park land demands.
Given Firebaugh’s increasing population and demand for
recreation and leisure activities, the following goals,
objectives and action plans are set forth.
                               4-28                                         9/29/09

Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.    Develop a high quality public park and
      recreation system that is convenient, accessible
      and affordable to all segments of the City.
      Based on a ratio of 5 acres per 1,000 residents,
      the City should add approximately 21 acres of
      developed park land by the year 2030.
      1.    The City should designate within its
            planning area lands for open space, parks,
            recreation facilities and other amenities that
            link the uses together, like pedestrian and
            bike paths.
            a.      Map 4-5 designates the location and
                    size of Firebaugh’s existing and
                    future open space, park and recreation              Park Land Dedication
                    facilities.                                              Requirement
            b.      The Circulation Element delineates
                    the alignment and design of future          Five acres of land shall be dedicated by

                    the planning area.                          housed in new residential projects.
      2.    Require developers to dedicate new parks            Based on the 2000 Census, there are
            within new subdivisions at a ratio of 5 acres       approximately 3.45 persons per
            per 1,000 residents. The actual amount of           dwelling in Firebaugh.
            acreage could be less if the developer agrees
            to install landscape and play equipment             Therefore, approximately 290 homes
            improvements equal to the value of the              would house 1,000 residents. A 290-
            difference in acreage.                              home development would be
                                                                responsible to dedicate five acres of
            a.      The Subdivision Ordinance shall be          land for park and recreation facilities.
                    amended to incorporate the 5:1,000
                    park land dedication standard. Until        The dedication of approximately 0.017
                    the ordinance is amended, this policy       acre, (5 ÷ 290) or about 751 square feet

            Time Frame:          Within three months
            Responsibility:      City Planner
      3.    Parks should be centrally located within the
            subdivision they serve.           Further, the
            subdivision should be designed so that
            homes face onto the park – thereby
            providing added security by ensuring there
            are “eyes on the park” at all times.

ISSUE TWO: Trails
Firebaugh has already made a good start in establishing
                                                                   2
an effective trail system that can be used by pedestrians,
cyclists and equestrians. The City has already established                   Trails
nearly a 3/4 mile section of trail along the San Joaquin
River on both sides of the Avenue 7-1/2 bridge.
Residents have expressed strong desire that this trail be
extended further in both directions along the river and that
additional trail connections be established to other
portions of the community. The General Plan must
establish policies now so that a comprehensive trail
system becomes a reality in the future.
I.     Establish a comprehensive, linked system of
       trails in existing and future development areas
       of Firebaugh.
       1.     Map 4-5 shows the proposed trail system.
       2.     To the extent permitted by law, require
              developers to install portions of the trail
              system that traverse or abut their properties,
              as development occurs.
              a.     The Subdivision Ordinance shall be
                     amended to include a requirement for
                     dedications for trails. In addition, a                     Figure 4-2

Recreation programs for youth and adults are a quality-of-
                                                                    3
life feature that many cities place great emphasis on. If
youth are involved in a local recreation program or                        Recreation
activity, they are less likely to get into trouble. Improved
physical fitness is also an important purpose of municipal
recreation programs – particularly with skyrocketing
obesity rates being witnessed in recent years.
Further, programs that involve sport teams help youth and
their families to form relationships with other members of
the community, further strengthening the community
through relationship connections.
Recreation can also involve the senior citizen population.
Firebaugh has a senior citizen center located in
Maldonado Park.           Additional programs could be
developed for this segment of the population, including
bingo, health classes, physical education, etc.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.      Develop a recreation program that involves all
        segments of the Firebaugh population.
        1.     The     City should endeavor to provide
               programs for youth, adults and senior
               citizens.
               a.     The City should work with other
                      public and private entities in
                      coordinating activities for youth,
                      adults and seniors. Other entities
                      could include the school district, the
                      County of Fresno, and local social
                      agencies such as the Boys and Girls
                      Club, AYSO Soccer, and YMCA.
                      The ultimate result should be a
                      program of regularly scheduled
                      “league-type” activities, such as
                      soccer, baseball and basketball
                      games.

II. Develop a recreation program that pays for
    itself through the collection of user fees.
    1.      The City should fund a recreation program
            that is supported through the collection of
            program fees.
            a.     The City should consider establish a

 ISSUE FOUR: Scenic Qualities
Firebaugh is blessed with scenic surroundings –
agricultural fields, the San Joaquin River, and views of
the distant Coast Range mountains. However, Firebaugh
                                                                    4        Scenic Qualities
could significantly enhance its image by promoting scenic
enhancements that will attract public and private
investment.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Preserve and enhance the scenic qualities of the
       community by adopting standards regulating
       entryways, view preservation, building and site
       design and landscaping.
       1.     The City should enhance its image by
              developing improvements within the City
              that improve the visual appearance of the
              community.
              a.      Undertake a beautification program
                      along Highway 33. This is the major
                      route through Firebaugh and many
                      portions give the City a less-than-
                      desirable image.      In addition to
                      landscaping improvements within the
                      right-of-way (which are already
                      funded) work with individual
                      property     owners       to     make
                      improvements to their sites, including
                      landscaping, façade improvements
                      such as new paint, window awnings,
                      and new signs.
              Time Frame:        Within five years
              Responsibility:         City Manager
              b.      The City should design and construct
                      a new streetscape in downtown
                      Firebaugh      along     O      Street.
                      Improvements should include street
                      trees, hardscape, pedestrian lighting,
                      benches,    and     public    signage.
                      Circulation improvements such as
                      bulb-outs and brick cross walks
                      should also be considered.

          Responsibility:    City Manager
          c.    The City should identify streets that
                could benefit from the installation of
                street trees and medians. Potential
                streets that have the necessary right-
                of-way width for a median include O
                Street, Clyde Fannon, Nees and
                Morris Kyle Drive, among others. A
                report on this matter should be given
                to     the     City    Council    with
                recommendations for action.

ISSUE FIVE: Conservation
The conservation element overlaps with the open space,
land use and safety elements. It differs from these
elements in that it focuses on the conservation of natural
resources. Given that natural resources can be finite, and
                                                                                    5               Conservation
given the increasing population growth occurring in the
San Joaquin Valley, it is imperative that local
governments properly manage their natural resources.
This section also establishes goals and action plans to
meet the requirements for an air quality element.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.    Protect the San Joaquin River and other water
      courses, natural and man-made, that traverse
      Firebaugh.
      1.     The City should utilize its water courses,
             (both natural and man-made) as landscaped
             open space corridors that would be
             improved with bikepaths, trees, lighting,
             benches         and         other   appropriate
             improvements.
             a.      The City should prepare a Waterway
                     master plan for these open space
                     corridors after seeking public input
                     on the issue. The plan should provide
                     that waterway corridors be improved
                     with      trails      and  landscaping.
                     Coordination with Central California
                     Irrigation District is critical on this
                     issue.                                                                       Figure 4-3

          b.     To the extent allowed by law, the
                 City should require developers to
                 install (where appropriate) trails and
                 landscape     improvements       along
                 waterways in Firebaugh. Further, the
                 City should seek state and federal
                 grants for the development of these
                 open space corridors.

II. Protect endangered plant and animal species
    and their habitat.
                                                             Two Ways to Treat Waterways: the top image
    1.    The San Joaquin River and adjacent lands           shows a canal fenced in, barren and
          are recognized as wildlife habitat. The Land       unattractive. The lower image shows a canal
          Use map designates lands along the San             incorporated into the community as an
          Joaquin River to remain primarily                  attractive open space feature, with walking trail
          undeveloped, in open space.                        and landscaping.
          a.     The Land Use Map designates land
                 along the San Joaquin River as “Open
                 Space”.
          b.     Development shall be prevented
                 within 100 feet of the ordinary high
                 water mark of the river. Privately
                 owned land within this corridor may
                 be required as a dedication for open
                 space preservation consistent with
                 park and open space dedication
                 requirements of this Element, or they
                 may be maintained in open space
                 through the creation of an open space
                 easement or similar method.

     2.     Prevent new development from impacting
            endangered plant and animal species.
            a.     The City will refer projects that may
                   have an impact on endangered plant
                   and animal species to appropriate
                   State and Federal agencies, as
                   required by law, such as the
                   California Department of Fish and
                   Game, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
                   Service. Projects that may impact
                   wetlands or “waters of the United
                   States” will be referred to the U.S.
                   Army Corps of Engineers. The San
                   Joaquin River channel is legally
                   considered to be “Waters of the
                   United States”.

            Responsibility:    City Planner
III. Protect the aquifer underlying Firebaugh from
     uses that would potentially adversely impact
     this resource.
     1.     The City should discourage the development
            of industrial and heavy commercial uses that
            could potentially leach chemicals into the
            aquifer that underlies Firebaugh.
            a.     Through the City’s site plan review
                   process, the City Engineer will
                   require design, improvements and
                   conditions so that proposed industrial
                   uses will not pollute the aquifer.
            Time Frame:        Ongoing
            Responsibility:    City Engineer
            b.     Any proposed use that generates
                   effluent will be required to be
                   pretreated prior to on-site storage or
                   disposal into the City’s sewer system.
                             4-40                                        9/29/09

IV. Protect prime agricultural soils from premature
    urbanization.
    2.    Residential land shall not be annexed into
          the City until 80 percent of the residentially-
          zoned land within the City is developed.
          Further, annexations of land for residential
          development more than 1/8 mile from
          existing or approved development within
          City limits shall not be approved, except
          where an exception may be granted by the
          Planning Commission and City Council. In
          granting an exception, a finding shall be
          made that extraordinary circumstances are
          present, such as a lack of available land to
          be developed and/or the presence of
          property owner(s) immediately adjacent to
          existing urban development who are
          unwilling to sell/develop.
          a.     The City Planner shall conduct an
                 analysis of proposed annexations to
                 determine consistency with this
                 policy.

          Responsibility:    City Planner
    3.    Encourage Fresno County to maintain land
          outside the City limits, in large-lot
          agricultural use (20-acre minimum lot size)
          a.     Communicate with the County to
                 ensure that lands outside the city
                 (within the Sphere of Influence) are
                 not parcellized for ranchettes and
                 other similar uses.

ISSUE ONE: COMMUNITY IMAGE
Image is an important community asset in that it can
influence how people feel about their city.            If a
community has a positive image, a strong sense of
community and pride can result.                                1         Community
                                                                         Image
A community that is clean, well-maintained, visually
appealling and properly planned will:
-      Attract outside investment;
-      Encourage people to maintain their property;
-      Cause real estate values to appreciate; and
-      Stimulate city revenues - tax increment, sales tax
       and transient occupancy (lodging) taxes.

A community that is well-planned will be more attractive
to potential residents, developers, companies and
investors than one that is poorly planned, has numerous
land use conflicts, urban sprawl, a non-viable downtown,
poor circulation patterns and disenfranchised sections of
town. Furthermore, a community that is compact and is
not sprawling has more efficient, cost effective
infrastructure and service delivery systems than a
community without these attributes.
Firebaugh is surrounded by some of the richest
agricultural lands in the world. The City must consider
very carefully when it decides to grow outward -
permanently converting agricultural lands to urban use.

     issue is addressed in more detail in Appendix A:
     “A Smart Growth Primer”.
     1.     The City shall amend its Zoning Ordinance
            to incorporate smart growth, neo-traditional
            design requirements.
            a.     The City shall prepare design
                   guidelines to incorporate planning
                   principals that:
            •      promote moderate increases in
                   residential densities;
            •      narrower, tree lined streets and
                   shorter blocks;
            •      better connectivity in and between
                   neighborhoods and
            •      site and architectural design that
                   emphasizes a humanized, pedestrian-
                   oriented environment, as opposed to
                   an automobile-oriented environment.

                 from existing or approved urban
                 development, except where an
                 exception may be granted by the
                 Planning Commission and City
                 Council. In granting an exception, a

                 extraordinary     circumstances     are
                 present, such as a lack of available
                 land to be developed and/or the

                 immediately adjacent to existing
                 urban development who are unwilling
                 to sell/develop.

          projects typically combine residential and
          commercial uses in the same building or
          site.
          a.     The City shall amend its Zoning
                 Ordinance to incorporate a Mixed-

ISSUE THREE: RESIDENTIAL
                   NEIGHBORHOODS
The “neighborhood” is the fundamental building block of
a community. The health and quality of life of a
community is best measured at the neighborhood level. If
a city’s neighborhoods are noisy, contain excessive
traffic, unkempt, include incompatible land uses or are
depreciating in value, then the community as a whole is
most likely spiraling towards a condition of blight. In
terms of community priorities, preservation of the
neighborhood ranks as one of the its most important
goals.
The ideal neighborhood should be inviting, quiet, cool in
the summer, children-friendly, pedestrian-oriented,
achitecturally appropriate and it should maintain its value
over time. The neighborhood should also provide for a
wide range of housing types, styles and prices.
Multi-family development (also known as apartments) is
necessary in all communities. It provides housing
opportunities for persons or families who do not wish to
own a single family dwelling or who can not afford to
own or rent one.
Improperly located, designed or maintained, multi-family
development can have an adverse impact on the
neighborhood and the community as a whole. To protect
the health, safety and welfare of persons living adjacent to
multi-family development as well as persons living in
these types of units, the location, design and long-term
maintenance of this type of housing must be carefully
considered.

                           per year
          Responsibility: Public Works Director
    4.    Encourage residential infill development in
          neighborhoods that are blighted.
          a.    Consider       the      reduction     of
                development        impact     fees    on
                residential infill projects.
          Time Frame:      Prepare a study regarding
                           infill fees within five years
                           of adoption of the General
                           Plan.      The study shall

                underlying density on land that will
                support a residential infill project.
                Increased density can help make
                projects “pencil-out” financially.
                However, such projects must have

      1.    The Land Use map has been designed to
            minimize potential land use conflicts. In
            general the City should avoid placing certain
            uses next to or nearby one another, such as:
            -      Residential and Industrial;

    3.    Multi-family developments shall be required
          to enter into a maintenance agreement with
          the City, prior to occupancy. A maintenance
          agreement provides the City the legal ability
          to ensure general maintenance activities are
          performed on a regular basis, addressing
          issues such as landscaping, accumulation of
          junk and inoperable vehicles, broken
          windows, siding, etc.

ISSUE FOUR: COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
The term “Commercial” Development generally refers to
several types of land uses that feature businesses
providing goods and services. These types of uses
include:
Retail commercial - businesses whose primary activity
is selling goods to the public.
Office - businesses whose primary activity is financial,
insurance, real estate, information processing etc.
Service - businesses that provide a variety of physical
services, such as auto repair, appliance repair, etc. These
types of uses approach light industrial activities in nature
and are typically encouraged to locate away from retail
and office commercial activities.
The Firebaugh General Plan provides for four types of
commercial land use designations:
                                                                    The 1992 Firebaugh General

•         General                                                   land use categories:
•         Service
•         Neighborhood

Each of these types of commercial uses is necessary if the          -      General
community wishes to provide services and shopping                   -      Service

Goals, Objectives, Action Plans:
I.     Ensure that a full range of commercial
       development is provided for in Firebaugh.
       1.     The General Plan Land Use map designates
              sufficient land to accommodate projected
              commercial development through the
              planning period.
       2.     Continue to monitor commercial land
              demand and accommodate requests to
              redesignate       land     for    commercial
              development as demand warrants, subject to
              the following guidelines:
              a.     The site has direct access to a major
                     street, such as Highway 33 or Clyde
                     Fannon Road.
              b.     Development of the site for
                     commercial use would not negatively
                     impact adjacent residential uses, in
                     terms of traffic, noise, glare or other

ISSUE FIVE: Downtown Firebaugh
One of the main goals of any community’s plan is to
preserve and strengthen the downtown. Just as a person
depends on their heart for survival, a good city has a
                                                                 5      Downtown

downtown that pumps life and vigor into the community.
Firebaugh’s downtown is fairly well-defined –
particularly compared to some neighboring communities.
In particular the commercial district along O Street
between eighth and 12th Streets forms an attractive,
pedestrian-oriented shopping district with stores fronting
onto the sidewalks. This has created the basis of a strong
downtown area and there is potential for Firebaugh to
strengthen the image of its downtown and fortify it as the
heart of the community.

Parking
I     Provide sufficient, accessible          parking     for
      automobiles and bicycles.
      1.     The City should conduct an analysis of
             parking         facilities      and        make
             recommendations to increase the supply of
             parking both on and off street, in the
             downtown area.
             a.      Working closely with downtown
                     merchants and property owners the
                     City shall inventory existing on and
                     off-street parking spaces and facilities
                     in the downtown area.
             Time Frame:        Within five years of
                                adoption of the General

      2.     Consider implementing a parking “in-lieu”
             fee program. In this type of program, new
             uses that cannot provide on-site parking pay
             a fee to the City which uses the funds to
             construct public parking lots in the
                                                      2-72                                9/28/09

            parking space” and is based on the cost of
            acquiring land and developing an individual
            parking space.
            a.     The City Planner shall conduct a

II.  Ensure parking areas are convenient, attractive
     and safe. At the same time, minimize the
     negative visual impacts of parking lots through
     careful placement, landscaping and screening
     techniques. Further, balance the parking
     downtown so there are sufficient spaces to
     efficiently meet shoppers’ and tenants’ needs for
     future land requirements for new building
     construction.

            needs and make repairs and upgrades as
            necessary.
            a.     The Public Works Director and City
                   Engineer shall monitor infrastructure
                   systems and report at least quarterly
                   to the City Council on recommended
                   repairs and upgrades.

Industrial development generally provides the economic
foundation for a city in that it is a source of employment
and it provides a flow of revenue into the city from

outside sources - other businesses buying raw materials or
finished goods from the local industry.
Industries are typically poor land use neighbors because
they can generate large volumes of truck traffic, they can
produce noise and odors, they may pose public health
hazards and they can be unsightly. For these reasons, it is
important that they be properly located in the community
- away from land uses that are sensitive, such as schools,
residential development and parks.

major land use features in the community. The City and
school district must work together to plan for future
expansion of the school system and ensure the system can
respond to demands of future growth.

ISSUE NINE: River Lands
Firebaugh is fortunate to have a natural resource like the
San Joaquin River at its doorstep. While the river
occassionally presents the danger of flooding, the
                                                                  9       River Lands
aesthetic, recreational and natural resources of a major
river channel like the San Joaquin is unique among valley
communities. The City has wisely opted to keep land
along the river in open space, and has also seized the
opportunity to begin a program of recreational
improvements such as a walking trail and a future
community park. This General Plan recommends the
river lands be kept as an open space and recreational
resource. Such a strategy also serves as a built-in
protective “barrier” against future flooding events.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Maintain existing “Open Space” designations
       from the 1992 General Plan.
       1.     The 2007 General Plan maintains open
              space along the river.
              a.      The General Plan designates most
                      land along the river with the “Open
                      Space” designation.
       2.     Continue development and extension of the
              River Trail, north and south along the river.
              a.      The City shall continue to identify
                      funding sources to extend the trail.
                      As permitted by law, development
                      projects nearby (such as the Lake
                      Joallan project) will also be required
                      to dedicate land and install the trail.
              Time Frame:        Ongoing
              Responsibility: City Manager
       3.     Develop the “River Park” community park
              facility on the city-owned site located east of
              the east end of Seventh Street.
              a.      The City shall identify funding and
                      prioritize construction of specified
                      improvements at the park site.

    4.    Require new development abutting the river
          to maintain a minimum open space setback
          of 100 feet from the ordinary high water
          mark.
                                                                          Figure 2-16

                 open space on the General Plan map,
                 the City shall require developments to
                 provide a minimum 100-foot wide
                 open space along the river.

          front onto the 100-foot setback required in
          Goal #4 with open space and a street, rather
          than with rear yard fences “backed up” to
          the open space. This is shown in Figure 2-

This basic industry employs nearly one third of the city’s
labor force. Almost all other local businesses are

indirectly dependent on agriculture. Agriculture is a
relatively stable industry when compared to other
industrial sectors, like manufacturing, tourism, and the
transportation industries. For this reason, agriculture
should be encouraged in the Firebaugh area. Further,
land use policies that minimize the impacts between urban
and agricultural uses should be promoted as part of the
General Plan.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Firebaugh will ensure that its primary economic
       base (agriculture) is protected.

ISSUE ELEVEN: Infrastructure
Infrastructure generally refers to a city’s utilities - water,
sewer, storm drainage, gas and electric, phone and cable
television services. In Firebaugh, the city operates water,
sewer and storm dainage systems. The other utilities are
operated by private utility companies.
The operation and maintenance of infrastructure is of
paramount importance to cities. Without these services,
human health and well-being would be in jeopardy. Good
infrastructure can also serve as an economic development
tool. For instance, many industries require water supply,
and wastewater disposal capacity. Firebaugh must strive
to maintain its existing infrastructure while planning for
expansions to accommodate future growth and
development.
Firebaugh currently has two main isues with
infrastructure – low water pressure plagues some parts of
the community, and the long term growth of the city
would be best served by moving the wastewater treatment
plant well to the north. Areas suffering low water
pressure include parts of the southern residential areas, as
well as the Del Rio area on the northwest side of the City.
Water pressure can be increased through a variety of
measures including the addition of new water mains, and
the installation of water pressure booster pumps.
Firebaugh’s existing wastewater treatment plant was
constructed south of the City. This creates a problem
because local topography drops from south to north. This
means that the treatment plant is “uphill” and all effluent
must be pumped to make it to the treatment plant. In
addition, the treatment plant is now located almost
immediately adjacent to existing and approved residential
development. This location causes problems in that it
blocks further growth to the south from occurring. The
close proximity of the plant to residential development
can also cause odor problems. In order to address this
problem, the General Plan recommends the City put in
place a long-term plan to relocate the plant “downhill” to
a location north of the City.

for many cities – particularly agricultural communities
like Firebaugh that are especially dependent on one sector
of the economy. New and well-paying jobs must be
available for residents if a community is to prosper. In

to fund local government and services. Firebaugh must
continue to pursue economic development to better the
lives of its residents and to ensure that necessary services
will be available to the community.

ISSUE THIRTEEN: Public Participation
For planning to be sucessful, citizens must be involved in
plan-making. A plan created without public input will
more than likely fail, as residents of the community, over
time, may not support the plan’s goals and principles.
The City took an important step in public involvement by
creating a citizen’s General Plan committee to work on
this General Plan. The Committee met over a period of
many months to educate themselves on planning issues,
and then formulate goals, objectives and action plans. A
highlight of this process was a bus tour of various cities in
central and northern California where participants were
able to see cutting-edge examples of smart growth
developments.
The City should continue to strive to involve citizens in
the planning process. A number of strategies to do this
are available.

ISSUE FOURTEEN: Code Amendments
In order to implement various goals of the General Plan
update the City will need to amend parts of the Municipal
Code, particularly the Zoning Ordinance. In fact, it is a
goal of this General Plan that the aged zoning ordinance
be re-written entirely. Many parts of the ordinance are out
of date, particularly requirements related to permitted uses
and development standards. In particular, the City should
give attention to updating the following sections:
-         Residential setbacks
-         Parking ordinance
-         Sign ordinance
-         Permitted uses in commercial and industrial
          zones
Goals, Objectives and Action Plans
I.     Amend city codes and standards to implement
       updated city requirements and planning
       practices.
       1.      Update city codes and ordinances as
               necessary to incorporate goals and policies
               of the General Plan.
               a.     The City should initiate a complete
                      update of the Zoning Ordinance. The
                      Ordinance should be re-written to
                      incorporate modern development
                      standards, including “Smart Growth”
                      design mechanisms and “form based”
                      codes, as appropriate. In addition, the
                      ordinance should be reformatted to
                      improve clarity and ease of
                      understanding. The new ordinance
                      should also make extensive use of
                      graphics to illustrate development
                      standards.
               Time Frame:       Within seven years of
                                 adoption of the General

               Responsibility: City Planner
               b.     At a minimum, update critical
                      sections of the Zoning Ordinance,
                      including:

CHAPTER 6 • NOISE ELEMENT
The Noise Element of the General Plan is a planning
document which provides a policy framework for
addressing potential noise impacts as the community
grows and develops.
The content of the Noise Element and the methods used in
its preparation have been determined by the requirements    Government code Section 65302
of Section 65302 (f) of the California Government Code      establishes the requirements for
and by the Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of
Noise Elements of the General Plan adopted and
                                                            preparation of a Noise Element.
published by the California Office of Noise Control
(ONC) in 1976.
The ONC Guidelines require that major noise sources be
quantified by preparing generalized noise exposure
contours for current and projected conditions. The Noise
Element shall be used as a guide for establishing land use
patterns that minimize noise impacts on the Community
and shall include measures and solutions to address
existing and foreseeable noise conflicts.
According to the Government Code requirements, current
and projected noise exposure information shall be
included in the Noise Element for the following major
noise sources:
1.        Highways and freeways
2.        Primary arterials and major local streets
3.        Railroad operations and rapid transit systems
4.        Aircraft and airport operations
5.        Local industrial facilities
6.        Other stationary sources
Noise-sensitive uses identified by the Government Code
and the City of Firebaugh include the following:
1.        Residential development
2.        Schools
3.        Hospitals, nursing homes
4.        Churches
5.        Libraries
The Noise Element is intended to minimize future noise
conflicts. A noise control ordinance may be used to
address noise levels generated by existing and future local
industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential uses,

which are not regulated by federal or state noise level
standards.
The regulation of noise sources such as traffic on
highways, freeways and other public roadways under
State or federal jurisdiction, railroad line operations and
aircraft in flight is preempted by existing federal and/or
state regulations, meaning that such sources generally
may not be addressed by a noise control ordinance. The
Noise Element addresses the prevention of noise conflicts
from all of these sources.
Relationship to Other Elements of the General Plan
The Noise Element is related to the Land Use, Housing,
Circulation and Open Space Elements of the General
Plan. Recognition of the interrelationship of noise and
these four mandated elements is necessary to prepare an
integrated general plan and to initiate changes which will
reduce noise exposure to acceptable levels in areas where
noise presently exceeds the levels set forth by the adopted
policies of the Noise Element. The relationship between
these elements is briefly discussed below:
1.     Land Use: An objective of the Noise Element is
       to provide noise exposure information for use in
       the Land Use Element. When integrated with the
       Noise Element, the Land Use Element will show
       acceptable land uses in relation to existing and
       projected sources of noise and noise levels.
2.     Housing: The Housing Element considers the
       provision of adequate sites for new housing and
       standards for housing stock. Since residential land
       uses are noise- sensitive, the noise exposure
       information of the Noise Element must be
       considered when planning the locations of new
       housing. The State Noise Insulation Standards
       may influence the locations and construction costs
       of multi-family dwellings, which will be
       considered by the Housing Element.
3.     Circulation: The circulation system, which can be
       a major source of noise, must be correlated with
       the Land Use Element. This is especially true for
       roadways which carry significant numbers of
       trucks. Noise exposure will thus be a decisive
       factor in the location and design of new
       transportation facilities, and in the mitigation of
                                                     6-2                          8/17/09

With regard to increases in A-weighted noise levels,
knowledge of the following relationships will be helpful
in understanding this report:
•    Except in carefully controlled laboratory
     experiments, a change of 1 dB cannot be perceived
     by humans.
•    Outside of the laboratory, a 3 dB change is
     considered a just-perceivable difference.
•    A change in level of at least 5 dB is required before
     any noticeable change in community response would

NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF NOISE ON HUMANS
Negative effects of noise exposure include physical
damage to the human auditory system, interference, and
disease. Exposure to noise may result in physical damage
to the auditory system, which may lead to gradual or
traumatic hearing loss. Gradual hearing loss is caused by
sustained exposure to moderately high noise levels over a
period of time, while traumatic hearing loss is caused by
sudden exposure to extremely high noise levels over a              Noise may also be a contributor

hearing loss both may result in permanent hearing
damage. In addition, noise may interfere with or interrupt         stress, such as hypertension,
sleep, relaxation, recreation, and communication.                  anxiety, and heart disease.
Although most interference may be classified as
annoying, the inability to hear a warning signal may be
considered dangerous. Noise may also be a contributor to
diseases associated with stress, such as hypertension,
anxiety, and heart disease. The degree to which noise
contributes to such diseases is dependent upon the noise
frequency, bandwidth, level, and exposure time.

CHARACTERISTICS OF SOUND
PROPAGATION AND ATTENUATION
Noise can be generated by a number of sources, including
mobile sources such as automobiles, trucks, and airplanes,
and stationary sources such as construction sites,
machinery, and industrial operations. Noise generated by
mobile sources typically attenuates (is reduced) at a rate
between 3.0 and 4.5 dBA per doubling of distance. The
rate depends on the ground surface and the number or
type of objects between the noise source and the receiver.
Hard and flat surfaces, such as concrete or asphalt, have
an attenuation rate of 3.0 dBA per doubling of distance.
Soft surfaces, such as uneven or vegetated terrain, have an
attenuation rate of about 4.5 dBA per doubling of
distance. Noise generated by stationary sources typically
                                                                In general, barriers contribute to

sight” between the source and the receiver. Buildings,
concrete walls, and berms can all act as effective noise
barriers. Wooden fences or broad areas of dense foliage
can also reduce noise, but are less effective than solid
barriers.
METHODOLOGY
When preparing a noise analysis, guidelines set by
affected agencies must be followed. Acoustical
terminology used for this element is documented in Table
6-1. In analyzing noise levels, the Federal Highway
Administration’s (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise
Prediction methodology must be applied. Safety concerns
must also be analyzed to determine the need for
appropriate mitigation resulting from increased noise due
to increased traffic resulting from growth facilitated by
the General Plan and other evaluations such as the need
for noise barriers and other noise abatement
improvements. Unless otherwise stated, all sound levels
reported are in A-weighted decibels (dBA). A-weighting
de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequencies of
sound in a manner similar to the human ear. Most
community noise standards use A-weighting, as it

provides a high degree of correlation with human
annoyance and health effects.
First, existing "baseline" traffic noise levels are
established based on previously collected traffic data and
using Traffic Noise Model (TNM) Version 2.5. TNM 2.5
is an FHWA Traffic Noise Prediction Program. Once
existing levels are established, future levels, based on
expected traffic growth, are calculated and compared to
both the existing noise level and the maximum allowable
noise exposure based on the General Plan. The Noise
Element identifies a maximum exterior noise exposure
level of 60 Ldn dB for outdoor residential and recreational
areas. For interior areas a maximum of 45 Ldn dB is
required.
EXISTING TRAFFIC NOISE
Existing traffic noise levels were evaluated using the
TNM 2.5 Prediction Model. Traffic volumes collected
from the 2030 Circulation Element were entered into the
model to estimate noise levels at nearby sensitive
receptors.
To assess the traffic noise impacts from adjacent roads the
first step is to determine the baseline or existing noise
condition. The second is to then compare the baseline to
future level results, based on expected traffic growth, and
the maximum allowable noise exposure.
To assess existing noise conditions, VRPA Technologies
(noise consultant retained by the City) staff compiled
current traffic counts and existing geometric conditions.
Staff conducted noise level measurements within the
planning area on June 5, 2007. The purpose of the
measurements was to evaluate the accuracy of the model
in describing traffic noise exposure within the planning
area. The planning area and noise-monitoring sites are
shown in Map 6-1. The noise-monitoring sites represent
nearby sensitive receptors and land uses.

were conducted in terms of the equivalent energy sound
level (Leq). Measured Leq were compared to Leq values
calculated (predicted) by the Sound 2000 model. Traffic
volumes, truck mix and vehicle speeds were used as
inputs to the model.
Results of the noise analysis are reflected in Table 6-3.

CHAPTER 5 • SAFETY ELEMENT
Introduction
The Safety Element is one of seven State-mandated
elements of a city's General Plan. Section 65302(g) of the
Government Code requires cities to develop, adopt, and
implement a Safety Element (shown to the right).
                                                           Section 65302(g)
Following accidents and disasters, citizens are sometimes
heard to ask, "How did this happen?" or "How can this be   “The General Plan shall include a
prevented from happening again?" or perhaps, "What is      safety element for the protection of the
the government's policy to prevent or respond to such
emergencies?"
                                                           community from any unreasonable
                                                           risks associated with the effects of
The Safety Element in itself can not prevent natural and   seismically induced surface rupture,
man-made disasters; however, it can provide standards      ground shaking, ground failure,
that may help minimize the impacts of disasters on the     tsunami, seiche, and dam failure;
human population and structural improvements in the
area. It will also provide additional standards for
                                                           slope instability leading to mudslides

Safety of the citizens of Firebaugh must be uppermost in
the minds of the local decision-makers. This Element will
provide a guideline towards developing a safer             Source: California General Plan Guidelines
environment for the community. Local decisions related
to zoning, subdivisions, entitlement permits and the like
should be tied to this Element's identification of such
hazards.
The Element
The Safety Element is the primary vehicle for relating
local safety planning to City land-use decisions. The
Element's main purpose is to reduce death, injuries,
property damage and the economic and social dislocation
resulting from natural hazards.
In 1975, the Legislature adopted SB 271, which made the
safety element a mandatory part of the General Plan. At
that time, the element was required to include policies
relating to fire safety, flooding, and geologic hazards.
In 1984, the Legislature adopted AB 2038, which requires
that the list of mandatory safety element issues be
                                                      5-1                 9/28/09

expanded to include seismic safety. Essentially, the
Legislature took the issues previously considered in the
seismic safety element and made them safety element
requirements.
While the focus of the safety element is on fire, flooding,
seismic and geologic hazards, it may also address locally
relevant safety issues such as vehicle accidents, crime,
power failures, and hazardous material spills.
Safety Element Goals
The following goals have been used as a guideline in the
preparation of this Element:
1.      Prevent the loss of life and property due to
        natural and man-made hazards, including
        earthquakes, floods and fires.
2.      Safeguard the economic resources of Firebaugh
        from losses due to natural and man-made
        hazards, including earthquakes, floods and
        fires.
3.      Promote citizen awareness of natural and man-
        made hazards which exist in the area.
4.      Safeguard public safety and the protection of
        property by reducing crime.
Existing Conditions
Each issue section below discusses existing condtions in
the Firebaugh planning area. A more detailed profile of
existing conditions (as they relate to safety) is found in
Part II of the General Plan.

ground motion that can reasonably be anticipated from
earthquakes on the principal fault systems affecting the

is shown in the map below. This exhibit shows that
Firebaugh is located within the “V3” (Valley-3) zone.

City of Coalinga.
Although no damage was reported in Firebaugh, the
quake was strongly felt by local residents. The Coalinga
earthquake and aftershocks were not associated with the
San Andreas Fault as most people believed, but rather,
occurred in the deeply buried Sierran Block Boundary
zone, which is thought to be made up of complex thrust
fault systems.
According to the FCSSE, Firebaugh is most likely to be
affected by the San Andreas Fault, which lies within the
Coast Range mountains, about 60 miles west/southwest of
Firebaugh. The distance from the fault to Firebaugh is
sufficient enough that the City is somewhat protected
from the most severe forms of damage that would result
from an earthquake.
Nevertheless, Firebaugh must take actions and remain
constantly prepared to minimize the hazardous effects of
an earthquake. These are expressed in the goals,
objectives and action plans below.
Goals, Objectives Action Plans

ISSUE FOUR: Flooding
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, a federal
agency charged with mapping flood prone areas
throughout the United Sates, has identified flood prone
areas in the Firebaugh vicinity. Map 2-3 in Part II of the
                                                                 4        Flooding
General Plan identifies the 100- and 500-year flood zones.
The major source of flood threat in Firebaugh is the San
Joaquin River. In 2006 flooding was a major issue as a
series of storms pushed the river nearly over its banks.
Crews were forced to work around the clock placing sand
bags to hold back the water. This event highlighted the
critical nature of flood prevention – an issue that can go
relatively “un-noticed” for years in the minds of the
general public.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.      Minimize the danger to people and property
        from flooding.
        1.    For existing undeveloped areas in flood
              zones, encourage uses that are not
              susceptible to flood damage. For uses that
              are susceptible to flood damage, require
              mitigation measures such as elevation of
              floors, anchoring of buildings, maintenance
              of floodways, etc.
              a.      Adoption of the Land Use map helps
                      to implement the foregoing objective.
                      To the extent practical, the Land Use
                      map has been designed to preclude
                      sensitive land uses from being located
                      within flood zones.
              b.      The City should review its flood zone
                      regulations (and if necessary amend
                      them) to ensure they comply with
                      current federal flood regulations.

ISSUE FIVE: Hazardous Land Use Relationships
Identification of existing hazardous land uses is also
important to the safety of the citizens of Firebaugh There
are several uses within the City that can generate a "risk"
                                                                  5     Hazardous Land
                                                                        Use Relationships
factor. These uses include industrial/agricultural packing
operations in the industrial district, major roadways that
carry large volumes of truck traffic, the railroad, and
Firebaugh Municipal Airport.
Relationships between land use types must be considered,
especially when locating residential development.
The Land Use Element has eliminated most of the
potential land use conflicts associated with the above uses
by ensuring that surrounding properties are designated for
uses that will not conflict with the use.
For instance, new industrial development will be directed
to locate primarily west of the railroad tracks and south of
the existing urban area This area is downwind of most
residential development in Firebaugh.
A hazardous land use relationship that is more difficult to
address involves trucks carrying hazardous materials
along the major roadways in and around the community.
Significant volumes of truck traffic pass through
Firebaugh on Highway 33 and also on 13th St/Avenue 7-
1/2 as well as Nees Avenue to Interstate 5.
It is difficult to ascertain the number of trucks carrying
hazardous waste. The Land Use Element has addressed
this issue by directing residential development away from
major roadways. In addition, the Circulation Element
designates truck routes that will channel trucks away from
most sensitive land uses.
Finally, Firebaugh Municipal Airport presents a land use
and noise hazard. The presence of the aiport also
constrains growth of the community as residential
development in particular is restricted from locating near
the airport. Members of the General Plan Committee
voiced their desire to see consideration given to
eventually moving the airport to a location further away
from the urban area.

‘ISSUE SIX: Site Plan Review
In order to ensure safety of the residents of Firebaugh and
their property, it is critical that good communication be
maintained in the development review process.
                                                                        6          Site Plan Review
Communication between various city departments and
other affected public agencies can result in projects that
are safer and better-planned.
Many cities utilize a Site Plan Review Committee process
to achieve this objective. In this process, representatives
of various city departments and other affected agencies
(such as the fire district, irrigation district, etc.) meet with
the project developer to review concerns pertaining to the
project. This type of “pre-application” meeting can work
to reduce delays downstream in the development process
by getting information “on the table” in an up-front and
timely manner. The result will be better-planned, safer
development.
As such, a Site Plan Review procedure should be
established to ensure that maximimum communication                       Site Plan Review Committee
occurs when projects are reviewed.                                             (Proposed Process)

ISSUE SEVEN: Emergency Preparedness
Communities must be prepared for any emergency.
Sometimes when disasters occur, it is not the initial
disaster itself, but the lack of preparedness that causes
                                                                    7      Emergency

much misery and suffering. With this in mind, the City of
Firebaugh can take actions to ensure that it is ready to
respond to emergencies.
Goals, Objectives, Action Plans
I.     Keep Firebaugh prepared to respond to
       emergencies that can be reasonably expected to
       occur in or around the planning area.
       1.      Establish an emergency preparedness team
               composed of City Department heads.
               Coordinate with other heads of other local
               agencies to provide a coordinated response
               to emergencies, including Firebaugh Police
               and Fire Departments, Fresno County
               Sheriff’s Department, Firebaugh-Las Deltas
               Unified School District, Central California
               Irrigation District and other agencies as may
               be appropriate. Require that this team meet
               on a twice-yearly basis to review emergency
               preparedness tactics, share information,                        Map 5-2
               discuss needs and develop action plans to               Primary Evacuation Routes
               address those needs. Issues to be explored
               include:
               -       Establishing emergency shelters at
                       key locations, such as the community
                       center, school campuses, etc. Ensure
                       these facilities are stocked (or will be
                       stocked) with emergency supplies
                       such as blankets, water and food.
               -       Ensuring key roadways stay clear in
                       the event that evacuation is necessary
                       (see Map 5-2).
               -       Lines of communication are open in
                       the event that equipment or
                       manpower must be shared between
                       agencies.
               -       Other issues that may be identified.
