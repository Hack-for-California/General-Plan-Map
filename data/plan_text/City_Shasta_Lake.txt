Housing Goals, Policies, and Programs
HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
 INTRODUCTION
The California Government Code requires the Housing Element (HE) to contain “a statement of goals, quantified objectives,
and policies relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing” (Section 65583[b] [1]).
This section fulfills that requirement and contains the City of Shasta Lake (City’s) goals, policies (P), and programs (PR) for
housing and supportive services to provide direction on key housing issues in the City.
The following six goals define the major topic areas covered by the Element:
                                      Adequate land for a balanced range of housing,
                                      Maintenance, improvement, and rehabilitation of housing,
                                      Adequate services for residential development
                                      Balance of employment and housing,
                                      Energy efficiency,
                                      Equal housing opportunity
An overarching concept applicable to all of the goals and policies in the General Plan is the City’s intent in ensuring that all of
the above goals and the policies and programs that support them are compatible with healthy community principles. As part
of the General Plan Update, the City has partnered with Shasta County Public Health to address these principles in the
community and to incorporate them into land use decisions.
 Among the healthy community principles that apply to housing and services and that support housing are:
                            Access to quality affordable housing
                            Access to economic opportunities
                            Safe neighborhoods and public places
                            Access to multiple modes of transportation including buses, biking, and walking
                            Access to medical services
                            Access to sources of healthy food (including stores, farmer’s markets and community gardens)
                            Access to environmental quality
                            Access to parks, and other sources of recreation
                            Green and sustainable development and practices
The principles above, incorporated into land use decisions will help Shasta Lake become a healthier community.
Policies are provided to guide day-to-day decisions regarding housing in the City. Implementation programs follow the goals
and policies of the adopted Housing Element and provide actions the City will take to make progress toward its stated housing
goals.
                                                                                                                                  1

The City is required to have quantifiable objectives wherever possible. Those objectives are included within each program
definition, along with timing and assigned responsibility for implementing those programs. Objectives for the 2009-2014
planning period are as follows:

            Above-Moderate                        2                   10                  0                12
            Total                                21                   39                  9                69

Housing element law recognizes that in developing housing policy and programs, identified housing needs may exceed
available resources and the community's ability to satisfy these needs. The quantified objectives of the housing element,
therefore, need not be identical to the identified housing need, but should establish the maximum number of housing units
that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved, or households assisted over a five-year time frame.
The programs detail specific actions that the City will undertake to ensure the goals are met using the adopted policies. In the
sections below, the rationale for the particular program is listed and, where appropriate, information given as to how the
program will address a particular need.
Where a program requires funding, possible funding sources are listed. Shasta Lake is not an “entitlement” city and does not
receive allocated federal funding for housing and services in support of housing automatically. That results in significant
funding uncertainty from year to year. It also means that the City must not only be ultimately ready for possible funding
opportunities but also ultimately flexible in many of its priorities.
For the City, many of the significant sources of funding for housing and services in support of housing require applications,
which are competitive. This means the City has to apply annually, be competitive, assume funding is still available, and make
choices from the many projects needed to improve the condition and quality of life in Shasta Lake. The goals, policies, and
implementation programs listed in this section are the reflection of these uncertainties.
                                                                                                                               2

GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Readers will note that a significant number of the implementation programs listed in this section are underway, and several
were due to be completed during the 2009/10 fiscal year but delayed by other projects. This has been driven by the funding
received to complete some of the projects, as well as the City‘s interest in keeping momentum going forward with the projects
listed below. The most significant project was the completion of the Affordable Housing Chapter which included many of the
implementation programs.
The Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs, while completing the Housing Element, are not intended to be the sole
source for action by the City.
    The City is undertaking a General Plan Update that includes the other elements of the General Plan. As part of the update,
     the City will be incorporating healthy community principles and economic development pursuits to provide for a well-
     rounded community with a good quality of life.
    The City of Shasta Lake Housing Authority is the Successor Agency for the Shasta Lake Redevelopment Agency. No policies
     have been included for the Successor Agency until funding has been settled and the Authority knows what firm funding is
     available.
Appendices attached provide more detailed background information for the development of these goals, policies, and
programs.
References to the “City” mean City of Shasta Lake and references to “Agency” mean the City of Shasta Lake Redevelopment
Agency. Acronyms used in this section include the following:
     CDBG          Community Development Block Grant (State funding)

GOAL HE-1: Adequate Land for a Balanced Range of Housing
              (Addresses Government Code Sections 65583(c) (1) (2) & (3))
Policies
Policy H-P-1  The City shall give highest priority for permit processing to affordable housing projects.
Policy H-P-2  The City shall grant residential density bonuses consistent with State law for projects that reserve units for
              low- and/or moderate-income households and meet affordability longevity requirements.
Policy H-P-3  The City shall give priority, and incentives to the use of infill lots and accessory dwellings for affordable
              housing to maximize their use.
Policy H-P-4  The City shall encourage homeownership in new housing constructed for low- and moderate-income
              households.
Policy H-P-5  The City shall continue to provide support and financial assistance to first-time homebuyers.
Policy H-P-6  The City shall strive to ensure that affordable units are located in suitable locations throughout the city
              close to retail services, parks, schools, public facilities, and public transit, and other amenities.
Policy H-P-7  The City shall consider the use of infill sites a priority for the construction of all housing and will look to
              acquire and assemble sites, as funds are available to facilitate development of lower-income housing
              projects at reduced costs, while minimizing displacement of existing residents.
Policy H-P-8  The City shall support the continued use of rental assistance opportunities, including HUD Section 8 Housing
              Choice Vouchers by City of Shasta Lake residents
Policy H-P-9  The City shall use available state and federal funding assistance appropriate to the City of Shasta Lake’s
              needs, to develop affordable housing. Appropriate programs may include, but are not limited to Community
              Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), Multi-family
              Housing Program (MHP), and other programs aimed at providing housing affordable to low - and very low-
              income households.
Policy H-P-10 The City and Redevelopment Agency shall consider using Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
              funds and tax increment revenues, as well as any other appropriate funding source to subsidize on- and
              off-site infrastructure improvements for lower-income housing projects.
Policy H-P-11 The City shall seek and apply appropriate financing techniques, such as mortgage revenue bonds or other
              mortgage-backed securities, to develop affordable housing in concert with affordable housing partners.
Policy H-P-12 The City shall review and apply fee reductions and waivers in concert with an incentive package to create
              additional affordable housing.
Policy H-P-13 The City shall amend the Non-Conforming section of the Municipal Code to increase the possible use of
              non-conforming residential structures.
Policy H-P-14 The City shall apply incentives and other inducements as may be available to encourage development of infill
              parcels for residential use in mixed-use and residential infill developments. The city shall consider the
              modification of setbacks, height limitations, coverage ratios, parking requirements, and other development
              regulations in the Zoning Ordinance to facilitate and encourage the use of in-fill sites for residential and
              commercial mixed use or multi-family residential use.
Policy H-P-15 The City shall encourage the construction of accessory (second) units. In addition, The City shall consider new
              housing construction methods and dwelling unit types that encourage affordability through innovative
              design such as small lot subdivisions and planned developments.
                                                                                                                            4

Policy H-P-16      The City shall seek to improve the efficiency of the housing production and marketing for rental, new, and
                   resale housing by providing information to the public and developers on approved residential projects and
                   vacant land supply.
Policy H-P-17      The City shall ensure that its current development impact fee structure does not unnecessarily constrain
                   production of affordable infill development and multi-family housing and, where constraints are identified,
                   consider assistance through payment of fees by the Redevelopment Agency Low and Mod fund, fee waivers
                   or fee reductions as part of an incentive package.
Policy H-P-18      The City shall ensure that amenities, transit, and other essential services are provided at appropriate
                   distances from residential development to serve the surrounding neighborhoods without the use of the
                   automobiles (pedestrian-oriented development, transit-oriented development, and traditional
                   neighborhood development).
Policy H-P-19      The City shall ensure that street and subdivision layout encourages connectivity and livable
                   neighborhoods.
Policy H-P-20      The City shall grant priority for service hook-ups to developments that help meet the community’s share of
                   the regional need for lower-income housing.
Implementation Programs
HE         1.1     Vacant Land Inventory to Accommodate Future Housing Needs (Changed/Continued)
While the City has a vacant land inventory that was included in the last Housing Element, mapping it on the City’s GIS system
accurately as an overlay has encountered difficulties The City has had issues with the GIS system set up by consultants. During
the last planning period, the County rectified the mapping as a project. However, the result became that the City’s specific
overlays no longer matched with the base map - making their use difficult.
The inventory will also permit the City to better understand the constraints of each parcel to provide any additional changes
necessary to City policy needed for efficient development that can meet healthy community standards.
Vacant Land Inventory to Accommodate Future Housing Needs:
The City shall take the completed land inventory for the City, update it with the few parcels created during the last planning
period, and integrate it with the City’s GIS system. A process will be developed to provide for updates to both the inventory
and the GIS layers that relate to the inventory (including infrastructure) on a regular basis. Information will be assembled in a
form useful for marketing the properties for affordable housing.

HE         1.2     Infill Strategic Plan (Continued))
To incorporate many of the healthy community principles, the City needs to address infill properties and their potential to
provide affordable housing sites. Having housing on infill sites will mean the housing will be close to services, schools, and
transportation. The City has inventoried vacant sites available for housing. More work needs to be done to complete
information about the utility needs and complete street needs to make use of those sites. The City is updating the Land Use
and Circulation Elements during the 2014/15 FY, which will help with this information. The final report will include
recommendations for the use of infill sites that include incentives for use.
Infill Strategic Report
The City will complete the Infill Strategic Report and use it to help establish programs for which the City and the
Redevelopment Agency’s Successor Agency or the Shasta Lake Housing Authority, will seek funding. This will also assist in
setting up a Capital Improvement Plan (CIP), which the City has not established.

The City does not currently have a density bonus ordinance, relying on the State law for guidance and requirements in the
past. Until now, there have been no requests for density bonuses from the development community. The City is working now
with several non-profit organizations interested in developing in the City, and the City is looking for additional partners for
affordable housing development who can commit to long-term affordability. Amendment of the Zoning Ordinance to be
specific about what density bonus is allowed as well as a list of incentives would expedite review of projects so that
protracted negotiations over those items does not ensue.
Density Bonus
The City shall amend Title 17, the Zoning portion of the Municipal Code to include density bonus provisions that are consistent
with State law, including statewide parking standards for affordable housing and a listing of other incentives available to
affordable housing developments, which commit to long-term affordability.

The City has numerous sites within the City that are single lots. Development of those lots is sporadic in part because
developers are not aware, the owners are out of town or the ownership is uncertain. A few solo builders pick up some of these
lots for development but not in the numbers that they might be. The City will evaluate individual characteristics of these lots
to see if they may qualify for infill development funding
Scattered Site Development
The City will map the single vacant lots, their sizes, and other characteristics. If appropriate, the City will seek funding or
encourage others to do so. Local builders/developers will be contacted to engage their interest.

HE        1.4      Non-Conforming Structures and Uses (Continued)
Review of the City’s Zoning Ordinance indicates that the Non-Conforming Use Section of the Zoning Ordinance may be an issue
for development of infill properties and for the conservation of housing. Frequent public inquiries about the expansion,
replacement, or improvement of non-conforming structures indicate that potentially there is a market that would be available
for improvement of these structures many of which are over 50 years old. However there has been no specific review of what
structures are non-conforming, the nature of the specific non-conformity and what can reasonably be done with these
structures that will insure the housing is not just affordable but livable and code compliant.
Non- Conforming Structures and Uses
After the completion of the infill report and the site inventory, the City will complete a review of the existing ordinance in
relation to use of vacant and underutilized sites. Based on the review the City will modify the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the
findings of the review.

In 2004, the City adopted a Second Dwelling Unit ordinance that meets the requirements of State law. Since adoption,
only two second units have been constructed. The Zoning Ordinance also includes different versions of dwellings allowed
as accessory to a primary residence, including family care residences, caretaker’s quarters, and guesthouses, each with
varying standards and requirements. The City sees this as an opportunity to both clarify allowable uses in the Zoning
Ordinance and to provide for additional affordable housing.
Second (and Other Accessory) Dwelling Units
The City will review and consider amendments to the Second Unit Ordinance to allow second units to be established at a
higher density than identified in the General Plan in certain circumstances, and to allow each unit to be separately
metered for utilities. Once changes are made, they will be placed on the City’s website, the City's utility billing, the
Builder's Exchange, the City's Development Services Department and Redevelopment Agency and otherwise publicized.

With very limited resources and staff, the City has been successful in receiving the vast majority of funding requests submitted
to State agencies when requested. The funding has ranged from the State Department of Water Resources for water line
replacement and upgrades to the Department of Housing and Community Development funding HOME funding for Down
Payment Assistance.
Pursuit of federal funding has been very limited by comparison as have request for foundation funding. Limited resources and
staffing has been the root cause for this. There may be funding opportunities the City may be missing. A review of federal and
foundation funding will be undertaken with a report to the City Council as to eligibility and promise for such funding.
Addressing city priorities identified in the Housing Element will be part of the report
The City will continue to pursue grant funding for a variety of purposes, including infrastructure and the provision of
affordable housing.

HE        1.7       Establish Design Standards-Mixed Use and Multi-Family (Continued)
The City has undertaken a project using CDBG PTA funds and City funds to produce graphic-driven design standards that
address mixed use and residential development. The project is also intended to make design review for residential uses an
over-the counter approval. The current design review standards are vague enough that applicants have difficulty
understanding what is required. This extends not only the review process but also the developer’s timeline for submitting a
complete application.
In addition, many projects are now required to go before the Planning Commission for approval, which adds at a minimum
several months to the processing time, even for uses permitted within the zone. The establishment of clearer design standards
will foster more clarity for the development community while reducing processing times. It will also mean that allowed uses
(both commercial and residential) would no longer have to obtain a Conditional Use Permit for Design Review from the
Planning Commission.
Establish Design Standards
The City will complete the design review project in the next fiscal year (2015/16) subsequent to the Land Use Element update.
Workshops for public input will occur in the fall of 2014 with preliminary recommendations for ordinance amendments
approved by City Council in 2015/16. The Planning Commission and City Council will review final draft design standards
2015/16. Once design standards are adopted, allowed uses such as (residential, commercial, and mixed use) would no longer
have to obtain a Conditional Use Permit from the Planning Commission.

The City does not have a development agreement ordinance detailing specific conditions and process by which a development
agreement is used. For projects that have used a Development Agreement, the requirements of the Government Code have
been used and then each agreement has been developed. While that has worked and development agreements signed, it
would be more productive to have the process in code so that prospective developers can have certainty with respect to the
City’s process and potential conditions of the agreements.
Development Agreements
The City will adopt a development agreement that meets State law and provides for the city’s interests in promoting quality
land use development, and if applicable, long term affordability.

would house very low-income seniors. Property purchased for the project is still available and, depending on specific project
requirements, will have infrastructure needs. Habitat for Humanity constructed 2 units during the last planning period but the
organization has not done any housing in the County in the last couple of years.

HE        1.11      Revision of the R-3 and R-4 Zoning Districts to Increase Densities (Continued)
The City has low densities for the two most dense zoning districts that are meant to accommodate affordable housing, R-3 and
R-4. For properties to generate affordable housing, the densities must be higher to account for increased costs, particularly in
the City of Shasta Lake where off-site infrastructure costs are significant compared to the revenue generated from the
housing.
Revision of the R-3 and R-4 Zoning Districts to increase densities
The City will review with affordable housing developers their ability to pay for infrastructure and what densities allow them to
maintain the 20-55 year affordability required when installing affordable housing. The City will increase densities for the zones
but also will look at particular areas for re-zoning to determine what existing sites can accommodate those densities and be
compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.
All multi-family residential will be increased to minimum allowable densities of 20 units (Mullin density) per acre. For the R-4
zone, the text will be changed to have allowed mixed uses that can be developed at 30 units be per acre as well. Where mixed
uses are allowed, the new design standards may mean that mixed use may become an allowed use (as opposed to requiring a

HE        1.12       Rezoning to Address 2003-2008 Housing Element Shortfall (Completed/Removed)
The adopted 2003-2008 Housing Element noted there was a lack of appropriately zoned land to meet the Regional Housing
Need Assessment (RHNA) meaning the City did not meet the requirement to have suitable land for specific numbers of
housing units. That lack is identified in Attachment A and is identified as a 271-unit shortfall. Fifty units of that total are
accommodated by other programs and policies. To address the remaining 221 units and the lack of appropriately zoned
property, the City is incorporating a program to rezone selected candidate properties to accommodate those units.
Rezoning to accommodate 2003-2008 RHNA housing needs
To accommodate the housing need for the remaining 221 units affordable to lower-income households, the City will rezone at
least 7.4 acres of vacant land by August 31, 2010, at a density allowing a minimum of 30 units per acre. Rezoned sites will
include the candidate sites for rezoning, described in Table 39 and will permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily
residential uses by-right (without a conditional use permit, planned unit development permit or other discretionary action)
pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.2 (h). In addition, at least 50 percent of those remaining 271 units will be

infrastructure. The inaccuracy results in longer than needed lead-time for development project review. It also deters
prospective developers because the information is not available to even allow for calculating potential costs. Accurate
mapping will reduce delays and improve customer service.
Utility and other Infrastructure Mapping and Verification
The City’s utilities were installed in the days of paper, not computer or GIS mapping. Unfortunately an additional issue of as-
built maps for some of the utilities not being prepared or retained complicates their use. Updating of the maps with
verification will help the identified issues.

context. Those same zoning standards result in non-conforming lots and structures that may have a useful and future life to
instead have disinvestment occur.
There are close to 200 active code enforcement cases on any given day. Units of housing that are vacant, and/or red-tagged

Review of the barriers to development of affordable housing has been addressed in other programs. Those barriers that are
addressed relate primarily to specific regulatory language such as those that affect second units or non-conforming lots/uses.
However, in reviewing other government barriers, it was determined that a significant cost for affordable housing is the cost of
fees as well as the implementation of infrastructure improvements. Twenty percent of all Redevelopment Agency funds are to
be used to create and assist affordable housing units. The Agency will use those funds for affordable housing and will prioritize
funding for extremely low income units.
Redevelopment Assistance for Affordable Housing
The Redevelopment Agency will institute a program that will provide, based upon proforma needs for affordable housing,
financial assistance, and/or infrastructure installation to make low, very low, and extremely low housing affordable with
extremely low units being a priority. The Agency will know by July 1, 2010, how much funding can be made available. Program
Guidelines will be prepared as well. Priority funding will be made available for extremely low and very low housing units.

State law requires local governments to provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to water and sewer providers. Water
and sewer providers must grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include housing units
affordable to lower-income households. The law prohibits water and sewer providers from denying, conditioning the
approval, or reducing the amount of service for an application for development that includes housing affordable to lower-
income households, unless specific written findings are made.
The City is the service provider for both water and sewer service within the City, and although a written policy has not been
adopted, the City has had adequate capacity to provide service to all development in the City.
Water and Sewer Service Priority for Affordable Housing
The City will adopt written policies and procedures regarding water and sewer service priority. The policy shall specify that
affordable housing units shall receive priority access to water and sewer resources over other new projects should the

Implementation Programs
HE       2.1       Housing Rehabilitation (Single-family) (Changed/Continued)
The City has had very little assisted single-family housing rehabilitation during the planning period (3 units). The
Redevelopment Agency has been primarily engaged in down payment assistance loans and grant applications for
infrastructure supporting housing, water and wastewater grants, etc. However, rehabilitation of the housing stock itself has
not been a priority.
To conserve what stock the City has that currently needs substantial rehabilitation, the Agency City will review the Housing
Stock Inventory to assess potential rehabilitation needs, identify potential loan applicants, and prepare a program to serve
those needs. The City has applied for 2014 CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) funds for rehabilitation of both
single-family and multi-family units. This program can be operated with the program proposed for energy efficiency (HE 5.1) to
maximize use of funds and accommodation of energy efficient measures lowering the overall operational costs for a home.

The City has had no assisted multi-family development rehabilitation during 2009-2014 planning period. The multi-family
housing stock is generally of more recent vintage than the single-family stock with the exception of pockets of cottages that
have been recreational housing or short-term housing in the past.
Housing Rehabilitation (Multifamily)

HE        3.2     Wastewater Capacity Improvement (changed/continued)
The City has identified a need to improve the City's ability to use the full capacity of the wastewater treatment plant.
Currently, the reclaimed water storage reservoir is undersized and does not permit long-term storage, limiting the City's ability
to treat and then retain reclaimed wastewater.
During the last Planning Period, the City explored extending a reclaimed pipeline to Tierra Oaks to use for landscape needs.
The estimated cost of the pipeline extension was not agreeable to Tierra Oaks (subdivision) Board so the City continued to
look at disposal possibilities. The City determined that replacing the outfall to Churn Creek with a reclaimed water outfall is the
most efficient means of disposal. The City now has a consultant preparing NEPA and CEQA documents to apply for permits for
the project.
Pursue Alternatives for Wastewater Capacity and Disposal
The City will continue the process to install a reclaimed water outfall to Churn Creek to include environmental documents,
permits, and funding.

HE        4.1       Mixed-Use Development (Continued)
Although the City introduced mixed-use zoning in the form of the Village Commercial (by right) there has been no
development proposed. This is synonymous with the lack of commercial development in the City. That lack has occurred in
part due to missing or inadequate infrastructure and dilapidated structures and signs, which are visually obvious. It is also due
to Shasta County’s lagging behind the State and Federal economies in improving.
The City has hired EDAW/AECOM to evaluate past economic studies as a peer review and to make recommendations to the
City as to the best use of resources to attract commercial development.
Mixed-Use Development
The City will evaluate commercial parcels and structures as part of the update to the General Plan and the Redevelopment

HE          5.1      Energy Efficiency (Changed/Ongoing)
The City has not addressed energy efficiency for residential uses in a comprehensive way to date. Efforts have been made to
offer rebates for particular weatherization without widespread success. The City is partnering with Shasta County to obtain
weatherization funds. Those funds, combined with available rehabilitation funds, will provide the energy efficiencies needed
for affordable housing. The City now has a ten year plan which outlines sources of energy to be used by the City and its
residents. The Electric Department monitors and proposes the use of Public Benefit funds. Recent years have seen a hiatus in
the use of the funds due to over-expenditure.

HE       6.1        Emergency Shelter (Completed)/Removed
The City has not revised its ordinance to meet State Law with respect to this housing. However, as inquiries have been
received from property owners and service providers, the City has provided the information from the State law denoting that
these uses shall be treated no differently from the residential units within each zone.
The most appropriate zone for the placement of emergency and transitional housing units is within the C-2 or C-2-DR zone
(Community Commercial-Design Review). This zone is applied to portions of two of the city’s major thoroughfares, Cascade
Boulevard and Shasta Dam Boulevard. Those thoroughfares are also on the Redding Area Bus Authority’s bus route for Shasta
Lake, making mass transit by bus available to residents of those units.
In particular, the City has identified one major structure that is currently vacant that could be used for emergency and/or
transitional housing. That structure (with room for over 50 beds) is located at 2096 Cascade Boulevard and was most recently
used for a rehabilitation facility for parolees and people on probation.
The most recent use of the structure had 61 beds, with some rooms with two beds per room. A field visit to the structure
found building and fire code issues that will reduce the available rooms (for example the ability to exit safely from the
structure). For that reason, 50 beds is a more likely number for the structure but a final total will be dependent upon the
program need together with the rehabilitation of portions of the building.
The program is now shut down and the structure is vacant but suitable for use for emergency/ transitional or other supportive
housing. It has a kitchen, meeting rooms, offices, and grounds for outdoor use. Uses within an existing structure do not need
to have a Design Review Permit within the C-2-DR zoning district The property owner has expressed an interest in using the
structure for congregate living or use by another non-profit organization that might have transitional or supportive housing.
Emergency Shelter
The City will amend the Zoning portion of the Municipal Code to incorporate the requirements of State law relative to
emergency shelter and transitional housing. The zones that are proposed for such use are C-2 or C-2-DR (Community
Commercial-Design Review). The City will amend the zone to permit the uses noted as allowed uses by right without a
                                                                                                                              19

can be provided by the Agency. The City shall update the Zoning Ordinance to explicitly define single room occupancy (SRO)
units as a residential use that is allowed “by right” in the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts and all Commercial zones. The Agency will
include within the Five Year Implementation Plan the requirement that of the units receiving Agency assistance, those projects
will be required to have 25% of the units constructed using universal design that will accommodate people with disabilities.

The City has not revised its ordinance to meet State Law with respect to this housing. As inquiries have been received from
property owners and service providers, the City has provided the information from the State law denoting that these uses shall
be treated no differently from the residential units within each zone. To be fully compliant the City will amend its Zoning
Ordinance to provide for that equal treatment.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to clarify that transitional and supportive housing units will be allowed in all zones
where other residential units are allowed with the same standards that must be met by other residential uses.

INTRODUCTION
The City faces continuing ongoing challenges during this Housing Element update, including a
housing market with foreclosures, some of the highest rates of regional unemployment in the
State and the country, and more limited funding for affordable housing, especially with the end
of Redevelopment Agencies, including the Shasta Lake Redevelopment Agency.
Local funding was reduced during the planning period due to the reduction in construction of
new buildings for commercial and industrial use. It is estimated to continue until close to the end
of this planning period (2019).
A significant reduction in the number of foreclosures and short sales of bank owned property in the region. Particularly in Red-
ding, sales will need to occur, as that housing is an attractive alternative to Shasta Lake housing. The exception to that poten-
tially will be affordable homes that can be constructed or purchased and rehabilitated. Funding will also be reduced due to
closures of businesses within existing buildings and the reduction of expansion by existing businesses, some of which have al-
ready occurred.
Finally, elimination of Redevelopment funding by the State will reduce the Agency’s ability to attract business to the communi-
ty, keeping property values and sales tax receipts down. Reducing tax increment funding will also harm the Agency’s commit-
ment to improving infrastructure in support of housing - a significant need for the construction of affordable housing. That
funding is necessary for many sites identified as affordable housing sites.
One bright spot among the gloomy forecasts for economic development and housing construction will be the City’s update of
the remainder of the General Plan. It is expected that the revisions will decrease processing time and the projects that survive
the economic downturn can move ahead more expeditiously.
The information in this Appendix resulted in amended and new programs for the City to be completed within the planning pe-
riod for the 2014-2019 Housing Element. The goals, policies, and implementation programs are meant to be used in tandem.
ARTICLE I           POPULATION, HOUS-
ING AND JOBS TRENDS
Section 1.01        Employment and In-
come Characteristics
The City has a few thriving long-term
commercial businesses including local
grocery stores, the hardware store, ser-
vice stations and professional services.
A fire significantly impacted the building
housing the ACE Hardware store. ACE
had to close for a few months but re-
turned to business in a new location in
the City (on Cascade Boulevard).
Several businesses that started just as
the downturn started were unable to
stay open including Starbucks and sever-
al retail stores.                                                                                    Heritage Roasting Company
On a positive note several small busi-
nesses opened during the planning peri-
od: Heritage Roasting Company and the Wintu Cultural Center (with a museum and gift shop), both of which made major
changes to existing structures and opened during the end of the planning period.
                                                                                                                     Page 2 of 82

  2014                                            HOUSING ELEMENT                         CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
                       Grand Opening of the Wintu Cultural Resource Center - It houses a museum, gift shop, community
                       meeting room with a kitchen and administrative offices for the Wintu Tribe of Northern California.
Retail and professional services are hampered by the lack of buildings that meet code requirements reducing available store-
fronts. Most of those businesses would rather lease only rather than own their structures. Many of the commercial lots are
also small without much depth making their use problematic and hampering the placement of access and parking spaces.
Industrial operations have been more resilient overall. Tenants of the City’s industrial incubator building are experiencing
growth. Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates a large log sawmill in the City, reduced their operations elsewhere, closing
mills in other communities, but maintained their operation in the City.
Knauf Insulation, the second largest industrial operation within the City, is in operation. Both businesses are dependent upon
the construction industry as users of its product(s). Knauf’s product mix has becoming greener and will hopefully be even more
competitive during the next planning period. Sierra Pacific Industries is moving toward sustainable products that should per-
form well in their market.
Sectors of employment found in Shasta Lake as noted in the 2010 Census are shown in Table 1. Comparisons to more current
years can only be used in tandem with information gathered by EDD for the Redding Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of
which Shasta Lake is a part.
One of the major blows to the City’s economy was the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency by the State. The Funding
from the Agency was used to match grant funds and to pay for infrastructure improvements as well as fund housing project
components.
The Agency’s role ended in 2011 but it has taken three years to wind down the activities and the asset considerations. The Suc-
cessor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency (which is the City Council for this period) will monitor the sale of the property
known as the “Commercial Center” located within a block of the main interchange with Interstate 5. Because the property is
                                                                                                                          Page 3 of 82

part of the Successor Agency, review no action on sale or development could occur until the State approved the Long Range
Property Management Plan (LRPMP). Decisions will be reviewed by the local Oversight Board - which includes agencies receiv-
ing property tax within the city limits. The Shasta Lake Housing Authority will be active in looking at housing projects.
The state approval of the LRPMP occurred May 5, 2014. During the last planning period, The City had a development group
ready to move on the property when the economic downturn began after which they reluctantly withdrew their offer.
The City will market the Commercial Center property during the next year. There will once again be an RFP issued to market the
property for sale. Because the Redevelopment Agency is no longer functional, funds that could have aided in off-site infrastruc-
ture installation are not available – as an incentive to develop- the property may sell for less than it once may have sold. During
discussion with potential developers of that property previously, staff was reminded by developers of the need to have local
and regional / rooftop numbers in order to attract business, particularly anchor stores or uses.
                                                                            The relationship of the number of businesses in the

by putting processes in place to assist businesses that want to locate and/or expand within the City including the elimination of
Planning Commission approval for most design review. The implementation of design standards will lead to over the counter
approval and will improve timeframes for building approval.
EMPLOYMENT
The largest employers reported for the City of Shasta Lake are industrial users and include Knauf Insulation and Sierra Pacific
Industries (together with Flake Board Industries). Knauf (which has been in the City for 10 years)) has a building that is valued
at $143 million. Sierra Pacific has land and equipment that constitute a lumber mill that is undervalued at its Proposition 13
value (assessment). Both properties are worth more than their Assessor’s Value due to no turnover and reassessment.
Unemployment in the County has consistently been higher than the majority of the counties in the state; for example, at the
end of March 2014 the unemployment rate was 10.9. While figures are not maintained for the City of Shasta Lake individually,
at a minimum the rate would be the same as the County, if not higher.
The City has land remaining, and available, in the first phase of the Shasta Gateway Industrial Park. The park has a second
phase that has not been developed, and may not be for many years, due to a secondary access that will be very expensive to
install. The secondary access is required for additional development in the Industrial Park due to concerns of the Fire District
for both access to the Park and egress in an emergency. This need has been heightened with the addition of the Trade School
and previous retail (not industrial) uses.
There is an emergency access for the industrial park from Ashby Road through the Knauf property to Newtown Rd. that inter-
sects to Lake Boulevard. The access crosses the Union Pacific Railroad that took the crossing out and was asked to reinstall it.
                                                                                                                       Page 4 of 82

That access will not suffice as a permanent secondary road access. This will be a limiting factor to additional development of
the existing industrial park and its second phase to the south and east of the park.

The Shasta County Economic Development Corporation (SCED) is administering a Microenterprise grant from the State De-
partment of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The funding allows SCED to provide technical assistance, a portion
of which is in the form of a 6-week workshop for small businesses. Upon completion of the workshop, applicants are eligible for
funding to implement a marketing plan for their business.
The City had a study done during the last planning period to evaluate the potential for a hotel complex at one of the City’s
three interchanges. That study allowed that it would be possible to have a successful hotel complex given certain conditions
that the city will pursue with private developers. Wages for industrial users are higher than retail. However, income to City suf-
fers from retail leakage to Redding, Anderson and the County so overall income to the City is an important issue to consider
when addressing development within the City.
The City prepared an RFP to market the property and received an appropriate offer from a development group however, the
group pulled out right before they were to prepare environmental documents indicating that the economic environment was
too uncertain for their potential anchor.
The Agency was told by HCD that to use the 2009 income survey, the Agency could not seek out renters in order to increase
their return rate to a level commensurate with their percentage of the population. Therefore, the income survey is not used

come levels reported in the American Community Survey (ACS) 2008-2012.
Looking at the data above and not accounting for overlap between those with both Social Security income and retirement in-
come, there is close to 50% of the income being generated from government transfer payments apart from income earnings
generated by employment. These payments are generally very low and extremely low-income levels.
There is also 33% of the population receiving Social Security with an additional 11% receiving Supplemental Social Security In-
come payments. These are lower levels of income, which combined with the levels of public assistance, 10%; mean less dispos-
able income available for expenditures, and a lower ability to pay for services.
Alternatively, the structures for this assistance often include cost-of-living increases when private industry does not and so are
deemed more stable income overall.

With the construction of houses in Windsor Estates and Deer Creek Manor (many more expensive houses- $300-400,000), the
income levels that are shown for the City likely increase over time. With the final set of construction of houses in Oakridge Es-
tates (a moderate-income development – under $250,000), there will likely be a higher rate of moderate (or workforce) rates
of income. Windsor Estates is now marketing housing at a reduced level of under $300,000, closer to workforce housing levels
but still not entirely affordable to most middle-income earners.
Both developments provide more units that are available for local workforce housing. While the Redevelopment Agency con-
ducted an income survey in 2009, distributed via utility bills, in the first quarter of 2009, the return on the survey was poor in

in comparison to their portion of the community – making the survey statistically flawed.

1.02      Population and Household Characteristics
Shasta Lake is one of three incorporated cities in Shasta County.- Redding is the major urbanized area in the County with An-
derson and Shasta Lake being very close in population. Each community is distinct; however, Redding and Shasta Lake share
several areas of co-terminus city limits. To the City’s southern border on both the east and the west side of the Interstate 5
freeway, Redding plans significant urbanization including a major shopping center complex. COSTCO will be located south of
the City’s limits off the Oasis interchange. No timeframe is established for construction and opening however it is presumed to
be within this planning period.

Population and housing growth in the City spiked in 2003 at the beginning of the planning period. Since that time both popula-
tion and housing changes have dropped (Table 4). Because of the state of the economy at all levels, the City does not expect
that trend to change. It may well stabilize however because the City has been the source of affordable housing for many years
for this area.
The cost of lots range from $15,000 to $110,000 with most infill lots hovering around 50,000. The cost for lots in this area for
new construction are still below that for other areas in part because of the lack of, or inadequate, infrastructure. Because of
the state of the infrastructure, the City has spent a significant portion of the period applying for, and in some instances, receiv-
ing funding for infrastructure improvements (see Appendix A - Section 3.02)- primarily sewer and water.

Housing Characteristics
Table 6 indicates the age of housing within the City of Shasta Lake that, together with the condition of housing, results in a sig-
nificant issue for the City of Shasta Lake. Nearly 50% of the City’s housing is over 49 years old and constructed as a temporary
use by workers constructing Shasta Dam- i.e. just a few years. Review of housing finds housing with no or poor foundations,
minimum electrical and substandard construction according to the Building Division.

A portion of the survey also included neighborhood conditions, which is not part of the survey required by HCD. Many of the
units that have become abatement cases also have issues that relate to the quality of life in the neighborhood including the
amount of trash, debris, cars, etc. that are stored on or adjacent to the abatement case properties .
This number is consistent with the sampling of 40 units (vacant) the staff has identified as being a high priority needing to be
demolished [See Code Enforcement]. The properties involved with those units can be recycled to produce new housing units
and in some instances additional units.

 The percentage of multi-family units and single-family units are shown below. The 52 units shown as group quarters could
include nursing/residential care homes and facilities for mentally and physically disabled individuals. One building on Cascade
Boulevard has been used as group quarters but is now virtually vacant. The City does not have a large housing stock of multi-
family units; however, they are generally in better condition than the SFD units.
The results of code enforcement activities however indicate that a number of single-family residences are rented as well as
people living in multi-family units. Building permit activity bears out the need for additional multi-family units.

Section 1.03      Housing Needs
Overcrowding
Overcrowding has been traditionally defined as more than one person per room (includes more than just bedrooms). For the
City that would mean that 4.4 % of owners are considered overcrowded as opposed to 6.4% of renters (or 50 % more renters).
While there are units that the ACS shows as being overcrowded there is a remarkably small percentage for both homeowners
and renter households. This is particularly striking given the small sizes of the structure- many houses being less than 1200 sqft.
Overcrowding is one need for housing that can be addressed through rehabilitation and more accessory dwellings in addition
to the construction of multi-family dwelling units. Affordability also offers renters in overcrowded situations to move to single
family structures that more often offer additional bedrooms or rooms available for bedrooms.
                                                                                                                      Page 12 of 82

NOTE: This Table will be updated as part of the Land Use Element update.
However, the best answer to overcrowding is building larger units, with more rooms, either bedrooms or total rooms. The City
will address this need during the preparation of an infill report, as those will likely be the most affordable units for lower in-
come users (owners and renters) and during the preparation of a Zoning Report that addresses increasing the density allowed
for R-3 and R-4 zoning districts. The new affordable housing subdivision (Cappuccino Court) will include mainly 3-bedroom
houses. It will be very hard to construct 4- bedroom homes without significant subsidies.
Overpayment
Table 11 describes the overpayment by sectors of the housing market. Two thirds of the people in the extremely low-income
levels who are homeowners are overpaying for their housing as opposed for example to 13.8% of the people with moderate-
income levels. The table below indicates that significant percentages of low-income renters and homeowners are overpaying
for their housing.

The City has been successful with a Down Payment Assistance Program (DAP) that has used both HOME/CalHOME funds as well
as Redevelopment Agency Low/Mod 20% Set-Aside funds to address overpayment by low/mod income homebuyers’ as well as
Program Income funds ( returned as loans are paid or property sold). All sectors of households are overpaying with the excep-
tion of above - moderate households. New construction to increase the housing stock will make a difference. Homeowners are
overpaying by 63.3 % and renters are overpaying by nearly 72%.
To address these needs shown above, the City has revised the programs shown in the 2009-2014 Housing Element that refer
to rehabilitation of rental units and to reflect looking at any funding available to rehabilitate those units. The City purchased
property on Morning Star Way (in 2006) to market to non-profit developers of multi-family units with a focus on very - low and
low-income residents. That property will add a minimum of 5 multi-family units or 10 with increased density when and if it has
a development with funding. Adjoining properties are for sale but the City has no funding to purchase the property.
Vacancy rates are another factor in determining whether a payment will become overpayment. It is generally accepted that
when the vacancy rate moves below 5%, the market is sufficiently tight that prices/rents begin to rise. For the City of Shasta
Lake the stated vacancy rate has hovered at 9% since 2000 according to the Department of Finance. The City believes however
                                                                                                                     Page 14 of 82

that the rate noted is more likely the result of abandoned houses being counted as vacant which may mean the vacancy rate is
actually lower.
Some of those units are on the caseload for abatement because they are vacant and require either substantial rehabilitation or
demolition and new construction to become habitable units. A portion of those could be rehabilitated and re-inhabited. This
possible factor will be investigated more as part of mapping code enforcement cases and correlating them with housing condi-
tion and vacancy numbers.
Section 1.04 Special Housing Needs
Several tables describe housing needs for special populations including disabled and elderly (senior) populations (Tables 13-16)
as well as large and female-headed households.
 Disability: There are also significant numbers of people identified with a disability of one kind or another. As shown in the ta-
bles below there is a constellation of disabilities- some of which may need the reasonable accommodation that has been put
into the City’s Municipal Code as well as other persons who may have disabilities that would be more manageable if there was
universal design being used.
The Planning Commission has determined that it is appropriate to require that all Agency and City funded housing projects will
ensure that 25% of the units are constructed using universal design to accommodate people with disabilities. Not all disabilities
require physical changes but instead accommodation that will also be required. That will be a minimum with the City looking at
a higher percentage where warranted and affordable. As part of the development of extremely low and low income senior and
low/mod income multifamily housing, the City will require that 25% of the affordable units to be constructed meet universal
design requirements.

Farm Workers
According to the 2012 Agricultural Census, there were only 282 farms in Shasta County with 1067 workers. There were 114
workers that worked over 150 days and 200 workers that worked less than 150 days. In the previous 2007 Agricultural Census,
there were seven farms with over 10 workers and now there are 25 workers where they worked over 150 days, a small in-
crease, but an increase one contributing factor to overall number of farms may be the increase in farmer’s markets in the
County. Overall, there are 282 farms, 1067 workers with a total payroll of $ 11,947,000 - an increase of $3,557,000. No infor-
mation specific to Shasta Lake is available.
Because there are no agricultural operations within the City, there is no obvious place for traditional farm worker housing - that
which would be located on or close to an actual agricultural operation to accommodate identified farm workers.
However, those same families can be presumed to be in the low and very low income categories given the wages traditionally
paid to farm workers – minimum wage and slightly higher ( i.e. about $16,640 -$20,000). The City has determined that housing
for these families should be accommodated with the affordable housing categories of low and very low income rather than
separated into housing solely for farm workers.
Seniors
With respect to extremely low and very low- income seniors, the City/Agency has been working for the last three years with
Northern Valley Catholic Social Services (NVCSS) to find a site to build units for that population.

 Initially, in 2006, the Agency purchased property that would have accommodated five units without a density bonus. In 2008,
 the Agency acquired a second set of sites on Meade Street near its intersection with Locust, which, at a minimum, would per-
 mit construction of 10-30 units.
 The Agency is working with NVCSS to determine off-site what density bonus could be allowed for the site. NVCSS applied for
 HUD 202 funding with the Agency assisting with the site and off- site improvement, however they were not funded. They also
 applied through the State for tax credit funds but did not receive approval. The city will be reviewing the status of this project
 in the early portions of the planning period.

The City is maintaining the DAP (Down Payment Assistance Program), a program that assists households meeting household
income requirements. That program currently indicates that dwellings that cost $238,000 and below can be considered for
purchase using the program.
Because all potential homeowners are classified according to the HUD median income levels or California Income levels de-
pending upon the source of the program funds, purchase of the units is still subject to affordability requirements as they apply
to each applicant.
Therefore, the top ranges of housing - with a cost of over $173,000 - are affordable to middle income households but not the
low, very low or extremely low. Neither very low nor extremely low would be expected to be homeowners but would instead
be more likely to rent. Low-income residents may be able to become homeowners if they qualify for the Down Payment Assis-
tance Program given low interest rates and a low or subsidized down payment.
Not all of the units are affordable housing where residents with below 80% of the median income could qualify. However,
those units that are most needed and so likely to be purchased by the population in Shasta Lake are the two and three bed-
room units of which there is more of a selection and all of the units fall under the criteria that has been established for the use
of affordable housing.
Comparison of the costs for the for-sale properties and the foreclosure properties indicates that there are some differences
between them. The better comparisons come where there are more significant numbers of units that are for sale or in foreclo-
sure. Because there are few one, four, and five, bedroom houses in either category comparisons between them are weak.
The median prices for the majority of the for-sale dwelling units are less than those units that are in foreclosure with the excep-
tion of the few four bedroom units for sale or are a foreclosure sale.

Rents advertised for Shasta Lake from April 10 to May 10, 2014 are weighted towards the rental of SFDs as opposed to apart-
ments. There were 51 housing units for rent (14 MFD and 37 SFD). The median rents were as follows:

There were no four or five (or more) bedroom units, either MFD or SFD, and only one studio available. The studio/cottage and
one apartment were available from multi-family stock. The remainder were SFD units with the majority of them 3 bedroom
units. Of the SFD available for rent, some of those are actually units that are for-sale. While they are not permanent rentals,
they are currently available and the City expects that a similar number will continue to be available to rent.
There are wide variances in rental costs for one and three bedroom units. – more than double the cost. However, the rental
costs for two bedroom units are reasonably related to the structure and their size. Relative to affordability, HUD income levels
for 2014 were used to determine if these rental costs are generally affordable.
The most significant issue relative to affordability is that the 2010 Census notes that the median income for Shasta Lake in 2009
was $26,275 compared to the Shasta County’s median income of $34,335, or 24% less. The current year county median is
$55,800 with no comparable amount for the City however; it can be safely assumed that there is still a 24% difference between
the City and the County medians making the City median closer to $42,408.

At-Risk Housing
The City has two multi-family housing developments that are at-risk housing and Valley Ridge Senior Apartments (37) and Tara
Hills Apartments (49). The units have been stable since their inception and are model examples of units that work well in the
City.
The City does not expect these units to be terminated; however, a program was been added that requires more, and regular,
contact with the owners. The program to plan for the occasion that the property owners want to sell the properties or, at the
end of their affordability periods, want to convert to market rate housing units. Having a plan in place that has been adopted
by the City will assist in ensuring decisions are not done in a panic.
The City has two affordable housing developments in the City that were at-risk developments during the last planning period:
the Deer Creek Apartments at 1660 Deer Creek Avenue (9 multi-family units) and Meade Street, and the Valley Ridge Senior
Housing development on Morning Star Way (37 senior apartment units + one manager’s unit). Neither development has been
sold.
Deer Creek Apartments:
The owners of the Deer Creek Apartments received their 50-year loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on April
29, 1988. They are funded through the Rural Rental Housing Program (RRH) with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which had
a 20-year low-income rental agreement connected to it. The term of this agreement expired on May 28, 2008. According to
USDA, these units did not have a RUP (Restrictive Use Period) and so the owner was allowed to pay off the USDA loan.
                                                                       The owners have indicated that they encourage tenants with
                                                                       Section 8 vouchers to be placed in these units; however, the

Valley Ridge Senior Apartments (37):
The owners of the Valley Ridge Senior Apartments received their 50-year USDA loan on December 19, 1991, which is scheduled
to expire on that date in 2041, 32 years from now. They also received funding through the Tax Credit Allocation Committee
(TCAC) and Rural Development (RD) Farm Homes Program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has a 20-year low-
income rental agreement connected to it.
The term of this agreement expired on December 18, 2011, within the planning period. This complex has 38 units with 37 as-
sisted units for seniors. A manager lives on the premises in the thirty-eighth unit. As noted in the proposed program, City staff
will monitor the loans for this complex as noted in Policy HP-34, and the associated Implementation Program 2.3.

This is a Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC project that was constructed in 1999 at the intersection of Riddle Road and Cas-
cade Boulevard. This is an affordable housing complex with 49 units.
Conservation versus Preservation
Current construction costs are in flux due to the state of the economy and the downturn in building construction. The City of
Shasta Lake has city limits in common with the City of Redding. The Redding area has been noted as one of the worst regions in
the country for building construction with one of the biggest downturns for construction in the country. Costs for construction
generally have dropped; however, initial purchase or construction funding is still a problem for builders as is takeout financing.
The City has not had a multi-family residential unit built since 2004. That unit was a duplex that was constructed in an R-3 zone
on a relatively level parcel with infrastructure adjacent to the parcel. The construction cost for that unit was $164,348 for a
total of 3,066 square feet (dwelling plus garage). The unit cost (less the garage) was roughly $70 / square foot without the cost
of land and off-site infrastructure costs. Those units are managed as market rate units, not affordable units. These units were
also constructed prior to the City implementing a substantial increase in impact fees, including transportation and park impact
fees, and connection fees for utilities. The fees total close over $30,000 for a single-family residence.
According to Northern Valley Catholic Social Services (NVCSS) which has constructed multi-family units in Redding and Chico as
recently as 2009, the average cost per square foot for construction of multi-family units has been $120-130 (construction only).
That is an average cost with specific units ranging both higher and lower (if an elevator is required there would be additional
costs). Infrastructure costs and site preparation/landscaping costs add another $55-65 per square foot for a total cost of $185-
195 per square foot.
Affordable units are typically smaller than market rate units. The Deer Creek apartments have five 2-bedroom apartments that
are 791 sq.ft. each and four 1-bedrooms (640 sq.ft.) for a total 6,515 sq.ft for the entire complex without accounting for the
carports available on-site. While covered parking is not required for multi-family, it is likely that some parking would be cov-
ered, as is the case for the Deer Creek Apartments. Affordable units usually include, as is proposed by NVCSS, universal con-
struction, which is also more costly.
Using the higher cost is a realistic means of determining the total costs for construction of (and land purchase, improvements,
etc.). Construction costs for a property this size would be approximately $1,270,425 plus an additional minimum of $100,000
for land costs for a total of $1,370,425. This also assumes there are no utility connection fees to be assessed – which could add
an additional amount close to $250,000 making the total closer to $1.6 million.

Two multi-family residential complexes have been for sale. One is a very small duplex - not comparable to the Valley Ridge Sen-
ior Complex. Purchase of a complex for sale would be one means of establishing comparable affordability. Deer Creek could be
replaced through purchase of several sets of duplexes or triplexes, but it would be more difficult to assemble and manage units
if the same owner does not own them.
Maintenance, i.e. conserving these units in place as affordable units, is much more affordable and cost-efficient than new con-
struction of additional units
Section 1.06       Opportunities for Energy Conservation
The City has a Residential Energy Efficiency Rebate Program open to all City residential customers. Items eligible for rebates
include electric appliances (refrigerators, clothes washers, dishwashers, and water heaters); electric heating and air condition-
ing units; and weatherization (retrofit insulation and replacement windows).
While the City applied for funds together with a consortium that included the County, the project was not funded and the fund-
ing is no longer available.
The City also implemented a retail solar rebate program effective January 1, 2008, with a goal to increase electrical energy pro-
duction from photovoltaic systems over a ten-year period. The maximum rebate amount for projects less than 5,000 kW is
$14,000. A declining rebate schedule was developed by the California Energy Commission that started with $2.80 per Watt and
decreasing by 7% annually, and the City adopted this schedule.
The City enforces current State standards for energy efficiency in new construction. All new construction must conform to Title
24 of the California Administrative Code, which was established in 1978 to ensure all new construction meets a minimum level
of energy efficiency standards. The Green standards due to go into effect on July 1, 2014 will be enforced by the City Building
Official.
The Housing Element includes development of a program to use the resources of the Electric Department to develop a program
for the installation of energy efficiency measures. It also addresses the City’s exemption from the Solar Shade Act and removing
that exemption as a part of the changes to the Municipal Code (Zoning and Subdivision sections).
To update this in the next planning period as part of the Land Use Element there will be discussion with the Planning Commis-
sion and the City Council concerning rates and managing the cost of energy while reducing the amount use as well as the move
to Green Energy Sources.

Fees assessed for regulatory applications are shown in Tables 20-22. The City’s permit fees for many years did not cover the
cost of processing development projects through the regulatory approvals needed for development and ultimately, construc-
tion. The new permit fees were adopted in 2007 and are based on a time and materials survey. Other than an annual inflation
escalator, permit fees have not increased since then. Due to staffing changes and an increase in internal operating costs, it is
likely these fees do not reflect full cost recovery. Any change that involves more than that permitted by the fee study would
have to have another study completed.
Fees for many approvals are reviewed and updated to reflect actual cost with costs for affordable housing reduced based upon
complete applications and affordability development agreements.
No change is proposed, which should help all applicants, including those for affordable housing projects, by subsidizing a por-
tion of the actual cost for services through the General Fund. The fees in parentheses in Table 20 are pre-application fees. If a
full application is submitted within a year of the pre-application, then the pre-application fee is applied to the permit fee. The
pre-application fees were reviewed and lowered in many instances. All applications also have maintenance surcharges of $35
for General Plan maintenance and $35 for information technology. The first fee listed is the 2009 fee and the second fee is the
fee in 2014.

 The fees listed in Table 20-22 are commensurate with local fees in the region for similar applications/approvals. No changes are
 proposed in the fees as part of the Housing Element. The initial fees are fees from the 2009-2014 Housing Element with the
 highlighted fees being the 2014 fees.

 Section 2.02        Building Permit and Infrastructure Impact Fees
 Impact fees assessed for new construction and reconstruction/re-establishment of use of units not used in the last three years
 are shown in Table 17 above. Over the past several years, the City completed Master Plans and impact fee studies to identify
 needed infrastructure improvements throughout the City as follows:
                                                 Water Master Plan                        2004

 The City will be updating the Water and Wastewater Plans in the next year if funding is received. All Impact Fees include an
 inflation escalator and are adjusted annually on January 1, with the exception of the Electric Connection fee, that is increased
 annually on July 1. Impact fees had not been increased since prior to the City’s incorporation and did not adequately cover the
 costs to complete needed infrastructure improvements.
                                                                                                                                 Page 25 of 82

 As with many impact fees, because the fees were implemented they have made it possible for smaller projects to pay the fees
 rather than have to go through a more thorough, and expensive, environmental review that would be potentially much more
 expensive and/or have to provide the related off-site infrastructure.
 It also allowed the City to capture fees from units that did not pay fees when the water and wastewater plants were expanded
 and improved. Now they pay their fair share of those plant and operating costs. This will permit the City to pay for necessary
 improvements to the plant(s) and other infrastructure. [See Section 3.02 - On/Off Site Infrastructure Improvements]
 In response to the recent downturn in the market, City Council adopted an interim Impact/Connection Fee Deferral Program in
 December 2008 to help stimulate residential development and to be responsive to the needs of property owners and develop-
 ers. The program allows payment of utility and connection fees until just prior to connection of utilities and final building in-
 spection. Builders could take out a building permit, start construction, and virtually complete construction before having to pay
 the fees.
 In June 2009, the City Council extended the program through December 2009, and has subsequently continued the program
 through to the present. Since initial adoption in December 2008, few property owners have taken advantage of the program
 and it does not appear the program has resulted in an increase in residential development over what might already have been
 constructed.

Table 23A indicates the typical building permit and utility impact/connection fees associated with construction of a single-
family residential dwelling unit. The table shows fees both for a 1,300 square foot house and a 1,600 square foot house, both
with attached 440 square foot garages.
Table 23B indicates typical building permit and utility impact/connection fees associated with construction of a four-unit multi-
family apartment building.
The City’s fee schedules were established based on nexus studies. The impact and building permit fees' schedules comply with
the California Government Code Section 66000 et seq., the Mitigation Fee Act. In addition to the fees described above, appli-
cants for major subdivision maps are required to dedicate land for neighborhood parks or pay an in-lieu fee. The dedication
requirement is one acre per 100 lots. The in-lieu fee is currently $747 per lot for single-family residential projects and $680 per
unit for multi-family residential projects.
These fees clearly add to the cost of housing; however, other programs are available to provide incentives such as density bo-
nuses, the use of Planned Development zoning, and state and federal construction funding programs, which significantly re-
duces overall construction costs. The City applies in each grant category for that funding and is successful much of the time.
The City implemented a deferred fee program in 2008 that allows an applicant to pay impact and utility connection fees when
construction is complete rather than at the time that a building permit is issued. Many of the fees do not represent full cost
recovery and are subsidized by the City’s General Fund.

These fees are in line with other cities in the region. Depending on housing unit size and type, it is estimated City and school
district fees amount to between ten and thirteen percent of the total cost of each moderate and above- moderate housing
unit. However, improvements funded by these fees are deemed necessary to maintain the health, safety, and quality of life
desired by City residents, and the City has determined its fee structure does not represent a constraint on overall development
that is dissimilar to other jurisdictions in California.
There is a constraint however for low, very low, and extremely low-income housing units. For those units the impact ranges
from being 25-33%. The City had added an Implementation Program (1.5) in the last Housing Element to look at having the Re-
development Agency assist affordable housing with the fees and/or infrastructure installation and/or seek funding. With the
elimination of Agencies in California, those funds are no longer available for assistance. The City has added a separate Imple-
mentation Program to look at where the fees can be waived, partially waived or other funding sought through grants.
The City has added a program to prioritize funding for infrastructure in looking at local (Agency), State, and Federal funding for
infrastructure in support of affordable housing unit construction. The City’s Master plans for water and sewer indicate that
laterals, in particular for sewer, are in need of replacement. Beyond funding for trunk line, replacement there is a need to re-
place laterals- and affordable housing will need support to be able to make those replacements.
Other fees that may occur for housing developments include fees assessed by the Shasta Lake Fire Protection District (District)
and the Gateway School District. Those fees are collected by the districts separately from the fees collected by the City. How-
ever, both of those districts have adopted fees that also reflect their costs for infrastructure. In the case of the school district,

Section    2.03    Processing Time
The development review and permitting process ensures that new residential projects develop in an orderly manner, con-
sistent with the General Plan and the Zoning Code. The City’s development permitting process includes the following levels:
1.        Ministerial review by City staff: City staff is authorized to approve site plans and improvement plans for individual
          single-family homes and accessory units (as part of the Affordable Housing Chapter). Staff also approves lot line ad-
          justments and encroachment permits administratively.
2.        Administrative review by Development Services Director. The Zoning Code includes several project types that are
          allowed pursuant to a Director-issued administrative permit.
3.        Discretionary review by the Planning Commission at a public hearing. Applications for subdivision (tract and parcel)
          maps use permits and variances require that findings be made and that the public be invited to comment on the pro-
          ject.
4.        Discretionary review by the City Council following recommendation of the Planning Commission. Applications for
          general plan amendments and rezones require that the Planning Commission conduct a public hearing and make a
          written recommendation to City Council. City Council also conducts a public hearing prior to taking action on the item.
The time required to process a project varies greatly and is directly related to the size and complexity of the proposal and the
number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process, including satisfying the requirements of the California Envi-
ronmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Complex, larger projects may require multiple discretionary permits, which are typically processed concurrently. It should be
noted many projects have taken several months or years to be approved because the applicants for development approvals
have consistently submitted incomplete applications or proposed significant modifications to the project, requiring additional
review.
In some cases, the process also may be longer because of issues with the City’s infrastructure and the data available for those
infrastructure areas. Subsequently, that means applicants may take much longer to get to a stage where an application is
complete and both the applicant and the City’s information is accurate and usable for decision-making.
Table 24 depicts the typical processing timeframes. The timeframes behind the original timeframes in 2009 are reduced due to
the slowdown of discretionary permit requests. Those timeframes would increase should the permit load increase back to the
levels of 2008/09.
The City offers applicants a pre-application review via weekly Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings. These meetings
allow discussion and identification of potential issues by various City departments and the Shasta Lake Fire Protection District
(SLFPD). Members include the City Engineer, Public Works Director, Electric Department, Wastewater Treatment Superinten-
dent, Water Treatment Superintendent, Building Official, Senior Planner, Permit Center Manager, and SLFPD Battalion Chief.
The City then provides comments to the applicant prior to submittal of a formal application and application fees. The fees for a
pre-application range from $100 for a residential building permit to $500 for a general plan amendment. This fee is applied to
the application fee if submitted within one year from the date of the pre-application. This assists both customers and staff in
identifying issues early – which helps the customer determine whether to proceed.
The City can improve its project tracking to ensure that all developments meet the timelines established by the State under the
Permit Streamlining Act.
One issue for the City is the accuracy of existing data for the City’s infrastructure systems. If that information becomes more
accurate, processing times could be dramatically reduced. Updating data to reflect actual line size and placement would be of
great assistance to the processing of development projects.

Types of Housing Allowed
The City is responsible for providing for the development of an array of housing types suitable for all economic segments of the
community. The Housing Element must describe how the City's Municipal Code allows for different types of housing to meet
the needs of its residents. Housing types include single-family dwellings, duplexes, residential care homes, second units, manu-
factured homes, mobile homes, group residential homes, multiple unit dwellings, supportive housing, and single-room occu-
pancy units. Tables 26 below summarize the housing types permitted by right and those that require an administrative permit
or use permit.
Except for Village Commercial, all of the commercial districts require a Use Permit for housing units to be established. That re-
quirement would include all types of housing (Homeless and transitional shelters below). Several programs have been added to
address second (and other accessory) units (Program HE 1.5) as well as transitional and emergency units (Program No. HE 6.1).

Design Review
Some zoning districts are combined with the Design Review zoning district (DR) which, unless a use occurs within an existing
building, requires a Use Permit for all uses. A Use Permit requires a Public Hearing before the Planning Commission extending
the time necessary for project approval. An additional layer of review is added for permitted (allowed uses) uses normally con-
sidered ministerial uses. As a ministerial use, the City could process those developments at the same time as a Building Permit.
The City has added Program No. 1.5 to put the design standard in place so that design review is ministerial. The City looks for-
ward to the update of the Land Use Element during FY 2014/2015.

  2014                                              HOUSING ELEMENT                        CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Section 2.05      Parking Standards
As indicated in Table 27, the City’s parking requirements for residential districts vary by housing type, the number of units, and
parking needs. Single-family units are required to have two parking spaces. Only spaces in the R-1 zone district are required to
be covered (garage or carport). Most developers opt to construct garages rather than carports. In addition, due to the proximi-
ty to Shasta Lake, for many single-family units in the City, parking is also provided on-site for recreational vehicles, boats, and
other watercraft. Space for that type of parking is often desired for single-family development and is required for multi-family
units (1 RV space per 10 units). The Zoning Code does provide for parking reductions on a case-by-case basis with issuance of a
minor use permit, and for affordable housing development as provided by State Density Bonus law.
Garages add to the development cost for housing. Excessive parking standards can pose a significant constraint to housing de-
velopment by increasing development costs and reducing the potential land availability for project amenities or additional units
and are not reflective of actual parking demand. The City will review current parking requirements as part of the update of the
General Plan Land Use Element to determine how parking requirements impact the overall cost of affordable units.
Section 2.06        Emergency/ Transitional Housing
The City does not have a record of transitional housing units located within the City. The City has had one large transition-
al/supportive housing program, Cornerstone Recovery Systems, approved in June 2002 but which closed in early 2009. The
program was a drug and alcohol treatment center for adult men and included 26 sleeping rooms with 61 beds.
Program participants entered the program through direct referral from County Drug and Alcohol agencies, with approximately
10 percent of individuals referred through Proposition 36 programs (Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000),
which allows certain non-violent adults who use or possess illegal drugs to receive drug treatment rather than incarceration.
The building was vacant and for sale. In 2013, the Vietnam Veterans’ organization proposed using it for transitional uses and
the City applied for a Community Development Block Grant that was not funded. HCD said having an option to buy (not owner-
ship) was one negative while the other was having a contractor’s estimate for building costs as opposed to having an engineer’s
estimate. The Veterans moved on to other projects in the State after the denial.
 In 2013, a non-profit group that operates transitional housing in Oroville purchased the same building (at 2096 Cascade Boule-
vard). The City approved a Use Permit for the use in October 2013 that will include transitional housing for persons with mental
health issues and possibly some permanent housing. The City received a Building Permit application for major changes shortly
after that approval. The applicant is working through their financing and detailed architectural changes currently.
There is currently no emergency housing within the City. The City has used the Point-in-Time survey prepared by People of Pro-
gress and the City of Redding in Table 28. Additional information about facility use is included in the next Table.
As part of the 2009-2014 Housing Element’s programs, pursuant to SB 2 (Government Code Section 65583 et seq.), the City
identified one zoning district, the C-2-DR zone, as a zone district where at least one new emergency shelter can be located
without a conditional use permit or any discretionary permits. Transitional and supportive housing will be defined as a residen-
tial use of property, subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same
zone.
Because residential uses are either not allowed or are required to get a Use Permit in the C-2 –DR zone, the district has been
amended to permit residential uses with the use of standards to define the use and relationship to commercial uses in the dis-
tricts. The C-2 DR district has the greatest access to retail uses and transit for low-income users as well as larger parcels more
suited to an increased residential use. Nearly all supportive services for emergency shelter users are located within Redding
making transit an important component. Program HE 6.1 addresses the change in the C-2-DR district described.
In 2012, People of Progress stopped doing the yearlong survey and instead went to the point-in-time survey method used by other communi-
ties who work with HUD wishing to access funding for homeless populations. The information in Table 28 is based upon that Point –in-Time
survey.

Locally there are a number of churches that have pantries available for food distribution. The City refers people to those pan-
tries so they do not have to go into Redding.
Section 2.07        Non-Conforming Structures/ Lots Requirements
The City has many non-conforming lots and structures which were lawful when established but do not conform to current de-
velopment standards or zoning codes.
Many lots are as small as 4,000 square feet, and some even less, and it is often difficult to meet those standards, especially
required setbacks. In addition, for small lots in the Summit City area of Shasta Lake, use of the lot is complicated by the fact
that there is no public sewer in that area and extension of sewer to the area would be cost prohibitive for a private develop-
ment. The Zoning Code allows these substandard lots, which contain less area than is currently required, if all other develop-
ment standards of the zone district are met or a variance is approved.
Non-conforming structures provide another challenge because many units were constructed in the 1930s – 1940s and some in
the 1950’s, which were intended only as temporary housing for workers constructing Shasta Dam. The age of City of Shasta
Lake housing structures is listed in Table 6.
If the structures/buildings had been built to any code, and maintained through the years, those structures might be a source of
housing available for rehabilitation and/or conservation. Unfortunately, that is not the case with many of the structures, and
they are identified as code enforcement cases according to the City’s Code Enforcement Officer.
The Non-Conforming Uses section of the Zoning Ordinance is restrictive in that only a minimal amount of maintenance and
repairs can be made to any non-conforming structure, and no structural alterations can be made. The cost of maintenance and
repairs cannot exceed 25 percent of the current appraised value of the structure. This has limited users who would otherwise
bring such structures up to Code.
While the Non-Conforming Uses section should not be changed to permit long-term use of structures that are unsafe to inhab-
it, the ordinance should be reviewed to determine what amendments could be made to encourage the conservation of existing
housing through rehabilitation or improvement. Program No. HE 1.4 was added to look at potential changes to the non-
conforming use section of the Zoning Ordinance in order to conserve existing housing that can be rehabilitated and improved.
Section 2.08        Second Dwelling Units /Accessory Units
In 2004, the City adopted a Second Dwelling Unit ordinance that met the requirements of State law at that time. The ordi-
nance allowed an attached or detached second dwelling unit, on any lot zoned for single-family residential use, without discre-
tionary review by the City. As part of the previous Housing Element planning period the City prepared an Affordable Housing
Chapter. The Chapter includes the various Implementation Programs found in the Appendix E of this housing element.
The new chapter provides for minimum requirements; permits such units as an ministerial action through a building permit. It
also increased the size of units permitted by using a floor area ration as opposed to the 30% rule. Previously a second unit
could only be permitted if it was 30% less of the size of the primary unit. In Shasta Lake that meant no second/accessory unit or
very small units. The new ordinance also allows the property owner to determine which unit will be the primary unit allowing
an additional unit on the property that may be larger than the first unit.
The City had met with representatives from the Shasta County Board of Realtors who requested amending the ordinance to
allow second units to be established at a higher density than identified in the General Plan, provided the lot frontage is a mini-
mum of 60 feet and the lot is a minimum of 6,000 square feet, and to allow each unit to be separately metered for utilities.
The Board of Realtors also recommended the second unit be limited to no more than three bedrooms, and the rear yard set-

The City has implemented the requests of the Board of Realtors with the new Affordable Housing Chapter with the exception
of the limit on bedrooms.
Section 2.09        Building/Fire Codes – Enforcement
The State requires each local agency to adopt building code requirements to ensure a minimum level of quality in new con-
struction. The City has the option to either adopt the standards contained in the California Building Code (CBC), or they may
adopt more stringent construction standards. The development of housing may be constrained if the more stringent standards
increase the cost of construction, design, materials, or labor.
The Shasta Lake Fire Protection District (SLFPD) reviews all building plans for new construction for conformity with the Califor-
nia Fire Code prior to submittal of the plans and building permit application to the City. The City and SLFPD collaborate on Code
Enforcement issues, and enforcement of the Fire Code is the responsibility of the SLFPD.
The City coordinates with the Shasta County Environmental Health Department (EHD) that acts as the Local Enforcement Agen-
cy (LEA) for the City. EHD issues septic tank permits, restaurant clearances and monitors business plans for hazardous waste
generated by uses.
Building and Zoning Code enforcement is the responsibility of the City’s Code Enforcement Officer who is positioned in the De-
velopment Services Department and reports to the Building Official. There was an average of 200 open cases at any given
time, which may include trash, junkyards, junk cars, substandard housing, illegal businesses, Building Code violations, Zoning
Ordinance violations, or a combination of these violations.
The City’s first step with all code enforcement actions is to seek compliance rather than just strict enforcement. Accordingly,
the property owner is contacted for a discussion of the issues and possible remedies. In some circumstances, the City’s dump-
ster program has been a source of resolving a code enforcement issue. Low-income residents can get a dumpster, upon qualifi-
cation, to use to remove refuse from their residence and/or lot.
For buildings, however, the violations can be more severe. In particular, where structures have not been maintained and have
been abandoned as well, the Code Enforcement Officer must post the building as a dangerous building and unsafe to occupy.
In many cases, the structure has not been secured, which can lead to much more deterioration. The City had identified 40
housing units that should be demolished to prevent their unsafe use as substandard housing and to eliminate a fire hazard. The
majority of these were abated using Neighborhood Stabilization funding in 2010. Unfortunately, there have been many units to
take their place through lack of maintenance or other issues.
When the property owner does not comply following the City’s initial contact, the City proceeds with the Enforcement Process
that requires a series of notices followed by an Administrative Hearing. The Hearing Officer makes a determination as to
whether the circumstances merit enforcement, what actions are required to obtain compliance, and a timeframe for complet-
ing the required actions. If the property owner fails to complete the actions as directed, the City can complete the work, which
may include removing junk and debris from a property or demolishing a dilapidated structure. The cost of the cleanup is rec-
orded as a lien against the property.
There are some properties with repeated, ongoing violations, and the City can report these cases to the State Franchise Tax
Board (the State Treasurer’s Office). The property owner is informed that a tax deduction may not be allowed for interest, tax-
es, depreciation, or amortization paid or incurred in the taxable year. The State would reserve those funds accruing to the
property in a fund made available to the City for use in addressing the violations.
Section 2.10        Reasonable Accommodation
Housing Element law requires than in addition to the needs analysis for persons with disabilities, the Housing Element must
analyze potential government constraints to the development, improvement and maintenance of housing for persons with
disabilities, demonstrate local efforts to remove any such constraints and provide for reasonable accommodations for persons
with disabilities through programs that remove constraints.
As stated above, the City adopted the 2007 CBC and no local amendments have been made to the Code that might diminish
the ability to accommodate housing development for persons with disabilities. The current Zoning Code defines "Group foster
home" as “a state or county authorized, certified or licensed foster care facility, serving more than six mentally disordered or
otherwise handicapped persons or dependent or neglected children, which provides care on a twenty-four (24) hour basis; or
                                                                                                                     Page 36 of 82

such a facility, serving more than six children or adults, which is licensed by the state or county or certified by a state-licensed
child placement agency and is institutional or medical in nature.”
Group foster homes, as defined above, are allowed in the I-R, R-R, R-2 and R-3 zoning districts pursuant to issuance of a use
permit. Parking requirements for a group home are the same as for multi-family residential uses. The current code does not
include separation distance requirements for special needs housing developments. Licensed residential care facilities with
fewer than six persons are allowed outright in single-family zone districts.
The City has not had a specific request for reasonable accommodation during the previous planning period. Individuals inquir-
ing about retrofits on private property are provided with CBC requirements for Housing Accessibility (CBC Chapter 11A). The
City Building Official reviews all plans and conducts all inspections from retrofits to existing facilities for compliance with the
CBC.
The City reasonable accommodation provision was incorporated into the Affordable Housing Chapter. It addresses needs for
persons with disabilities with respect to Zoning, Subdivision and Building activity to ensure equal access to housing.
Policies and procedures are ministerial and include but not be limited to identifying who may request a reasonable accommo-
dation (i.e., persons with disabilities, family-members, landlords, etc.), timeframes for decision-making, and provision for relief
from certain land-use, zoning, or building regulations that may constrain housing for persons with disabilities. The City will also
create a public information brochure on reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities and provide that information
on the City’s website. Program HE 6.4 from the 2009-2014 Housing Element has been implemented (see Appendix E).

ARTICLE III         NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Section 3.01        Land and Construction Financing Costs
Land costs in Shasta Lake are significantly below other cities in the area, namely Anderson and Redding. Because Shasta Lake
has acted as a bedroom community to Redding (south of Shasta Lake), in the last few years much activity on infill lots has oc-
curred from individual contractors and small developers buying a few small lots and then building on them for re-sale
purposes.
Similarly, property owners seeking them only for re-sale (flipping) or for use as rental properties, because they were of lower
value, have bought houses in Shasta Lake. The availability of financing and the interest rate can significantly affect the ability of
developers and builders to produce housing, which directly affects the consumer’s purchase price.
Sales prices ranged from $60,500 for a 1,064 square foot 3 bedroom, 1 bath dwelling constructed in 1948 on an 8,400 square
foot lot to $266,000 for a 1,792 square foot 3 bedroom 2 bath dwelling on a 9,800 square foot lot. More information concern-
ing sales and rent costs is found in the section that addresses adequate sites and affordability (Section 4.01). One very expen-
sive home for the community was available for $750,000 that included amenities and acreage.
Section 3.02        On/Off Site Infrastructure
Responses to Inadequate Infrastructure
The need to address inadequate infrastructure necessary to support not only affordable housing but also market-rate housing
has been a priority for the City since incorporation. Inadequate or missing infrastructure has meant that when developers of
housing look at parcels in Shasta Lake, there has to be recognition that infrastructure costs may be a part of the development
cost. There is a practical reason why lots and houses are lower priced and generally, it is related to either infrastructure or the
surrounding environs.
Unlike other communities that have healthy budgets for public works projects the City has primarily relied on grant funding, or
in the past, Redevelopment funds, to provide infrastructure. Without Redevelopment funding, nearly all funding for infrastruc-
ture will have to be the result of grant applications. Much of the infrastructure funding is not only competitive but requires that
the City have funding to prepare plans and complete environmental which may not be funded. With the low rate of revenue in
Shasta Lake, even ongoing maintenance is difficult to fund. As with the 2003-2008 Housing Element period, during the 2009-
2014 planning period, the City made improvement of infrastructure a priority.
In 2009, the City applied for and received ARRA funding- see review - for the overlay of two residential streets. Two other infra-
structure components, roads and storm water drainage, have plagued the City where development is concerned. Inadequate
utilities, unpaved (or poorly paved) roads and a lack of storm drainage structures are the most significant in terms of cost for
new construction. Roads and drainage are closely related because paving a street requires addressing storm drainage. It is bet-
ter to address both concurrently rather than defer drainage improvements.
With respect to paving, the City has difficulties with in-fill lots and some parcels that are larger within the infill areas of the City.
Because much development occurred when the community was part of the County, and the County either did not apply urban
infrastructure requirements to new development or deferred the improvements, many streets are substandard.
 Many streets are not paved, others are partially paved, and some are paved but had an inadequate base so they were essen-
tially temporary. Others can only be described as a collection of potholes.
To move forward, the City has conducted a Pavement Report and will be updating the Circulation Element in the next fiscal
year. Both documents will assist in better identifying paving, right-of-way and transportation needs, and prioritizing those
needs for grant funding requests.
The City applied for and received two different Safe Routes to Schools Grant during the planning period and is planning for two
additional applications under the Active Transportation Program of the State during the next planning period.
In May 2009, the City completed a Storm Drainage Master Plan (Hydrology Study) for the entire City, a portion of which was
paid for with a CDBG Planning and Technical Assistance (PTA) grant. The Storm Drainage Master Plan only identifies where ma-
jor storm drainage infrastructure is needed or needs replacement or up sizing. While it will be of assistance to the City, it will
not result in significant improvement for individual lots.
                                                                                                                          Page 38 of 82

  2014                                             HOUSING ELEMENT                       CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Between the conclusions of the Paving Report and the Storm Drainage Master Plan, there is a minimum of $40 million worth of
improvement costs needed. With the costs of construction receding, there may be an opportunity to install some projects;
however, many of the projects require construction plans that do not yet exist.
The City Council’s direction to incorporate healthy community principles into the Housing Element and other elements of the
General Plan also means that the development of housing will necessarily look first to infill properties that are plagued with
these infrastructure needs. Program HE 1.2 was added to ensure infill properties are not just inventoried but that prioritized
with respect to infrastructure improvement.
As part of the Housing Element Program, the City will prepare an Infill Strategic Plan that addresses not only available lots but
also the infrastructure needed as well to service these lots. This provides the opportunity for the City to encourage high-
density, infill residential development in the downtown core. This program was part of the prior element but has been moved
to this planning period to coincide with the update of the Land Use/Circulation Element updates.
In addition, a program is included to grant priority for utility service allocations to proposed development that includes housing
units affordable to lower income households. Program HE 1.15 was implemented- see Appendix E- as part of the Affordable
Housing Chapter.
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), a grant program administered by HUD/HCD to allow cities and counties to ac-
quire and redevelop foreclosed properties, provides the City with an opportunity to address the foreclosure crisis while sup-
porting affordable homeownership for low- and moderate-income residents, in particular using infill sites. The City used these
funds in 2010 to abate housing units. All of the abatements were a result of either voluntary, requested, abatements or units
where the abatement had gone to a hearing.
Most of the city had been within the City of Shasta Lake Redevelopment Area. In 2008, the City of Shasta Lake Redevelopment
Agency expanded its boundaries and increased the length of time the Redevelopment Agency would be operational. The added
area included portions of ”Summit City” and properties along Shasta Park Road, primarily occurring west of the Union Pacific
Railroad tracks. However, the State eliminated the Redevelopment Agency as a source of funding.
Water and Sewer (Wastewater) Capacity
According to information provided by PACE Civil, Inc., the City’s available treatment plant capacity as of January 2010 was ap-
proximately 1,551 Single Family Equivalent Connections (SFECs). However, as explained below, due to the City’s limitations for
discharging treated wastewater, the number of available connections as of January 1, 2010, is approximately 511.
PACE Civil, Inc. completed a Draft Recycled Water Facilities Planning Report (Report) in March 2008. The Report explains the
City of Shasta Lake’s existing wastewater treatment and reclamation facilities were upgraded in 1995 to an average dry weath-
er flow capacity of 1.3 million gallons per day (MGD) and a peak wet weather capacity of 5.2 MGD.
The existing 400 AF reclaimed water storage reservoir was sized, based in part, on the assumption the City would be allowed to
discharge treated effluent to Churn Creek between November 15 and March 15, if creek flows provided the required 5:1 dilu-
tion; and the City could discharge to Churn Creek between October 16 to November 14 and March 16 to April 14 if creek flows
exceeded a minimum 10:1 dilution.
Following construction of the facilities, the Regional Water Quality Control Board increased the dilution rate in Churn Creek
from 5:1 to 10:1. Because of this change, the reclaimed water storage reservoir is undersized to accommodate the 1.3 MGD
plant flow during a low rainfall year.
The City’s plans at that time included irrigating the Peri Property, located in the northeasterly section of the City, and the Tierra
Oaks Golf Course, located in the City of Redding, with reclaimed water. The Peri project did not proceed, and the Agreement
with Tierra Oaks was cancelled due to the lack of funding needed to extend the infrastructure to Tierra Oaks.
The Report explains that the City’s current average dry weather wastewater flow is about 0.7 MGD. An estimate of the effec-
tive capacity of the existing storage reservoir, the current reclamation uses, and the allowed discharge to Churn Creek during
drought conditions is about 0.83 MGD. The increase from 0.7 MGD to 0.83 MGD represents about 540 SFECs as of January 1,
2008. New construction during 2008 and 2009 amounted to 29 SFECs, reducing this number to 511 SFECs available as of Janu-
ary 1, 2010.
                                                                                                                        Page 39 of 82

The Draft Report analyzes the City’s options to increase its reclaimed water utilization by expanding effluent storage and irriga-
tion capacities. The Report identifies potential future users of reclaimed water, including Tierra Oaks Golf Course, Gold Hills
Golf Course, Lassen Canyon Nursery, and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The Report explores the op-
tion to expand the City’s existing spray fields to the currently vacant Industrial Park expansion area south of the City’s
Wastewater Treatment Plant. The final report will analyze the option to construct a pipeline to the Sacramento River, which
would allow year around discharge and provide a long-term solution for the City.
Waterworks Engineers completed a subsequent study in August 2009 to assess further the City’s options for disposing of re-
claimed water. Alternatives analyzed included effluent land application and recycling alternatives, regionalization with the City
of Redding, relocation of outfalls, and discharge to Churn Creek as an effluent dominated water body.
The study recommended the City proceed with constructing a reclaimed water pipeline to the Tierra Oaks Golf Course located
east of the City of Shasta Lake, in the City of Redding, to reach the near-term treatment plant capacity of 1.3 MGD. The study
also looked at a no dilution option as a long-term disposal solution.
Tierra Oaks determined that they would not participate with the extension of the City’s reclaimed water line. So the City pro-
ceeded to look at another alternative - a higher level of treatment and direct discharge to Churn Creek. That project is in the
process of its environmental review. The City has received positive feedback from the Regional Water Quality Control Board,
NOAA, California Fish and Wildlife, and Fish and Wildlife Services.
Water Capacity
The City entered into a Long-Term Renewal Contract (No. 4-07-20-W1134-LTR1) with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) for the
provision of Project Water from the Shasta Division – Central Valley Project (CVP). The term of the contract is March 1, 2005
through February 28, 2045. This contract water is the primary source of water for the City.
On July 29, 2003, the City was successful in securing an additional long-term water allocation from the Bureau of Reclamation
(BOR) when the BOR agreed to restore the City’s historical allocation of 4,400 AF of Central Valley Project (CVP) water per year.
The City recently entered into agreement with Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) for the long-term (40-year)
transfer of 2,000 AF of water to the City of Shasta Lake.
An agreement was reached with MCM Properties, Inc., (MCM) for the long-term (40-year) transfer of up to 325 AF of water.
The MCM agreement states MCM shall make available an additional 132 AF per year of water if agreed upon annually by both
MCM and the City. The City has the first right to this 132 AF if MCM determines that the water is available for transfer.
Including the BOR allocation of 4,400 AF, the ACID transfer of 2,000 AF, and 325 AF from MCM, the City’s total long-term water
supply would be 6,725 AF per year, pending BOR’s approval of the ACID and MCM water transfers.
The Water Utility has a current service-area population of 10,279. According to the Calendar Year 2009 Department of
Water Resources Public Water Systems Statistics Report, there are 3,698 active water service connections in the City,
which represents 95 percent residential and 5 percent commercial/industrial/institutional users.
The Report indicates a total of 2,501 acre-feet of metered water were delivered during CY 2009. Based on the BOR all o-
cation alone, this would leave 1,899 AF available to serve new development, which represents approximately 1, 899
SFECs. Therefore, the City has sufficient water capacity to accommodate Shasta Lake’s share of the regional housing
need. The long-term concern however is whether there will be sufficient rain and snow pack on an annual basis to avoid
water reductions determined by the Bureau of Reclamation. The City had to buy water this year from the McConnell
Foundation at $200 per acre-foot (preciously $50/acre foot). The City also adopted a drought ordinance with a penalty
for overuse of water to help reduce use in the City. The City also adopted a water efficient landscape ordinance during
the planning period that is consistent with State Law. The first land use to put the ordinance into use was the Wintu
Tribes’ new Cultural Resource Center. All of the plants used at the Center are native plants that are inherently drought
tolerant and drip irrigation installed that is timed for efficiency.

Section 3.03        Environmental Constraints
The City has several constraints to development that are environmental:
   Topography
    Much of the land area in the City significantly varies in topography, including a portion of the vacant property zoned for
    housing units. In 2007, the City adopted a Grading, Erosion Control, and Hillside Development Ordinance, which addresses
    how the City expects development to address topographic changes and grading. The ordinance addresses environmental
    issues such as loss of soil, impacts to drainage areas, and visual impacts.
    Because no extensive development is permitted on property over 30% (small isolated areas of 30 percent or greater will be
    considered only for sections of roads and utilities), some of the property zoned for residential development will not be
    able to meet the density allowances for specific zones. Therefore, for example, should the City adopt a minimum develop-
    ment standard, it would be very difficult to ensure that properties could meet those minimums.
    Instead, each property must be assessed for that density allowance on a case-by-case basis due to the differences between
    lots. Having an individual assessment then means additional costs per development proposed.
    The City has added a program to review the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts. As part of that review, the City will analyze in de-
    tail all of the parcels with those zoning district designations for topographic issues. Program HE 1.11 provides for revision
    of the R-3 and R-4 densities. The exact increases are not proposed but the City expects those densities to increase from 10
    units per acre for R-3 to 20-30 units per acre and from 20 units per acre for R-4 to 30-40 units per acre. This program has
    been continued into the 2014 Housing Element planning period.
    Flood Plain/Drainage
    The City has several creeks identified by FEMA as 100-year flood hazard areas. Properties adjacent to and in those flood
    plains include some of the vacant property zoned for housing. All new residential construction or substantial improvement
    must provide an Elevation Certificate verifying the structure is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
    The City does not perceive this as an impediment but rather an appropriate method for making sure structures and people
    are primarily not located within a flood plain and protected when they are within the flood plain. For some property own-
    ers, however, who believe the FEMA maps are incorrect, the process to validate their belief can be expensive.
    Local drainage that is not of a 100-year storm value can still be a problem for new and existing structures within the City.
    For example, in the area where the City has purchased property at Meade and Locust Streets, the storm drainage from the
    site enters an undersized pipe that cross the street and then daylights on a private property, then traverses that property
    before entering an alley area and then again traversing private property.
    In order to develop without causing off-site impacts, a hydrology study is required to ensure development does not affect
    downstream properties, and the developer must address the need to either retain the drainage on-site or find means to
    accommodate it within public right-of-way without an increased impact to those property owners. While this does not af-
    fect all properties, it causes a particular problem for infill properties that cannot spread the cost across multiple lots/units.
   Trees
    The City’s vacant properties and existing developed properties contain significant tree coverage. The City’s Tree Conserva-
    tion ordinance addresses how protected trees (all trees over 10” diameter at breast height with the exception of gray pine)
    will be retained and/or replaced. An exemption is provided for property developed with a single-family residence that
    does not result in mass clearing over 20,000 square feet, and for new construction of a single-family residential dwelling
    unit.
    However, for subdivisions, there is a requirement for a tree survey, which adds to the cost of the development. This cost
    varies depending on the size of the property and the number of trees, and requires the identification of specific trees as
    opposed to tree cover or canopy. To date, the tree survey has proved beneficial in identifying constraints that can be ad-
    dressed as part of the development.
                                                                                                                       Page 41 of 82

  One issue, however, is completing required topographic mapping which is often constrained by heavy tree coverage. Aerial
  photography then becomes an issue rather than a resource for topographic mapping and slope tolerances. In the past, the
  City has permitted, on a limited basis, tree sampling/cruising, which uses a sampling of an area and projects forward what
  the tree coverage/type is on a particular property.
  Larger projects have found that the tree cover has been an impediment to even sampling trees or “cruising” the trees
  much in the same way they would be estimated for logging – verifiable only when brush and smaller trees are removed.
  The effects of the environmental constraints vary widely according to the parcel location and size. Smaller properties and
  smaller numbers of proposed units have the greater problem in accommodating the cost for additional studies or surveys
  as may be required. Some larger residential properties have the ability to cluster units, preserve open space while reducing
  the need for long wide roads that inherently result in more impervious surface and greater runoff under the existing
  standards.
  Healthy Community standards will be incorporated into the new design standards and subsequent improvement standards
  that follow the remainder of the General Plan. Healthy Community standards indicate that narrower roads reduced imper-
  vious surfaces, on-site drainage retention, and clustering of uses will avoid much of the need to address mitigation as well
  which adds Mitigation Costs to the overall development costs.

Units Built, Under Construction and/or Approved During Planning Period
According to HCD, a jurisdiction may take credit for units constructed or under construction between the base year of the
RHNA period and the beginning of the new planning period. Units that have been issued building permits on, or after, January 1
of the year falling two years prior to the due date of the jurisdiction’s housing element may be credited against the RHNA to
determine the balance of site capacity that must be identified. For example, for housing elements due June 30, 2014 units for
which permits were issued on or after January 1, 2014 may be credited against the RHNA. Those building permits are list below.
To credit units affordable to lower- and moderate-income households against the RHNA, a jurisdiction must demonstrate the
units are affordable based on at least one of the following:
             subsidies, financing or other mechanisms that ensure affordability (e.g., MHP, HOME, or LIHTC financed projects,
              inclusionary units or RDA requirements);
             actual rents; and
             actual sales prices
Table 29 describes the units that have been constructed during the period allowed for credit- from January 1, 2009 to July 1,
2014. The valuation section is the value at the time of the Building Permit application. The Assessor’s value- because these are
all recent sales- is based upon the actual sales and the Prop. 13 increase for the years in use. These prices are relevant to the
price that would be expected to be used to determine affordability.
There were no extremely low or very low units constructed within the allowed time. There are several manufactured homes
that were constructed that could be considered available for low-income homeowners as well as few of the small, less expen-
sive homes noted in the Table 29.
Shasta Lake uses affordability tables that demonstrate median income levels for a variety of household sizes, issued by HUD
(US. Department of Housing and Urban Development) and HCD (California Department of Housing and Community Develop-
ment) on an annual basis. The income categories include the extremely low, very low, low, and moderate-income levels. Both
HUD and HCD when awarding grant funds correspondingly use those levels.
In the last five years, Agency DAP loans for example have been available initially for $225,000 but have now increased to
$228,000. HUD permits an even higher threshold but income levels in the community do not support those levels.
In the table below, the Assessor Parcel Numbers that have strikeout formatting are an indication that at the time of the permit
submittal, there was one number assigned to the parcel but that the parcel was subsequently assigned another parcel number
by the County Assessor in their records. The current parcel number is included in parenthesis. This will allow the City to keep its
records clear on what has occurred on each parcel.
The City kept the original information from the 2009-2014 Housing Element in this document to show the contrast between
the planning periods. Table 29 is from 2003-2008 while Table 29 a is from the 2009-2014 planning period.

          1 – All SFD During the last planning period. The exception is three Manufactured Homes.
          Lined out Parcel Numbers have been replaced with new parcel numbers.
This table was left in this Housing Element because it was part of the adequate sites calculation required by the State of Cali-
fornia’s Department of Housing and Community Development during the last planning period. It helps with comparison to the
new constructed units shown in Table 29 a.

New Construction from January 2009 to Present
The units constructed in this period were divided between two income levels. Thirty-nine of the units were single-family units.
Two of the low-income units were manufactured housing units/modular homes. No multiple family units were constructed nor
were there any very low or extremely low-income housing units constructed.
Table 29 a shows the areas/values for the newly constructed single-family units (including manufactured homes) placed on lots
during the last planning period from January 1, 2009 through May 1, 2014. Table 29 b shows the number and placement of
housing units removed (constructed and mobile home) during that same period. There were more units removed during the
period than placed in service.
The number of units that were removed increased during that period because the City had Redevelopment and Neighborhood
Stabilization funds available (particularly in 2010) for the removal of the units. Unit values are not shown, as there was no way
to estimate accurately the values of structures/mobile homes that were in an abatement process. All of the units were vacant.
It is expected that demolitions will slow significantly in the next planning period in part because the funds are no longer availa-
ble and that the number of older, dilapidated structures has been reduced.

Vacant Land Assessment
When current staff reviewed the list in Table 29, it was clear many parcels had not received adequate review. For example, where slope is indicated as a concern, no reduc-
tion had been made to address the slope issues or indicate that the slope issue was major where the average slope was over 20%. Staff reviewed all of the parcels in the
original table (using it as a baseline for the City) to provide a more realistic assessment of the number of units that could be placed on each of the parcels. Each parcel is
unique, depending upon size, slope, location, and access to utilities.
Some parcels have multiple issues as noted in the table, which significantly reduced the number of units that could be accommodated on the parcel. For that reason, staff
added columns to the original table, as opposed to just retaining the original table, so that the reduced numbers could be included and a more realistic number of units
assumed. This was intended to show that the City reviewed the original site listing from the previous planning period. That review was also completed in order to verify
previous assessments of the numbers of sites that were still available, the realistic capacity of the sites, as well as any sites no longer available because they have been de-
veloped. An updated inventory is included as a program on page five of the Goals, Policies, and Programs section, Program 1.1. The City will review all of the parcels during
the Land Use Element update in 2014/15

     Units are those allowed with process proposed BUT do not include density bonus for affordable housing – for MFD unit total would increase by 25% from Minimum of 16 to 20 and from 81
      to 100.
     Re-zoning to R-3 would mean w/ current density 10 units/acre- change in density for R-3 would mean 20 units per acre
     Some R-3 has URH General Plan designations. In those cases, the density, without having to change the Zoning, would be 20 units per acre. There are a minimal number of URH parcels
      within the City. They are primarily on parcels between I-5 and Cascade Boulevard.
     Possibly R-4 would also increase in density to 25/30 units.

This table illustrates the possible additional units that could be made available where code enforcement cases that involve vacant structures (that are dilapidated) could be pur-
sued. Once the structures are removed, they can be made available for new structures.

Site Inventory and Analysis
This section of the element addresses the requirements of Government Code Sections 65583 and 65583.2, requiring an invento-
ry of appropriately zoned, available, and suitable sites to provide realistic opportunities for the provision of housing to all in-
come segments within the community.
The City does not yet have a complete (detailed) inventory of all sites within the site that includes all infrastructure needs and
an assessment of whether the build-out capacity according to approved densities is realistic. The City did inventory lots that are
currently zoned for multi-family residential, including those used and those that are vacant in order to address potential for the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation to be accommodated within the City.
On June 20 2012, the California State Department of Housing and Community Development notified the City of the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for Shasta County and the three incorporated cities within the county. The RHNA totals for all
of the jurisdictions are listed in Table 32 below.

The City’s share of the total number of housing units for all income levels for this planning period alone is 742 dwelling units.
This is the number that the State of California’s Housing and Community Development Department (HCD) says is expected to be
needed throughout the planning period, 2009-2014.
As a percentage of the total for the County, the City’s share is approximately 5.7% that is close to the City of Anderson’s alloca-
tion (5.9%). In the last planning period, there was discussion about increasing Shasta Lake’s proportion of moderate and above-
moderate income households. However, because Shasta Lake was not included in HCD’s meetings for this planning period the
RHNA was devised and finalized without this change.
In the next planning period, prior to RHNA development, the City of Shasta Lake will pursue discussions concerning the distribu-
tion of household income levels within the region and managing a balance of households.
Through the policy and program sections in the Element, the City must address the need to accommodate the very low and low-
income units proposed for the prior planning period - 271 units. In the last Housing Element (2003-2009), the City proposed to
rezone property to allow for an additional 300 units - more than the required amount for affordable units.
According to California State Department of Housing and Community Development Analyst Melinda Benson, the City must meet
the 271 affordable housing unit allocation (Low, Very Low, and Extremely Low) as provided in the past element because the City
did not provide the zoning noted in the last Element. This number (271) is in addition to the current planning period totals (see
summary total for 2009-2019 planning period).
This means the City must address the need for enough appropriately zoned land for affordable housing. Existing and potential
zoning must allow for 333 very-low income units (half, or 167, of which need to be for extremely low–income households) and
                                                                                                                                61

Using HUD median income levels for the County provides the dollar amount available for housing expenses as a percentage of
their income. Traditionally 30% of the household’s income, depending upon the household size, is the level used to determine if
housing is affordable which is what HUD uses.
The 2014 HUD income levels for affordable housing are as follows:

To determine what units would be affordable the City used the HUD income limits to determine mortgage payments and the
associated total housing costs that would be affordable. The amounts stated below in Table 36 are for a 4-person household-
used as a baseline. Mortgage assumed at 30 yr., 6 % interest, and 10% down. Also assumes no debt, 1.0% property tax, and in-
surance costs of $500. (Bankrate.com).

Because the total cost of housing is highly dependent upon interest rate, down payment requirements, debt to income ratios
and associated housing costs (insurance and property taxes) the simplest formula was used but means that the amounts shown
are the absolute upper limit of what can be affordable.

The City’s share of the regional housing need will be met through the implementation of a variety of strategies (e.g., available
and appropriately zoned land, units built since the beginning of baseline Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) period, sec-
ond units). There were only three second units constructed in the planning period, and these are included in the single-family
residential totals.
Meeting the adequate sites requirement will be addressed primarily through the identification of available vacant lots suitably
and appropriately zoned and the identification of zones that can accommodate increased density.
The City’s evaluation of adequate sites begins with an inventory of individual sites with their Zone and General Plan land use
designations. To demonstrate the realistic development viability of the sites, the tables included in Appendix A list site issues
that may impede full development of the sites and also discuss:
 (1) whether appropriate zoning is in place,
 (2) the applicable development standards and their impact on projected development capacity and affordability,
(3) existing constraints including any known environmental issues, and
(4) availability of existing and planned public service capacity levels.
The City’s land and housing stock condition inventory was recently developed with the completion of a windshield survey. The
City used Planning and Technical Assistance (PTA) funds from the State Department of Housing and Community Development to
perform the survey. The survey form primarily addressed housing stock condition but also included issues important to the
quality of life in the neighborhood and whether a healthy community environment existed.
For example, the inventory includes notations that indicate whether there are sidewalks in place or drainage issues that are ap-
parent. The inventory also notes where there is garbage, refuse, or junk cars. Review of the City’s Land Use Element and Zoning
and Subdivision Ordinances were completed to determine if there were opportunities to reduce constraints to development or
to improve the process for consideration and approval of development.
The compilation resulted in not only an identification of sites, but also an estimate of potential development capacity for these
sites. The majority of the land available for mass new construction residential development is on properties on the edges of the
City’s boundaries. The majority of land available for new small construction, densification, and rehabilitation are primarily on
lots within our urban core area adjacent to both Shasta Dam and Cascade Boulevards or within several blocks of those main
thoroughfares. The inventory includes both small and large residentially and non-residentially zoned parcels and parcels which
are substantially vacant or underutilized which could be developed for more intense residential uses.

ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE SITES
 Vacant Lots – Approved Subdivisions (Lot size minimum 6,000 square feet ranging to ½ acre)
The City has a number of subdivisions (approved during the last planning period); both final map subdivisions and parcel map
subdivisions (see Tables 33 and 34). Housing units on the final map subdivision lots are expected to fall into the moderate and
above moderate-income levels. Between the approved final maps and the pending final maps, there are a total of 847 lots ex-
pected to be available during the planning period. There are also an additional 23 lots that have been created (or will be upon
recording) via parcel maps. These are expected to be moderate income housing units as well.
The total number of lots that will be available will be 870 with 472 of them expected to be Above Moderate income units and
398 moderate-income units.
The Woolery Subdivision, seen above, is an example of a subdivision that has been approved but where the Final Map is not yet
recoded. The subdivision is an edge subdivision - at the edge of the city near the city limit line with the City of Redding. This is
one of the properties returned to the bank.

Parcel along Shasta Dam Boulevard zoned for R-4
For the purposes of the Housing Element, vacant lots that are included as available for units are those lots where enough infor-
mation exists to define their functionality. These are demonstrated as part of Table 30. The City evaluated the lots identified in
the previous Housing Element as available for units.
Some identified parcels have had units constructed whereas others are more appropriate for commercial development or are
proposed for commercial development by the property owners. In other instances, the previous assessment was completed
prior to the City having a functional Grading, Erosion Control, and Hillside Development ordinance.
Consequently, a number of the parcels have significant access and slope issues that reduce the number of units that could be
constructed or at a minimum will increase the cost of the units significantly due to increased engineering work needed to devel-
op the properties.

The Redevelopment Agency had purchased two sets of vacant lots to develop them with multi-family units which are now part
of the Successor (to Redevelopment) Agency. The initial property purchased is located at Morningstar Way. The lot is currently
zoned R-3 and could accommodate five units of MFD under the current density allowed for R-3. One of the programs proposed
by the city would increase the density allowed within R-3 that would double the amount of units possible to 10 units on the
Morningstar site. There are also proposals to merge the property with a much larger property to the northwest of the parcel to
make a more developable parcel.
The second set of lots purchased by the Agency is located at Meade and Locust Streets. The lots will accommodate, with a den-
sity bonus, approximately 30-35 units. The Agency has partnered with Northern Valley Catholic Social Services (NVCSS) to place
those units at the site for use as a senior housing project. NVCSS has applied for HUD 202 funding (non-funded) and three
rounds of Tax Increment financing at the State, none of which were approved. The City and NVCSS will be reviewing options for
funding for this project.
For both projects, the Oversight Board (established at the end of Redevelopment- consisting of local taxing agencies) will over-
see the sale of these properties.
Non-Vacant Sites (Underutilized)
The City has several sites with existing structures within the R-1 and R-3 zones. Additional units could be added or, if the exist-
ing units were removed, density could be increased. Portions of these are included within the abatement caseload. In addition,
some of these sites have the potential for either residential or commercial.
Abatements of Dilapidated Housing Stock
The City’s housing condition survey completed in May 2009 indicated significant numbers of housing units are considered dilap-
idated or in need of substantial rehabilitation (309 total units). Until May 2009, the City did not have a searchable database
with a housing inventory of the units within the City.
During the 2003-2008 planning period, there were 90 demolitions completed, that included both voluntary and involuntary
abatement demolitions. In the case of some of those lots, houses were constructed replacing the demolished housing. The
Agency has funding allocated to accomplish demolitions of vacant housing. For the majority of this housing, the replacement
housing units would be low or moderate-income housing. However, some properties could be rezoned to permit additional
density or a change in density. Those units are identified in the Table 31 (Abatement Cases).
The City established a Code Enforcement Officer position several years ago, in part to begin to remove dilapidated uninhabitable
housing units. During the last planning period (2004-2008), there were 90 demolitions as indicated in the table below. This in-
cluded single-family houses, mobile homes, and detached multi-family units (these were old "cabins").

See Table 29 b for demolitions during the 2009-2014 planning period. During the 2003-2008 planning period, Redevelopment
Agency funds were available for demolitions. In the last planning period 2009-2014 additional demolitions were completed,
mainly using Neighborhood Stabilization funds. Some demolitions were voluntary/requested, while others were a result of a
code enforcement action. In all cases, the demolitions involved long vacant structures, some of which were burned out shells
with others being old structures built in the "dam era".
                                                                                                                   Page 67 of 82

  2014                                            HOUSING ELEMENT                     CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The dam era structures were built in the late 1930's and were meant to be temporary (less than 5 years) housing units. In many
cases, the units did not have foundations or other conditions required by current building codes and have been allowed to dete-
riorate in the intervening years to the point of being uninhabitable.
In the past, the Redevelopment Agency had routinely provided upfront money to demolish these types of structures, a lien was
recorded against the property for those funds, and the funds recovered when the property sold. The City noted in the last Hous-
ing Element- 2009-2104, that demolitions will be no less than the number indicated (60) in the Housing Element (Table 37, Cat-
egory 1) based on the 90 units demolished in the previous planning period, the continued abatement process, and the funds
that are budgeted every year by the Redevelopment Agency to assist in those abatements. The actual number demolished was
59 during the planning period.
The city implemented a Voluntary Abatement Program (VAP) that provides funding for demolition of vacant substandard hous-
ing units using Neighborhood Stabilization funds in 2010. This was in addition to the funds budgeted through the Redevelop-
ment Agency. However, because of the Redevelopment Agency elimination, there were abatements at the end of the planning
period than there could have been due to the lack of funding. Annual funding for the last few years has meant only six in 2012
and one in 2013.
Once these structures are removed, the lots are available for development. Because the significant majority of these parcels are
within residential zones, they are available to be developed for residential uses. Many of the lots are, as noted by HCD, small
lots. Structures constructed on these lots are similar to many existing lots within the community where other housing units
were constructed.
While in urban areas it may be difficult to construct affordable housing on small lots, those small lots are exceedingly affordable
in a small community like the City of Shasta Lake. Because the structures that will be demolished are of such low value, the ac-
tual value is in the lot. One caveat, however, is that if the previous sewer and water assessments were not paid for those lots,
impacts fees may be a burden to development. The City has added the Implementation Program listed above to look at where
waivers could occur. The City has deferred payment of such fees until the housing unit is ready to be issued a Certificate of Oc-
cupancy.
In the City of Shasta Lake, previously developed lots have significantly reduced impact and utility connection fees, making them
ideal sites for the development of affordable housing. If a dwelling unit is a replacement for a use that has been inactive for less
than three years, the developer pays no impact or utility connection fees, resulting in a savings of over $38,000. If a use has
been inactive for more than three years, the utility impact and connection fees are currently no more than $5,200, approxi-
mately $25,800 less than typical impact/connection fees for construction of a single-family residential dwelling.
Several examples from the 2003-2008 planning period are listed below of lots where a single structure was demolished and sub-
sequently a housing unit, or units, has been constructed.
Examples of new construction after demolition
         3146 West Street - Structure demolished. New housing unit constructed within 12 months for $120,730.
         4185 Chico Street - Structure demolished. New housing unit constructed within 12 months for $85,416.
         4069 La Mesa - Structure demolished. New housing unit constructed within 12 months for $84,304
         3840 Laredo - Structure demolished. New mobile home installed within 12 months for a cost of $32,000.
         748 Miller Street - Structure demolished. New housing unit constructed within 12 months for $105,591.
         756 Shasta Park Drive - Structure (mobile home) demolished. New housing unit constructed within 12 months for
          $103,228.
         5201 Grand Ave - Structure demolished. New housing unit constructed within 12 months for $106,176.

Examples of proposed new units after demolition:
         4625 Vallecito Street - Single structure was demolished through the VAP in 2010. Owner requested, and received fund-
          ing to construct at least 7 affordable single-family units on a parcel of just under one acre (6 additional units) with City
          assistance. The funding was through a CDBG grant for off-site infrastructure in support of affordable housing. The City
          waived the impact fees and because the first unit was approved for a building permit within 3 years of demolition, they
          received a credit for sewer and water connection fees- spread over seven units.
The City views these demolitions as a chance to provide low cost parcels for individuals and contractors to build affordable
housing. In essence, the volume of potential for abated structures is much like a land bank except that we expect that private
and/or non-profit developers and individuals without the need for federal, state, or local assistance will construct the vast
majority of new units. Affordable housing has been constructed on these lots over the course of many years, and we believe
that the trend will continue because of the reduced fees associated with previously developed infill lots, the location of the lots,
and their size.
Because the number of units (60) that are shown in Table 37, Category 1, as available for abatement (demolition) is less than the
historical number of abated units over a five-year period (90), there was no difficulty in having the 60 lots available within the
City's inventory of lots.
The City has added an Implementation Program to look at funding for scattered site development- taking a closer look at the
details of those lots and their characteristics in order to seek funding available for these kinds of infill lots. With additional fund-
ing, many of these lots could become sites for affordable housing.
Other units are added below the RHNA totals in Table 37, as HCD believes these are less likely to have affordable housing con-
structed on the lots. They can be counted as affordable housing if they meet the affordability requirements at construction and
reported as part of the Annual Report.
Commercial Sites ---- Shasta Dam Boulevard / Cascade Boulevard and adjoining streets
Shasta Dam Boulevard is also State Route 151, and as such, is owned and controlled by the State of California. Shasta Dam
Boulevard is the major thoroughfare for the City, and the majority of the property is occupied (or was formerly occupied) by
commercial, office and retail uses.
The Shasta Dam Boulevard corridor is not built-out, with a large percentage of the potential tenant spaces vacant, making the
area a good candidate for residential redevelopment and recycling. Land in this corridor includes several pieces of property
                                                                                        available for multi-family zoning. One area in

jects that demonstrate residential development viability. There is some potential for a few of the lots developed with non-
conforming residential uses to be rezoned or to be permitted outright in the C-2 zone district.
One program added by the City amended the C-2 zone to allow mixed uses, single-room occupancies, and transition-
al/emergency housing. Property was rezoned in the last planning period to R-3 and R-4 as proposed in the 2009-2014 planning
period. One program has been continued to increase the densities of the R-3 and R-4 zones. These proposals will receive public
review when the City begins the update of the Land Use and Circulation Elements in FY 2014/15.
Cascade Boulevard has a mixture of commercial, highway commercial, light industrial, and residential. A portion of the residen-
tial is under used and could accommodate additional housing units (see previous page).
These cottages (see prior page) sit back from Cascade Boulevard with vacant land to the west and south. While commercial
might be seen as an option, the property is also suited to additional residential as well as having potential for new construction
that would replace these units with more dense multiple- family dwelling units.
Zoning appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households
The City recognizes higher density resi-
dential and mixed-use districts (R-3,                                           Property on Shasta Street
R-4, SP, and MU) provide the poten-                                             rezoned from R-1 to R-4 to
tial for lower construction costs be-                                           accommodate additional
cause of the economies of scale                                                 units in 2010
created and are, therefore, most
suitable for development of housing
affordable to very low- and low-
income households.
Those sites identified in the invento-
ry as having the greatest potential
to accommodate housing affordable
to lower-income households allow
densities of at least 20 units per
acre.
Per Government Code Section
65583.2(c)(3)(B) the City’s zoning for
R-3 and R-4 within the URH General
Plan land use designation is consistent
with 20 units per acre standard for subur-
ban jurisdictions and therefore considered appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households.
There are additional properties that could accommodate 20 units per acre. The City rezoned properties to permit density bo-
nuses at a minimum of 20 units per acre for R-3 and 30 units per acre for R-4. The property shown above had both R-1 and R-3
zoning. The City rezoned all of it to R-4 (allowing with a density bonus 60-75 units). If additional property was assembled, there
could be units on the site over and above that amount. With a density increase, the number of units could be as many as 100 if
developed with adjoining property owned by the same property owner.
Program 1.12 addresses the potential for rezoning parcels for potential residential use. At a minimum, the sites listed below are
candidates for rezoning that have potential for residential use within a commercial zone either as a separate residential use or
as a mixed use:
Mixed Use in Commercial Zones
The City estimates 166 units could be accommodated within commercial zones. The City currently has several commercial zones
that allow multi-family residential uses pursuant to issuance of a Use Permit or Administrative Permit. Those zones will be

 changed to reflect that residential uses will be allowed uses as part of a mixed-use development; for sites that are on major ar-
 terial roadways, the residential use would be an allowed use in conjunction with a mixed-use development.
 17.40 City Center Commercial (CC) District – Currently, multi-family development requires a Planning-Commission issued Use
 Permit. Zoning will be amended to allow multi-family uses with an Administrative Permit as part of a Mixed Use.
 17.41 Village Commercial (VC) District – Currently, multi-family development requires an Administrative Permit. No changes
 proposed.
 17.42 Local Convenience Center (C-1) District - Currently, single-family residential is allowed as a secondary use with a Use
 Permit. Zoning will be amended to allow with an Administrative Permit as part of a mixed-use property.
 17.44 Community Commercial (C-2) District - Currently, single-family residential is allowed as a secondary use with a Use Per-
 mit. Reconstruction of an existing single-family residence is allowed with a use permit. Zoning will be amended to allow these
 uses with an Administrative Permit.
 17.48 Highway Commercial (C-H) District - No residential uses allowed. No changes proposed.
 17.50 Commercial Recreation (C-R) District - Currently, single-family residential is allowed as a secondary use with a Use Permit.
 No changes proposed.
 17.52 Commercial-Light Industrial (C-M) District – Currently, a caretaker or night watchman’s quarters are allowed. No changes
 proposed.
 17.54 Mixed Use (MU) District – Currently, single-family residential and Second Units are allowed with a Use Permit. Zoning will
 be changed to allow a single-family residence by right and a second residence subject to the City’s Second Dwelling Unit Ordi-
 nance.
 Housing Element Program 1.7 will result in graphic-driven design standards that address mixed-use and residential develop-
 ment. Under this Program, approval for multi-family residential development will become a ministerial permit as part of a
 mixed-use development. As documented in the Housing Element, there will be many parcels in the City - some of them vacant -
 on which affordable housing can be built.
The City expects none of the units will be above-moderate-income units and very few, if any, will be moderate-income units. The
following Table includes parcels that are zoned commercial to demonstrate that there are enough parcels where residential may
occur as a mixed use. All of the parcels included are in urbanized portions of the City have infrastructure available and no slope
issues.
The implementation program associated with these zoning changes will occur as part of the Land Use Element update.

Candidate Sites for Rezoning
The City has identified several sites, which were suitable for rezoning to increased densities for residential purposes. The City
completed the rezoning in FY 2010/11. The majority of the lots with one exception were rezoned in 2010 and the final lot in
early 2011 ( see Appendix E).Most of the sites included in the table below have particular characteristics in that they are close to
schools and retail with infrastructure available. They qualify as infill lots in areas that would be compatible with the proposed
zoning and uses.

Adequate (Realistic) Site Capacity.
The City will rely primarily on multi-family zoned sites, which are mainly the R-3 and R-4 zones. The General Plan allows a densi-
ty of 20 dwelling units per acre in the Urban Residential High (URH) and 10 units per acre in the Urban Residential (UR) land use
designation.
As part of Table 37, the City has indicated what level of units can be constructed. In the 2003-2008 Housing Element, only the
Zoning and General Plan land use designations were used. While some attempt was made to estimate units, the slope density
                                                                                                                       Page 73 of 82

and other factors like water/sewer and access were not realistically included; thus, the previous planning period that estimated
land available for housing units was not realistic.
First, the City considered and evaluated the implementation of its current multi-family development standards and on-site im-
provement requirements (e.g., setbacks, building height, parking and open space requirements), to determine approximate
density and unit yields. As an example, using a typical site plan design for a multi-story medium sized multifamily project on an
interior lot, the imposition of the 20 foot front yard requirement, 45-foot building height requirement, the 1.5 parking space per
unit parking requirement, and the 30 percent open space requirement allowed for maximum density to be achieved.
The City used HCD formula for extremely low income units- so they are 50% of the total for very low (i.e. 50% of the 333 noted
for the 2009-2014 RHNA). With such as small RHNA going forward the City has plenty of sites to permit housing to occur. The
details however mean that sufficient financing and willing developers to see Shasta Lake as a good market for housing is neces-
sary over and above the number and type of lots available.

Section 4.02         Redevelopment Fund Uses
The Redevelopment Agency had several housing programs they operate with redevelopment funds. Program income from sales
of property, loan payments, etc. are being programmed for housing however until the Department of Finance settles on what
income the City can maintain and use to administer those funds the funds will be banked. Once those decisions are finalized by
the State the City will use the funding for affordable housing projects.
Housing related programs have also been funded through State CDBG for housing and infrastructure that increases the likeli-
hood of vacant lots being used. HOME and CalHOME funding (state and federal) for first-time homeowners has also been used.
The activity for all programs was down over the 2003-2008 planning period and continued to spiral downward as the economic
downturn continued in the last portion of the 2009-2014 planning period with the exception of abatements. Listed below are
the programs that the Agency has managed until Redevelop-
ment was eliminated
Additional programs may be added depending upon the re-
ceipt of grant funds for several projects including energy effi-
ciency projects and rehabilitation of existing housing stock-
some of which is expected to be foreclosures.
Paint Rebate Program
The Paint Rebate Program started in 2005, in the middle of the
planning period and continued through the 2011 of the last
planning period. The initial two years were successful but par-
ticipation waned in 2008 and 2009. The Program was intended
to alleviate blight by improving the appearance of residential
structure exteriors. The Program offered rebates for paint and
materials of up to $500 for single-family properties and up to $350                                                           per
unit for multi-family properties (not to exceed $2,000).
Both owner- and tenant-occupied single-family units were income-qualified in accordance with the City’s other housing pro-
grams. At least 50 percent of tenants in multi-family properties must be income-qualified for the property to be eligible.
In the 3 years while the program lasted – 2009 thru 2011 an additional 12 units received paint rebates until the program closed
down.
Dumpster Program
The Agency provided dumpsters to income eligible residents to assist in removing debris, waste, junk and other unsafe and un-
healthy items from a property. Use of dumpsters has been steady over the planning period.
Marketing had been passive only – with posting of information in a variety of venues but no active contact with property own-
ers except where abatement issues may be resolved using a dumpster.
It was a very active program. During the last planning period, $90,432 (6 fiscal years) was spent at an average of $15,072 av-
erage/year. This is clearly a need in the City; however, there is no funding source for it. The dumpster program ended with the
end of Redevelopment as it was paid for out of Redevelopment or RDA funds. The City has people ask about it frequently as the
need is still there.
Abatements
                                                                                                                    Page 75 of 82

Funding for abatements has been steady through the planning period, but the use of the funds increased as the code enforce-
ment officer, when the position existed, focused on specific abatement projects. The abated structures are vacant and, in many
cases, have been for a very long time. The
state of the structures ranged from burnt
out mobile homes to substandard stick
dwellings.
In many neighborhoods, the abated build-
ings and those that are red-tagged are nui-
sances for the neighborhood, and others are
unsafe structures. They also attract transient
use that has led to fires as the transient
population builds fire or attempts to connect
to electrical lines themselves.
Abatement costs for the demolition of indi-
vidual dwellings has had a wide variance in
cost ranging from $5,000-7,000 with a very
few requiring up to, and over, $10,000
where lead and asbestos were involved or
there was other debris to be removed be-
yond the dwelling.
The Agency had allocated funds each year for the
demolition of red-tagged units that are deteriorated and now the City has allocated funds in the past.
However, the amount of money is very small the last few years and will barely abate a single unit. A secure source of funding is
needed to insure these actions can be taken.
                                                            At the beginning of the last planning period (2009-2014), the City
                                                            eliminated the Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) position. Code en-
                                                            forcement while still a priority occurs less frequently due to the ac-
                                                            tivities being handed off to other positions with their own responsi-
                                                            bilities (the Permit Center Manager and the Building Official).
                                                            The greater majority of enforcement cases are compliant driven
                                                            because without a Code Enforcement Officer there is not enough
                                                            staff time to pursue all of the needs in total.
                                                            In all cases, the City attempts to get compliance from the property
                                                            owner to ameliorate the condition that requires abatement. If the
                                                            abatement has to go to a hearing. Should the property owner not
                                                           abate the issue, the abatement process proceeds to an administrative
                                                       hearing. The Abatement Hearing Officer determines the necessary work
that needs to be done, issues an Order of Abatement, and indicates a specific period of time in which the abatement must be
completed.
If the property owner fails to comply with the Abatement Order, the City can proceed with the work and place a lien on the
property for the cost of the abatement, including administrative costs. However, now the City has to prioritize funding to a point
that 1-2 units only may be abated as the City does not have the funding to do the abatement and wait for payment or a sale
where the funds would be returned.
                                                                                                                     Page 76 of 82

City staff has asked that abatement funds from prior that are returned do not go to the General Fund if they came from other
sources but instead to a fund specifically designated for abatement. The City Manager and the City Council will consider this
request during the two-year budget review.
The Agency received Neighborhood Stabilization program funds, used to abate dwellings primarily in fiscal year 2010/11. Those
funds were in addition to the Agency funds that were eliminated.
First Time Homebuyer
The Agency operated a healthy down payment assistance program (DAP) directed at first time homebuyers. The program has
been in place for 15 years and has been funded using both redevelopment funds as well as California Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funds. In 1999, the Agency made three loans and in the 2009-2014 period made 12 loans.
In the last planning period, the City made 28 loans from a constellation of funds. Unfortunately, since Redevelopment Agency
funds are no longer available it will be harder to match funds in the future.

Because the Agency no longer exists, the City expects to continue the program through the next planning period with the specif-
ic amount highly dependent upon the other funding sources. The program has been funded through a variety of funding
sources including the Agency (RDA funds), HOME funds (federal), CalHOME funds, and program income(revolving loan funds).

Rehabilitation
The Agency has participated in two rehabilitation loans during the planning period. Rehabilitation will be a difficult activity for
the City to pursue. City staff has indicated the majority of units needing assistance are owned by seniors who do not want to
incur debt even as a deferred loan due on sale or transfer. Before elimination, the Agency applied as part of a consortium for
funding from the California Energy Commission that was not funded.
                                                                                                                     Page 78 of 82

The City applied for Community Development Block Grant $500,000 in funding in April 2014 for single-family and multi-family
funding for rehabilitation. The State does not award until August/ September and their process for getting agreements out and
releasing funds means that there will be no rehabilitation in 2014. The City has prepared program guidelines for rehabilitation
and has an active Loan Committee so it will be a matter of the funds being released by the State as to when the rehabilitation
can occur.
Senior Housing
The Agency purchased property in 2005 on Morning Star Way to abate five older structures in order to construct ten new senior
housing units. The project was to be in partnership with Northern Valley Catholic Social Services (NVCSS). After reviewing infra-
structure needs at the site, most notably in the area of drainage, the Agency looked for other property to purchase for that use.
Drainage issues for the Morning Star property extend off-site and will require looking at additional properties to provide a
neighborhood solution for the drainage issues. Such a solution will require that there are more properties involved and a local-
ized drainage solution made part of any development in the area.
The replacement property, which is larger at 2/3 acre, is located at the intersection of Meade and Locust Streets. NVCSS has
remained a partner with the Agency for the new property. An RFP was issued in 2008, and Nichols, Melburg, Rossetto, a local
architectural firm, chosen to begin site development planning for a senior complex. NVCSS applied for HUD 202 funds in No-
vember 2009 and HOME (Home Investment Partnership Program-HUD and Cal HOME) funds in 2010. Neither application was
funded. They also applied for Tax Credit funding through the State and were not funded (3 times).

ARTICLE V      GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
State law requires that this element and all other elements be consistent with each other as follows:
                   “the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
                   internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies” (CA State Gov. Code § 65300.5)
Requiring internal consistency ensures that there will be no conflict between goals, policies, and programs in the other elements
of the General Plan and the Housing Element. This Element is the first element to be updated in the General Plan. The other
elements will be updated in the next calendar year. The Housing Element has laid the groundwork such that no other Element
amendments will conflict with this Housing Element
Other elements of the General Plan have been reviewed for consistency with this proposed Housing Element. The only incon-
sistency will occur when the proposed change to the land use density for Urban Residential (UR) and Urban Residential High
(URH) are processed, and the Land Use Element will be amended. The other proposals in the Housing Element for programs
essentially implements much of what was contemplated but not completed within the prior General Plan.
The City will update other portions of the General Plan and will review the Housing Element as changes to the other elements
are contemplated to ensure consistency. Because the remainder of the General Plan will be updated, statutory changes that
affect any of the elements from 1999 through 2014 will be reviewed and incorporated as appropriate so the updated General
Plan is consistent with State and Federal law.
This includes the update of the Safety and Conservation Elements consistent with Government Code Section 65302. The City
recently used Disaster Response Initiative funds (DRI) administered by HCD to prepare a Hazard Mitigation Plan which forms the
basis for the Safety Element (which includes Noise, Safety and Seismic Safety

ARTICLE VI          QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The information for the table below is based upon primarily on trends in our building permit activity as modified by the econom-
ic climate. While the City will be implementing new policies, which will make many types of housing much easier to develop, the
current economic situation is expected to extend throughout the planning period, 2014-2019.
We assume then that the mixture of units may become more diverse because of City activity but not necessarily a greater num-
ber in total than the prior planning period. This is consistent with many sources that track building construction and economic
trends. The last planning period was the beginning of a downturn that may have hit bottom. Unemployment has continued
downward.
This assumption for a number that reflects prior activity is based upon the fact that Shasta County has one of the highest fore-
closure rates, not only in California, but also in the United States. Foreclosuredata.com, an arm of the FDIC states, as of
04/11/14 has the following statistics for jurisdictions in the county:

This number of units in the region that are in foreclosure or already bank owned has a significant effect on the ability of the City
to attract developers/ contractors to the community when they may not be able to sell the units at a competitive rate with fore-
closed units. These numbers do not include "pre-foreclosure" or "resale" number, which add another several thousand units to
the totals that will be for sale.
Shasta Lake has the lowest number and rate of foreclosures as well as bank-owned properties. The volume of foreclosures in
Redding, which shares a city limit with the City of Shasta Lake, is significant and means that the largest market for resale homes
will be in Redding.
Shasta County also has one of the highest unemployment rates in California and the United States. With an unemployment re-
port of 10.9% noted in January by the California State Employment Development Department (EDD), Shasta County is in the top
1/3 of the counties in the state with the highest unemployment rates.
The chart below from EDD shows that the trend in the county for unemployment during the economic downturn was initially
upward not downward. Shasta County is still behind other counties in its ability to recover with unemployment as an indicator.
Large areas of California still have foreclosures and bank owned properties for sale. With few new jobs in the County there is
little incentive to buy property expect by retirees who are cashing out from areas with higher property values.
The City believes that there are residents and workers who live outside the City who will benefit from more use of the First Time
Homebuyer program. Consequently the City will be promoting the First-Time Homebuyer program through DAP to potential
purchasers of the new affordable housing being built and looking for additional properties where similar projects can be con-
structed.

The City has added an Implementation Program that will concentrate on trying to get a multi-family project constructed in the
next planning period – of some size—70-85 units. Such a project will take major amounts of staff time but could be a real asset
to residents who need decent housing or who work here but cannot find adequate housing.
The City of Shasta Lake is tied to the regional market since it has very little tax base compared to the other two cities in the
county, Redding and Anderson.
The City has had one developer during the last planning period who constructed a significant number of the moderate and
above-moderate housing units. The developer owned the subdivision in which he was constructing those units providing him
with a steady supply of lots. That subdivision is nearly full and the developer has approached the city about two defunct subdivi-
sion applications, which he may purchase for a similar purpose, construction of moderate and above-moderate income units.
The City has noted in the Housing Element and other response sections, the activities that we will be implementing to help en-
courage the production of extremely low, very low, and low-income units. If the 30 units of senior housing that we are assisting
proceeds to development, the low and extremely low numbers will increase. Short of having this project we believe we may
have two units total in those categories. Rehabilitation unit numbers are based upon historical trends in the City.

APPENDIX C CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT - HCD FUNDING RESOURCES
HCD manages the greatest number of funding sources available to the City of Shasta Lake. While HUD
direct grants/loans, USDA and CalHFA can also provide funding for projects in the City of Shasta Lake. HCD
directed funding is the most accessible for the City.
                Boxes that are shaded grey indicate programs shown on the HCD website that are no longer available.
                Boxes that have text in red are economic development funding sources that could be considered with
                mixed use projects.
                Boxes that are yellow are programs that are new, have changed or where the City can apply.
Noted in the table is whether the City is eligible for the funding and if there is a current application. Because the City is
small, is not an entitlement city, and does not have some of the required characteristics- such as mass transit, many of the
resources are not available to the City.

quarters, including single-room occupancy (SRO) housing, where 10 or more unrelated individuals are housed.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA): The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires larger lending institutions making
home mortgage loans to publicly disclose the location and disposition of home purchase, refinance, and improvement
loans. Institutions subject to HMDA must also disclose the gender, race, and income of loan applicants.
HOME Program: The HOME Investment Partnership Act, Title II of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990. HOME is a
Federal program administered by HUD which provides formula grants to States and localities to fund activities that build,
buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or home ownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income
people.
Homeless: Unsheltered homeless are families and individuals whose primary nighttime residence is a public or private
place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings (e.g., the street,
sidewalks, cars, vacant and abandoned buildings). Sheltered homeless are families and persons whose primary nighttime
residence is a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter (e.g., emergency, transitional, battered women, and
homeless youth shelters; and commercial hotels used to house the homeless).
Household: All those persons—related or unrelated—who occupy a single housing unit.
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is usually described as very low
income, low income, moderate income, and upper income based upon household size, and income, relative to the
regional median income.

Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The concept of
household is important because the formation of new households generates the demand for housing. Each new
household formed creates the need for one additional housing unit or requires one existing housing unit be shared by two
households. Household formation can continue to take place without an increase in population, thereby increasing the
demand for housing.
Housing and Community Development, Department of (HCD): The State agency with principal responsibility for
assessing, planning for, and assisting communities to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income households.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD): Cabinet-level department of the federal government that
administers housing and community development programs.
Housing Authority, Local (LHA): Local housing agency established in State law, subject to local activation and operation.
Originally intended to manage certain federal subsidies, but vested with broad powers to develop and manage other
forms of affordable housing.
Housing Problems: Defined by HUD as a household which: (1) occupies a unit with physical defects (lacks complete
kitchen or bathroom); (2) meets the definition of overcrowded; or (3) spends more than 30% of income on housing cost.
Housing Subsidy: Housing subsidies refer to government assistance aimed at reducing housing sales or rent prices to
more affordable levels. Two general types of housing subsidy exist. Where a housing subsidy is linked to a particular
house or apartment, housing subsidy is “project” or “unit” based. In Section 8 rental assistance programs the subsidy is
linked to the family and assistance provided to any number of families accepted by willing private landlords. This type of
subsidy is said to be “tenant based.”
Housing Unit: Place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. Housing unit may be a single-family dwelling,
a multi-family dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile home, a cooperative, or any other residential unit
considered real property under State law. Housing unit has, at least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to sleep. It
also is a dwelling that cannot be moved without substantial damage or unreasonable cost.
Impact Fee: A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the development of a project by a city, county, or other public
agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will produce.
Inclusionary Zoning: Provisions established by a public agency to require a specific percentage of housing units in a
project or development remain affordable to very low-, and low-, or moderate income households for a specified period.
Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or technique that carries out General Plan policy.
Implementation programs specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and a time frame for its
accomplishment.
Income Category: Four categories classify a household according to income based on the median income for the county.
Under state housing statutes, these categories are defined as follows: Very Low (0-50% of county median); Low (50-80%
of county median); Moderate (80- 120% of county median); and Upper (over 120% of county median).
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over properties) within areas already
largely developed.
Jobs/Housing Balance; Jobs/Housing Ratio: The availability of affordable housing for employees. The jobs/housing ratio
divides the number of jobs in an area by the number of employed residents. A ratio of 1.0 indicates a balance. A ratio
greater than 1.0 indicates a net in-commute; less than 1.0 indicates a net out-commute.
Large Household: A household with five or more members.
Lease: A contractual agreement by which an owner of real property (the lessor) gives the right of possession to another (a
lessee) for a specified period of time (term) and for a specified consideration (rent).
Low-income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): Tax reductions provided by the federal and State governments for investors in
housing for low-income households.
Manufactured Housing: Housing constructed of manufactured components, assembled partly at site rather than totally at
the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
                                                                                                              Appendix D-4

Market-Rate Housing: Housing available on the open market without any subsidy. The price for housing is determined by
the market forces of supply and demand and varies by location.
Mean: The average of a range of numbers.
Median: The mid-point in a range of numbers.
Median Income: The annual income for each household size within a region defined annually by HUD. Half of the
households in the region have incomes above the median and half have incomes below the median.
Mitigate, v.: To ameliorate, alleviate, or avoid to the extent reasonably feasible.
Mixed-use: Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial, institutional, and residential, are combined in a
single building or on a single site in an integrated development project with significant functional interrelationships and a
coherent physical design. A "single site" may include contiguous properties.
Mobile Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed for use as a
single-family dwelling unit and which (1) has a minimum of 400 square feet of living space; (2) has a minimum width in
excess of 102 inches; (3) is connected to all available permanent utilities; and (4) is tied down (a) to a permanent
foundation on a lot either owned or leased by the homeowner or (b) is set on piers, with wheels removed and skirted, in a
mobile home park.
Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB): A state, county or city program providing financing for the development of housing
through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
Multi-family Dwelling Unit: A building or portion thereof designed for or occupied by two or more families living
independently of each other, including duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, apartments, and condominiums.
Overcrowding: Households or occupied housing units with 1.01 or more persons per room, excluding bathrooms.
Parcel: A lot in single ownership or under single control usually considered a unit for purposes of development.
Physical Defects: A housing unit lacking complete kitchen or bathroom facilities (U.S. Census definition). Jurisdictions may
expand the Census definition in defining units with physical defects.
Poverty Level: As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are classified as being above or below the
poverty level based on a poverty index that provides a range of income cutoffs or "poverty thresholds" varying by size of
family, number of children, and age of householder. The income cutoffs are updated each year to reflect the change in
the Consumer Price Index.
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific tenant. A tenant receiving
project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance upon moving from the project.
Public Housing: A project-based low-rent housing program operated by independent local public housing authorities. A
low-income family applies to the local public housing authority in the area in which they want to live.
Quantified Objective: The housing element must include quantified objectives which specify the maximum number of
housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved by income level within a five- year time frame, based
on the needs, resources, and constraints identified in the housing element (GC §65583 (b)).
The number of units that can be conserved should include a subtotal for the number of existing assisted units subject to
conversion to non-low income households. Whenever possible, objectives should be set for each particular housing
program, establishing a numerical target for the effective period of the program.
Ideally, the sum of the quantified objectives will be equal to the identified housing needs. However, identified needs may
exceed available resources and limitations imposed by other requirements of state planning law. Where this is the case,
the quantified objectives need not equal the identified housing needs, but should establish the maximum number of units
that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved (including existing subsidized units subject to conversion which can
be preserved for lower- income use), given the constraints.
Redevelop: To demolish existing buildings; or increase the overall floor area existing on a property; or both; irrespective
of whether a change occurs in land use.
                                                                                                               Appendix D-5

percent of all tax increment dollars generated from each redevelopment project area for increasing and improving the
community’s supply of affordable housing.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA): The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is based on State of California
projections of population growth/housing unit demand and assigns a share of the region’s future housing need to each

groups present in their community.
Subdivision: Division of a tract of land into defined lots, either improved or unimproved, which can be separately
conveyed by sale or lease, and which can be altered or developed.

NOTES:
    1. All of the units set as an objectives in the 2009 Housing Element were way too high to be even possible in the City. The City has not had a high of over 60 units in one year- of
          an income level combined. The new RHNA numbers that will be used to develop the 2014 Objectives are much more attainable than those produced by the State of California
          for the 2009 Housing Element.
    2.    HE 1.10 - One is a developer of single-family affordable units. The City approved a 7 unit affordable housing subdivision, applied for, received funding for off-site infrastructure,
          and waived impact fees for the subdivision. The City encouraged the developer to work with the California Heritage Youth Build Academy and use trainees for construction-,
          which they are now doing. The first building permit has been issued in 2014. The City had 2 Habitat for Humanity houses constructed in the City. City staff expedited the pro-
          cess for these units. The City Council approved a First-Time Homebuyer loan for the first house and waived impact fees for the second house. The City continues to work with
          North Valley Catholic Social Services (NVCSS) as they attempt to fund a senior housing project (31 units). They have applied for HUD 202 funding as well as applied through the
          State Housing Tax Credit Program (3 times) but have not been funded.

General Plan
I.        INTRODUCTION
          On July 2, 1993, the City of Shasta Lake incorporated and adopted the Shasta County General Plan
          on an interim basis. The initial City budget recommended funding for the preparation of the City of
          Shasta Lake General Plan, but due to a dispute with Shasta County over LAFCo approved terms of
          incorporation revenue transfer amounts, funds to prepare the revision to the General Plan were not
          available. Due to the uncertainty of funding availability, on May 7, 1996, the City Council adopted
          the County General Plan and Zoning Regulations for an indeterminate period per Government Code
          Section 65301(a). Due to an April 1997 judicial ruling, the City was able to provide the necessary
          funding to revise the General Plan in a comprehensive manner.
          On April 1, 1997 the City Council conducted a public hearing and adopted Resolution CC-97-81 to
          file a request for a two-year extension to the State of California Office of Planning and Research
          (OPR) to revise and adopt the General Plan. On April 25, 1997, the request was approved. In
          November of 1997, the City Council authorized the General Plan revision effort to commence. Diaz
          Associates was selected to spearhead the General Plan Revision effort and in December 1997, the
          General Plan revision process began with the appointment of a General Plan Task Force comprised
          of Planning Commission Members to oversee the preparation of the Plan. The General Plan Task
          Force completed a series of eight public hearings and workshops which led to the acceptance of the
          Draft General Plan Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Measures and the Land Use and Circulation
          Map to be circulated for public review and comment.
          On November 3, 1998, the Notice of Preparation and Initial Study determination to prepare an
          environmental impact report was distributed to local agencies and organizations, the State
          Clearinghouse, and made available to interested citizens. A scoping session was held on November
          10, 1998. The comment period ended on December 11, 1998 and only one comment letter was
          received.
          On February 5, 1999, an Administrative Draft General Plan was completed and distributed for
          Planning Commission review on February 10. An Administrative Draft Environmental Impact
          Report was provided on February 19. At public meetings held on March 3, 10 and 17 the Planning
          Commission provided input on the two documents and formally authorized their distribution for
          formal public review and comment on March 17, 1999. On March 29, the Draft Environmental
          Impact Report (DEIR) was submitted to the State Clearinghouse for distribution and
          commencement of the 45-day public review and comment period. The review period ended on May
          12, 1999. On May 20, 1999 the Planning Commission recommended to the City Council
          certification of the Final EIR and adoption of the Draft General Plan. The City Council conducted a
          public hearing on June 1 to obtain public input. On June 15, 1999 the City Council certified the
          Final EIR and adopted the General Plan. During the time period beginning on December 4, 1997,
          when the first public workshop was held and ending on May 20, 1999 when the General Plan was
          adopted, a total of 20 public workshops and public hearings were conducted.

                    California State law (Government Code Section 65300) requires the City of Shasta Lake to
                    adopt a general plan "for the physical development of the city, and any land outside its
                    boundaries which . . . bears relation to its planning." The general plan serves as a
                    "constitution" for development, the foundation upon which all land use decisions are to be
                    based. It expresses community development goals and embodies public policy relative to
                    the distribution of future land use, both public and private. In summary, it is a statement of
                    the City's vision of its physical growth over the next 20 years to the Year 2020.

General Plan
                    The City of Shasta Lake General Plan will serve to:
                            Establish long-range development policies;
                            Provide the Planning Commission and City Council a basis for judging whether
                            specific private development proposals and public projects are consistent with the
                            policies;
                            Guide public agencies and private developers in designing projects that are
                            consistent with City policies;
                            Provide a basis for decision making, including a nexus to support development
                            exactions as required by Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987) 107 S. Ct.
                            3141;
                            Provide citizens with opportunities to participate in the planning and decision-
                            making processes of the City; and,
                            Inform citizens, developers, decision-makers, the City of Redding and Shasta
                            County and other public agencies of the "ground rules" that will guide development
                            within the City.
                    The General Plan was designed to be:
                            Long range in nature since almost any development decision has effects lasting for
                            more than several years;
                            Comprehensive since the Plan must provide direction to coordinate all major
                            components of the City's physical development; and,
                            General because although it serves as a framework for detailed public and
                            development proposals, it establishes requirements for additional planning studies
                            which must be completed prior to any future actions to modify land use allocations.
                            Simple in format so that the Community can have a clear and concise understanding
                            of its contents.
          B.        CONTENTS
                    A general plan is required by State law to address the following seven elements briefly
                    summarized as follows:
                            The Land Use Element designates the general distribution and intensity of uses of
                            the land for housing, business, industry, open space, education, public buildings and
                            grounds, waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses.
                            The Circulation Element is correlated with the land use element and identifies the
                            general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
                            transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities.
                       The Housing Element is a comprehensive assessment of current and projected housing
                            needs for all segments of the community and all economic groups. In addition, it
                            embodies policy for providing adequate housing and includes action programs for
                            this purpose.
                       The Conservation Element addresses the conservation, development, and use of
                            natural resources including water, forests, soils, rivers, and mineral deposits.

General Plan
                        The Open Space Element details plans and measures for preserving open space for
                             natural resources, the managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, public
                             health and safety, and the identification of agricultural land.
                        The Noise Element identifies and appraises noise problems within the community and
                             forms the basis for land use distribution.
                             The Safety Element establishes policies and programs to protect the community
                             from risks associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and fire hazards.
                    In addition to the general plan elements listed above, the City may adopt "any other
                    elements or address any other subjects which...relate to the physical development of the
                    county or city" (Government Code Section 65303). Upon adoption, an optional element
                    becomes an integral part of the general plan and has the same force and effect as the
                    mandatory elements and must be consistent with the other elements of the plan.
                    In spite of the lack of sufficient funds to revise the General Plan in a comprehensive
                    manner, the mandatory Circulation and Housing Elements were revised and adopted on April 1,
                    1997 and June 16, 998, respectively. An optional Air Quality Element was adopted on
                    October 17. 1995. The funding for the preparation of these Elements was derived primarily
                    from grants.
                    The City of Shasta Lake General Plan Revision addresses all of the mandatory elements and
                    incorporates the mandatory Housing and Circulation Elements and the optional Air Quality
                    Element into the Plan. In addition, a Parks and Recreation Element is integrated into the Plan.
                        The Parks and Recreation Element is closely linked with the Open Space Element
                             since plentiful, well-designed parks and recreation facilities contribute to the quality
                             of life in the community and help to preserve natural features and habitat areas.
          C.        FORMAT
                    Some local governments adopt their general plan elements individually. However, due to the
                    nature of the state's general plan statutes, a number of issues (such as flooding) have to be
                    addressed more than once. This results in needless duplication and bulk, and makes
                    administration difficult. Therefore, the City of Shasta Lake has combined elements so that
                    the General Plan is adopted as a single general plan document arranged by primary issue
                    topics within which each element is addressed. The format addresses all the mandatory
                    general plan elements, but is organized to eliminate redundancies, where possible.
                    Support documentation for the General Plan is provided in the following documents, which
                    provide background information and analyses and are an integral part of the General Plan.
                    The documents are provided under separate cover.

                             The City of Shasta Lake’s Land Use and Circulation Map, located at the back of this
                             document, is an integral part of the General Plan. Normally these maps are
                             separate, however, to clearly identify the relationship of land use to circulation the
                             maps were combined into one. The Map identifies the type of land use permitted
                             on each property covered by the General Plan. The circulation component of the
                             Map identifies current and proposed arterial and collector streets, or other roadways
                             as well as rail lines and the conceptual location of trail systems. Other pertinent
                             features of the Land Use and Circulation Map include the location of existing and
                             proposed parks, public schools, and other public services and facilities.
          D.        CONSISTENCY
                    INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
                    The State of California General Plan Guidelines provide a clear discussion regarding the general
                    plan consistency issue. The concept of internal consistency, as used in California Planning
                    Law, means that no policy conflicts exist, either textual or diagrammatic, between the
                    components of an otherwise complete and adequate general plan. Without consistency in
                    the five areas described below, a general plan cannot effectively serve as a clear guide to
City of Shasta Lake                                         4                                           June 15, 1999
General Plan

                    future development. Decision-makers will face conflicting directives; citizens will be
                    confused about the policies and standards the community has selected; and land owners,
                    business, and industry will be unable to rely on the general plan's stated priorities and
                    standards for their own individual decision making.
                            Equal Status among General Plan Elements
                            All elements of the general plan have equal legal status. For example, the land use
                            and open space elements cannot contain different land use intensity standards
                            rationalized by statements such as "if in any instance there is a conflict between the
                            land use element and the open space element, the land use element controls"
                            Consistency among the Elements (Inter-element Consistency)
                            All general plan elements, whether mandatory or optional, must be consistent with
                            each other. As an example, the land use and open space elements should not
                            designate different future land uses for the same site. Whenever a jurisdiction
                            adopts a new element or amends part of a plan, it should update the rest of the plan
                            at the same time, or immediately thereafter. It must eliminate any inconsistencies
                            that the new element or amendment creates.
                            Consistency within an Element (Intra-element Consistency)
                            Each element's data, analyses, goals, policies, and implementation programs, must
                            be consistent with and complement one another. Established goals, data, and
                            analysis form the foundation for any ensuing policies. For example, if one portion
                            of a circulation element indicates that city roads are sufficient to accommodate the
                            projected level of traffic, while another section of the same element describes a
                            worsening traffic situation aggravated by continued subdivision activity, the element
                            cannot be internally consistent.
                            Area Plan Consistency
                            Internal consistency also means that all principles, goals, objectives, policies, and
                            plan proposals set forth in an area or community plan must be consistent with the
                            overall general plan.
                            Text and Diagram Consistency
                            Internal consistency means that the general plan text and diagrams must be
                            consistent with one another since both are integral parts of the plan. A general plan
                            with written policies and programs that conflict with its corresponding diagrams is
                            internally inconsistent. For example, if a general plan's land use element diagram
                            designates extensive low density residential development in an area where the text
                            describes the presence of prime agricultural land, and further contains written policies
                            to preserve agricultural land or open space in this area, a conflict exists.
                            All land use regulations and plans must be consistent with the general plan. These
                            include zoning ordinances, subdivision ordinances, specific and area plans, and
                            redevelopment plans. Ensuring that existing ordinances and plans are consistent
                            with the general plan is one method of implementing the general plan's policies.
                            Other methods include development of new ordinances, plans, financing programs,
                            capital improvement programming, code enforcement, and the entitlement process.
                            The General Plan identifies implementation measures or programs.

General Plan
                    CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PLANNING PROCESSES
                    To be an effective guide for future development, the general plan must provide a framework
                    for local development that is consistent with the policies of relevant State, regional, and local
                    programs and regulatory agencies. The General Plan takes into consideration the following
                    plans or regulations:
                         Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Maps
                         Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan
                         Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) Sphere of Influence
                         Regional Housing Needs Assessment
                         Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA)
                         Shasta County Air Quality Attainment Plan
                         Shasta County Congestion Management Plan
                         Shasta County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
                         Shasta County Regional Transportation Plan
                    In addition, the general plan is subject to the requirements of the California Environmental
                    Quality Act (CEQA). A separately bound environmental impact report (EIR) has been
                    prepared in compliance with CEQA requirements to evaluate and disclose the
                    environmental impacts associated with implementation of the General Plan.

                    The general plan defines key terms that are used repeatedly throughout the text. The following
                    terms are defined as used within the context of a general plan.
                    Goal
                    A goal is a broad, generalized expression of commonly held community values. Since a goal is
                    broadly stated, disagreement regarding a goal tends to be uncommon.
                    Objectives
                    Objectives are similar to goals and frequently the two terms are used interchangeably. As used
                    in the general plan, however, an objective is a more narrowly drawn expression of community
                    intent. One goal may imply two or more objectives, each responsive to a particular aspect of a
                    more broadly stated goal. For example, a community goal might be Protection of natural resources.
                    A related objective could be Prevention of erosion, which leads to loss of soils, degradation of water quality,
                    and destruction of wildlife habitats. It should be noted that the existing City of Shasta Lake Housing
                    and Circulation Elements used goals to describe objectives.
                    Policy
                    A policy is a precise statement of public regulatory powers and fiscal resources that will be
                    exercised and allocated to achieve a specific objective. Policies may be expressed in text, maps,
                    diagrams, or some combination thereof. Since policies are tangible, they can be quantitatively
                    measured. It is important to note that some policies are more specific than others. Examples
                    of policies relating to the previous examples of goal and objective include, Construction practices
                    shall provide for the impoundment of storm waters and removal of sediment prior to discharge into creeks, and

General Plan
                    development shall not be permitted on highly erosive soil when slopes exceed 15% (or some other specified
                    limit).
                    The policies contained in the general plan are expressed in terms of shall or should. There is
                    an important distinction between these two terms. As used in the general plan, shall indicates
                    an unequivocal commitment, while should indicates a guide toward accomplishing a long-range
                    goal.
                    Implementation
                    The final link in the hierarchy running from an objective to its physical realization is provided by
                    implementation. Although implementation is commonly spoken of in terms of programs
                    implying a long-term effort, it may be of much shorter duration and simply be referred to as a
                    measure. In any event, implementation programs and measures are concerned with the specific
                    actions necessary for accomplishment within a definite time. Examples of implementation
                    measures include Revision of the zoning and grading ordinances or the development standards.

II.       GENERAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
          A.        GENERAL GOALS
                    There are four existing major ideas, or concepts that provide a summary or overview of what
                    the General Plan is attempting to accomplish and why. There are four major goals that the
                    General Plan advances.
                    Goal 1           Preserve and enhance the quality of life by providing a variety of living
                                     environments and accommodating growth.
                    Goal 2           Geographic distribution and the timing of growth shall be directly related to
                                     the provision and/or improvement of public facilities, services and utilities.
                    Goal 3           Recognition that the general plan is a decision-making tool which will be
                                     reviewed and revised periodically.
                    Goal 4           Apply an interjurisdictional approach to planning issues.
          B.        GENERAL OBJECTIVES
                    The function of the following objectives is to provide guidelines for the implementation of
                    the General Plan and the operation of the planning process. These objectives are advanced
                    as part of the General Plan.
                    1-1              To insure that planning is a comprehensive process that is derived from
                                     public policies clearly stated in the General Plan and includes the
                                     application of these policies to lands within the City and Sphere of
                                     Influence through redevelopment, zoning, subdivision, and other
                                     mechanisms and regulations.
                    1-2              To develop a General Plan which is both internally consistent among all its
                                     elements and which provides the policy basis for the redevelopment,
                                     zoning, subdivision, and other implementing mechanisms and ordinances.
                    1-3              To develop public trust and confidence that the objectives, polices, and
                                     implementation measures shall be faithfully adhered to and equitably
                                     applied to all land use matters.
                    1-4              To provide public assurance that the General Plan shall be applied in a
                                     manner that responds to local conditions and local concerns through the
                                     interpretation of its policies, but only within well-defined and understood
                                     limits intended to preserve the overall integrity of the plan.
                    I-5              To develop a planning process that resists short-term pressures exerted by
                                     narrow interests to modify the General Plan, but is capable of thoughtfully
                                     responding to significantly changing conditions or community needs.

General Plan
                    1-6 To insure that administration of the planning process is characterized by:
                             The efficient and expeditious handling of planning matters through the
                                 coordination and communication of the various departments and
                                 divisions of the City and other government agencies
                             Timely and decisive action on all planning matters.
                    1-7 To promote a planning process which is accessible to all citizens.
                    1-8 To fashion a planning process that recognizes the continuing need for
                        citizen review of the objectives, policies, and implementation measures
                        contained in the General Plan.
                    1-9 To convert the General Plan land use boundaries to precise zoning
                        boundaries through the use of natural and man-made physical boundaries
                        such as creeks, ridges, roads, etc., and non-physical boundaries such as
                        property lines, section lines, etc.

General Plan
III.      OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
          As previously identified, the City of Shasta Lake has combined general plan elements so that the
          General Plan is adopted as a single document arranged by primary issue topics within which each
          general plan element is addressed. The topics are Natural Resources Group, Public Health and Safety
          Group, and Community Organization Group. Prior to the establishment of Goals, Objectives, Policies and
          Implementation Measures for the General Plan, the General Plan Task Force, after a series of public
          workshops, identified a series of key issues that needed to be evaluated for consideration and inclusion in
          the General Plan.      Open space, parks and recreation, land use, public services and facilities,
          circulation, and housing were the areas identified as being of most concern. Therefore, prior to the
          identification of Objectives and Policies, the issues of concern will be briefly discussed when they
          specifically relate to a General Plan Element. Background information, existing conditions, and
          analyses are provided in two documents that are an integral part of the General Plan and are
          provided under separate cover. The two documents are the City of Shasta Lake General Plan Existing
          Conditions Report dated July 27, 1998 and amended on September 9, 1999 and the July 27, 1998City of
          Shasta Lake General Plan Revision Land Use Alternatives Working Papers.
          A.        NATURAL RESOURCES GROUP
          CONSERVATION
                    MINERALS
                    Objectives
                    M-1              Protect known significant mineral resources from land uses both onsite and
                                     offsite, which would be incompatible with mining operations.
                    Policies
                    M-a              Large-scale mineral resource areas shall be designated Mineral Resource.
                                     Based on the results of mineral resource exploration, additional lands may be
                                     placed in this category and lands presently subject to this category may be
                                     removed from it. Uses permitted in these areas shall include mineral
                                     exploration and extraction, processing, and accessory uses. Residential uses
                                     may be permitted for security and labor housing.
                    M-b              Development and uses within and abutting Mineral Resource lands shall be
                                     regulated so that proposed future land uses avoid or mitigate incompatibilities
                                     with mineral extraction operations.
                    M-c              Upon classification by the State Geologist of any land area as a Mineral
                                     Resource Zone (MRZ) or Scientific Resource Zones (SZ), pursuant to the
                                     State Mining and Reclamation Act, the City shall apply the mineral resource
                                     category to areas classified as MRZ-2 or SZ.
                    M-d              All approved mining or mineral extraction operations shall have a reclamation
                                     plan for the rehabilitation, reuse, erosion control, and water quality protection
                                     of mineral resource lands.
City of Shasta Lake                                        11                                             June 15, 1999
General Plan
                    M-e           Ensure that mining operations are conducted in a manner which protect the
                                  public health, safety, and welfare by minimizing impacts on adjacent land uses
                                  and mitigating potential adverse cumulative impacts.
                    Implementation Measures
                    M-(1)         If aggregate mineral resources of regional or statewide significance are
                                  identified by the state, the General Plan should be amended, where
                                  appropriate, and zoning regulation should be applied permitting extraction
                                  as a conditional use and prohibiting incompatible uses, consistent with state
                                  law.
                    ENERGY
                    Objectives
                    E-1           Utilize the City's renewable resource base to the extent feasible, including
                                  passive and active solar, wind, co-generation, and biomass.
                    E-2           Conserve nonrenewable energy resources, specifically raw materials,
                                  transportation fuels, and land area, through the recovery and recycling of solid
                                  waste materials in a cost effective manner.
                    Policies
                    E-a           The City of Shasta Lake in conjunction with Shasta County and the City of
                                  Redding, shall work towards land use patterns that would support a regional
                                  transit route.
                    E-b           City government shall review its energy consumption performance and
                                  implement programs designed to increase energy efficiency.
                    E-c           City ordinances and regulations shall be reviewed to eliminate barriers to the
                                  use of renewable energy resources.
                    E-d           Priority shall be given to energy projects and programs that provide jobs and
                                  other economic benefits within the City.
                    Implementation Measures
                    E-(1)         Coordinate with the City Electric Department to educate the public about
                                  the need to conserve scarce energy resources, insulate buildings to reduce
                                  energy required for heating and cooling, and use energy-efficient appliances.
                    E-(2)         Require consideration of passive solar energy techniques in subdivision
                                  design; including house orientation, street and lot layout, vegetation and
                                  protection of solar access.
                    E-(3)         Continue to require new buildings to meet state energy efficiency standards,
                                  and develop a design manual showing examples of energy conservation in
                                  subdivision planning, site layout, landscaping, and building design.

                                  to the City's wastewater collection system. Develop an implementation
                                  plan for connection to the sewer system for existing residential
                                  development and individual houses where septic systems have failed.
                    W-(3)         Maintain an inventory of known sources of groundwater and soil
                                  contamination, including underground storage tanks, landfills, septic tanks,
                                  and industrial uses and prepare annual reports of groundwater quality and
                                  efforts being undertaken to eliminate groundwater and soil contamination.

General Plan
                    W-(4)      In coordination with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
                               Board and the Department of Fish and Game, periodically monitor and
                               prepare reports on surface water quality in Churn, Salt, and Moody Creeks.
                    W-(5)      Require the use of Best Management Practices to control runoff from all new
                               development, including the issuance of building permits.
                    W-(6)      Continue requiring project proponents to provide plans for erosion and
                               sedimentation control from their sites during construction.
                    W-(7)      Explore alternatives to storm water collection methods, including the use of
                               detention/retention basins to implement the"no net runoff" concept.
                    W-(8)      Establish storm water run-off reduction standards for projects larger than
                               five acres and incentives for "zero-net" storm water runoff, such as reduced
                               storm drainage impact fees.

                    FISH, WILDLIFE & VEGETATION
                    Objectives
                    FW-1       Conserve and manage significant fish, wildlife and vegetation resources.
                    FW-2       Recognize that wildlife habitat and development practices may on occasion
                               conflict and shall need to be resolved according to policies specified in the
                               General Plan.
                    Policies
                    FW-a       Significant wildlife habitat resources, to be determined through a
                               comprehensive study or on a project by project basis, shall be classified on the
                               General Plan Maps as Natural Resources Protection-Habitat (NH).
                               In areas designated NH, residential units may be permitted at the density
                               indicated on the land use map. If a project proponent agrees to cluster
                               residential units, up to a 100 percent density bonus may be permitted if the
                               parcels are clustered to the degree necessary to reduce the negative impacts on
                               wildlife habitat. When the clustering option is utilized, the clustered parcels
                               shall be sited to reduce the impacts on critical habitat elements such as wildlife
                               watering sites, roost sites and nest concentrations. The balance of the land
                               shall remain in open space. Recreation uses may also be conditionally
                               permitted when identified significant adverse impacts on the habitat resource
                               are mitigated.
                    FW-b       Projects that may impact rare, threatened or endangered plant or animal
                               species, as officially designated by federal and state resource agencies, shall be
                               designed or conditioned to avoid significant adverse impacts on those species.
                    FW-c       The significant creekside corridors in the City shall be designated on General
                               Plan Maps.

General Plan
                    Implementation Measures
                    FW-(1)        Prepare a Best Practices Manual, including general development standards and
                                  resources management guidelines for all sensitive habitats found in the City.
                                  Standards and Guidelines should be developed for the following habitat
                                  types: oak woodlands, riparian woodlands, vernal pools, emergent wetlands,
                                  riverine habitats, and open water.
                    FW-(2)        Ensure that open space corridors along creeks include protective buffers
                                  (non-development setbacks), preserve existing riparian vegetation through
                                  the environmental review process and require minimum setbacks from the
                                  top-of-bank along creeks. Specific setbacks and widths will be determined
                                  on a case by case basis. Input from resource agencies, including the
                                  Department of Fish and Game will be considered in determining the
                                  setback distance.
                    FW-(3)        Evaluate and implement, where feasible, means to minimize or avoid
                                  interference with sensitive wildlife on the urban fringe by domestic pets.
                    FW-(4)        Ensure that all new developments restrict the use of fencing in locations
                                  essential for wildlife movement and place structures so as to minimize
                                  interference with wildlife movement.
                    FW-(5)        Evaluate the establishment of regulations and development standards for
                                  NH lands and lands located adjacent to NH lands, including provisions for
                                  clustering of development, waiver of minimum-lot-width requirements,
                                  narrower local streets widths, and other techniques where these would
                                  enhance protection of sensitive habitats and resources.
                    FW-(6)        Evaluate the establishment of procedures for reviewing development
                                  applications in, or adjacent to, NH areas and for approving off-site
                                  mitigation to replace resources affected by development.
                    FW-(7)        Protect and preserve areas identified for Natural Resources Protection-
                                  Habitat (NH). Evaluate amending the zoning ordinance to include
                                  habitat protection standards, particularly buffering, for sites abutting
                                  Natural Resources Protection-Habitat.
                    FW-(8)        Evaluate and implement, where feasible, linking NH areas with
                                  interconnecting open space corridors, particularly those which provide
                                  access to water sources and enhance overall biological diversity of the area.
                    FW-(9)        Evaluate the establishment of a fund for acquisition and/or maintenance of
                                  Natural Resource Protection-Habitat areas to ensure permanent
                                  protection, if tax revenues not otherwise committed can be allocated for the
                                  purpose. Also, explore the feasibility of establishing maintenance districts
                                  for ongoing management activities.
                    FW-(10)       Coordinate with the Shasta County Mosquito Abatement District to ensure
                                  that acceptable disease vector control measures are coordinated with
                                  preservation of resources such as wetlands, recognizing the community's
                                  interest in meeting federal and state wetlands protection policies.

General Plan
                    FW-(11)           Coordinate with the Department of Fish and Game to ensure the
                                      preservation and enhancement of species of resident and anadromous fish
                                      in creeks within the City.
                    OPEN SPACE, PARKS & RECREATION
                    Open space, parks and recreation areas were specific areas of concern that were identified as
                    being key to the development of the City of Shasta Lake. It was determined that open space,
                    bike and trail routes, and flood plains needed to be carefully integrated with existing and
                    proposed land uses. Areas needed to be designated as greenbelts to provide visual quality
                    and as a means to preserve natural habitat. Clearly identified was the need for sufficient
                    parkland to accommodate future development needs. However, it was determined that there
                    currently exists a need for neighborhood parks, particularly in the developing areas of the
                    City. Lastly, facilities to provide off-road bicycle recreation opportunities were also an
                    identified need. Objectives and Policies evolved that would specifically address these areas
                    of concern.
                    Objectives
                    OSR-1             Conserve and manage the open-space and recreation resources of the City of
                                      Shasta Lake for the use and enjoyment by City residents and visitors both now
                                      and in the future.
                    OSR-2             Provide public access to open-space and recreation resources consistent with
                                      the need to protect these resources and consider the rights of private property
                                      owners.
                    OSR-3             Establish, integrate, and maintain "natural" and "man-made" greenbelt areas
                                      along existing creeks, floodplains, natural open space areas, certain
                                      roadways, bike and trail systems.
                    OSR-4             Link existing and future development in a manner that provides open space
                                      and recreational opportunities.
                    OSR-5             Provide sufficient park facilities to serve the City's population.
                    Policies
                    OSR-a             Parks and recreation systems, planning, acquisition, development, and
                                      operation should be coordinated among City, Shasta County, state and federal
                                      governments, as well as schools and special districts, and should take
                                      advantage of opportunities for linkages between publicly owned parks and
                                      publicly owned state and federal lands.
                    OSR-b             The significant creek and streamside corridors in the City of Shasta Lake shall
                                      be designated on the General Plan Maps. The primary purpose of this
                                      designation is to protect the riparian habitats from development. The purpose
                                      is also to encourage open space and recreation. Riparian habitat protection
                                      along the significant river and creekside corridors as designated on the plan
                                      maps shall be achieved, where appropriate.

General Plan
                                  The following measures are identified to provide the riparian habitat
                                  protection:
                                             regulation of vegetation removal
                                             design of grading and road construction
                                             establishment of a development set-back
                                             the siting of structures, including clustering.
                    OSR-c         The locations of existing and proposed large-scale community recreation
                                  facilities shall be designated on General Plan Maps as Natural Resources
                                  Protection Community Parks (NP).
                    OSR-d         The City may require the dedication of land and/or improvement of open
                                  space, parks, or the payment of in lieu-fees in accordance with City
                                  development standards as part of the entitlement and/or building permit
                                  process.
                    OSR-e         Provide for neighborhood parks.
                    OSR-f         Provide off-road pedestrian and non-motorized bike facilities, where
                                  feasible and practicable.
                    Implementation Measures
                    OSR-(1)       Provide 5 acres of neighborhood, community, and creekside parks per
                                  1,000 new residents. Strive to maintain a neighborhood park standard of at
                                  least 0.9 acres per 1,000 new residents
                    OSR-(2)       Evaluate the establishment of a park and recreation fee on non-residential
                                  development projects commensurate with expected use of such facilities by
                                  employees in such projects.
                    OSR-(3)       Evaluate the feasibility of developing smaller neighborhood parks, of about
                                  two acres, in selected areas where a landscape maintenance district or other
                                  funding mechanisms can be utilized and where the development pattern
                                  lends itself to such facilities.
                    OSR-(4)       The Land Use Map identifies a community park in the Pine Grove
                                  Avenue area along Churn Creek which would be a combination of natural
                                  open space, trails and formal park facilities. Residential and industrial
                                  development within the area would contribute to the development of the
                                  park. A landscape maintenance district or other funding mechanisms
                                  would be required to fund ongoing maintenance.
                    OSR-(5)       Evaluate the establishment of a network of bike and trail systems extending
                                  throughout the City. The system will be a combination of the existing and
                                  future road and sidewalk system and through greenbelt areas along existing
                                  creeks, streams, floodplains, natural open space and NH and NP
                                  designated areas. Public access will be preserved through new and existing
                                  development to enable future use of such trails. The Circulation Map
                                  identifies the system that could be located along minor arterials and
                                  collector streets and within certain creek corridors. A parkway system
                                  could connect the Salt Creek and Churn Creek corridors along Pine Grove

                    HERITAGE RESOURCES
                    Objectives
                    HER-1         Conserve and manage significant prehistoric and historic cultural resources.
                    Policies
                    HER-a         Development projects in areas containing known significant cultural resources
                                  shall be designed to minimize degradation of these resources. Where conflicts
                                  are unavoidable, mitigation measures, which reduce such impacts, shall be
                                  implemented. Possible mitigation measures may include clustering, buffer
                                  zones, and building siting requirements.
                    Implementation Measures
                    HER-(a)       Require a records search for any development project proposed in areas of
                                  high archaeology sensitivity to determine whether the site contains known
                                  prehistoric or historic cultural resources and/or to determine the potential
                                  for discovery of additional cultural resources.
                    HER-(b)       Require that sponsors of projects on sites where probable cause for
                                  discovery of archaeological resources (as indicated by records search and
                                  where resources have been discovered in the vicinity of the project) retain a
                                  consulting archaeologist to survey the project site. If unique resources, as
                                  defined by state law, are found, require preparation of an archaeological
                                  resource mitigation plan; monitor the project to ensure that mitigation
                                  measures are implemented.

                                  use of noise mitigation measures to reduce exterior sound levels in those
                                  residential areas to less than or equal to 60 dB CNEL.
                    N-(2)         Where noise mitigation measures are anticipated to be needed based on a
                                  review of a project, require that project applicants secure the services of a
                                  qualified acoustical engineer to perform a detailed technical study and to
                                  design mitigation measures.
                    N-(3)         Where site conditions permit, require noise buffers along the Union Pacific
                                  Railroad for all new adjoining developments that are subject to
                                  unacceptable noise levels.
                    N-(4)         Site-specific railroad noise studies shall be prepared for noise sensitive
                                  development projects anticipated to be affected by railroad noise.
                                  Generalized railroad noise contours are shown on the Noise Contour Map
                                  and serve as a "trigger" indicating where future study is advisable.
                    N-(5)         Control noise at the source through use of insulation, berms, building
                                  design and orientation, buffer yards, staggered operating hours, and other
                                  techniques; where necessary, use noise barriers to attenuate noise to
                                  acceptable levels; require that barriers are landscaped to reduce negative
                                  visual impacts on the community.
                    N-(6)         Encourage noise attenuation programs that avoid visible sound walls, where
                                  practical. Open space, parking, accessory buildings, frontage roads, and
                                  landscaping can be used to buffer development from noise.
                    N-(7)         Request Caltrans to provide freeway sound walls adjacent to residential
                                  areas where existing noise levels exceed 67 dB, consistent with State
                                  standards and Caltrans' priorities for community noise abatement.

                Notes:
                1. For traffic noise within the City of Shasta Lake, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are
                    estimated to be approximately similar. Interior noise level standards are applied within
                    noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed
                    positions.
                2. Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For
                    large parcels or residences with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard
                    shall be applicable within a 100 foot radius of the residence.
                3. For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at
                    the common outdoor recreation area, such as at pools, play areas or tennis courts.
                    Where such areas are not provided, the standards shall be applied at individual patios
                    and balconies of the development.
                4. Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less
                    using a practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior
                    noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be allowed provided that available exterior noise
                    level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise levels are in
                    compliance with this table.
                5. Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic
                    areas.
                6. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for
                    hospitals are applicable only at clearly identified areas designated for outdoor
                    relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
                7. Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation
                    have any degree of sensitivity to noise.

          AIR QUALITY
          The City of Shasta Lake Air Quality Element of the General Plan adopted on October 17, 1995 was not
          revised as part of this General Plan update and is incorporated herein by reference. However, the
          objectives, policies and implementation measures are provided. Some minor changes have been made to
          policies and implementation measures that are identified by an asterisk. It should be noted that none of
          the changes result in less restrictive criteria or measures. Policies AQ-n and AQ-o and Implementation
          Measures AQ-(1) and AQ-(2) are new.
                    Objectives
                    AQ-1*            Improve and maintain air quality to protect human health and preclude
                                     damage to plants and property.
                    AQ-2             Meet applicable California air quality standards and avoid violating Federal

                    AQ-b*            Land use decisions shall be made with consideration given to the
                                     improvement of air quality.            New development projects shall be
                                     conditioned to reduce air quality impacts. Standard Mitigation Measures and
                                     Best Available Mitigation Measures shall be incorporated into new projects
                                     when thresholds are exceeded. The City should consult with the Air
                                     Quality Management District regarding mitigation of air quality impacts.
                    AQ-c*            All parcels created by new land divisions and new multi-family residential,
                                     commercial and industrial development (or with expansion of such uses)
                                     shall be served by paved roads, driveways, and parking areas.
                                     A comprehensive plan shall be developed by the City that establishes when
                                     a road paving deferral should be granted, for what period of time, standards
                                     for determining the fair share of a paving requirement, and the level or
                                     standard of the paving work.
                    AQ-d             Encourage a land use pattern that reduces reliance on the automobile and
                                     encourages alternative modes of transportation for travel to employment
                                     and shopping by encouraging:
                                               infill development
                                               mixed-use development near employment centers (day care,
                                               restaurant, and bank)
                                               increased residential densities near employment and shopping, and
                                               along major traffic corridors

          C.        COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION GROUP
          LAND USE
          The Land Use Element and the Land Use and Circulation Map constitute the physical framework for the
          General Plan which designates the proposed location, distribution, and extent of land uses. As
          required by state law, land use classifications, shown as letter designations on the Map, specify a range
          for population density for each type of residential land use. These standards of population density
          and commercial and industrial intensity allow for the determination of circulation and public facility
          needs. They also reflect the environmental carrying capacity limitations.
          Land use was a specific area of concern identified as being key to the development of the City of Shasta
          Lake. Some of the major issues identified included an evaluation and establishment of urban, rural and
          urban reserve boundaries. This was accomplished by identifying areas that currently lack
          infrastructure that would be required to develop in an orderly manner through the development of
          Area Plans. Land use compatibility adjacent to the City of Redding and Shasta County was another
          issue area. In addition to Objectives and Policies that call for cooperative efforts, the Land Use Maps for
          the City of Redding and Shasta County were reviewed to determine compatibility. In addition, both
          agencies were provided opportunities to review and comment. Other issues of concern were:
                Addressing non-conforming land uses and undersized lots
                Promoting the community village concept through quality and character
                Improving neighborhood aesthetics
                Scaling back design review
                Reinforcing the need to undertake a market analysis to determine specific commercial uses in the
                    Village Commercial land use classification
                Integrating the Central Business District Plan into the General Plan
                Providing for light industrial and service commercial lands
                Determining a Sphere of Influence line and annexation potential
                    Designating appropriate land use classifications for federal lands
          Directly affecting the future land use pattern of the City are the last two issues. Currently, the City
          encompasses approximately 6,942 acres of land. The General Plan proposes inclusion of the 1,948
          acres (3 square miles) within the City Sphere of Influence. Of this total, 1,894 acres is owned by the
          Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) and lies generally to the north of the current
          City Limits. Of the total acreage, approximately 788 acres is suitable for future annexation in

General Plan
          The Bureau of Land Management currently has approximately 234 acres of land located within the
          existing City Limits. The majority of these lands are suitable for lower density residential
          designations of Rural Residential A and Rural Residential B and are designated as such on the
          Land Use and Circulation Map.
          Table LU-1 identifies land use and population projections for ultimate buildout of land within the
          City and the area proposed for future annexation.

          The Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures advanced in this Land Use Element component
          of the General Plan specifically address the key issues of concern.
                    Objectives
                    LU-1            Promote a development pattern which will accommodate, consistent with the
                                    other objectives of the Plan, the growth which will be experienced by City of
                                    Shasta Lake during the planning period (1999-2020), and as such period is
                                    extended by future revisions of the Plan.
                    LU-2            Guide development in a pattern that will provide opportunities for present
                                    and future City residents to enjoy the variety of living environments, which
                                    currently exist within the City, which are served by the full range of urban
                                    services.
                    LU-3            Guide development in a pattern that will minimize land use conflicts between
                                    adjacent land users.
                    LU-4            Guide development in a pattern that will establish an acceptable balance
                                    between public facility and service costs and public revenues derived from
                                    new development.
                    LU-5            Fashion a development pattern whose implementation mechanisms such as
                                    zoning, subdivision, and other regulations, explicitly define a relationship
                                    between public and private expectations and responsibilities concerning land
                                    use that is based on the following principles:
                                              Public programs shall recognize both the expectations of individual
                                              property owners to be able to use their lands as they desire and the
                                              responsibility of government to provide a regulatory climate, which
                                              does not impede reasonable private expectations.

General Plan
                                       Property owners shall recognize public programs emphasizing that
                                       land be used in a responsible manner that does not adversely affect
                                       either adjacent property owners or the community values of the
                                       citizens of the City.
                    LU-6     To recognize that the major economic resources for achieving the
                             development pattern will come from the private sector, rather than
                             government, and that the General Plan, as the expression of community
                             values, will guide the use of these resources.
                    LU-7     To integrate the Central Business District Plan into the General Plan.
                    LU-8     To establish a sense of community "village" quality and character
                             throughout the City.
                    LU-9     To improve existing neighborhood aesthetics.
                    Policies
                    LU-a     The City shall ensure the availability of an inventory of developable lands
                             sufficient to accommodate growth projected for the planning period.
                    LU-b     The City shall monitor, on a yearly basis, the rate at which the developable
                             land inventory is being consumed, the population and employment growth of
                             the City, and other useful indicators of City growth.
                    LU-c     The procedure for adding lands to the inventory shall be by amendment of the
                             Plan at five year intervals. This policy shall not preclude any resident or
                             property owner in the City from requesting a general plan amendment upon
                             submission of the required application and payment of the prescribed fee.
                    LU-d     The City shall ensure that a 15-20 year supply of commercial and industrial
                             land required for employment purposes is available within the City. The City
                             shall continue its close working relationship with economic development
                             groups to monitor the demand and supply of land.
                    LU-e     Expand the City Sphere of Influence and establish urban, rural and urban
                             reserve boundaries within the planning area, where appropriate.
                    .
                    LU-f     To the degree feasible, develop and ensure land use compatibility through
                             coordination and cooperation with the City of Redding and Shasta County.
                             All development applications which have the potential to impact lands or
                             facilities in the City of Redding and in the unincorporated areas of Shasta
                             County shall be submitted to the respective agencies for review and
                             comment.
                    LU-g     Federal and State lands will be recognized as part of the land use pattern
                             and designated accordingly.
                    LU-h     The General Plan shall contain residential, commercial, and industrial land use
                             categories, each of which is described in the Table LU-2 and shall be
                             implemented through more specific zone districts:

                         relationship with private, public and non-profit development groups to
                         monitor the demand and supply of land for housing purposes. The City shall
                         make appropriate, periodic revisions to the General Plan in order to maintain
                         the availability of residential lands.
                    LU-k Lands to be considered for industrial development shall demonstrate that
                         public services are available, the site is compatible with adjacent uses or of

                         orderly development.
                    LU-n The City's regulatory systems should accommodate new economic
                         development and should be reviewed periodically to facilitate the development
                         and the permitting process.
                    LU-o Continue efforts to streamline and simplify the design review process.

                    LU-q The Rural Residential A (RA) and B (RB) designations shall be primarily
                         applied to the rural fringes where limited services and facilities are available in
                         order to accommodate large lot residential development.
                    LU-r All residential designated lands in excess of 30 percent slope shall not be
                         developed. Development on slopes in excess of 20 percent may be
                         considered subject to additional design requirements as part of a land division
                         map or building permit submission. At a minimum the following shall be
                         provided: comprehensive grading, erosion and landscaping plans; a soils report
                         by a soils engineer with specific recommendations; and a visual impact

Draft Goals, Objectives, Policies & Implementation Measures
                    LU-t          Proposed land divisions that lie in two or more General Plan land use
                                  designations that allow residential development may be permitted to create
                                  smaller parcels (including clustering), than indicated by the density of any of
                                  the land use designations provided that:
                                            The maximum number of residential units does not exceed the
                                            combined total allowed by each designation, and
                                            If the area is designated as a resource area, the resource is protected.
                                            If developed to the maximum allowable combined density, further
                                            residential development for the property will be forfeited unless
                                            additional density is permitted by a general plan amendment.
                    LU-u          Where existing parcels of land contain two or more detached legally
                                  constructed or installed residences or mobilehomes, residential land divisions
                                  may be allowed to exceed the general plan land use density provided that:
                                       All such residences or mobilehomes were constructed or installed before
                                            January 10, 1984; and
                                       Each newly created parcel is occupied by at least one of these residences,
                                            and
                                       Each newly created parcel meets applicable City development standards in
                                            effect when the land division is approved.
                    LU-v          The City shall develop and utilize a fiscal impact analysis system for evaluation
                                  of public service costs for development projects. When this system is
                                  developed, projects that prove not to be cost effective for the provisions of
                                  services must provide offsets for those fiscal impacts.
                    LU-w          Develop Area Plans for the Pine Grove Interchange, Summit City, and
                                  North and South Shasta Dam Boulevard areas.
                    LU-x          Prior to any approval of any entitlements, Area Plans shall be developed for
                                  those vacant lands referenced as the Peri Property, Eastern Washington
                                  Property, and the vacant lands to the north and south of the Pine Grove
                                  Avenue Extension. Costs shall be borne by the property owner/developer.
                    Implementation Measures
                    LU-(1)        Establish zoning districts and development standards in the Zoning
                                  Ordinance consistent with the General Plan, and amend the Zoning Map to
                                  be consistent with the General Plan Map within six months. Two new
                                  commercial land use designations, Village Commercial - VC and Civic
                                  Center Commercial - CC have been developed to integrate the Central
                                  Business District Plan into the General Plan.
                    LU-(2)        As part of the Annual General Plan Report, monitor and report on;
                                  cumulative residential development since Plan adoption; the overall density
                                  of residential projects approved during the previous year; and the supply of
                                  vacant land by use.

General Plan
                    LU-(3) Ensure that the Zoning Ordinance provides for:
                                     Minimum and maximum densities consistent with the Plan's land
                                     use classifications. (In order to promote compact development,
                                     and ensure the availability of adequate sites in transit-accessible
                                     corridors for high-density housing and development of the
                                     proposed neighborhood centers, sites designated for Urban
                                     Residential High residential uses should be reserved for the
                                     intended use.);
                                     Developing standards that permit zero-lot line attached or
                                     detached single-family dwellings on sites designated for Urban
                                     Residential and Urban Residential High densities in the
                                     General Plan.
                                     Allowing existing commercial development within areas designated
                                     Urban Residential (UR) and Urban Residential High (URH)
                                     accessing streets identified in Table C-1 be legally conforming.
                                     However, the structures on the site should be on a residential scale,
                                     be in standard condition and painted and that the site is clean,
                                     landscaped and fenced, where necessary.
                    LU-(4) Distribute shopping centers so that new neighborhood centers are located
                           at least one mile away from existing major shopping centers.
                    LU-(5) For development along Cascade and Twin View Boulevards, adopt
                           appropriate standards to improve the character of these corridors, including
                           but not limited to site access, building and off-street parking orientation to
                           street, building height, on-site lighting, transitional requirements adjacent to
                           residential uses, and incentives to encourage office/residential mixed use.
                    LU-(6) Lands along Pine Grove Avenue between Salt Creek and Churn Creek and
                           along Shasta Gateway Drive at appropriate locations are to be designated
                           and zoned to permit research and development (R&D) and light
                           manufacturing/warehousing facilities.
                    LU-(7) Establish use regulations, development standards, and minimum
                           performance        requirements      for      R&D       facilities and       light
                           manufacturing/warehousing facilities in the Zoning Ordinance consistent
                           with the General Plan, and amend the Zoning Map to be consistent with
                           the General Plan Map.
                    LU-(8) In new and undeveloped industrial areas, require master plans and
                           infrastructure financing programs as a condition of subdivision approval, so
                           haphazard development, without a coordinated plan for land use,
                           incompatibility with adjacent residential areas, circulation, infrastructure,
                           and public services, does not occur.
                    LU-(9) Use the Redevelopment Agency to facilitate funding infrastructure
                           improvements needed for industrial areas to accommodate expansion of
                           existing industry or provide sites for new industry.

General Plan
                    LU-(10) Monitor changes in the number of jobs by sector, workforce characteristics,
                            and residents' commuting patterns, and work with local industry and
                            business leaders to target those with the greatest imbalance.
                    LU-(11) Prepare Area Plans for those areas identified in Policies LU-w and LU-x
                            that will specifically address the following in a narrative and diagram form:
                                 Master Development Plan
                                 The services and facilities necessary to serve the identified area based
                                      on ultimate development. Services and facilities include, but are
                                      not limited to roads, water, sewer, storm drainage, power, law
                                      enforcement, fire protection, schools, parks, and trail system.
                                 Construction, maintenance and operation costs.
                                 Financing mechanisms to provide the necessary services and facilities.
                                 Maintenance finance mechanisms.
                                 A fiscal impact analysis of public services and facilities over a 20 year
                                      time period.
                                 A schedule of the phasing of public improvements and anticipated
                                      development.
                                 Preliminary grading and tree removal and replacement.
                                 The design and character of development must be identified including,
                                      but not limited to parcel sizes, building types, general architecture,
                                      scale, landscaping, and amenities.
                                 Compatibility with adjacent land uses.
                    LU-(12) Currently there are a series of substandard size lots adjacent to each other
                            and often held under one ownership that are difficult to develop due to
                            their dimensions. Often, property owners do not willingly merge the
                            parcels because the resulting density would be less than the density available
                            due to the separate parcels. The City will identify the groups of parcels and
                            evaluate mechanisms to encourage the merger of the lots by, at minimum,
                            not reducing the density of the parcel(s) resulting from the merger, or by
                            initiating general plan amendments and/or rezonings to allow for higher
                            densities.
                    LU-(13) Application of the Design Review overlay district shall be limited to
                            properties that have unique natural and development attributes and/or that
                            have special circumstances that warrant discretionary review by the
                            Planning Commission.           Specific design objectives, guidelines, and
                            development standards shall be developed and adopted by the City.
                    LU-(14) The City shall strictly enforce the non-conforming use provisions of the
                            Zoning Code in instances when a preexisting non-conforming use is clearly in
                            conflict with other surrounding uses which fully conform with the existing
                            zoning.
                    LU-(15) Revise the R-4 Zone District through a textual amendment to remove the
                            minimum one (1) acre lot size requirement and to clarify that "a density
                            bonus of at least 25 percent will be allowed for fully subsidized units as
                            provided by State density bonus law provisions."
                    LU-(16) The area immediately east and north of the Pine Grove Avenue and
                            Interstate 5 interchange is currently designated as Urban Residential and
City of Shasta Lake                                34                                           June 15, 1999
General Plan
                                       Urban Residential High. The area is bounded by Pine Grove Avenue to the
                                       south, Leona Avenue to the east, the parcels along the northern side of
                                       Akrich Street to the north, and Interstate 5 to the west. At such time that
                                       either Pine Grove Avenue is extended easterly, or the interchange is
                                       modified, conversion of those lands to a Commercial classification should be
                                       evaluated.
                    PUBLIC SERVICES & FACILITIES
                    Key to development within the City of Shasta Lake is that growth be guided by the ability of
                    public services and facilities to accommodate it. This requires the assurance that new
                    development does not create demands that cannot be met without adversely impacting the
                    quality of services and facilities currently being provided to existing residents and businesses.
                    Recognizing the need to provide current and future public services and facilities in an orderly
                    manner to meet existing needs and accommodate growth, the following issues were identified
                    that needed to be addressed through Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures:
                         Extension of sewer and improved water services to the Summit City Area
                         Development of a City-wide drainage plan
                         Improvement of the water distribution system
                         Maintenance of the water system
                         Recognition that the existing water supply is limited and should be increased
                         Establishment of "Level of Service" thresholds for services and facilities
                               Recognizing a need for higher education facilities
                               Recognizing that there is a potential need for more schools
                    The Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures advanced in this public service and
                    facilities component of the General Plan specifically addresses the key issues of concern.
                    Objectives
                    PF-1               Provide for a full range of public services and public facilities throughout
                                       the City.
                    PF-2               Develop a Citywide mechanism for managing the water resources available to
                                       the City. Adequate supplies and quality of water should be available to serve
                                       development projected for the planning period and evaluate additional water
                                       supply resources.
                    .
                    PF-3               Improve and maintain the Citywide water system facilities.
                    PF-4               Improve and maintain the Citywide wastewater system facilities.
                    PF-5               Encourage water conservation in all new development through the use of
                                       measures which result in the more efficient use of water.
                    PF-6               Encourage the use and expansion of recycled wastewater for irrigation
                                       purposes.
                    PF-7               Develop a comprehensive long-term plan for wastewater treatment within the
                                       City.

General Plan
                    PF-8          Extend community wastewater treatment services to the Summit City area.
                    PF-9          The City shall implement the solid waste program in accordance with the

                    PF-10         Develop a land use pattern that can be adequately served with community
                                  facilities such as schools, libraries, and community recreation facilities.
                    PF-11         Encourage specialized educational facilities that expand and provide
                                  additional training opportunities.
                    Policies
                    PF-a          Establish levels of service thresholds for public services and facilities.
                    PF-b          Participate in the development of a region-wide groundwater resource
                                  management plan.
                    PF-c          Evaluate the water infrastructure system and develop a plan to improve the
                                  system, where applicable.
                    PF-d          The City shall take actions required to implement the Solid Waste Management
                                  Plan and Source Reduction and Recycling Element.
                    PF-e          The City will cooperate and coordinate its planning with the Gateway Unified
                                  School District and develop plans that respond to the growth of the City.
                    PF-f          Public uses (e.g. schools, parks, waste disposal sites) and public utilities (e.g.
                                  substation, transmission lines) whose site specific locations often cannot be
                                  identified in advance by the General Plan may be permitted throughout the
                                  City to serve the public need. Appropriate zoning on site specific locations
                                  will be determined in response to the identified need as it occurs. Solid waste
                                  disposal facilities shall be conditionally permitted to ensure that the site is
                                  compatible with adjacent land uses. Surrounding land uses, to the extent
                                  feasible, shall be regulated to avoid incompatibility with the solid waste
                                  disposal facility.
                    Implementation Measures
                    PF-(1)        If cost effective, require annexation to the City as a condition of extending
                                  City services.
                    PF-(2)        Explore the feasibility of a drainage fee to fund storm water drainage and
                                  ongoing maintenance. Require all new development to pay this fee as a
                                  condition of project approval.
                    PF-(3)        As part of the project review and building permit process, ensure that all
                                  new development has a minimal impact on natural drainage channels and
                                  flow capacity.
                    PF-(4)        Explore the feasibility of using reclaimed water for landscaping of
                                  residential landscaping in new subdivisions, major commercial and
                                  industrial projects, and landscaping at public facilities, including schools,
                                  government facilities, parks and golf courses.

General Plan
                    PF-(5)            Establish guidelines and standards for water conservation and actively
                                      promote use of water-conserving devices and practices in both new
                                      construction and major alterations and additions to existing buildings.
                    PF-(6)            Undertake maintenance efforts, in cooperation with Shasta County, City of
                                      Redding, and Caltrans to ensure that surface drainage channels are not
                                      obstructed.
                    PF-(7)            Evaluate, and if feasible, implement a requirement that new development
                                      pay its fair share of costs associated with the provision and maintenance of
                                      streets, parks, water supply and treatment, wastewater treatment and
                                      disposal, drainage, and facilities for police and fire protection.
                    PF-(8)            Evaluate and adopt an "adequate public facilities and services" ordinance,
                                      or other regulatory mechanism, establishing a procedure for reviewing
                                      major development applications and requiring a determination as a
                                      condition of approval that:
                                           Adequate public facilities and services would be available at the time of
                                                project occupancy and performance standards maintained
                                                following project occupancy; or
                                           Funds for required improvements are assured and that improvements
                                                would be completed within a stipulated time of project occupancy.
                    PF-(9)            Use the Redevelopment Agency to facilitate funding needed for
                                      infrastructure improvements throughout the City in designated
                                      redevelopment areas of the City.
          CIRCULATION
          In addition to the provision of public services and facilities, an efficient and maintained road circulation
          system is key to the orderly development of the City. A balanced transportation system must not only
          serve the needs of vehicular traffic but must also serve the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians, in
          particular school children. As the City grows, connections between neighborhoods, commercial and
          industrial areas need to serve the transportation needs of residents and businesses.
                There is a need for curb, gutter and sidewalks in the older areas of the City
                Insure the safety of foot traffic to and from schools
                Evaluate the establishment and expansion of scenic routes
                    Establish an alignment for Wonderland Blvd
          Recognizing the need to provide transportation services and to construct and maintain a road circulation
          system to meet existing needs and accommodate growth in an orderly manner, the following issues were
          identified that needed to be addressed through Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures:
                    Objectives
                    C-1               Provide for safe and efficient vehicular movement.

General Plan
                    C-2      Promote alternative travel modes, including transit, pedestrian and bicycle
                             circulation systems and Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
                             programs.
                    C-3      Coordinate policies for land development and circulation.
                    C-4      Coordinate local transportation planning and administration with the
                             activities of other government agencies and concerns of local citizens and
                             businesses.
                    C-5      Design and implement the circulation system to protect natural features,
                             conserve energy, and mitigate, to the degree feasible, air and noise
                             pollution.
                    C-6      Designate local scenic routes and enhance and protect their scenic qualities.
                    Policies
                    C-a      Monitor, maintain and improve, as necessary, the operation, safety and
                             performance of the street system, including roadway surfaces, capacity, and traffic
                             signals. For capacity and operational purposes, strive to attain a Level of Service
                             (LOS) “C,” to the maximum degree feasible, so that potential traffic congestion
                             on streets and at intersections is minimized.
                    C-b      Improve unpaved roads, driveways and parking areas.
                    C-c      Provide for adequate, safe, and direct, and if necessary, alternative access to
                             public facilities, schools, parks and shopping areas.
                    C-e      Encourage the continued development and expansion of local and regional
                             public transit systems.
                    C-f      Encourage bicycle and pedestrian transportation, both on-and off-street.
                    C-g      Construct, improve and maintain the system of curb, gutters, sidewalks and
                             crosswalks for pedestrian circulation safety and drainage control.
                    C-h      Promote the use of TDM programs and strategies to reduce overall vehicle
                             travel, particularly during peak commute periods.
                    C-i      Coordinate transportation planning and implementation with regional and
                             local plans.
                    C-j      Protect natural features, to the degree feasible, when maintaining and
                             expanding the City’s circulation system.
                    C-k      Establish Route 151 between North Boulevard and Shasta Dam, Shasta
                             Park to Digger Bay, and the existing and future road segment of
                             Wonderland Boulevard (changed to Cascade Boulevard) between Shasta
                             Dam Boulevard and the Mountain Gate Interchange with Interstate 5 as
                             scenic routes.
City of Shasta Lake                                38                                           June 15, 1999
General Plan

                    C-l           Evaluate the acquisition, development and maintenance responsibilities
                                  associated with the relinquishment of Route 151 to the City by Caltrans.
                    Implementation Measures
                    C-(1)         Establish a data collection program for the street system to include a
                                  physical inventory, condition of surfacing, maintenance needs, traffic
                                  volumes and accident reports. Update the program at least yearly.
                    C-(2)         Develop a priority system for physical improvements based on
                                  demonstrated needs according to the collection of data on physical
                                  conditions, traffic volumes and safety reports.
                    C-(3)         Develop a priority system of road improvement projects financed in part by
                                  redevelopment fund.
                    C-(4)         Respond quickly to correct traffic signal breakdowns, sign damages and
                                  losses.
                    C-(5)         Review high frequency accident locations and develop specific mitigation
                                  measures or improvements.
                    C-(6)         Complete a “Safe Route to School” study to determine requirements for
                                  new walkways, school crossings, traffic control and roadway improvements.
                    C-(7)         Develop and adopt street standards that provide flexibility in design,
                                  especially in residential neighborhoods. Revise right-of-way and pavement
                                  standards to reflect adjacent land use and/or anticipated traffic, and permit
                                  reduced right-of-way dimensions where necessary to maintain
                                  neighborhood character. Standards should consider median construction,
                                  or intersection lane widening which may require additional width and right
                                  of way. Alternative standards should be provided for new and existing
                                  alignments, since having just one set of standard may conflict with existing
                                  facilities, which for various reasons are inconsistent in right-of-way or other
                                  constraints. Interpretations and/or recommendations regarding minimum
                                  street widths is the responsibility of the City Engineer with input from the
                                  planning process.
                    C-(8)         Continue to require that new development pays a fair share of the costs of
                                  street and other traffic and transportation improvements based on traffic
                                  generated and impacts on service levels.
                    C-(9)         Update the Traffic Impact Fee Study within six months after adoption of the
                                  General Plan. The fees should be reviewed or updated at least every two
                                  years.
                    C-(10)        The City has been divided into four geographic areas that function relatively
                                  independently of each other for circulation purposes and are therefore
                                  named "Circulation Areas." For each Circulation Area (identified in the
                                  Planning and Circulation Areas Map), develop the necessary fee
                                  structure, or other financing mechanisms, for the construction of the traffic
                                  signals, existing and future "Minor Arterial" and "Collector" streets, and,
City of Shasta Lake                                     39                                            June 15, 1999
General Plan

                           where applicable, the trail system identified in the Land Use &
                           Circulation Map.
                    C-(11) Development of vacant parcels will require the construction, or a deferral
                           agreement for the construction of curb, gutter, sidewalk and the necessary
                           tie-in paving along the street frontage of the affected parcel(s), whichever
                           combination of improvements are applicable, as a requirement of the
                           entitlement or building permit approval. A deferral of curb, gutter and
                           sidewalks can be considered for existing vacant parcels where drainage
                           requirements have not been established. New development that requires
                           road extension beyond parcel frontage will be required to construct and/or
                           pave, at minimum, the road surface and insure proper drainage.
                           Development of vacant parcels will require the developer or property
                           owner to pay a fee that will be used toward the improvement of the "Minor
                           Arterial" and "Collector" streets identified in Circulation Table C-1 that
                           are located within the geographic area (identified in the Planning and
                           Circulation Areas Map) the parcels are located within.
                           Circulation Table C-1 and the Land Use & Circulation Map identify
                           the existing and future "Minor Arterial" and "Collector" Street system in the
                           City of Shasta Lake. The system not only reflects a priority for moving
                           vehicles throughout the City in a safe and expeditious manner, but also
                           prioritizes the movement of pedestrians, in particular children to and from
                           schools, parks and commercial uses. As part of the Capital Improvement Plan
                           programming process, the City will prioritize the "Collector" streets to be
                           improved from the fees collected within each geographic zone.
                           For those City streets not identified in Circulation Table C-1, an
                           evaluation should be undertaken to prioritize the streets where curb, gutter,
                           sidewalk and tie-in paving improvements (whichever combination of
                           improvements are applicable) are necessary. For those streets where

General Plan

          The City of Shasta Lake Housing Element of the General Plan adopted on June 16, 1998 was not revised as
          part of this General Plan update and is incorporated herein by reference. The June 16, 1998 Housing
          Element provides the mandatory Housing Needs Assessment; Governmental Constraints to Maintenance,
          Improvement, and Development of Housing; Nongovernmental Constraints to Maintenance, Improvement, and
          Development of Housing; Energy Conservation and Opportunities; Goals and Policies; and the Five Year Action
          Program.
          As a point of clarification the June 16, 1998 Housing Element Goals are identified as Objectives in this
          General Plan Revision. In addition, the Five Year Action Program identifies Implementation Programs and
          Quantified Objectives. In this document, the Implementation Programs and the Quantified Objectives have been
          summarized as Implementation Measures. Some minor changes have been made to Objectives, Policies and
          Implementation Measures in this General Plan Revision and are identified by an asterisk.
          Whereas, the General Plan Task Force recognized that the Housing Element had been recently adopted in
          June of 1998, the Task Force reaffirmed the need for additional multi-family classified lands, the need
          for more low income housing, and the necessity to improve housing condition through
          rehabilitation. In addition, the Task Force identified that as part of the effort to improve housing
          conditions, the abatement of substandard housing and the enforcement of the housing code were
          necessary to improve the quality of life for residents of the City.
          The Planning Commission also determined that the Urban Residential High land use classification with
          densities of up to 30 dwelling units per acre was not realistic or financially feasible. Therefore, a density
          range of 10 to 20 dwelling units per acre for the Urban Residential High classification was adopted. This is
          consistent with land use classifications currently being advanced by the City of Redding General Plan
          revision effort. Land costs in the Shasta County region compared to those of metropolitan areas like
          Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area are significantly lower. In those areas, higher densities are
          necessary in order to justify land and construction costs associated with development, such is not the
          case in the City of Shasta Lake, or the region.
                    Objectives
                    H-1                Improve and conserve the existing housing stock.

                    H-7                Encourage energy conservation.
                    Policies

                    H-b                Continue to apply for Federal and State funding to rehabilitate substandard
                                       housing.
                    H-c*               Pursue the abatement of unsafe structures.

                         affordable units.
                    H-k  Continue to monitor all regulations, ordinances, departmental processing
                         procedures and fees related to the rehabilitation and/or construction of
                         dwelling units to assess their impact on housing affordability.
                    H-l  Maintain an adequate supply of residentially classified land to meet all
                         residential housing needs based on projected growth rates and as a

                           financing.
                    H-(4)* The City shall continue their abatement program which provides for the
                           abatement of hazardous properties/structures at the owner’s expense.
                           Owners are instructed to fix hazardous conditions. Ultimate action by the
                           City due to noncompliance by the owner is to remove the offending
                           structure or condition from the property.
                    H-(5)  The State of California Government Code Section 65915 allows for a developer
                           to obtain a “density increase of at least 25 percent over the otherwise
                           maximum allowable residential density under the applicable Zoning
                           Ordinance and Land Use Element of the General Plan as of the date of
                           application by the developer.” In addition, the Code identifies that a city
                           shall provide the developer incentives, if needed, to enhance affordability of
                           the project or provision by the City of other incentives of equivalent
                           financial value. The City will develop and adopt an ordinance that specifies
                           the method of providing developer incentives.
                    H-(6)  The City shall continue to support the HUD Section 8 Rental Assistance
                           Program which provides rental assistance to very-low income
                           seniors/disabled individuals and families.
                    H-(7)  The City will evaluate the establishment of a rental assistance program
                           similar to the HUD Section 8 program.
                    H-(8)  The City will continue to support the development of new affordable
                           multifamily projects by both for-profit and non-profit developers. The City
                           can provide direct financial support to these projects through application to
                           the State for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME funds.
                           The City will also participate with developers of affordable housing in the
                           issuance of mortgage revenue bonds.
                    H-(9)  Federal and State tax credits for eligible low-income rental housing projects
                           are currently available by application to the State Tax Credit Allocation
                           Committee. The City will act as an information and referral service to
                           interested developers regarding available tax subsidies.
                    H-(10) State law requires redevelopment agencies to provide 20% of their tax
                           increment income to improve housing opportunities for low- to moderate-
                           income persons. A total of $833,151 is projected to be available during the
                           five-year housing planning period. The City has designated the expenditure of
                           funds for low and moderate-income housing. Land acquisition, infrastructure
                           improvements, housing construction subsidies and rent payment supplements
                           are amongst the activities envisioned for set-aside funds.
                    H-(11) The City shall continue to seek funding from the HOME Investment
                           Partnership Act program which provides funding to provide incentives to
                           develop and support affordable rental housing and homeownership
                           opportunities.     Eligible activities include real property acquisition,
                           rehabilitation, down payment assistance and construction of affordable
                           housing.

General Plan

                    H-(12) The City will support obtaining funds from the HOPE grant program
                           which is designed to increase homeownership for lower-income households
                           through resident purchase of public housing, purchase of vacant or
                           foreclosed properties held by the government, and purchase of distressed
                           properties held by FHA.
                    H-(13) As part of the General Plan update, an inventory of existing land for
                           residential development will be compiled and updated as needed on a
                           regular basis and as part of the General Plan review process, every five
                           years.
                    H-(14) The City will study current land use patterns within the urban core to
                           identify areas which have the potential for intensification of use due to
                           current under-utilization or changing market conditions, rendering an area
                           economically obsolete.
                    H-(15) Revise the R-4 Zone District to remove the minimum one (1) acre lot size
                           requirement and to clarify that "a density bonus of at least 25 percent will
                           be allowed for fully subsidized units as provided by State density bonus law
                           provisions."
                    H-(16) Mortgage revenue bonds can be issued by the City or the Shasta County
                           Housing Authority to support the development of multi-family or single-
                           family housing for low-and moderate-income households. Bonds can be
                           used for the purchase, rehabilitation, and construction of housing, as well as
                           capital improvements related to housing. Federal and State law requires
                           that a percentage of the total units in an assisted project be reserved for
                           lower income households. Issuance of bonds is conditioned upon the
                           affordability of project units for lower-income households. The City shall
                           evaluate the potential use of this funding source.
                    H-(17) The City shall support the Downpayment Assistance Program (DAP) which
                           offers assistance with the downpayment required when purchasing a home.
                           Eligible participants must be first-time homebuyers, buying a home in the
                           City, and be moderate-income or less. Assistance is in the form of a second
                           mortgage recorded as a lien on the newly purchased property.
                    H-(18) The City shall continue support of the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
                           offers IRS tax credits for low-to-moderate level income first-time
                           homebuyers. It enables the potential homebuyer to qualify more easily for
                           the primary financing on the purchase as well as to realize substantial tax
                           savings. This program, administered by the Shasta County Housing
                           Authority has issued 25 Mortgage Credit Certificates for home purchases in
                           the City since inception in 1990.
                    H-(19) The City shall support the Fair Housing Referral and Information Program that
                           provides basic information regarding fair housing rights to both landlords
                           and tenants. Housing discrimination complaints are referred to the State
                           Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Special outreach efforts are
                           made to include groups likely to experience discrimination in housing
                           including minority, elderly, handicapped, and lower-income families. These
                           efforts include, but are not limited to; providing brochures to be available
                           and on display at City Hall, the Community Center, and local business
                           bulletin boards; providing staff speakers at service agency meetings; and,

General Plan
                           periodic informational mailings to service organizations. In addition, all
                           tenants and landlords participating in the HUD Section 8 Programs are
                           counseled as to fair housing rights and responsibilities.
                    H-(20) The City shall require compliance with the Uniform Building Code, Title 24
                           Handicapped Adaptability/Accessibility Regulations Compliance and the Disabled
                           Americans Act.          In general, compliance requires handicapped
                           adaptability/accessibility features on new multifamily residential projects
                           containing 5 or more units per building. The City is responsible for
                           reviewing proposed projects prior to construction for compliance.
                           Furthermore, Title 24 compliance is monitored during the construction
                           process.
                    H-(21) Planning Division staff will review and revise the language of the City's
                           Zoning Ordinance to specify both transitional housing and homeless
                           shelters as uses in specific zoning categories.
                    H-(22) Proposed projects are to be reviewed by the City prior to construction for
                           compliance with Uniform Building Code, Title 24 Energy Conservation Compliance.
                           The City, during the construction process, also monitors compliance with
                           Title 24 regulations. The program advances local code enforcement of
                           required energy conservation features and appliance guidelines for
                           construction of residential structures.
                    H-(23) The City shall support the assortment of programs designed to lessen the
                           consumption of electricity by both homeowners and businesses. At this
                           stage, the programs are completely voluntary, however, as energy resources
                           decrease by increasing public demand due to population growth and
                           irresponsible usage, it is likely that energy providers will begin to utilize
                           punitive measures such as imposing higher costs on excessive users to
                           encourage participation.
                    H-(24) The City shall evaluate entering into an agreement with the Self Help Home
                           Improvement Program (SHHIP), or any other experienced agency, to
                           administer a weatherization improvement program.                Weatherization
                           improvements could be provided to eligible homeowners and landlords as
                           part of a City Homeowner and Rental Rehabilitation Program. Eligible
                           repairs could include weather-stripping, insulation, installation of storm
                           doors, installation of dual-pane windows, and caulking. These types of
                           repairs should be encouraged and in some cases required by all City housing
                           programs.

          household size.
                        Very Low Income = 0-50% of the regional median income.
                        Low Income = 51-80% of the regional median income.
                        Moderate Income = 80-120% of the regional median income.
                        Upper Income = over 120% of the regional median income.

          released in an earthquake.
          Local Street - A street providing direct access to properties and designed to discourage through-
          traffic.
          Median Income - The income category for each household size which is defined annually by the

          Noise - Any unwanted or undesirable sound.
          Noise Exposure Contours - Lines drawn about a noise source indicating constant energy levels of
