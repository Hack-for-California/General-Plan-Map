Introduction and Overview
REGIONAL LOCATION
Nestled in the midst of Silicon Valley, Campbell has retained the charm of yesteryear
while embracing the future. Unique historic buildings rest comfortably alongside
efficient high-tech structures, successfully blending tradition with progress. Residents
enjoy beautiful natural surroundings, well maintained parks and trails and proximity to
work environments – all within the atmosphere of a small, friendly town.
For those who choose to
live or work in Campbell,
the advantages abound.
Chief among them is its
central location.      With
easy access to most of the
valley’s major freeways,
this charming city offers
the best of all worlds to its
residential and business
communities.
As shown in Figure I-1,
the City of Campbell is
located approximately 50
miles south of San
Francisco in Santa Clara
County, one of the nine
Counties that make up the
region known as the San
Francisco Bay Area. The
City occupies over six
square miles of relatively Figure I-1: Regional Location Map
flat land that slopes
gently toward the south end of the San Francisco Bay. Campbell is bounded on the north,
east and west by the City of San Jose and on the south by the Town of Los Gatos. A
small portion of Campbell’s southwestern boundary is adjacent to the City of Saratoga.
The residents of Campbell have views of the Sierra Azules to the east and Santa Cruz
Mountains to the southwest.
CAMPBELL: A CAPSULE HISTORY
The City of Campbell takes its name from Benjamin Campbell, an early landowner,
rancher and farmer of the area. From 1885 to 1888, Benjamin Campbell served as the
first Postmaster from his home, which was located on Campbell Avenue between what is
today First and Second Streets. On his land was the “flag stop” on the railroad from
Santa Clara to Santa Cruz. In 1886, several buildings were constructed on the Campbell
property including a train depot known as “Campbell Station” and a town hall for social
gatherings. In 1888, the first residential lot in the first subdivision of Campbell’s
                                            I-1

Campbell General Plan
property was sold. Campbell had a fire department and newspaper by 1895, grammar
school by 1888, and a high school by 1900.
Campbell’s ideal location in the Santa Clara Valley, dubbed the “Valley of Heart’s
Delight” because of its rich agricultural soils, made it a home to many of the world’s
largest fruit drying grounds and some of the finest canneries. Campbell became known
as the “Orchard City” in the very beginning of its history as most of the land within the
area was devoted to agricultural use, primarily orchards. In 1887, the first use of the land
for industrial purposes was the development of one of the largest drying grounds in the
world. The drying grounds had been built adjacent to the tracks south of the depot. The
dried crops included prunes, apricots, plums and apples.
John Colpitts Ainsley founded the J.C. Ainsley Packing Company in Campbell, which
was one of the finest canneries in California. The packing company was a vital part of
the Campbell community, which operated from 1893 until 1933 when Mr. Ainsley sold
the cannery to the Drew Canning Company. Other big company names in Campbell’s
fruit canning and drying business include the George A. Fleming Company, Frank
Buxton’s Fruit Drying Works, George E. Hyde and Company, The Orchard City Canning
Company, Campbell Horticultural Association, Campbell Fruit Growers’ Union,
Campbell Farmers Union Packing Company and the California Prune and Apricot
Growers Association that marketed fruit under the famous brand name of Sunsweet. 1
By the time the city was incorporated, on March 28, 1952, there was a well-established
downtown center and many of the orchards, which gave Campbell its “Orchard City”
nickname, were being replaced by housing, commerce and industry. Today, agriculture
is practically non-existent as an industry in Campbell. Campbell prides itself for being a
well-balanced community in the center of booming “Silicon Valley.” It has a variety of
housing options and has many technology firms and professional offices, providing
Campbell with a balance of housing and jobs.
Campbell is a General Law City with a five-member Council including a rotating
Mayor’s position.
THE CITY OF CAMPBELL’S VISION
The development of the City of Campbell’s Community Vision Statement was an
important outcome from the City’s Strategic Planning process and the Community
Satisfaction Survey. A vision articulates a destination toward which the City should aim
and a future that, in important ways, is more desirable than the present. The Vision
Statement has been paramount in the development of Campbell’s General Plan Goals,
Objectives and Strategies.

                                                In 1993 and 1994, the City of Campbell

                                                process that examined the state of the
                                                community in terms of seven strategic
                                                planning elements: Land Use, Financial

                                                was conducted as a means to give decision
     effective basic municipal                  makers an indication of residents’ thoughts,
   services and foster regional                 issues and concerns regarding the City of
                                                Campbell. Researchers found that 90% of
       cooperation and local                    respondents were satisfied with the job the
             partnerships.                      City of Campbell was doing to provide
                                                City services. Police, fire and emergency
                                                medical services were ranked highest in

services included in the survey. Almost two-thirds of respondents noted “small
community,” “good location,” or “quiet” when identifying the best thing about living in
Campbell. “Traffic” was the most frequent response to the question regarding the worst
thing about living in Campbell, being cited by 18% of respondents. Notably, 26% of
respondents did not find a “worst thing” about living in Campbell.
A second Community Satisfaction Survey was conducted in the Fall of 1999. The results
of the survey did not vary significantly from the earlier one.

Campbell General Plan
GENERAL PLAN PURPOSE
The purpose of a city’s General Plan is to guide decisions regarding physical growth and
development, provision of public services and facilities, and conservation and
enhancement of natural resources. Therefore, Campbell’s General Plan:
        • Outlines a vision of long-range physical and economic development and
            resource conservation that reflects the aspirations of the community;
        • Provides strategies that will allow this vision to be accomplished;
        • Establishes a foundation upon which the City Council and Commissions can
            base policy decisions and a basis for judging whether specific development
            proposals and public projects are in harmony with community desires;
        • Allows City departments, other public agencies, and private developers to
            design projects that will enhance the character of the community, preserve and
            enhance critical environmental resources, and minimize hazards;
        • Provides the basis for establishing and setting priorities for detailed plans and
            implementing programs, such as the Zoning Ordinance, specific plans, and the
            Capital Improvement Program; and
        • Addresses the issue of land availability to meet the City’s economic
            development objectives, the need for housing in the community, and State law
            requirements for Campbell to accept its “fair share” of the regional housing
            needs.
Campbell General Plan: Visionary and Realistic
The General Plan sets a vision for the city, but it is not merely a compendium of ideas
and wish lists. Broad objectives such as “quality of life” and “community character” are
meaningful only when translated into tangible, feasible actions. Thus, while each
element of the General Plan articulates long-term goals, it also includes action-oriented
policies that outline concrete and achievable steps to attain these goals. The General Plan
is comprehensive and long-range in scope. It will be used on an on-going basis, because
many City regulations, requirements, and actions are required by State law to be
consistent with the General Plan. Since the Plan is general, there will be circumstances
and instances when detailed studies are necessary before policies can be implemented.
NEED FOR GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
General plans typically look out 20 years in the future and are revised every five to ten
years. Most of the City’s General Plan Elements were adopted ten years ago or more.
Campbell’s first General Plan was adopted in 1960 and revised in 1968. Revised Land
Use and Circulation Elements were adopted in 1983 and were amended in 1990, 1991
and 1993. Conservation and Scenic Highways Elements were adopted in 1972. In 1975,
the Seismic, Safety and Noise Elements were adopted. The Air Quality Element was
adopted in 1987, the Open Space Element was adopted in 1990 and the latest Housing
Element was adopted in 1992. Although the community vision and goals for Campbell
haven’t changed significantly since the adoption of the first General Plan, some fine-
tuning must be made to reflect current population, community conditions and State
requirements.
                                             I-4

                                                                Introduction and Overview
AMENDMENTS TO THE GENERAL PLAN
As the City’s guide for development, the General Plan is the heart of the planning
process. It is intended to be a living document and, as such, will be subject to more site-
specific and comprehensive amendments over time. Amendments also may be needed
from time to time to conform to State or Federal law passed after adoption, and to
eliminate or modify policies that may become obsolete or unrealistic due to changed
conditions (such as completion of a task or project, development of a site, or adoption of
an ordinance or plan). State law limits the number of times a jurisdiction can amend its
general plan. Generally, no jurisdiction can amend any mandatory element of its general
plan more than four times in one year, although each amendment may include more than
one change to the general plan. This restriction, however, does not apply to amendments
to:
        • Optional elements
        • Allow development of affordable housing; or
        • Comply with a court decision
Periodic Review
The City will undertake a periodic review of the General Plan, to determine how well the
General Plan has performed, that is, whether policies related to development and
conservation have been effective. This review will include:
        • Analysis of the effectiveness of implementation strategies initiated to carry
            out the General Plan; and
        • Review of growth trends since General Plan adoption
As part of the review, a target date for a comprehensive update of the General Plan will
be established. A report summarizing City staff’s findings and recommendations will be
circulated for public comment and then presented to the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission will review the report and make a recommendation to the City
Council. The Planning commission and the City Council also will hear comments on the
report at duly noticed public hearings.
GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
State law requires each California City and county to prepare a general plan. A general
plan is defined as a “comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development
of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries, which in the planning agency’s
judgment, bears relation to its planning.” State requirements call for general plans that
“comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the
adopting agency.”
While they allow considerable flexibility, State planning laws do establish some
requirements for the issues that general plans must address. The California Government
code establishes both the content of general plans and rules for their adoption and
subsequent amendment. Together, State law and judicial decisions establish three overall
guidelines for general plans.
        • The general plan must be comprehensive. This requirement has two aspects.
            First, the general plan must be geographically comprehensive. That is, it must
            apply throughout the entire incorporated area and it should include other areas
                                             I-5

Campbell General Plan
           that the City determines are relevant to its planning. Second, the general plan
           must address the full range of issues that affects the city’s physical
           development.
       • The general plan must be internally consistent. This requirement means that
           the general plan must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them to each
           other without conflict. “Horizontal” consistency applies as much to figures
           and diagrams as to the general plan text. It also applies to data and analysis as
           well as policies. All adopted portions of the general plan, whether required by
           State law or not, have equal legal weight. None may supersede another, so the
           general plan must resolve conflicts among the provisions of each element.
       • The general plan must be long-range. Because anticipated development will
           affect the city and the people who live or work there for years to come, State
           law requires every general plan to take a long-term perspective.
Correspondence to Required Elements
The General Plan includes the seven elements required by State law – Land Use,
Circulation, Open Space, Conservation, Safety, Noise, and Housing. The required Land
Use and Circulation Elements have been combined into the Land Use and Transportation
Element and the Noise Element has been integrated into the Conservation and Natural
Resources Element. Table I-1 shows how the Campbell General Plan elements
correspond to State required elements.

DOCUMENTS THAT IMPLEMENT THE GENERAL PLAN
There are many documents that support and implement the goals and policies of the
General Plan. Ordinances and documents the City must update or prepare upon adoption
of the General Plan include:
Zoning Code
Land uses indicated on the General Plan Land Use Map are implemented by regulations
found in the Zoning chapter of the Municipal Code (Title 21). To clarify the relationship
between these two documents, the term General Plan is used for the policy document
that is basically conceptual, providing the broad framework for land uses within the City.
The term Zoning Code refers to organized and codified legal regulations that are very
specific and detailed. Zoning provides a legal mechanism for local government
regulation of the land uses described in the General Plan Land Use Map.
In addition to providing specific regulations related to minimum lot size, building
heights, setbacks, lot coverage, etc., for each zoning district, the Zoning Code also lists
the uses that would be acceptable or could be considered in each district, as well as those
that would be considered unacceptable. For some uses, further regulations are
established. For example, floor area ratios (FARs) have been established in the C-3 Zone
and residential zones in the San Tomas Area to respond to specific concerns about land
use intensity in these districts. Zoning regulations designate the process to be used when
a permit must be applied for in order to consider approval of a particular land use in a
district. A table illustrating the relationship of the Campbell General Plan land use
categories with zoning categories is located in Appendix B.
Special Area and Redevelopment Plans
The City approved several major land use plans, which include the North of Campbell
Avenue (NOCA) Plan, The South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA) Plan, the Downtown
Neighborhoods Plan and the San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan (STANP). The City
has established a redevelopment project area for the downtown area with an extended
area to the southeast. In redevelopment areas, the property tax increment from new
development is reinvested into the redevelopment area, whether through public
improvements, economic development strategies, or other measures. All of these plans
oversee the redevelopment, or more extensive development, of their respective planning
areas. These plans act as powerful tools for implementing the goals and policies of the
General Plan through the regulation of density, height and other design standards. Each
of the plans listed above can be found in Appendix A.
Subdivision Code
A subdivision is any division of land for the purpose of sale, lease or finance. The State
of California Subdivision Map Act (Government Code § 66410) regulates subdivisions
throughout the state. The goals of the Subdivision Map Act are as follows:
    •    To encourage orderly community development by providing for the regulation
         and control of the design and improvement of a subdivision with proper
         consideration of its relationship to adjoining areas.
                                               I-7

Campbell General Plan
    •   To ensure that areas within the subdivision that are dedicated for public purposes
        will be properly improved by the subdivider so that they will not become an
        undue burden on the community.
    •   To protect the public and individual transferees from fraud and exploitation.
The Map Act allows cities some flexibility in the processing of subdivisions. Campbell
controls this process through the subdivision regulations in the Municipal Code (Title
20). These regulations ensure that minimum requirements are adopted for the protection
of the public health, safety and welfare; and that the subdivision includes adequate
community improvements, municipal services and other public facilities. Campbell’s
subdivision provisions support the Subdivision Map Act and, in so doing, also support
implementation of the City’s General Plan.
Capital Budget and Capital Improvement Plan
Within Campbell, the General Plan serves as the foundation of the entire City’s planning
and budgetary actions and it forms the basis of the Capital Budget. The City’s Capital
Improvement Plan (CIP) is both a short and long-range plan for acquisition, improvement
and/or renovation of City assets. The first year of the CIP is adopted with the Operating
Budget and appropriations are approved only for the first year. The remaining six years
of the seven-year CIP function as a project planning and budgeting tool. The CIP is not a
static document and while the “out years” are important for planning purposes, the CIP is
reviewed and updated each year. City goals and priorities evolve, or are fine tuned, and
financing assumptions change over time. These changes result in modifications to the
City’s CIP, such as adjustments to the timing of particular projects or removal from the
CIP, if a funding source cannot reasonably be identified or if City priorities have
changed.
Conditional Approval for Development
The City’s development requirements for some developments are approved subject to
“conditions of approval.” Such conditions apply to projects whether or not they require
environmental review per the California Environmental Quality Act. Typical conditions
of approval for a development application may include the installation of street
improvements and trees. The requirements must be in direct proportion to the type and
amount of development.
Streetscape Standards
Campbell’s community image is created in large part by the major image streets that pass
through the city. The streets, including Hamilton Avenue, Bascom Avenue, Winchester
Boulevard, and the commercial portion of West Campbell Avenue near the San Tomas
Expressway interchange, are wide commercial avenues with varying streetscape
treatments and building setbacks. These streets give Campbell much of its character, and
some of its strongest elements of community form, and delineate many of its districts.
The Streetscape Standards were developed in 1993 to ensure consistency in the
streetscape treatment on these major streets. The “streetscape” refers to the land directly
adjacent to the street in both private and public ownership. The Standards establish the
required design and materials for sidewalks, trees and landscaping.

                                                              Introduction and Overview
Design Guidelines
The City of Campbell has Design Guidelines for Single Family Homes, for Low-Medium
Density Residential Projects and for new development in the San Tomas Area. The City
developed these documents to improve the overall image and aesthetic quality of
Campbell. Used in conjunction with the Zoning Code, the Design Guidelines help guide
and inform the public about the desired site and building design in Campbell. Drawn
from the goals and policies of the General Plan, the Design Guidelines serve as effective
tools to direct site and building design issues.
Regional Transportation Plans
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is the designated Congestion
Management Agency (CMA) in Santa Clara County. The VTA produces two planning
documents that affect the implementation of Campbell’s General Plan. The Congestion
Management Program (CMP) is a biennial document that sets performance standards for
regional roadway, transit and other transportation modes. The CMP also contains
requirements for promoting alternative transportation uses consistent with air pollution
control measures. In addition to the CMP, the VTA has a long-term planning document,
which is updated about every three to four years: the VTP2020 Plan is the VTA’s most
recent version of this planning document. The CMP and VTP2020 Plans serve as tools
for maintaining service levels and initiating capital improvements for major roadways
and transit, supporting the City’s General Plan goals.
Countywide Deficiency Plan
Local agencies are not able to affect large-scale improvements on freeways, expressways
and state roadways that are not owned or controlled by them. This situation led to State
legislation that Congestion Management Agencies prepare Countywide Deficiency Plans
for such regionally controlled facilities. Part of the legislation defines deficiency
planning and includes the identification of ways to address local impacts on regional
transportation systems. Deficiency planning will allow development to continue to occur
while addressing, on a larger scale, regional impacts. The VTA, acting as the Congestion
Management Agency, has identified needed capital improvements and the funding for
these improvements over time.
Environmental Documents
New and existing developments and uses are subject to Federal, State and local standards
and requirements for protecting the environment. Requirements and standards for clean
air, clean water, noise and solid waste are outlined in the Conservation and Natural
Resources Element of the City of Campbell’s General Plan. Sites or uses that have the
potential for more serious and immediate environmental impacts, such as hazardous
materials spills, are required by law under the “Tanner Act” to comply with emergency
planning programs and requirements. These requirements are outlined in the Health and
Safety Element of the City of Campbell General Plan.
CEQA is the acronym for the California Environmental Quality Act. It encourages the
protection of all aspects of the physical environment. The CEQA review process
analyzes proposed developments for their potential impacts on the physical environment.
CEQA requires identification of mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate negative
                                              I-9

Campbell General Plan
impacts. For example, some traffic mitigation measures may require the construction of
new streets or turn-lane improvements, while other measures may mandate bicycle
facilities or trip reduction programs. The most common traffic mitigation measures
require improvements to roadways and intersections to reduce congestion and traffic
delays.
GENERAL PLAN PREPARATION PROCESS
Task Force
In 1998 the City Council
authorized an update of
the Campbell General
Plan and appointed an
11-member task force to
help       develop      the
revisions.      The Task
Force was comprised of
two       City     Council
members        and     two
members from each of
the City’s boards and
commissions, as well as
active members of the
community at large.
Many members of the
Task Force have been
active          community
members for many years,
and provided insight to
Campbell’s issues and        The Task Force provided direction to staff in the idea formation and

history. The Task Force
met approximately once
a month for a two-year
period to discuss a wide
variety of issues.
In addition to the Task Force, Campbell’s General Plan was developed through a
cooperative effort among citizens, the City Council, the Planning Commission, the Parks
and Recreation Commission, the Historic Preservation Board, the Civic Improvement
Commission and the Bicycle Advisory Committee.
GENERAL PLAN ORGANIZATION
Chapter Organization
The City of Campbell General Plan is organized into the following chapters:
    1.      Introduction and Overview. This includes General Plan vision and themes,
            State requirements, and requirements for General Plan monitoring, review and
            amendments.
                                           I-10

                                                                   Introduction and Overview
    2.      Land Use and Transportation. This Element provides the physical
            framework for development and circulation in the City. It establishes policies
            related to the location and intensity of new development, citywide land use
            policies, future street and bikeway improvements, and addresses alternative
            transportation modes and parking.
    3.      Open Space, Parks, and Public Facilities. This Element outlines policies
            and standards relating to regional and local open space, parks and recreational
            facilities, and public facilities, including schools, water and wastewater.
    4.      Health and Safety. This Element addresses the risks posed by seismic and
            geologic hazards, flooding, as well as other topics, including hazardous
            materials, and emergency management.
    5.      Conservation and Natural Resources. This Element outlines policies
            relating to water quality, air quality, noise and historic and archaeological
            resources.
    6.      Housing. This Element focuses on housing availability and affordability
            according to State requirements.
General Plan Themes
Several themes for the General Plan were identified and considered by the General Plan
Task Force, based on a recent community satisfaction survey and the strategic planning
process. These themes form the basis of goals and policies throughout each chapter of
the document.
        • A safe, clean, comfortable and healthy environment
        • A physically connected and involved community with a strong sense of
            identity
        • Attractive residential neighborhoods and business districts
        • Friendly, small-town atmosphere
        • Fiscally self-reliant City government with effective basic municipal services
General Plan Structure
Each element of the General Plan is introduced by brief background information that
establishes the policy context. This background material is neither a comprehensive
statement of existing conditions nor does it contain any adopted policy, except where
specifically stated otherwise. This background information is followed by goals and
policies:
        • Goals. Goals are general statements of values or aspirations held by the
            community. Because goal statements are general in nature they tend to have
            broad community support, and are not typically controversial.
        • Policies. Policies are more precise expressions regarding how a particular
            goal will be interpreted or implemented.
                                                I-11

Campbell General Plan
        • Strategies: Strategies are an action, activity or program carried out in response
             to an adopted policy to achieve a specific goal.
Policy Numbering System
Policies in the General Plan are organized using a two-part numbering system that is
intended to give each goal and policy a distinct, easily referenced number. The first part
refers to the element, and the second refers to the specific goal or policy. The first part is
represented by the abbreviated initials of the element (such as LUT for Land Use and
Transportation). For the second part, goals are represented by a number and policies by a
secondary number. Thus, the first goal in the Health and Safety Element is HS-1, the
first policy is HS-1.1, and the first strategy is HS-1.1a.

Land Use and Transportation
INTRODUCTION
Campbell has an ideal layout, with a traditional Downtown in the heart of the city, a
natural creekside trail used by pedestrians and bicyclists both recreationally and for
commuting, a beautiful collection of parks, a community center on a historic campus, a
mix of housing types and a variety of shopping facilities that are accessible to
neighborhoods and employment centers. Campbell enjoys a nearly perfect balance
between the number of jobs and workers within its borders. Campbell’s attractive living
environment is enhanced by its central location in the Bay Area, and extensive regional
transportation network including the Vasona Light Rail. Regional mobility is important
because Campbell’s location affords residents, visitors and employers convenient access
to all parts of the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Areas. Several
freeways serve Campbell for regional mobility including: Highway 17 (which is the
southern extension of Interstate 880), Highway 85 to the south and Interstate 280 to the
north. These highways provide excellent north-south and east-west regional automobile
access. Campbell has only a few arterials throughout the City to handle peak hour traffic.
Difficulties arise as some commuters use residential streets during peak commuter
periods in efforts to bypass freeway or arterial traffic.
The Land Use and Transportation Element outlines the community’s aspirations and
vision for maintaining the ideal layout of the physical environment, while integrating new
development sensibly into the existing fabric of the community. The function and
physical appearance of streets and buildings within Campbell shapes the image of the city
and reflects its community pride and values. The Land Use and Transportation Element
identifies goals, policies and strategies that define preferred land uses and development
standards that will enhance the function and physical appearance of the community,
accentuate Campbell’s traditional small town environment and provide greater
accessibility and mobility through a multi-modal circulation system that is balanced, safe,
convenient, and available to all users including pedestrians, bicyclists, those with
disabilities, and transit users within and between Campbell’s neighborhoods and
community facilities.
The goals, strategies and policies encourage well-landscaped, attractive and functional
development, connected through a network of transportation alternatives that tie the
community together, ideally resulting in an overall reduction of automobile traffic,
carbon emissions and land use conflicts. The goals and policies are intended to promote
and implement alternative transportation options while ensuring that appropriate levels of
automobile traffic occur on the streets for which they were designed; and that traffic
resulting from commercial and industrial development does not adversely infringe upon
residential neighborhoods.
The Land Use and Transportation Element also encourages integration of traffic calming
techniques in areas not intended for faster through traffic. At the same time, this Element
seeks to enhance mobility by working with neighboring cities and the Valley

Transportation Authority to implement and operate facilities of regional significance,
such as arterials and expressways as well as regional public transit. The Element
identifies goals and policies that will enhance Campbell as a quality place to live, work
and play.
The Land Use and Transportation goals and policies harmonize with the community
vision and community goals, which are to encourage a safe, clean, comfortable and
healthy environment; a physically connected and involved community with a strong
sense of identity; attractive residential neighborhoods and business districts; a friendly,
small-town atmosphere; and a fiscally self-reliant City government with effective basic
municipal services.
The Land Use and Transportation Element lays out a vision of the distribution, location,
and intensity of all land uses, and the transportation network for moving people, goods
and services within the city – not just what they are now, but what they will be in the
future. This Element satisfies the State requirement for both the Land Use and
Circulation Elements. The Land Use and Transportation Element will focus on:
    •   Population characteristics
    •   Land Use (Land Use Diagram, Land Use Categories)
    •   Transportation (Roadways, roadway maintenance, the Neighborhood Traffic
        Management Program, Complete Streets policies and practices, Street Lighting,
        Parking, Traffic Volumes, Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation, Public Transit,
        and disabled access)
    •   Community Design (Neighborhoods, Gateways/Boundaries, Streets and Public
        Improvements, Historic and Cultural Resources, Land Use Compatibility,
        Amenities, Open Space and Community Linkages, Access to Development, and
        Building and Site Design)
    •   Area Plans (Pruneyard/Creekside Commercial District, North of Campbell
        Avenue, South of Campbell Avenue, San Tomas Area Neighborhood, Campbell
        Redevelopment Area, Downtown, Downtown Neighborhoods)
    •   Goals, Policies, and Strategies(Regional, City-Wide and Neighborhoods)
POPULATION
Campbell’s population has grown steadily over the past three decades. When Campbell
incorporated in 1952, the population was approximately 7,800. By 1970, the City’s
population doubled. During the early 1980s, the City annexed land in the San Tomas
neighborhood, and by the 1990 U.S. Census, the population count for the City of
Campbell was 36,048. The 2000 U.S. Census population count is 38,138.
The proposed General Plan at buildout would accommodate a population level of
approximately 41,825, or 9.7 percent over 2000 levels, as shown in Table LUT-1:
Historic and Projected Population. This population increase would be generated from the
potential increase of 1,600 housing units, concentrated mainly on mixed-use
redevelopment sites along light rail transit corridors and infill development.

Non-residential building space in Campbell will increase nine percent from an estimated
10.2 million square feet to nearly 11.2 million square feet, as shown in Table LUT-2:
General Plan Buildout Projections for Non-Residential Floor Space. This results from
application of average assumed densities and floor area ratios (shown in Appendix B) to
vacant sites and areas with potential redevelopment/intensification opportunities.

The time at which full development (“buildout”) will occur is not specified in or
anticipated by the Plan; Therefore, the levels of “buildout population” may be reached in
a 15-25 year period. Designation of a site for a certain use does not necessarily mean that
the site will be built/redeveloped with the designated use over the next 8-10 years, the
horizon of the Plan.
LAND USE
Campbell is a predominantly built-out community. Many believe there is little room for
growth or change in the physical environment due to the scarcity of vacant land.
However, land use is dynamic and change is constant from within and without. Guiding
change in an effort to maintain the quality of life in Campbell is a challenge. In making
land use decisions, the City’s decision makers must consider which land uses will best
serve the public interest, while allowing property owners reasonable property use.
Maintaining this balance has always been a primary function of land use planning.
Land for the development of homes has become scarce within the City. As a result of
increasing demand for homes in the City and the Santa Clara Valley as a whole, the City
is feeling the pressure to develop the maximum number of units on each site. The
character of some neighborhoods has been affected by this intensification trend, and as a
                                            __________
                                               LUT-3

result, the land use category of some neighborhoods has been changed to a lower density
to reflect the existing housing types. Conversely, some neighborhoods have been
identified as areas where density can increase due to factors such as proximity to light-
rail. In those areas the land use category on the General Plan Diagram has intensified.
As the City has limited resources in terms of vacant land, there are no plans to locate
solid and liquid waste disposal, including hazardous waste facilities, within the City of
Campbell boundaries. The City participates with Santa Clara County and the cities
within Santa Clara County to site solid and hazardous waste facilities in appropriate
locations where they will not pose nuisance and health threats to the population, and
where the potential for groundwater contamination and air pollution is minimized. See
the Health and Safety Element and the Conservation and Natural Resources Element for
more information.
Some land within the City of Campbell is located in special flood hazard areas. The land
adjacent to the Los Gatos Creek, San Tomas Aquino Creek and Smith Creek may be
designated as “Areas of 100-year flood” by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
In areas with flood potential, the City ensures that new construction meets State and local
standards for construction as mandated by the Uniform Building Code. For more
information on Flooding, see the Health and Safety Element.
The Land Use Diagram
Campbell’s General Plan Land Use and Transportation Diagram is a graphic
representation of the policies set forth in the Land Use and Transportation Element. The
Diagram has the following major land use categories:
     • Residential
     • Industrial
     • Commercial/Office
     • Public/Government Facilities
     • Mixed-use and Special Planning Areas
Each of these categories is divided into subcategories, based on density and land use type.
The various land use categories are applied to geographic land areas within the
community, to indicate which land uses the City believes will be the most appropriate at
that location.

Land Use Categories
Residential Development
The quality and livability of existing residential neighborhoods are often intangible
elements, but they are important to community life. The General Plan focuses on
enhancing neighborhood character, attracting quality development and providing
opportunities for neighborhood interaction. The compatibility of residential development
is determined by such factors as housing density, lot size, lot configuration, building scale
and type, and building design. It is a goal of the City to maintain a variety of residential
land use options. The various residential designations are as follows:
        Low-Density Residential (Less than 3.5 units per gross acre): Development at
        this density is most often in the form of single-family detached homes on large
        lots (typically 10,000 square-foot lots or larger). The allowable density of less
        than 3.5 units per acre results in a population of approximately one to nine
        persons per acre.
        Low-Density Residential (Less than 4.5 units per gross acre): This designation
        also provides for detached single-family homes on larger lots (typically 8,000 to
        9,000 square- foot lots). The allowable density of less than 4.5 units per acre
        results in a population of approximately one to 11 persons per acre.
        Low-Density Residential (Less than six units per gross acre): This designation
        provides for detached single-family homes (on lots that are typically 6,000 square
        feet). The allowable density of less than 6 units per acre results in a population of
        approximately one to 15 people per acre.
        Low-Medium Density Residential: The low-medium density residential category
        permits a range of 6 to 13 dwelling units per gross acre. Developments at this
        density consist generally of duplexes, small apartment buildings, and small lot
        single-family detached homes when the PD (Planned Development) Zoning
        Designation is utilized. The allowable density of 6-13 units per acre results in a
        population of approximately 15 to 32 persons per acre.
        Medium Density Residential: The medium density residential classification on the
        land use plan permits a range of 14 to 20 units per gross acre, which results in a
        population of approximately 35 to 49 persons per acre. Historically, new
        development at this density has been in the form of apartments, condominiums
        and townhouses.
        High Density Residential: The high density residential category permits from 21
        to 27 units per gross acre. Developments at this density consist generally of
        apartments and condominiums, and similar types of residential uses. The
        allowable density of 21 to 27 units per acre results in a population of
        approximately 52 to 67 persons per acre.
        Mobile Home Park: The Mobile Home Park category was created to discourage
        the conversion of several functioning mobile home parks to other uses, since
        mobile home parks have traditionally provided low-to-moderate income housing
        for Campbell residents. The allowable density is 6 to 13 units per gross acre,
        which results in a population of approximately 15 to 32 persons per acre.

                                           LUT-6
Commercial Development
Commercial designations have a broad range of uses. Retail and service business,
professional offices, banks, restaurants, and similar types of uses are allowed in
commercial zones. Floor Area Ratios (FARs) in Commercial designations vary by
Special Project Area. Special Project Areas are discussed beginning on page LUT-32.
The visual quality of commercial streets is enhanced when buildings form a street-wall,
by extending them along the street. Through good design, commercial building
placement and scale can enhance the image of the community. Visual quality is also
improved through appropriate and complementary building scale, which means the
relationship of new development to existing buildings.
In Campbell there are four commercial designations as follows:
        Central Commercial: The Central Commercial designation is used for the heart of
        Campbell including parts of Campbell and Winchester Avenues in Downtown
        Campbell. This area is intended to provide shopping, services and entertainment
        within a pedestrian oriented, urban environment. Building forms in this
        designation edge the street and should include retail commercial uses on the
        ground floor with either office or residential uses on the second and third floors.
        For more information on the Downtown area, refer to the Downtown Area Plan in
        Appendix A.
        General Commercial: This category permits commercial uses that need exposure
        to high volumes of automobile traffic or access to transit corridors. Most of the
        land in Campbell that is designated for General Commercial is located along both
        sides of Bascom and Hamilton Avenues and parts of Winchester Boulevard.
        Commercial development in these areas is highly visible, hence the placement and
        scale of buildings is especially important to the community image.
                                         __________

__________
  LUT-8

           __________
              LUT-9
The building forms should typically frame the street, with parking lots either behind or
under the building. Auto related uses, such as auto repair, are not allowed to locate in the
General Commercial areas.
        Neighborhood Commercial: The Neighborhood Commercial category is designed
        to encourage the location of commercial uses at major intersections in residential
        areas. Neighborhood Commercial uses accommodate small-scale, lower intensity
        commercial and office uses that provide goods and services to the adjacent
        residential neighborhood and are accessible by automobile, bicycle, transit, and
        by foot. Neighborhood Commercial areas should be designed to encourage
        convenient pedestrian and bicycle travel to and from surrounding neighborhoods.
        The architecture of the buildings should be compatible to the neighborhood.
        Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants, laundries and personal services are
        examples of neighborhood commercial uses.
        Professional Office: The Professional Office land use designation permits
        administrative, professional and research uses that may provide a customer
        service or be more corporate in nature. Office uses are dispersed throughout the
        City, since they are permitted in most non-residential zoning districts. Because
        office uses generally have a less intense impact on adjacent land uses than other
        commercial uses, they often provide a buffer between residential and commercial
        or industrial uses. Location and design of office developments should include
        proximity to transit lines and connections to light rail as well as bicycle routes.
Mixed-Use
Within the City of Campbell, there are several areas where a mix of uses is encouraged.
Adding residential development along some of the City’s commercial corridors will
create activity along the street, provide a variety of housing types near work and
shopping, and enhance public safety. This strategy ensures safer, more viable
commercial areas with the mixed-use residents providing around the clock “eyes and
ears” for greater safety and helping to ensure the viability of the commercial uses. Also,
mixed-use development should be located next to sidewalks or landscape setback areas
adjacent to the public street to enhance visibility, pedestrian and bicycle access and
interaction with the commercial uses. The maximum floor area ratios (FAR) are
contained in specific land use policies for each project area. Residential densities will not
be counted against the allowable FAR to provide incentive to developers to construct
housing near employment centers and public transit.
Several of the areas designated for Mixed-Use Development are part of Area Plans such
as the North of Campbell Avenue Area Plan (NOCA) and South of Campbell Avenue
Area Plan (SOCA) which are within one-half mile of either the Downtown Campbell or
Winchester light rail stations. Development Standards will be created for many of the
mixed-use designations listed below.
The General Plan contains four categories of mixed land uses:
        Low-Medium Density Residential and/or Professional Office: This designation
        occurs primarily near Downtown, where there is a need for office uses to buffer
                                         __________
                                           LUT-10

        the single- family homes from commercial impacts. Many parcels designated
        with the Low-Medium Density Residential and/or Professional Office category
        have homes that are on the Historic Inventory. These homes may be converted to
        office use, however the character of the historic homes and the single-family
        residential neighborhood should be maintained.
        Medium to High Density Residential and/or Commercial: This Land Use
        Designation occurs near Downtown, in the South of Campbell Avenue Area
        (SOCA). These parcels primarily front Railway Avenue, Dillon Avenue and
        Gilman Avenue and are zoned higher densities purposefully near the Light Rail to
        encourage residents to get out of their cars and use public transit. The General
        Plan identifies these parcels for commercial or a mix of uses, promoting
        commercial on the ground floor and residential above, similar to the uses along
        Campbell Avenue in Downtown Campbell. The SOCA plan identifies maximum
        floor area ratios and minimum lot sizes for this area.
        Residential / Commercial / Professional Office: There are several areas within the
        City with this designation including the NOCA area, several parcels on Hamilton
        Avenue west of San Tomas Expressway and areas along the Vasona Light Rail
        line. The Residential / Commercial / Professional Office Designation is intended
        to provide a residential component to traditional commercial and/or professional
        office uses. The intent of this designation is to maintain the commercial and
        office uses on the ground floor, with residential on the upper floors. Development
        standards will be created for these areas regarding minimum lot coverage and
        floor ratio requirements. The Development standards will also ensure quality site
        design (e.g. encouraging building placement toward the street edge and parking in
        the rear or underneath).
        Commercial and/or Light Industrial: This area is located on Old Camden Avenue,
        southeast of Winchester Boulevard, in the SOCA planning area. The Commercial
        and/or Light Industrial designation is intended for service commercial type uses.
        Auto repair facilities and similar uses are encouraged to locate in this area.
Industrial Development
Industrial development in Campbell is located primarily along Dell Avenue, the
McGlincey Lane area and Old Camden Avenue. Uses in Campbell’s industrial areas
include research and development, small start-up companies, warehouses, and auto
repair. Buildings vary in size and appearance. Nearly all of Campbell’s industrial land is
built-out. The City seeks to upgrade the function and appearance of these industrial areas
by encouraging high quality development.              The City maintains two industrial
designations as follows:
        Research and Development: This designation accommodates campus-like
        environments for corporate headquarters, research and development facilities and
        offices. The Research and Development designation accommodates uses such as
        incubator-research facilities, testing, packaging, publishing and printing.
        Light Industrial: This designation is intended to provide and protect industrial
        lands for a wide range of light manufacturing, industrial processing, general
                                         __________
                                            LUT-11

         service, warehousing, storage and distribution and service commercial uses, such
         as automobile repair facilities. Industries producing substantial amounts of
         hazardous waste or odor and other pollutants are not permitted. Businesses
         serving commercial uses such as food services or office supply would be allowed
         as ancillary uses, subject to appropriate standards.
Institutional
The General Plan provides for civic, social service, educational, cultural or charitable
uses operated by a government or private agency serving the public under the category of
Institutional. The term institutional can include facilities owned or operated by a private
organization, such as a private school or religious organization, as well as facilities
owned or operated by a public entity, such as public buildings and grounds.
The City operates a variety of facilities for its citizens, including the Civic Center
complex, the Community Center, Adult Center, and the Campbell Historical Museum.
More information on these facilities can be found in the Open Space, Parks and Public
Facilities Element of the General Plan.
Open Space
This designation provides for a variety of uses of land that include areas of natural
resources, recreation and areas of enjoyment of scenic beauty, such as parks, creeks and
trails. Historically, Campbell contained large expansive open space in the form of orchard
land. Today, however, there is no land devoted to commercial agriculture, though non-
commercial agricultural uses are allowed in areas designated for residential and open
space land uses. More information on Open Space can be found in the Open Space, Parks
and Public Facilities Element of the General Plan.
TRANSPORTATION
The object of a community circulation system is to provide its users safe, efficient and
convenient navigation of the transportation system, regardless of the mode of
transportation. The Complete Streets Act of 2008 requires cities to accommodate safe and
convenient travel for all users including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit users, and people
of all ages and abilities to reduce automobile traffic congestion and greenhouse gas
emissions, while enhancing recreational and healthier alternatives for travel. For purposes
of this document, travel is defined as moving people, goods, and services by means of
multiple modes of transportation including motorized vehicles, public transit, bicycle,
walking and wheel chair. The roadway system is the foundation for moving people,
goods and services within and through Campbell. Its right-of-way provides the
opportunities for growing and enhancing mobility options while “leveling the playing
field” when it comes to providing bicycle, pedestrian and transit opportunities.
Transportation is a complex web of travel modes, operators, and behaviors. Historically,
traffic and transportation policy has emphasized the convenience and priority of the
automobile. However, recent State and regional land use policy has emphasized the need
to stress alternative modes of transportation in its efforts to alleviate traffic congestion
and improve air quality. The transportation component of this Element is intent on
establishing policy that will integrate pedestrian, bicycle, auto, and public transit into a

                                            LUT-12

   unified system that balances all modes of transportation for all users in a convenient, safe
   and effective manner.
   In planning a transportation network, the street system provides the framework for
   organizing the various modes of travel and establishing a blue print for how that system
   will be used. The City’s inventory of streets is classified based on capacity and intended
   purpose under the appropriate transportation mode which is designed in a safe, efficient
   and convenient manner. Table LUT-3 categorizes the City’s street system.
Table LUT-3: Transportation Network Classifications
   Category                                          Function
Freeways         Freeways are designed to be high-speed, high-capacity facilities with limited
                 access and grade separations at cross streets. The primary function of
                 freeways is to provide high mobility for regional and countywide motorized
                 travel. Freeways are designed, operated, and maintained by the State of
                 California. Both Highways 17 and 85 traverse Campbell.
Expressway       Expressways are major divided arterials with access limited primarily to grade
                 separations and at-grade intersections. The purpose of expressways is to serve
                 countywide trips. Expressways are generally designed, operated, and
                 maintained by the County of Santa Clara. San Tomas Expressway, the only
                 expressway in Campbell, is also used for bus transit and bike travel. Bike use
                 is available in both the northbound and southbound directions. The
                 expressway is not used for pedestrian travel, except for access to transit stops.
Arterial         Arterials are major multi-lane streets that primarily function to serve through
                 traffic for inter-city and intra-city trips. Arterials also provide access to
                 adjacent properties. Both bike routes and bike lanes can be found on arterials
                 along with ADA accessible pedestrian sidewalks for access to commercial
                 services.
                     • Class I arterials generally have little on-street parking and serve major
                         bus routes such as Hamilton and Bascom Avenues.
                     • Class II arterials generally have on-street parking and serve major bus
                         routes such as Campbell Avenue and Winchester Boulevard.

Collector         Collectors are low- to medium-speed two-lane or multi-lane streets that serve
                  to collect and channel local traffic to arterials and to distribute arterial traffic
                  onto local streets. Collectors provide mobility and land access via driveways
                  and on-street parking. Collectors serve bus routes, bicyclists and pedestrians
                  and provide transit opportunities.
                      • Commercial/Industrial Collectors have adjacent commercial and
                          industrial land uses.
                      • Residential Collectors serve the residential neighborhood they
                          penetrate.
Local Access      Local streets are low-speed two-lane streets that provide direct access to
                  abutting land uses. Local streets provide the lowest level of mobility and
                  usually serve no bus routes. Local streets are used for bicycle and pedestrian
                  circulation connecting neighborhoods with services and recreational
                  amenities.
Private Lane      Private streets are low-speed access streets that provide direct access to
                  properties within a particular subdivision or development. Private streets are
                  maintained and operated by Home Owners Associations or individual private
                  landowners.
Bike Path         Bike Paths are paved facilities that are physically separated from roadways
                  used by motor vehicles by space or a physical barrier and are designated for
                  bicycle use. The Los Gatos Creek Trail falls in this category. (Class I)
Bike Lanes        Bike Lanes are lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the
                  exclusive use of bicycles, so designated with special signing and pavement
                  markings. (Class II)
Bike Routes       Bike Routes are roadways recommended for use by bicyclists and often
                  connect roadways with bike lanes and bike paths. Bike routes are designated
                  with signs. (Class III)
   Pedestrian Mobility
   The City of Campbell prides itself on its small town character and its unique sense of
   place. This is reflected best in the downtown core and its surrounding neighborhoods.
   The lifestyle and ambiance of the downtown area is a slice of traditional “Americana”
   where locals often stroll to their favorite downtown restaurant, summer concert series or
   neighborhood park. What is conspicuously distinctive about a district like the downtown
   is the convenience and enjoyment of being able to walk to destinations and services.
   Having a safe and convenient network of pedestrian routes encourages community

                                              LUT-14

interaction, health and minimizing the use of motorized vehicles which tend to isolate a
community while contributing to traffic congestion and carbon emissions.
The City has extended this formula to areas outside the downtown core, including the use
of bulb-outs, pedestrian level street lighting, wide sidewalks and pedestrian-oriented
development as exemplified in the East Campbell Avenue Master Plan and the
Winchester Boulevard Master Plan. These area plans promote the extension of
pedestrian oriented development and infrastructure throughout the Priority Development
Area (PDA) where pedestrian connections to services and transit stations serve as a
foundation for development.
While some industrial areas and older commercial areas lack acceptable pedestrian
connectivity, the City is looking to further the ideals of pedestrian circulation throughout
the City and its neighborhoods as opportunities arise in the development review process
as well as the City’s annual Capital Improvement Program (CIP). Through development
policies and a proactive CIP process, existing neighborhoods and districts can be
retrofitted with pedestrian paths of travel to improve connections and safety for school
children, older adults, and residents wanting to access services, parks and transit stations.
Goals and policies have been developed that encourage pedestrian connections
throughout the City, by encouraging connected, interesting site design. As Special Area
Plans are developed, they will need to be reviewed to ensure their policies are consistent
with Complete Streets strategies as well.
Bicycle Mobility
Since the City is only six and a half square miles in area and geographically flat,
traversing the City of Campbell by way of bicycle is an available transportation option
for most. The City’s goals are to provide a network of bike lanes, routes and paths within
its street system to encourage and serve a broad range of bicycle abilities. The City has in
place a Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee that advises the City Council on
bicycle mobility policy. The City employs over 30 miles of bike routes and lanes, and the
Los Gatos Creek Trail provides a Class 1 bike path for both commuters and recreational
use through the City. The City is committed to developing a comprehensive bicycle
transportation network linking existing and planned regional networks in order to expand
the breadth of opportunities for bicycle users.
Bicycle facilities include bike paths, bike lanes and bike routes:
     •   Bike Paths are paved facilities that are physically separated from roadways used
         by motor vehicles by space or a physical barrier and are designated for bicycle
         use.
     •   Bike Lanes are lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the exclusive
         use of bicycles, so designated with special signing and pavement markings.
     •   Bike Routes are roadways recommended for use by bicycles and often connect
         roadways with bike lanes and bike paths. Bike routes are designated with signs.
Figure LUT-4 depicts the locations of the existing and proposed bike lanes, bike paths
and routes. There are links between Campbell bikeways and bikeways in the neighboring
cities of San Jose, Los Gatos and Saratoga. Santa Clara County allows bicycles on all
expressways including San Tomas Expressway. The Los Gatos Creek Trail provides a
                                         __________
                                           LUT-15

north-south connection linking Campbell to San Jose to the north and Los Gatos to the
south.
Public Transit
In order to provide mobility to the greater region, Campbell must have a transportation
system that provides choices for multiple methods of travel that are available to all facets
of the community with good connectivity to all destination points, both within the City
and beyond. This mobility will be enhanced by a variety of methods including the
extension of local and regional public transit serving as an essential component of a
comprehensive transportation system by providing an affordable alternative to the
automobile, and reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. The City of Campbell
enjoys three light rail stations along the Vasona Light Rail Corridor, including stations at
Hamilton Avenue, Downtown Campbell and Winchester Boulevard. Additionally, the
City has access to extended bus service, and para-transit for the elderly and disabled, all
operated by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).
These regional measures will be linked to and coordinated with the City’s existing
circulation system so that Campbell’s residents and business community will have
excellent mobility both within the City and to destinations beyond. The challenge in
providing this mobility will be protecting the heart of the community and its internal
connectivity by breaking physical impediments and barriers such as those posed by
freeways and expressways, with connective elements such as trails and over crossings.
The Land Use and Transportation goals and policies will identify strategies to encourage
a greater range of transportation options that are widely used by making them safer, more
accessible and more efficient.

Roadway Maintenance
The City maintains or contracts maintenance of all improved public streets, associated
signs and striping. The City uses a Pavement Management System to identify and
prioritize major preventive and corrective maintenance needs. All City streets are
surveyed and rated on a biennial basis. Maintenance needs are identified by measuring
observed pavement conditions against a City standard for system-wide average pavement
surface conditions and standards establishing road repair strategies with the condition
rating for individual street segments. Depending on the rating of a specific street,
differing repair approaches ranging from patching to reconstruction may be required.
Larger resurfacing jobs are usually contracted out to private contractors, with City crews’
primarily handling preventive maintenance such as crack sealing and filling potholes.
Street, roadside area, parking district, walkway and bike path cleaning are ongoing City
services. Street cleaning of Downtown streets occurs twice per week. Arterials are
cleaned once a week and other improved streets are cleaned two times a month, in
addition to an as-needed or requested basis.
The Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
The Neighborhood Traffic Management Program (NTMP) is essentially a set of
guidelines by which the public and City staff can work together to improve neighborhood
livability by managing speeding and cut-through traffic on residential streets. The NTMP
develops procedures for addressing neighborhood traffic issues, defines what speeds and
cut-through traffic volumes are considered excessive, and creates a toolbox of acceptable
neighborhood traffic calming strategies for managing traffic speeds and volumes.
Street Lighting
The City maintains an extensive system of streetlights for the purpose of pedestrian and
vehicle way lighting and to reduce the likelihood of crime. City owned lights on arterials
and in city-owned parking lots are routinely surveyed for maintenance needs. The City
also monitors new lighting technologies and circuiting techniques to reduce energy and
maintenance costs.
Parking
The City regulates parking on City streets and maintains several public parking lots.
Most residential streets have no parking restrictions, however some street parking spaces
in Downtown have time limitations. All parking on City-owned lots and streets is
currently free. The City imposes minimum on-site parking requirements for private
development, and more lenient standards for businesses in Downtown due to the ability
to share parking. Parking standards for new or expanded development projects are
defined in the Campbell Municipal Code. These standards are occasionally modified in
response to new or changed conditions, such as new land use types or changing parking
demands. The City’s parking standards are comparable to other jurisdictions.
In the 1970s, large cannery/warehouse buildings in Downtown were converted to office
uses, creating additional parking demand as a result of the intensification of the use. A
municipal bond was issued to build a parking structure for these large office and
commercial buildings in Downtown to satisfy parking demand caused by the conversions.

                                           LUT-19

Since that time, parking demand in the Downtown area has been increasing as other
shops, restaurants, and offices continue to intensify and become more popular. In 1999
the City provided 95 new parking spaces along Civic Center Drive and Orchard City
Drive to ease parking demand. In 2002, a 300 space public parking structure was built in
the downtown. The Downtown Development Plan (Appendix A) outlines goals and
policies for providing adequate parking in Downtown, maximizing the use of existing
and future parking resources and encourages the joint utilization of parking. The City is
continually looking for creative ways to increase the supply of parking due to increased
demand in the Downtown area.
The City’s adoption of the California Green Building Standards in 2011 includes
requirements for both short and long term bicycle parking in new developments. The City
has also provided public bike racks in the Central Commercial District where pedestrian
and bicycle travel is most prevalent. Future public works projects within the Priority
Development Area will examine the need for new or additional public bike racks.
Traffic Volumes
Campbell’s Land Use and Transportation Plan control the intensity of development,
based on the capacity of the street network to carry traffic, incorporating measures that
protect the heart of the community and residential areas from through traffic. The term
“traffic carrying capacity” is subjective. Its definition is based on the desired maximum
road width and number of travel lanes and the “level of service.” Level of service is a
measurement that determines the level of traffic congestion on a given roadway (for a
more complete description of traffic technical criteria and terminology, please refer to the
Technical Appendices). The General Plan links existing and future land use activities
with the existing and future street improvements, and other transportation systems, so that
an acceptable level of service can be provided to the residents and businesses of
Campbell.

COMMUNITY DESIGN
Campbell contains many community assets and activity areas that enhance the City’s
distinctive character and sense of place. These elements, such as commercial corridors,
residential neighborhoods, natural and historical resources, and public improvements,
provide opportunities for community pride and an enhanced quality of life. Campbell’s
central position in the Valley provides both excellent accessibility and beautiful views of
the surrounding hillsides.
In 1991, Campbell’s Community Design Study was prepared, which identified the major
components of community form that is comprised of the existing and desired character of
the City. The Study also identified the role and characteristics of the various components
of community form as well as appropriate design strategies to enhance the City’s image.
In general, the design strategies of the Community Design Plan seek to encourage high
quality development, which integrate the goals of the City as a whole. Many of the ideas
presented in the Community Design study are presented in this section.
This section discusses the enhancement of the overall community life and character
through the strengthening of neighborhoods and by the use of gateways, streetscapes,
historic and cultural resources, interrelationships of land uses, multi-modal linkages and
access, and building and site design. The Community Form Diagram illustrates the
essential components of community form that make Campbell such a special place to
live.

Priority Development Area
In 2007, the City established a Priority Development Area (PDA) under the regional
planning initiative called FOCUS implemented by the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG). FOCUS is intended to further the development of self sustaining
communities by bringing housing closer to public transit and services in order to reduce
automobile traffic resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality.
The City identified the Central Campbell Redevelopment Project Area as a PDA that
includes the area in and around the downtown. This area is planned for higher density
residential and mixed use development in proximity to public transportation and services
and will be the focus for the City’s higher density development.
Neighborhoods
Campbell has a variety of residential, commercial, industrial and mixed-use areas that
have evolved into special, identifiable neighborhoods. Figure LUT-6 illustrates the
location of Campbell’s neighborhoods, and Table LUT-2 shows the land uses distribution
in each of Campbell’s neighborhoods.
Neighborhoods are the building blocks of the community. Thus, neighborhood integrity
is the heart of community character. A neighborhood should have a central focal point
that serves as a place for gathering and interaction. Neighborhoods should offer residents
a range of recreational, commercial, religious and educational opportunities.
Neighborhoods should also be bicycle and pedestrian friendly. Walkable, bikable, and
accessible neighborhoods are tree lined, safe, have pedestrian and bicycle connections
with surrounding neighborhoods and nearby shopping facilities and offer a comfortable
walking and bicycling environment with ready access to public transportation.
Issues that affect neighborhood integrity include the proximity of residential and
nonresidential uses (incompatible land use), loss of connectivity to other neighborhoods,
poor site design, lack of adequate public facilities and lack of identity.
Goals, policies and strategies in the Land Use and Transportation Element promote the
enhancement of Campbell’s neighborhoods.

Gateways / City Boundaries
Gateways and Boundaries are the primary locations where people enter and leave the
city. Gateways provide initial impressions of Campbell and convey a “sense of arrival.”
Currently the City is lacking Gateways at its boundaries and to most of its districts and
neighborhoods.
This General Plan
Update encourages
Gateways at the
city boundaries on
major streets and
intersections and at
entries to special
districts, such as
Downtown.
Gateways should
be appealing and
distinctive, evoking
a positive city or
district      image.
Gateways can be
identified through
special
architecture,
landscape,       and
artwork. Uniform
signs for the city’s
gateways can also
help define the
city’s boundaries.      Figure LUT-7: Gateways
A city’s boundaries define the municipal service area and determine the efficiency of
municipal service delivery. The City has several areas that have illogical boundaries such
as the intrusion of San Jose at the west edge of the city (also known as the Cherry Lane
neighborhood) and the portion of San Jose that is south of San Tomas Aquino Creek near
southwestern Campbell. Another illogical boundary occurs west of Bascom Avenue
between Apricot Avenue and Camden Avenue. Illogical boundaries undermine the sense
of a cohesive community and reduce the efficiency of local service delivery. Boundary
adjustments to create logical boundaries and service areas may be pursued with
neighboring jurisdictions.

Street Appearance and Public Improvements
The appearance and function of streets, freeways, and public improvements impact the
image of the City and the service levels and function of the street system. Campbell’s
arterial streets and freeways include Hamilton Avenue, Bascom Avenue, Camden
Avenue, Winchester Boulevard, Campbell Avenue, Pollard Road, Highway 17, and San
Tomas Expressway. Public improvements include streets, sidewalks, bike lanes,
medians, parkways, drainage and flood control facilities, street trees, street lighting and
traffic signals. Examples of public utilities include telephone services and electrical
transformers. Consistent and attractive street improvements, landscape treatments,
screening or undergrounding of public utilities enhance the appearance and function of
streets.
Many of Campbell’s streets have varying streetscape improvements and building
setbacks. For example, the City inherited a partially developed area with a varied set of
street standards or no improvements when it incorporated the San Tomas Neighborhood
in the mid-1980s. In some cases, a street may be developed with two or three different
improvement standards including various curb types or no curbs, sidewalks or no
sidewalks, street lights or no lights, misaligned curbs, varying street widths and streets
that are not aligned at intersections. Variable street improvements can be unattractive,
confusing to pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists, and in some cases costly to maintain.
The policies in the San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan (found in Appendix A) establish
a strategy to correct these inconsistencies by requiring adherence to consistent standards
and attempting to achieve compatibility as new development or redevelopment occurs.
In addition to maintaining street improvements, the City’s Streetscape Standards identify
the need for attractively landscaped parkways and safe sidewalks along major
commercial streets. Adjacent development, their employees and customers benefit from
safe and attractive public improvements. Accordingly, property owners and developers
are responsible for installing and maintaining boulevard landscaping within the adjacent
public right of way. In 1991, Campbell identified several streets that are located at
important gateways to the City. Interim Streetscape Standards were adopted for these
streets in 1993, and the final Streetscape Standards adopted in 2001. The streetscape has
been installed on many segments of the identified streets (Winchester Boulevard, Bascom
Avenue, Hamilton Avenue, and West Campbell Avenue), including Hamilton Plaza,
Home Depot, Kirkwood Plaza, Campbell Gateway Square, Campbell Plaza and the
Pruneyard. The streetscape has significantly enhanced Campbell’s image as a quality
small town.
Landscaping adjacent to the freeways and expressway enhances the image of adjacent
private development and improves the image of the City. Currently the landscaping
along the freeways and San Tomas Expressway are stark and visually unappealing. The
City will work with adjacent property owners and public agencies, including the Santa
Clara Valley Water District, Santa Clara County, City of San Jose and the California
Department of Transportation, to determine how to provide attractive landscape
treatments on regional roadways.
Maintaining public streets will continue to be a challenge into the next century.
Shrinking revenue sources and added traffic increase the burden of maintaining streets.
                                        __________
                                          LUT-29

Campbell will seek strategies to ensure that new development, including significantly
improved properties, upgrade public improvements and travel ways adjacent to their
property.
Historic and Cultural Resources
Preservation of Campbell’s historic and culturally significant resources promotes
community identity, enhances the quality of life and preserves a quality small town
feeling. The historic area of Campbell is primarily located in or near the Downtown area.
Older homes, like those in the Alice Avenue Historic District, and buildings such as the
Community Center, Heritage Village, the Ainsley House, and the Water Tower in Hyde
Park are important reminders of the past and contribute significantly to Campbell’s sense
of place. The City maintains an inventory of the City’s historic buildings, structures and
districts and notes the City’s cultural resources.
Historic structures and cultural resources are more likely to be preserved and maintained
if they have an economically viable use. Rehabilitation is the repair or improvement of
historic buildings that enables them to be used for their original purpose or adapted to a
new use. Sensitive improvements and additions complement the scale, massing, and
architectural character of historic buildings and the surrounding neighborhood. Sensitive
improvements and additions respect the historic qualities of older buildings and allow
them to remain prominent elements in the community.
An example of the preservation of a historic structure is the restoration of the City’s
Heritage Theatre at the Campbell Community Center (formerly the Campbell High
School campus). Built in 1938, the theatre was formerly an integral part of the
community where music, drama, dance and chorale events were presented for 40 years at
the Campbell High School Auditorium. The Friends of the Heritage Theatre came
together in the spirit of a quality small town, and have hosted fundraisers and applied for
and received grants to restore the theatre.
The City will seek to expand properties within the Historic Overlay District where a
neighborhood’s integrity has been kept intact by preserving and remodeling buildings
sensitively. For example, the City will study the residential neighborhoods directly north
and south of Downtown for possible addition of the Historic Overlay District designation
on the Zoning Map, where appropriate.
Land Use Compatibility
The regulation of land use is intended to promote land use compatibility. Land use
incompatibility will result if development standards do not adequately address conflicts
between different land use types. Incompatibility can occur when noise, traffic, parking,
fumes or mechanical vibration disturbs adjacent uses. Incompatible land uses may occur
where residential homes are adjacent to non-residential uses (such as commercial or
industrial) or significantly higher density residential uses. Land uses typically
incompatible with residential uses include, automobile and truck repair shops, late night
and early morning uses, fast food establishments, and entertainment establishments such
as nightclubs, bars, dance clubs, video arcade and liquor establishments. Limiting their
number, controlling their locations and hours or methods of operation, or otherwise
                                          __________
                                            LUT-30

restricting their development or expansion can mitigate the negative effects of
incompatible uses.
Another type of potential incompatible use within a commercial neighborhood is a single-
purpose building. Single-purpose buildings have a greater likelihood of remaining vacant
through changing economic times. In particular, buildings specifically designed for self-
storage limit the flexibility and types of future uses. Commercial buildings should be
flexibly designed to accommodate a variety of tenant types and to ensure they remain
viable and contribute to the success and vitality of the surrounding commercial or
industrial district. A key element in retaining flexibility is the provision of sufficient
parking, landscaping and an enhanced street appearance.
Amenities, Open Space and Community Linkages
Open space and creeks provide recreational opportunities and visual relief. Residents and
workers viewing the open space from adjacent development provide a measure of safety
and security for users of the open space and the adjacent neighborhood. Development
can act like walls and block views and access to public and private amenities.
Accordingly, buildings and structures should not back up to amenities but should orient
to them. Face to face orientation will maximize exposure and enhance security. High
activity areas such as plazas, and pedestrian walkways and bike routes can also be used to
connect projects to these amenities. For example, a residential complex or a research and
development building may face a plaza that is situated adjacent to the Los Gatos Creek
Trail. The plaza’s interface between the buildings and the trail provides a physical and
spatial connection to the openness of the Creek and provides an amenity for the
building’s occupants.
Some neighborhoods are separated from adjacent development by major roadways or
natural barriers.      Examples of neighborhoods that are isolated from adjacent
neighborhoods include the White Oaks neighborhood, which is separated from the rest of
Campbell by Hwy 17 and the San Tomas Neighborhood, which is separated from Central
Campbell by the San Tomas Expressway.                 These roads and barriers isolate
neighborhoods from each other, lessening the overall sense of community. To enhance
the sense of community, residents need opportunities to interact. Opportunities for
interaction increase when neighborhoods are linked together through the use of bridges,
trails, pedestrian and bike paths, continuous streetscape and other methods. With such
connections, residents of now-separated neighborhoods will increasingly feel they are
part of the larger Campbell community.
Access to Development
The number and size of entrances and exits from the roadway can affect the efficiency
and safety of roadways. For example, an expressway has a limited number of driveways
and intersections, which allows traffic to travel freely without slowing for cars turning
into driveways. Large numbers of driveways on busy streets allow drivers to enter and
exit travel lanes indiscriminately, which disrupts the flow of traffic and increases the
potential for collisions. In order to minimize traffic disruptions on arterial roadways, the
General Plan encourages site design that consolidates driveways.
                                        __________
                                          LUT-31

In addition, numerous, small, disconnected parking lots are inefficient and force
customers back into the public street when they desire to travel between adjacent sites,
which disrupts the flow of traffic and causes safety concerns. The General Plan
encourages shared parking facilities between non-residential uses to limit the need to
enter roadways to go to adjacent sites. Efficient parking lot design incorporates sufficient
queuing by installing parking spaces that are setback sufficiently from the driveways,
which limits the conflicts with motorists entering or leaving the site.
Building and Site Design
New developments, especially “infill” projects (i.e. new development that primarily takes
place by remodeling existing buildings or by removing an existing structure to
accommodate a new structure), require careful attention to building scale, architectural
design, landscaping, and placement and screening of loading areas and mechanical
equipment. With proper encouragement and direction, new development can have a
positive affect on surrounding development and enhance the quality of life for residents,
employees, and visitors to Campbell.
The General Plan encourages new developments, including major remodels, which are
designed to complement existing development. New development and improvements can
be compatible with surrounding development if careful attention is paid to scale,
materials, colors, building height and form, and design details. Franchise establishments
sometimes employ a generic “corporate architecture” that is garish and repetitive.
Corporate architecture is more difficult to blend with existing development, does not
accommodate other commercial land uses easily and becomes dated quickly. Therefore,
corporate architecture is discouraged. The General Plan encourages high quality building
designs that are architecturally attractive and are compatible with or enhance the
surrounding development.
Pedestrian Friendly Development
New development and redevelopment can be designed to enhance the pedestrian
experience. Buildings that provide human scale are visually interesting and oriented to
the pedestrian. Such buildings engage the pedestrian at ground level, at entryways, and
along street frontages by using interesting building designs, quality materials, interesting
display windows, recessed openings, awnings, canopies and entrance features.
Building Placement at Intersections
Major intersections are often the first and most lasting impression of the community.
Street intersections create focal points that can enhance or detract from the image of a
community. This highly visible position deserves special design consideration. Well-
designed buildings that frame intersections help define a space and reduce the expanse of
asphalt.     Incorporating prominent entries, windows, design details, and landscape
oriented to the intersection creates “a sense of place.” Well-designed and strategically
placed buildings can provide a more positive image of the community.
Parking Areas
After parking the car, every motorist becomes a pedestrian. Parking areas should be
visually attractive and accommodate vehicles and pedestrians in a pleasant, well-
landscaped environment. Parking lots should incorporate a pedestrian walkway system
                                        __________
                                          LUT-32

that connects buildings, parking areas, and street sidewalks in a comprehensive and easily
understood manner. The pedestrian system needs to be designed to serve the interior and
the periphery of large parking areas. Parking areas that have little or no landscape, or that
front the street are unattractive and unpleasant for the pedestrian and the motorist.
Design features that enhance pedestrian ways include special paving or markings, trellis
structures, and special landscape treatment.
Lot Consolidation
The lot pattern in some areas of the City is small and fragmented, which compromises the
ability to accommodate coordinated development. Odd configurations and small lots also
make quality development difficult or infeasible to achieve. In these instances, adjacent
parcels should be consolidated. Consolidation will provide logical building sites and
promote coordinated development. It will address issues of economy of scale, and foster
consistency and compatibility of development. The SOCA and NOCA plans (located in
Appendix A) allow density bonuses as an incentive for lot consolidation.
AREA PLANS AND SPECIAL PROJECT AREAS
Several areas of the city are unique in ways that require special consideration. These
“Special Project Areas” include land use and development policies specific to these areas.
These Special Project Areas include:
    • Pruneyard / Creekside Commercial District
    • North of Campbell Avenue (NOCA)
    • South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA)
    • San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan (STANP)
    • Redevelopment Project Area
    • Downtown Campbell
    • Downtown Neighborhood
Pruneyard/Creekside Commercial District
Bascom Avenue, Highway 17, Hamilton Avenue and Campbell Avenue bound the
Pruneyard/Creekside Area.
The Pruneyard/Creekside Area is a major employment and commercial district featuring
the Pruneyard shopping center and office towers, numerous offices, commercial activities
and the Hamilton Station of the Vasona Light Rail line. The Los Gatos Creek Trail is a
major amenity, which should be maintained as a naturalistic parkway landscaped with
native vegetation to complement the mixed-use environment planned for the area. The
Aloha Apartments separate the Pruneyard from the remainder of the area. However, the
extension of Campisi Way will relieve traffic impact of development and will link the
area together. The Pruneyard and the offices on Creekside Way will serve as the area’s
“anchors” attracting people to the area both during the daytime and evening. The area
along the west side of Bascom Avenue between Hamilton Avenue and Campisi Way is
envisioned as a mixed-use area with residential or office over commercial, which differs
from the previous General Plan designation for the area of Commercial only. Residents
and workers of this area will be able to walk to the Hamilton Avenue light rail station and
to the Pruneyard. The objective of the Pruneyard/Creekside Commercial District is to
obtain an active, connected space with a mixture of commercial, office, residential,

                                          LUT-33

entertainment and recreational uses functioning as a community and regional focal point.
It is anticipated that the City will prepare an Area Plan for the Pruneyard/Creekside Area
to help guide development.
North of Campbell Avenue (NOCA)
NOCA is located adjacent to the Downtown business district and the Civic Center, which
includes the Library and City Hall. The area encompasses those properties north of the
intersection of Civic Center Drive and the Vasona Light Rail Line and extends north to
several parcels adjacent to Salmar Avenue within the City’s PDA.
The NOCA is envisioned as a mixed-use area that supports revitalization of the
Downtown and provides additional housing in proximity to Downtown shopping and
public transit. This area was historically a residential area that converted to industrial
uses. The NOCA policies are intended to guide redevelopment of the area. The objective
for the area is to have a mix of medium density residential (up to 20 units per gross acre),
office and retail commercial uses functioning as an attractive gateway and
complementing Downtown commercial activity. Ideally, the urban context of the area
lends itself more towards alternative forms of transportation and less dependence on
automobile travel for accessing services and entertainment. Due to the proximity to
single-family residential, retail and commercial uses in the area should be low impact in
nature (e.g. operate during the daytime hours, not generate noise, vibration, or a large
amount of traffic). The NOCA plan can be found in Appendix A of this General Plan.
South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA)
The SOCA is located between Highway 17 to the east, the Vasona Light Rail Line to the
west, East Campbell Avenue to the north, and the San Tomas Expressway to the south.
Also included is the triangular area at the western edge of the site bounded by Kennedy
Avenue and Industrial Street and the Vasona Light Rail Line.
The SOCA, also located within the City’s PDA, is transitioning from a mixture of
residential uses and small industrial uses to a commercial/residential mixed-use area that
supports and complements Downtown Campbell.                  The General Plan supports
revitalization of the area and the addition of new higher density residential uses to
provide additional housing opportunities in close proximity to Downtown, the Los Gatos
Creek Trail and along the Vasona Light Rail Corridor. The objective for SOCA is to
revitalize Downtown commercial and recreational areas and provide housing
opportunities closer to services. The intention of the plan is to transition industrial uses
to cleaner, non-offensive uses. Any use in the SOCA area that emits dust, fumes, glare,
heat, noise, odor, variations or other disturbances is prohibited from the SOCA area. The
SOCA plan can be found in Appendix A of this General Plan.
San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan (STANP)
The San Tomas Area consists of 1.5 square miles located in the southwest corner of the
City. The San Tomas Area is bordered by Winchester Boulevard and the San Tomas
Expressway to the east, San Tomas Aquino Creek and the City Limit’s to the north, and
the City Limit to the west and south.
Most of the San Tomas Area developed in the 1940s and 1950s and was incorporated into
the City of Campbell in the 1980s. It retains a semi-rural, country character with various
                                         __________
                                           LUT-34

sized lots and neighborhoods that have varying or no streetscape improvements (street
lights, curbs, gutters and sidewalks). The STANP establishes specific policies to preserve
the unique character of the San Tomas Area and serves as a resource guide for building or
remodeling in the San Tomas Area. The STANP clearly defines the streets that are to
receive improvements and which streets remain without. The STANP can be found in
Appendix A of this General Plan.
Campbell Redevelopment Area
The Central Campbell Redevelopment Project Area was created in 1983. The Area
encompasses 360 acres in and around Downtown Campbell and the McGlincey Lane
area. The major purpose of the Project Area is to eliminate blight and to revitalize the
central core of the City. Specific goals include restoring Downtown Campbell to its
historic role as the symbolic, cultural, functional, and economic focal point of the city
and to retain the historic character of Downtown through preservation and rehabilitation.
Downtown
Downtown Campbell, known sometimes as “Historic Downtown Campbell,” has
traditionally been centered on East Campbell Avenue in the area between Winchester
Boulevard and the Vasona light rail tracks. Downtown has expanded eastward to include
the rest of Campbell Avenue to the Pruneyard, and west to include the Community
Center.
Downtown Campbell is the historic, cultural, and civic center of the City. It is the
location of numerous community resources and landmarks, including City Hall, Orchard
City Green, the Ainsley House, and Hyde Park. Historically, Downtown provided a full
range of retail and commercial services. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the area declined
in importance and vitality as the City’s retail focus. The loop streets (Civic Center Drive
and Orchard City Drive) were also installed at that time. The City resisted the efforts to
eliminate the small shops and storefronts Downtown in exchange for large shopping
centers that take up the whole Downtown, as was the case in other cities in Santa Clara
Valley. The City was able to retain the historic buildings and development pattern set by
the City’s founders, which preserves the small town connectedness that a traditional
Downtown brings to a community. The objective for Downtown is to have a vibrant
community oriented Downtown that serves as the retail, commercial, cultural and historic
center of the city.
The Downtown Development Plan was prepared to outline and implement a specific
redevelopment program for the Downtown. The Plan contains goals and policies for the
Downtown, addressing land use and development strategies, circulation, parking, urban
design, implementation and funding. The Downtown Development Plan can be found in
Appendix A.
Downtown Neighborhoods
The Downtown residential neighborhoods encompass approximately 100 acres of land
area located north and south of the Downtown loop streets (Civic Center Drive and
Orchard City Drive). The area is bounded by Winchester Boulevard to the west,
Hamilton Avenue to the north and the Union Pacific Railway to the south and east.
                                         __________
                                           LUT-35

Campbell’s traditional commercial Downtown is surrounded by other residential
neighborhoods that reflect a “small town” style and pattern of development reminiscent
of development occurring in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These neighborhoods
provide complementary development patterns and styles that are consistent with the
desired character of the Downtown commercial area.
The “small town” character of Downtown Campbell can be maintained by encouraging
the preservation of important historical resources, promoting the improvement of
important historical resources, promoting the improvement of existing properties
(residential and commercial) and encouraging new development compatible in scale with
the highest standards of traditional Downtown development.
It is anticipated that the City will prepare a Downtown Neighborhood Plan including
design guidelines to help guide development. In addition to a Downtown Neighborhood
Plan, the Downtown Neighborhood will be studied for the possibility of identifying and
designating areas within the Neighborhood as Historic Districts or Conservation Areas,
where appropriate.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND STRATEGIES
The General Plan acknowledges a regional context for local decisions; how local
decisions affect regional facilities and how continued regional growth affects the City’s
plans for the future. Within its borders, the City has the ability to execute policies and
strategies. But Campbell is one of many cities in the region. The City is limited in its
ability to influence travel demand that is generated outside of the City limits. Regional
agencies are advocating and establishing procedures to foster consistent land use and
transportation policies and prioritize funding for capital projects. City policy needs to
consider and often conform to regional policies in order to qualify for state and federal
funding.
The discussion of city-wide issues in this plan concentrates on characteristics that help
define Campbell and addresses the specific needs of Campbell. The Goals, Policies and
Strategies in the Land Use and Transportation Element concentrate on how the City can
provide and ensure coordinated land use and transportation planning in the region, while
still promoting a balanced and functional circulation system that satisfies the needs of all
users including bicyclists, pedestrians, transit users and persons with disabilities. This
section includes strategies for enhancing the City’s image by reinforcing positive
neighborhood design elements, enhancing neighborhood and district gateways,
strengthening the city’s streetscape, preserving historic and cultural resources and
promoting good building and site design, as well as its functionality by improving all
modes of transportation options.

Open Space, Parks and Public
Facilities
Open space, parks and public facilities in the City provide opportunities for a wide
variety of active and passive recreation, organized activities and classes, education public
services and social gatherings. A broad range of open space, park land and public
facilities exist in Campbell — ranging from the Orchard City Green in the Downtown to
the Los Gatos Regional Creek Trail that runs through the entire City.
The Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element of the General Plan includes goals,
policies and strategies relating to regional and local open space, parks and public
facilities. This Element meets the State requirement for the Open Space Element and
serves to guide the comprehensive and long-range conservation of open space land. This
Element also sets forth one optional element – the Public Facilities Element.
Open Space land is defined by State Law as any parcel or area of land or water which is
essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space use and is also designated in a
local, regional or State plan as open space for statutorily recognized open space purposes.
The terms essentially unimproved are not defined by State law. For the purposes of this
Element of the General Plan, essentially unimproved land includes outdoor park and
recreation facilities, school grounds, outdoor athletic facilities, trails and other amenities
intended to enhance the use and enjoyment of outdoor resources. Within the City of
Campbell, open space land consists primarily of City and Santa Clara County parks and
recreation facilities, school recreation facilities (i.e. sports fields), regional groundwater
recharge facilities and creek corridors.
This Element emphasizes the provision of adequate open space, parks and public
facilities and services to meet the needs of the residents of Campbell. Parks, schools and
other public facilities play an integral part in creating a sense of community.
The City seeks to provide high-quality public services and facilities to its residents,
businesses and visitors in a manner that maintains the small town character of Campbell.
The City also strives to work effectively with other regional service providers and will
continually look for opportunities to improve efficiency.
OVERVIEW
The Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element goals, policies and strategies serve
to help achieve the community vision and community goals that were identified by the
Campbell community through the Strategic Planning process. These goals are included in
the Introduction.
Open space, parks and public facilities in Campbell that are safe, clean and comfortable
will attract residents of all ages and become places that they will want to visit and use
regularly. The City’s open space, parks and public facilities, especially multi-use
pathways and trails, are major contributors to the physical connection of Campbell and
provide linkages between residences, schools and commercial and employment centers.
They are a focal point for community involvement and are well-known landmarks that
                                             OSP-1

Campbell General Plan
provide a sense of community identity and pride. These parks and facilities increase the
attractiveness of the City’s residential neighborhoods and business districts with their
well-maintained landscaping, modern play equipment and recreation facilities and
comfortable outdoor furniture. These facilities contribute to the City’s friendly, small
town atmosphere by providing a destination where local residents can meet, visit and
enjoy a wide variety of activities together. They are an important part of what makes
Campbell a desirable place to live or work.
The Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element seeks to provide a variety of open
space land in the City including public, private, passive and active open space. When
implemented, the Element will accomplish the following objectives:
        • Strive to provide three acres of open space, park land and recreational
            facilities and one acre of school open space and recreational facilities per
            1,000 residents in the City;
        • Strive to provide open space, parks, or recreation facilities within comfortable
            walking distance (one-half mile) of all City residents;
        • Maintain and modernize existing open space, parks and public facilities;
        • Offer a wide variety of Recreation and Community Service programs;
        • Require ample open space and recreational areas within all types of residential
            developments;
        • Provide substantial landscaped pathways and medians along major streets;
        • Provide adequate well-maintained and efficient community facilities,
            including libraries and schools;
        • Provide high-quality public services to residents and businesses; and,
        • Provide properly functioning and efficient sewer and wastewater treatment
            facilities and storm drainage systems.
This Element maintains the existing standard of three acres of open space, park land and
recreational facilities and one acre of school open space and recreational facilities for
every 1,000 residents that was set in the 1990 Open Space Element. The City will also
strive to provide open space, parks and recreational facilities with one-half mile of all
residents. This provision is made with the recognition that the City’s ability to provide
these facilities may be limited since the City is largely built out and has only small
pockets of vacant or underutilized land. In some neighborhoods, there are no practical
and affordable options to acquire new open space or parks or recreational facilities;
however, the City will explore opportunities for acquiring new open space, parks or
recreational facilities as opportunities arise. Several of the strategies contained in this
element originated from the Open Space Implementation Plan, which was adopted in
December 1993. These strategies constitute an “action program” of specific techniques
the City intends to use in implementing its open space element. The Open Space Special
Zoning is one of the main tools to do this.
Given the limitation for acquisition of new parkland, this Element places a high
importance on the maintenance, modernization and renovation of existing open space,
park and recreation facilities to ensure that they are efficiently utilized and keep pace
with the evolving recreational demands of the community. The City will focus on
                                           OSP-2

                                           Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element
improving existing unimproved open space lands within the City, such as the Santa Clara
Valley Water District Groundwater Recharge Facilities. If improved and fully accessible,
these facilities would complement the City’s open space, park and recreation resources
by providing unique amenities and special facilities. This Element includes policies to
increase regional coordination of park and open space improvements and renovations,
establish joint use agreements with regional agencies to open public access to existing
closed-access facilities and prioritize acquisition of surplus agency land if it becomes
available.
OPEN SPACE, PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
Open Space, Park Land and Recreation Facilities Inventory
Campbell currently contains over 250 total acres of fully accessible usable open space,
parks and recreation facilities which includes City parks and special facilities, the County
park and trail, Campbell Union School District facilities, one Santa Clara Valley Water
District groundwater recharge facility that is improved and open to the public and one
private open space area that provided a credit towards the City’s park impact fee and
dedication requirement. In this section, regional open space land, park land and recreation
facilities are discussed first, City lands and facilities are discussed second, school open
space and recreation facilities are discussed third and the distribution of lands and
facilities within the City’s Neighborhoods is discussed last.
Regional Open Spaces, Parks and Recreation Facilities
County Park Lands
The City of Campbell is fortunate to have both a Santa Clara County Park and a multiple-
use County Creek Trail within its boundaries. The County regional park and trail includes
a total of 53.8 acres in the City, of which 52.8 acres is usable open space, as shown in
Table OSP-1. The Los Gatos Creek County Park is a ten-acre park. Casting ponds within
the park are available for fly and plug casting. This park is currently in need of
renovations and the City has set aside funding in its current CIP for a Park Master Plan
that will be jointly prepared by the City and Santa Clara County.
A second unique County resource in Campbell is the Los Gatos Creek Trail. The
multiple-use trail, which totals fourteen miles in length and runs through three cities, is an
important link in the regional trail and park system. The trail stretches over three miles
through Campbell. This trail attracts a large number of pedestrians, hikers, bicyclists and
nature lovers. It connects to the 151-acre Vasona County Park in Los Gatos to the south
and extends northward to Leigh Avenue in San Jose. In the future, the trail will extend to
the Guadalupe River Park in downtown San Jose and will eventually link with the San
Francisco Bay Trail. This trail is an excellent example of interagency cooperation and
planning.
Santa Clara Valley Water District Groundwater Recharge Facilities
Six Santa Clara Valley Water District groundwater recharge facilities are also located in
the City. These areas are shown in Figure OSP-1: Regional Open Space, Parks and
Recreational Facilities. The Santa Clara Valley Water District owns and maintains 122.4
acres of groundwater recharge facilities located within the City. Water held in the
                                            OSP-3

groundwater recharge ponds seeps or “percolates” through the earth’s layers under it
reaches underground aquifers. Although the facility adjacent to the Los Gatos County
Creek Trail is open for public use, the other five groundwater recharge facilities in the
City are not currently available for public use or access. The City has set aside over
$280,000 in its current CIP for the improvement of the Hacienda Avenue Recharge
Facility in 2003 that will add landscaping around the ponds, create a “demonstration
pond” and provide pedestrian access from the adjoining residential neighborhoods to the
southern pond through a joint use agreement. The City recently completed on the
construction of a path around one of the ponds at the McGlincey Groundwater Recharge
Facility adjacent to the new Edith Morley Park.

Santa Clara County Open Space Authority
In 1993, Campbell joined the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority (SCCOSA). The
SCCOSA consists of seven elected Directors and a fifteen-member Citizens Advisory
Committee. The Authority encompasses all areas in Santa Clara County except those that
                                                  OSP-4

                                        Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element
are currently within the jurisdiction of the Mid-Peninsula Open Space District. The
Authority has the power to acquire property and create assessment districts to fund the
acquisition of and development of support facilities at open space property. Funding for
the Authority is derived from a benefit assessment district on property within the
Authority’s boundaries. A portion of the assessment revenues is reserved for use by
participating jurisdictions to supplement their open space acquisition and development
efforts. The City may apply for the use of these funds for specific open space projects in
the City.
City Facilities
The City owns and maintains a variety of open space, parks and recreation facilities.
Parks provide facilities for athletic, community and social events and are valuable
community resources that are used regularly by residents. These facilities include athletic
fields, basketball courts, play equipment, tot lots, water play features, horseshoe pits,
BBQ grills and picnic areas which can accommodate groups up to 150 people. In 1985,
the City purchased the Campbell High School and rehabilitated it into the 165,000
square-foot Campbell Community Center, which contains several recreational facilities,
including a gymnasium, pool, the Campbell Adult Center, a weight room and cardio
center, meeting rooms, locker rooms and showers, athletic fields and a track. These parks
and facilities are shown in Figure OSP-2: City of Campbell Open Space, Parks and
Recreational Facilities.

                                           Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element
The City recently completed major renovations to Virginia, John Morgan and Campbell
Parks that were specified in the current Park Improvement Implementation Plan. A
variety of new amenities for all ages were installed at these parks, including new play
areas and equipment, swings,
safety fencing, benches, lit
basketball courts, wider paths,
grass volleyball areas and water
play areas. Landscaping was also
replaced or added at the parks.
The City’s newest park is Edith
Morley Park, a four-acre park
near the Campbell Technology
Park off McGlincey Lane. The
park includes a community
garden with 39 plots, native plant
and wildflower areas, picnic
tables, water features and
pathways. The park is adjacent to
2.2 acres of groundwater
recharge ponds and public access
is provided through a joint use agreement with the Water District.
Park Types
The City's parks, open space and recreation facilities include several types of parks and
recreation facilities. The Campbell Municipal Code defines a park as any land held by a
public entity, which is open to the public for recreation activities. The types of parks
include:
        • Community Parks. Community Parks are designed and maintained to serve the
            entire community. Amenities may include sports facilities, including
            basketball courts, ball fields, swimming pools, recreation buildings and other
            special use facilities. Additional amenities may include meeting rooms,
            gymnasiums, locker rooms and group picnic areas.
        • Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are intended primarily to serve a
            small portion of the City and are usually within a comfortable walking and
            biking distance from residences. They may contain amenities such as children
            playgrounds, picnic facilities, natural/landscaped areas and multi-use open
            fields.
        • Passive Parks. Passive Parks are small play areas and landscaped open spaces
            less than an acre in size. They are designed to provide recreation and aesthetic
            benefit, primarily in areas of high population density or commercial areas with
            high pedestrian use. Amenities may include children's playgrounds, plazas,
            turf, picnic areas, benches and special features.

Recreation and Community Services
The Campbell Recreation and Community Services Department provides and facilitates a
variety of activities and programs which serve the needs of the City’s residents and
employees. Programs for youth include summer day and sports camp programs, dance,
sailing, tennis, ice skating, gymnastics and martial arts instruction and special facilities
such as the Temporary Skatepark Facility. Adult programs also include organized sports
leagues, as well as fitness and dance instruction and health, wellness and computer
classes. Mature adults may participate in a variety of arts, exercise and group activities at
the Campbell Adult Center.
School Open Space and Recreation Facilities
The Campbell Union School District (CUSD) owns and maintains seven schools within
the City limits. The Moreland School District owns one school in the City limits,
Coventry School, which is currently closed and leased to a private school. One of the
CUSD’s schools, Dover, is also currently closed and leased to several private schools.
In December 1999, the City Council approved the Facilities Improvement and Joint Use
Agreement with the Campbell Union School District. This Agreement covers eight
schools- Castlemont, Rosemary, Dover, Hazelwood, Capri, Forest Hill, Campbell Middle
and Rolling Hills Middle – but Castlemont School is not located within the City limits.
The seven sites within the City contain a total of 88 acres, of which approximately 51
acres is usable open space – consisting of playing fields, ball courts, playgrounds and
miscellaneous facilities that are available for use by youth sports groups and the public
through the Facilities Improvement and Joint Use Agreement. This Agreement provides
access to valuable resources that complement the City’s neighborhood parks and
recreational facilities. Local recreational leagues using school facilities include Campbell
Little League, Campbell Bobby Sox and West Valley Soccer Club. See Figure OSP-3:
School Open Space, Recreation Facilities and District Boundaries for the location of
these sites.
The City has agreed to pay the District for improvements, including field improvements
at Dover, Hazelwood and Castlemont and construction of a new rest room facility at
Rosemary. Other improvements and renovations will be completed depending on
availability of funds. The District will pay all costs of maintenance, operation and repair
of improved facilities. The agreement has a five-year term, which is renewable for
additional (unlimited) five-year terms upon mutual agreement. The City Recreation and
Community Services Department has agreed to coordinate and monitor reserved
community use of the District facilities.
Although school populations are currently increasing, it is possible that the Campbell
Union or the Moreland School Districts may consider disposing of more surplus school
sites in the future. The Naylor Act (Education Code § 17485- 17500) requires school
districts to first offer to sell or lease surplus school property that consists of land which is
used for school playground, playing fields, or other outdoor recreation purposes or open
space land particularly suited for recreational purposes. This area must not exceed 30
percent of the total surplus school acreage and there must be no other available publicly
owned land in the vicinity of the school site that is adequate to meet the existing and

sold to the City at a price that may be below the fair market value of the land. Although
the exact percentage below the market rate may vary from site to site, the purchase cost
must be at least 25 percent of the fair market value of the land.

Privately Owned Open Space and Recreation Facilities
Privately owned open space supplements other park and recreation facilities in the City;
however, access is usually limited to residents of the development or private members.
These facilities include small tot lots in large residential developments and apartment
complexes, swimming pools, cabana swim clubs, church playground facilities and
outdoor eating areas. Two of the City’s privately owned open space and recreation
facilities are included in Table OSP-4; however, specific area calculations are not
available for most resources. New residential projects may be eligible for up to a 50
percent credit off the park impact fees if they include specific types of on-site park
amenities that will meet the needs of future residents. These amenities must cover at least
an acre and are thus only likely to be included in large projects. Smaller projects may
include smaller open space areas but will not be eligible for credit towards required park
impact fees.

Distribution of Parks and Open Space in City Neighborhoods
Ideally, all residents of Campbell should have access to a park facility within a
reasonable walking distance of their residence. The City’s policy is to strive to provide a
park or school open space and recreational facility within a one-half mile (a 10-15 minute
walk) of all residents. The current half-mile radii around the City’s usable open space,
parks and recreation facilities are shown in Figure OSP-4. Parks and schools located
outside the City limits are shown on the Diagram since residents who live close to these
publicly-accessible facilities use them.
As Table OSP-5 shows, several neighborhoods have a need for additional open space,
parks and recreation facilities. However, some facilities are close to neighborhood
boundaries and are used by residents in adjoining neighborhoods. This table should be
compared to Figure OSP-4 to determine the areas of greatest need for additional parks or
recreation facilities.

Open Space, Parks and Recreation Facilities Standard
Existing Acreage Per 1,000 Residents
The adequacy of existing open space, parks and recreation facilities can be measured
through a service standard that specifies the usable park or school open space acreage
required to serve a given number of residents. City and County-owned usable open space,
parks and recreation facilities and Campbell Union School District usable open space
total 3.93 acres per 1,000 residents, as shown in Table OSP-6. Only these types of open
space, parks and recreation facilities are included in calculating the ratio per 1,000
residents; public facilities that are not publicly-accessible are excluded. In addition,
private open space that was given credit towards the Park Impact Fee and Subdivision
Dedication Requirement is included.
Table OSP-6 also shows the ratio of improved and unimproved usable open space which
totals 6.29 acres per 1,000 residents. This ratio is a significant increase over the ratio of
improved usable open space since it includes the 89.7-acre SCVWD groundwater
recharge facility that is adjacent to the Los Gatos County Creek Trail.

Campbell General Plan
Although there are no State standards for parks, the Quimby Act (Government Code §
66477) allows local jurisdictions to establish standards, at a maximum of three (3) acres
per 1,000 residents and to require residential subdivisions to provide land or in-lieu fees
for developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood and community parks of the
City, county, or local public agency or recreation facilities to serve the subdivision.
The City has set the open space standard at three acres of open space, park land and
recreational facilities and one acre of school open space and recreational facilities for
every 1,000 residents.

                                                Open Space, Parks and Public Facilities Element
Under the Quimby Act (Government Code § 66477), the City of Campbell currently
requires all new residential subdivisions to dedicate land or pay an in-lieu fee for the
acquisition of new park facilities. However, the Quimby Act does not authorize charging
such fees to developments which do not require a subdivision. In 1990, the City Council
adopted a Park Impact Fees and Park Land Dedication Developments Ordinance,
establishing a supplemental development fee that is assessed at a standard of four acres
per one thousand persons and is required for approval of residential development projects
that do not require a subdivision.
The need for additional open space, park land and recreation facilities is projected to be
14 acres at build-out with the projected buildout population of 41,946, as shown in Table
OSP-7.

    units at buildout and assuming 2.38 persons per household at buildout. This is the total population
    based on 100 percent occupancy of housing units, which is the method used to assess in-lieu fee or
    land dedication requirements under the Quimby Act.
2.  Includes the improved usable open space acreage at City Parks, County Parks and Canyon Creek
    (since it was partial credit towards the Park Impact Fee and Park Land Dedication Requirement for
    the development project).
1990 OPEN SPACE ELEMENT AND CURRENT PLANS
The City’s 1990 Open Space Element lead to the adoption of an Open Space Element
Implementation Plan and a Park Improvement Implementation Plan and the amendment
of the Park Impact Fees and Park Land Dedication Subdivisions Ordinance and the
adoption of a Park Impact Fees and Park Land Dedication Developments Ordinance to
secure additional funding for the acquisition and renovation of open space, park land and
recreation facilities.
Open Space Implementation Plan
In 1993, The City adopted the Final Open Space Implementation Plan. This Plan
identified an implementation strategy that prioritized the use of the Naylor Act and
cooperative agreements with other public agencies and the initiation of discussions with
the school districts and the Santa Clara Valley Water District for the joint use of their
property. The Plan also directed preparation of a Surplus School Site Plan, which covered
the San Tomas School (developed into Jack Fisher Park) and the Coventry School (now
leased to a private school) sites.

Campbell General Plan
Park Improvement Implementation Plan
The City adopted a Park Improvement Implementation Plan in 1997. This Plan included
the funding sources and renovation concepts for John D. Morgan, Campbell and Virginia
Parks.
Park and Open Space Funding
The costs for acquiring, developing and maintaining neighborhood and community parks
increase every year. Specific cost estimates are not included herein since they would be
outdated within a short period after adoption of the General Plan. The main source of
funding for the acquisition and development of park and open space facilities is the Park
Impact Fee Fund. The Fund grows in proportion to the amount of residential subdivisions
and development in the City.
The City may consider a number of funding mechanisms to supplement the Park Impact
Fee funds. These include:
        • Redevelopment Tax Increment Funds for open space, parks and recreation
            facilities within the redevelopment project area;
        • General Fund monies;
        • Recreation Facilities User Fees;
        • General obligation bonds;
        • Capital Improvement Funds; and
        • Special taxes.
Purchase of surplus school sites through the Naylor Act can significantly reduce the cost
of acquiring additional park and recreation land. The park costs can further be reduced by
continuing the Facilities Improvement and Joint Use Agreement with the Campbell
Union School District and by contributing to joint development projects with other
agencies.
The Lighting and Landscape District funds are currently used to finance street lighting,
sidewalks and ground maintenance and may also be used to finance expansion of existing
parks and the creation of new parks.
In the existing Capital Improvement Plan, three million dollars in Park Impact Fees and
$434,000 from the Winchester Drive-In Proceeds are set aside for park acquisition and
development for the seven-year period between 2000 and 2007.

Non-City Funds
Campbell has been able to obtain State grant and bond money in the past to pay for park
and open space projects. The Santa Clara County Open Space Authority has a 20 percent
funding program for urban park projects that may include land acquisition, site
development and/ or restoration and related direct capital costs. While it is difficult to
predict when those funds will be available, the City should continue to pursue such
sources when possible.
PUBLIC FACILITIES
City Hall
The Campbell City Hall is located in the downtown of the City near the Orchard City
Green and Library. City Hall houses all the City departments, including the Police
Department.
Special Facilities
The City, with the assistance of the Friends of the Heritage Theatre, plans to restore the
Heritage Theater in the Community Center complex to provide a facility for local cultural
events and productions. The restoration project is expected to cost approximately 8.5
million dollars. Once restored, the Theatre will fulfill a critical need for performance
space in the region.
The City’s Historical Museum and Ainsley House provide interpretive programs and

SEWER, STORM DRAINAGE AND WASTEWATER
The West Valley Sanitation District provides sanitary sewer collection services to
approximately 110,000 persons residing in Campbell, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga
and portions of the County. The District sewer collection system consists of 494 miles of
pipeline, most of which lie beneath public rights-of-way. The system includes 315 miles
of main and trunk sewers and 179 miles of sewer laterals, with about 100 miles of sewer
pipelines in Campbell. More than half the connections in Campbell are single-family
residences and about five percent are commercial and industrial properties. The type of
sewer connection by jurisdiction are included in Table OSP-9: Sewer Connection
Distribution by Jurisdiction.

The Sanitation District contracts with the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control
Plant for wastewater treatment and disposal. Located in north San Jose, the plant treats
wastewater from local municipalities and sanitation districts and discharges the treated
wastewater into San Francisco Bay. The Sanitation District accounts for about 10 percent
of plant treatment capacity. The District’s current allocation is 13 million gallons per day.
Wastewater measurement in fiscal year 1998-99 showed the District flow to the plant at
10.5 million gallons per day, of which Campbell is estimated to contribute about three
million gallons per day. Because only 1,600 housing units are projected to be added at
buildout, sufficient capacity exists in the collection pipeline system and wastewater

treatment plant to ensure continued adequate sewerage services to Campbell for the
foreseeable future.
The District initiated a Septic System Abandonment Program to encourage property
owners in the urbanized areas of the district to abandon their septic systems and connect
to the public sewers. Under this program, the District designs and constructs the main and
lateral sewers in neighborhoods where residents have expressed interest in obtaining
public sewer service. The District also offers ten-year financing to property owners who
connect to sewers which have already been installed. This program is beneficial to many
City residents who use septic systems.
Storm Drainage
The City operates and maintains a storm water drainage system and coordinates with
surrounding jurisdictions and Santa Clara County to provide regional storm drainage for
the Santa Clara Valley area. Drainage improvements are planned to enable additional
development while preventing flooding. The drainage system consists of a series of inlets
and pipes that channel storm runoff to various percolation ponds and Los Gatos and San
Tomas Aquino creeks, which discharge into San Francisco Bay. Some of the City’s storm
drain system currently discharges into several groundwater recharge facilities; however,
the City is working to reroute this discharge into the creeks.
As Campbell is almost built-out, runoff pollution is a significant concern, especially since
samples taken from the South San Francisco Bay in 1997 identified copper, nickel,
mercury, silver and selenium as “pollutant metals of concern.” Since the City has few
undeveloped areas where storm water can percolate into the ground, a large amount of
storm runoff can occur. Runoff may contain pollutants including heavy metals, oil and
grease, automobile discharge, household chemicals, pesticides and fertilizers.
In 1997, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, Santa Clara County and its 13 cities
produced an Urban Runoff Management Plan establishing measures to reduce runoff
pollution. Implementation of the plan is expected to reduce significantly the volume of
runoff pollutants and hazardous materials entering local watercourses.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
During and following heavy rains, materials discharged into a storm drain are carried
directly to surface and ocean water. Because of the adverse effect of these discharges, the
Clean Water Act requires that communities and industries obtain National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits to discharge storm water to urban storm
sewer systems. The EPA also requires permits for storm water runoff from eleven
different categories of industrial activities. These industrial activities include certain
manufacturing facilities, wastewater treatment plants, hazardous waste treatment plants,
hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities and construction activities
where there is a land disturbance of five acres or more.
The City is required under the Clean Water Act to obtain a NPDES municipal stormwater
permit. Campbell’s municipal stormwater permit is shared with the 13 cities of Santa
Clara Valley, the County of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara Valley Water District who
have joined together to create the Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention
Program. The overarching purpose of the program is to protect the beneficial uses of
                                          OSP-27

Campbell General Plan
watersheds of the Santa Clara Valley and the South Bay, with an emphasis on pollution
prevention and integrated watershed management. This program includes pollution
control measure activities which reduce or eliminate pollutants in storm water to the
maximum extent practicable. The keystone of this program is the Storm Water
Management Plan. This Plan was first developed in 1991 and is updated every five years.
It focuses on desired results, such as reductions in specific priority pollutants and heavy
metal concentrations in the Valley’s streams and loadings to the South Bay as well as
initiation of a comprehensive watershed management approach to pollutant reduction and
resource protection.

Health and Safety
The Health and Safety Element identifies methods and resources for minimizing death,
injury, property and environmental damage and economic and social disturbance
resulting from natural and human-induced hazards. State law requires the Health and
Safety Element to focus on fire, safety, flooding and seismic and geologic hazards. In
addition to the State requirements, this Health and Safety Element also addresses police
and fire services, aircraft overflight and hazardous materials and waste.
The City’s role in ensuring public safety involves both daily operations and emergency
preparedness. Tailoring public services to community needs is important to maintaining a
high quality of life for Campbell residents. For example, because the presence of police
officers in neighborhoods is vital to instilling a feeling of safety, the City controls and
manages that service directly, while fire services are more efficiently provided by
contract with Santa Clara County Fire Department.
Disaster preparation requires considering how potential hazards may be exacerbated by
human alteration of the natural environment. Natural hazards that may affect the City
include earthquakes and floods; human-induced hazards include fire, hazardous material
storage and dam failure. Many health and safety risks associated with development can
be avoided through the recognition of potential hazards and the application of appropriate
mitigation measures. Implementing the goals and policies in this Element will help
prepare the residents and workers in Campbell for potential catastrophes and allow the
City to develop in ways that minimize public exposure to hazards.
In anticipation of both minor and major potential emergencies, the City conducts
emergency preparation educational programs, drills and volunteer training. The City
staffs and trains public safety officers to respond to potential emergencies and coordinate
with neighboring cities, Santa Clara County and other agencies. The City works to ensure
that recovery programs will run smoothly in the event of a disaster. These efforts include
risk assessment and maintenance of critical facilities.
To minimize the impacts of hazards, City development regulations require structures to
be built to withstand potential earthquakes, fires and/or flooding. The City strives to
minimize public exposure to hazardous materials through strict regulation of local
industries that utilize, store and transport such material. The City also provides public
information regarding household hazardous waste and collection services.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Campbell has adopted an Emergency Plan to help manage the local response to
emergencies that could affect the City, in accordance with Government Code Section
8607, which aims to establish a uniform framework of emergency preparation and
response Statewide. The primary goal of the Emergency Plan is to guide local decision-
makers and emergency personnel in handling emergencies in Campbell, consistent with
the State requirements and in coordination with other State and local agencies and plans.
The Plan emphasizes preparedness in advance of emergencies and development of
appropriate and timely responses to emergencies when they occur. The Emergency Plan:
                                             HS-1

Campbell General Plan
         Establishes a framework for organizing and managing emergency response;
         Provides policies, responsibilities and procedures to protect persons, property
            and the environment; and,
         Sets forth concepts and procedures for field response, Emergency Operations
            Center activities and disaster recovery.
The Plan distinguishes three levels of emergencies:
Level I     A minor incident that can be handled by available local agencies and
            resources.
Level II A moderate-to-severe emergency that may require regional or Statewide
            mutual aid to supplement local resources. A Local Emergency proclamation is
            likely and a State of Emergency may be proclaimed.
Level III A major disaster in which local resources are overwhelmed and extensive
            State and/or federal assistance is required. Local Emergency and State of
            Emergency proclamations are likely and a Presidential Declaration of
            Emergency or Major Disaster may be requested.
The range of risks addressed by the Emergency Plan include (but are not limited to) civil
disorder, dam failure, earthquake, fire, flood, hazardous materials spill, large scale (multi-
casualty) traffic accidents, severe weather and terrorism. For each of these hazards, the
Plan assigns potential risk (high, medium or low) and severity, along with the appropriate
level of response. The Plan also contains a mutual aid agreement that establishes
responsibilities at the operational (local), regional and State levels.
Roadways identified for evacuation routes include Hamilton Avenue, Bascom Avenue,
Winchester Boulevard, Campbell Avenue, Highway 17 and the San Tomas Expressway.
These streets have been identified as potential evacuation routes as they have been
identified as routes for emergency vehicle signal preemption or are part of the "Silicon
Valley Smart Corridor Project," a cooperative effort of 10 local agencies to address
recurring and incident related congestion on the Highway 17/Interstate 880 Corridor.
These routes are designated because they would allow for the greatest amount of
vehicular traffic. They will be evaluated as needed, and modified if they are found to be
deficient. The approval authority for the designation of these routes the City’s Director
of Emergency Services. In an event that these routes are closed or impacted by the
subject disaster, the Director of Emergency Services or an on-scene Incident Commander
have the authority of designate new evacuation routes to bypass the closed roadways.
The Santa Clara County Fire Department, the Santa Clara County Emergency Medical
Services Agency, as well as other emergency services organizations will be notified of
these evacuation routes via operable telecommunications systems. Police officers will
also post the routes at the time of evacuation to ensure that they are visible to the public.
In September 2000, the City and the San Jose State University Foundation entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding regarding a collaboration for disaster mitigation. This
collaboration, which also includes the cities of San Jose and Sunnyvale, the Santa Clara
County Emergency Preparedness Council, businesses and other non-profit organizations,
aims to reduce the effects of and improve the economic recovery from natural disasters
through more practical prevention efforts and more integrated responses. The
                                              HS-2

                                                                 Health and Safety Element
Collaborative will complete essential tasks such as assessing the benefits of new
technology in risk reduction and emergency preparedness and recovery, providing
professional development and training and developing cost-effective plans to reduce the
effects of disaster.
Critical Facilities
Critical facilities provide emergency assistance after a major disaster. They include police
and fire stations, schools, hospitals and evacuation routes. The Campbell Emergency
Operations Center (EOC) is located at the Civic Center Complex. The City also has a
mobile EOC. Both the EOC and the mobile EOC have the capability to link to the
Statewide agency computer network.
PUBLIC SAFETY
Police
The Campbell Police Department operates from the Main Police Facility at City Hall.
The Police Department also has a Neighborhood Police Center that is used for a public
information center and drop-in point for on-duty police officers. The Department
conducts a variety of policing and education programs, in addition to providing law
enforcement, patrol and investigation services. In the case of a large-scale emergency, the
Department abides by the terms of a mutual aid agreement with surrounding communities
to share police resources.
The Police Department employs 46 officers and 17 administrative employees. The
Department maintains performance standards for response times, attempting to arrive at
emergency scenes within five minutes of dispatch 95 percent of the time and at non-
emergency scenes within 20 minutes of dispatch 90 percent of the time.
Property-related incidents (the majority of reported crime in Campbell) are expected to
increase as population grows, as are vandalism and general gang activity. Locally high
traffic volumes are anticipated to continue to produce frequent citations and accidents.
The Police Department runs the Neighborhood Watch law enforcement program. In
addition, officers that are not responding to service calls patrol Special Enforcement
Areas to address specific community problems. The Department runs a Drug Resistance
Education Program (DARE) at local elementary schools and additional programs for at-
risk youth have been implemented. Officers spend increasingly more time making contact
with the public in shopping centers, parks and neighborhoods not only to enhance
enforcement, but also to engage in proactive information sharing.
The Department employs current communication and information technologies and
operates modern, well-maintained vehicles and equipment. A number of capital
improvements are proposed in the future to help increase efficiency, including extensive
remodeling of facilities.
Fire and Emergency Services
Since 1993, the City has contracted with Santa Clara County Fire Department for fire and
emergency medical services. The Fire Department operates two stations and a training
facility in Campbell, with 20 of its 275 personnel in the City. The distance between these
                                            HS-3
Campbell General Plan
stations and most of the City is less than 1.5 miles, the optimum maximum distance for
emergency response.
In addition to fire protection, the Department undertakes fire prevention and public
education programs, including earthquake preparedness, CPR training and first aid. The
Department responds to vehicle accidents, calls for rescue and hazardous materials
incidents. All engine companies provide paramedic service, attempting to achieve
response times of five minutes or less. The Department also offers hazardous material
and premises inspections for businesses. The City also benefits from the depth of
resources available through County Fire Department’s regional system.
The City presents a wide range of fire risks, including high-rise structures, multi-story
apartment buildings and hazardous materials storage and use. Still, fires comprise an
increasingly smaller portion of Department workload (only about 6%), as older buildings
are replaced with newer, more fire-resistant structures. Fires in grass/brush areas and
single family homes together account for about one-quarter of fire responses. Vehicle
fires are the most common fire type, but emergency medical aid, including at traffic
accidents, comprises the majority of Department calls.
The City helps to minimize fire hazards by regulating building construction and site
planning through the Zoning Ordinance, the California Fire Code and the California
Building Code. Many new businesses and residences have been equipped with fire
sprinklers and detection systems. Annual inspections by the County Fire Department and
the City help ensure compliance with fire protection standards. Water supply for fire
suppression is provided by the San Jose Water Company, which owns and operates the
water distribution system serving the City.
GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
Campbell is subject to the effects of earthquakes due to its location at the tectonic
boundary between the Pacific and North American Plates. The movement of these plates
leads to the accumulation of strain energy in the crustal rocks of the Bay Area. The
release of strain energy by the sudden movement of a fault creates earthquakes. Several
active faults in the Bay Area region create a high likelihood of future seismic events
affecting Campbell. Recognition of the likelihood of these events and preparation for the
potential effects of them is necessary to reduce the potential damage to life and property.
On the basis of research conducted since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the United
States Geological Survey2 (USGS) and other scientists conclude that there is a seventy
percent (±10%) probability of at least one magnitude 6.7 or greater quake, capable of
causing widespread damage, striking the San Francisco Bay Area region before 2030, as
shown in Table HS-1. There is a 21% chance of one magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake
created by the San Andreas Fault before the year 2030 (see Figure HS-3). The probability
of at least one smaller (magnitude 6.0 to 6.7) earthquake in the Bay Area before 2030 is
estimated to be at least eighty percent. Earthquake probabilities are based on balancing
the continual motions of the plates that make up the Earth's outer shell with the slip on
faults, which occurs primarily during earthquakes. To determine Bay Area region

earthquake probabilities, the USGS Working Group gathered new data, developed
analytical tools and debated a wide variety of interpretations about how future
earthquakes may occur.
The San Andreas Fault, the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault and the Calaveras Fault pose
the greatest earthquake threat, because they have high quake odds and run through the
Santa Clara Valley region's urban core. However, there are also smaller faults located
closer to Campbell that also have the potential to cause earthquakes.
The San Andreas Fault zone to the southwest in the Santa Cruz Mountains has been the
source of several large earthquakes in California, including the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. The San Andreas Fault is located just eleven kilometers from the Campbell
City Hall and is a 1997 Uniform Building Code Type A Fault (UBC Table 16-U). The
Maximum Magnitude is 7.9 moment magnitude. The geologic slip rate is 17 (+/- 3) mm
per year. The possible shaking intensity of a moment magnitude 7.2 earthquake on the
Peninsula- Golden Gate segment of the San Andreas Fault is shown in Figure HS-1.

The Hayward-Calaveras fault system to the east in the Diablo Mountain has the potential
to cause earthquakes that could affect Campbell. The possible shaking intensity of a
moment magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the Southern Hayward Fault is shown in Figure
HS-2. This figure projects strong ground shaking within the City of Campbell.
The Shannon-Monte Vista Fault extends through southwestern Campbell, as shown in
Figure HS-4. This fault runs a length of 53 (+/- 5) km and has a Maximum Magnitude of
6.8 moment magnitude. The slip rate is measured at 0.4 (+/- 0.3 mm/year). It is a UBC

The geologic formations in the City of Campbell range in age from Holocene to
Pleistocene. Approximately 85 percent of the City is underlain by Holocene alluvial fan
deposits. These deposits have a low susceptibility to liquefaction. There is a small
occurrence of Pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits in the southwestern portion of the City.
These terraces grade to Pleistocene alluvial fan surfaces. Holocene Fluvial deposits are
located along the narrow channel of the Los Gatos Creek and the percolation basins south
of Camden Avenue. These deposits overlie alluvial sediments of Pliocene to Pleistocene
age and interfinger with alluvial fan and estuarine sediments of Holocene age. They have
a moderate susceptibility to liquefaction and lateral spreading.

These earthquake probabilities place an urgency on the City and all Bay Area
communities to continue preparing for earthquakes. Earthquakes can produce significant
damage over localized areas, particularly if they occur in a heavily urbanized area.
Although earthquakes can inflict damage at to buildings and infrastructure at a
considerable distance, shaking will be very intense near the fault rupture. Less likely
damage results include dam failure and associated flooding.
Within Campbell, earthquake damage to structures can be caused by ground rupture,
near-field effects, liquefaction and ground shaking. Damage associated with ground
rupture is normally confined to roads, buildings and utilities within a narrow band along a
fault. The primary earthquake hazards are groundshaking (acceleration of surface
material) and liquefaction (sudden loss of soil strength due to the upward migration of
groundwater as a result of groundshaking). Liquefaction in Campbell is most likely to
occur in the areas with fine-grained alluvial soils.
Unreinforced masonry buildings are extremely susceptible to groundshaking. The 1989
City Unreinforced Masonry Ordinance established a mitigation program for ten
potentially hazardous buildings identified in the City (see Table HS-3). Engineering
analyses have been conducted on many of these and subsequent structural strengthening
has taken place on one of the buildings (415 E. Campbell Avenue).

Minimizing seismic risk begins with requiring new construction and remodels to
incorporate engineering features to strengthen the building to be able to withstand severe
groundshaking. The next line of defense is proper emergency planning to help minimize
loss of life and property and speed recovery when an earthquake occurs.
The 1990 Seismic Hazards Mapping Act and related regulations establish a Statewide
minimum public safety standard for mitigation of earthquake hazards. This means that
the minimum level of mitigation for a project should reduce the risk of ground failure
during an earthquake to a level that does not cause the collapse of buildings for human
occupancy, but in most cases, not to a level of no ground failure at all. The Seismic
Hazards Mapping Act mandates that the City must regulate certain development projects
within the designated Seismic Hazards Zones and withhold development permits for sites
within the Zones until geologic or soils investigations are conducted and appropriate
mitigation measures are incorporated into development plans.
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act requires the State Geologist to prepare Seismic
Hazard Zone Maps. This Map is currently being developed for the City of Campbell (San
Jose West USGS Quad) using a combination of historic records, field observations and
computer-mapping technology. The Map will identify areas where, prior to retrofitting,
reconstruction, or construction of new structures, the City should take extra precautions
to minimize exposure to potential future strong ground shaking. These precautions
include requiring conduct geologic investigations to identify and mitigate the seismic
hazards prior to development.

FIRE HAZARDS
Campbell may be affected by vehicle, structural and brush fires that can threaten life and
property. Vehicle fires, the most common, tend to occur in conjunction with traffic
accidents. Brush fires may occur due to natural or human causes on vacant lots where
accumulation of weeds has increased the fuel load. Structural fires, most likely in
buildings constructed prior to the advent of modern building codes, comprise an
increasingly smaller percentage fire activity in Campbell because many new buildings are
equipped with fire protection features such as alarm systems and sprinklers.
The Uniform Fire Code identifies fire flow requirements and fire protection systems
based on the type of construction and occupancy and size of the building. The fire flow
for typical office or Research and Development buildings ranges from approximately
2,250 gallons per minute at 20 psi residual pressure to 5,500 gallons per minute at 20 psi
residual pressure. The inclusion of automatic fire sprinkler systems may result in adjusted
fire flow requirements. Fire vehicle access roads are typically required to be paved all
weather surfaces, have a minimum unobstructed width of 20 to 30 feet, a vertical
clearance of at least 13 feet 6 inches and a maximum slope of 15 percent. The current
distribution system should be adequate to meet the water flow requirements in the event
of a multi-structure fire in the City.
The Santa Clara County Fire Department responds to fire and medical emergencies in
communities and unincorporated areas throughout the County. The Department operates
16 fire stations and employs 275 fire personnel, including two stations and 20 employees
in Campbell. All staffed engine companies have Advanced Life Support/Paramedic
capability. Response time within the City is generally five minutes or less. The
Department also conducts a number of fire prevention and public education programs and
conducts periodic inspections to ensure compliance with fire protection standards.
FLOODING
A flood is a temporary increase in water flow that overtops the banks of a river, stream,
or drainage channel to inundate adjacent areas not normally covered by water. Only a
very small portion of Campbell is subject to flooding, as noted on maps issued by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (see Figure HS-6).
Although natural factors such as overgrown brush and trees in creek channels can
obstruct water flow and increase flood damage, development poses the highest potential
to increase the magnitude and frequency of flooding. Campbell is primarily a suburban
community with few undeveloped areas where storm water can percolate into the ground.
Additional paving is expected to further reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff.
Localized flooding may also occur in low spots or where infrastructure is unable to
accommodate peak flows during a storm event. In most cases, localized flooding
dissipates quickly after heavy rain ceases. There are some streets in the San Tomas Area
Neighborhood (see Appendix A), annexed into the City in the 1970s, that have a rural
character with no curb, gutter or paving, which precludes installation of storm drain
facilities. Although some nuisance flooding results, the City anticipates preserving the
rural character of the area.

Campbell General Plan
The City operates and maintains a storm water drainage system and cooperates with
surrounding jurisdictions and Santa Clara County to provide regional storm drainage. The
City drainage system consists of a series of inlets and underground pipes that collect
storm water runoff for conveyance to Los Gatos and San Tomas Aquino creeks, which
drain into San Francisco Bay. The Santa Clara Valley Water District owns and maintains
85 acres of groundwater recharge facilities along Los Gatos Creek within the City that
recharge groundwater basins.
Dam failure could result from earthquake activity. Less catastrophic effects could also
result from a landslide into a relatively full reservoir. Dam failure can cause injury, loss
of life and property damage due to flooding, inundation, erosion, debris and sediment
deposition, disabling of infrastructure and interruption of services. Health hazards from
sewage release may also result. The City lies within the inundation zone for several dams,
as shown in Table HS-4. Failure of one or more of these dams could adversely affect the
City as water spreads out over the valley floor and with the static pressure on structures
from standing water once flow subsides.

AIRCRAFT OVERFLIGHT
Hazards associated with aircraft overflight are principally related to the risk of accident
and to noise levels along primary San Jose International Airport and San Francisco
International Airport paths. These hazards are addressed in each of the Airport’s Master
Plans. Both Master Plans also show noise contours and hazard zones extending north and
south at the end of each runway. During inclement weather, the San Jose and San
Francisco airport flight patterns are shifted over Campbell and increase the risk of aircraft
accidents in the City as well as the amount of aircraft overflight noise. The airport Master
Plans propose to change flight patterns to increase the frequency of overflight in the City.
The City will advocate reducing the amount of overflight.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE
Waste is defined as hazardous if its quantity, concentration, physiochemical or infectious
properties may:
        • Increase mortality or produce irreversible or incapacitating illness, or
        • Pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the
            environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed, or
            otherwise managed.
Some businesses and industrial activities in the City are involved in the transport, storage,
or use of toxic or hazardous materials that pose a potential safety hazard in the event of
unintentional exposure, leak, fire or accident. Some hazardous materials are byproducts
of industrial processes. Residents in Campbell also generate household hazardous wastes
such as waste oil, paint, solvents, cleaners, pesticides and glue.
The City of Campbell participates in the implementation of the 1991 Santa Clara County
Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The Plan establishes the framework for hazardous
waste management efforts, including goals and policies relating to hazardous waste
generation, management, reduction, facilities siting and transport. The overall goal of the
Plan is to protect public health, safety and the environment by reducing the generation of
hazardous waste. The Plan may be updated periodically.
State Assembly Bill 2707 requires each city to characterize and quantify its household
waste stream and develop plans for safe collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of
household hazardous wastes. The 1992 Campbell Household Hazardous Waste Element
seeks to:
        • Provide residents access to convenient household hazardous waste collection
            services;
        • Expand curbside motor oil collection programs to include all single and multi-
            family homes;
        • Minimize disposal of collected wastes through distribution of reusable
            materials and recycling;
        • Improve monitoring and evaluation of household hazardous waste programs;
        • Limit improper disposal of hazardous waste at solid waste landfills by
            continuing State-mandated hazardous waste exclusion programs;
        • Increase efficiency and effectiveness of waste collection services and public
            education by coordinating programs with other jurisdictions and agencies
            whenever feasible;
        • Decrease potential short- and long-term liability risks by monitoring
            environmental compliance records and proof of insurance of contract waste
            haulers and contract treatment, storage and disposal activities; and,
        • Increase source reduction options for residents by supporting legislative
            efforts aimed at promoting development of safer products and safer waste
            management methods.

Conservation                                      and                     Natural
Resources
The Conservation and Natural Resources Element includes goals, policies and strategies
that address the City’s historic resources, biological resources, water resources, waste
management and recycling, noise and air quality. This Element satisfies the State
requirement for both the Conservation and Noise Elements.
The focus of this Element’s goals, policies and strategies is to conserve and enhance the
City’s cultural and natural resources that help define the community. Although regulatory
authority over these resources is shared with several local, State and federal agencies, the
City itself has a significant influence over these resources through its land use and
development policies. Campbell seeks to make a positive contribution to regional
conservation efforts through recycling to extend the life of area landfills, conserving
water, recharging groundwater supplies, improving regional air quality and reducing the
adverse impacts of noise.
The natural ecosystem in Campbell has undergone significant changes during its history
of urbanization. Since virtually the entire City area is urbanized, the protection and
enhancement of the City’s existing natural resources such as trees and creek corridors is
important. Other conservation issues within the City, including minimizing water usage,
improving air quality and promoting source reduction and recycling efforts, are addressed
through the efforts of various federal, State, regional and local government agencies.
These entities work jointly, as well as individually, to improve conservation through
legislation, regulation, planning, policy-making, education and a variety of programs. In
order to fulfill legislative requirements, the City cooperates with regional agencies
including the Santa Clara Valley Water District, the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District and the West Valley Solid Waste Management Board.
With anticipated development and redevelopment, the City will focus on maintaining
efficient service levels for provision of water and solid waste services.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
Campbell has a rich history of farms, orchards, canneries, packing plants and the railroad
that is conveyed to its current citizens through community groups, the Historic
Preservation Board, the Campbell Historical Museum and the Ainsley House. Traditional
events like Early Settler’s Day and the Prunefestival provide chances to convey the
community’s sense of identity and activities like the annual tea and spring clean-up help
instill local residents with pride in their City.
The 1996 Campbell Downtown Development Plan (see Appendix A) aims to restore and
protect the City’s historic character, buildings and landmarks, including the Hyde
Cannery (1887), Farley Building (1895), Grammar School (1922), Water Tower (1928)
and Los Gatos Creek Bridge (1942).
The City’s Historic Preservation Ordinance designates a historic overlay zoning district
for the purpose of identifying, preserving and enhancing structures, natural features, sites
                                             CNR-1

and areas within the City that have historic, architectural, archaeological, cultural and/or
aesthetic significance. The Historic Preservation Board oversees the provisions of the
Historic Preservation Ordinance and recommends measures to implement historic
preservation to the City Council and City commissions.
Currently the Alice Avenue area is the City’s only multi-parcel Historic Overlay District.
The Alice Avenue homes were constructed for fruit canners and packers around the turn
of the century. The City is currently updating its inventory of historic resources, many of
which are single family residences near the historic downtown core. The City may also
consider designating additional Historic Districts. Policies addressing this are included in
the Land Use and Transportation Element.
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Although native vegetation in the City was eliminated decades ago for ranching and
orchards, much of Campbell provides habitat for wildlife species commonly associated
with suburban areas. The riparian vegetation along Los Gatos and San Tomas Aquino
Creeks supports a greater variety of animal wildlife species than the developed area of the
City and they provide a corridor for wildlife movement. The creek corridors provide
habitat for a number of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and introduced fish species. Trees
along these creeks provide cover, feeding and nesting sites for a variety of birds.
There are currently no rare, threatened, endangered or sensitive animals, plants or natural
communities within the City limits, according to the California Department of Fish and
Game’s Natural Diversity Database. However, the absence of any special status species
from this Database does not necessarily mean that there is no chance that they may be
found in the City, only that no occurrence data is currently entered into the Database.
However, since Campbell is a very urbanized environment, it is not likely that there are
any unrecorded species in the City.
Trees
Although historically referred to as the “Orchard City”, Campbell currently contains no
agricultural land. However, the City maintains approximately 1,000 trees on major
arterials and median islands and approximately 9,000 trees on residential streets. These
trees enhance the City’s identity, community image and sense of place by adding a
natural element to the urban environment. The City has been a designated “Tree City
USA” for the past eighteen years, which is a national recognition for the City’s urban and
community forestry programs. This program is sponsored by the National Arbor Day
Foundation in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service and the National Association of
State Foresters. The City met specific standards to attain this designation, which include
the adoption of a Tree Protection Ordinance and the observance and proclamation of an
annual Arbor Day Celebration.
WATER RESOURCES
Protection of water quality and the provision of adequate water resources is critical for
the health and quality of life of Campbell residents and employees. Water quality is a
regional issue that is regulated at the county, State and federal levels.

Water Supply
The regional wholesale supplier of water to the South Bay Area is the Santa Clara Valley
Water District (SCVWD), which derives water from local, recycled and imported
supplies.
Less than half of the District’s water is supplied by local rainfall and groundwater. The
rainwater is stored in ten local reservoirs and some of it is transferred to the District’s
Groundwater Recharge Facilities. The District owns more than 30 groundwater recharge
facilities, six of which are located in Campbell. These facilities percolate both local and
imported water into the groundwater aquifer. The average yearly surface flow that can be
captured and diverted to reservoirs, treatment plants or the groundwater basin is about
101,000 acre-feet per year; natural recharge into the groundwater basin adds another
112,000 acre-feet. During critical dry periods these amounts average only 59,000 acre-
feet and 74,000 acre-feet, respectively.
Four municipal water pollution control plants are located in Santa Clara Valley that
develop recycled water for outdoor irrigation use. Approximately 5,000 acre-feet of
recycled water is currently produced from these plants and used for landscape irrigation
in the County. Approximately 20,000 acre-feet per year of non-potable recycled water
could be developed throughout the County by the year 2020. Currently, the SCVWD
does not supply recycled water to retailers in the City or have any projects or plans for
supplying water to retailers in the City.
Most of the District’s imported water comes to the County from the Sierra Nevada
mountains via the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta. This imported water is delivered by the
State Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project. The Santa Clara Valley Water
District Supply is shown in the table below. Figure CNR-1 shows the District’s supply
map.

Most of the District’s imported water and some local water is delivered to the District’s
three water treatment plants, where it is purified before being delivered to the local water
retailer, the San Jose Water Company (SJWC). The SJWC supplies Campbell with a
blend of water that is primarily from the SCVWD but also from local wells. The SCVWD
water is treated with Chloramine and the well water is chlorinated for effective
disinfection as required by the EPA and State DOHS guidelines. San Jose Water
Company does not add fluoride to its drinking water. However, fluoride does occur
naturally at very low levels (less than 0.2 parts per million) in the water. The SJWC
operates a regional distribution system that supplies water for domestic use and fire
suppression.
Water deliveries from the SJWC to all its customers (including Campbell) have averaged
between 125,000 and 129,000 acre-feet over the past several years; SJWC does not
assign water allocations to individual jurisdictions that it serves. Over 183,00 residential
accounts comprise approximately 60 percent of the SJWC water deliveries, with
businesses comprising an additional 30 percent of SJWC deliveries.

                                              Conservation and Natural Resources Element
Water Conservation
A safe, reliable water supply is essential to the health and well-being of a community.
Although water demand varies with the nature and intensity of land use, population
continues to grow while water supply resources remain relatively constant. Therefore, it
is essential to implement conservation measures to ensure an adequate water supply in
the future.
The SCVWD’s Integrated Water Resources Plan includes measures for residential,
commercial, governmental and industrial water conservation and management. The
District is also permitted to require the installation of water-saving devices, such as low-
flow showerheads or ultra-low-flush toilets and to charge higher fees for higher water
usage. Additional water conservation measures include high-efficiency irrigation
systems, automated controllers, water efficient landscape design, air-cooled drinking
fountains, cooling tower modifications and proper landscape maintenance practices. In
accordance with the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, the City has adopted Water
Efficient Landscaping Guidelines for drought-tolerant landscaping to help minimize
water demand.
The San Jose Water Company provides residential water audits free of charge. Trained
SJWC specialists will check residential sprinkler system, faucets, toilets and other parts
of the water system and suggest repairs or improvements that residents can perform. The
Company provides free water-saving devices such as low-flow shower heads and faucet
aerators to customers. Businesses may also request free large turf water audits and
commercial or industrial water audits.
Water Demand
Many factors that affect water demand are difficult to predict. For example, weather
patterns fluctuate, development and growth patterns vary from projections and
conservation programs save either more or less water then projected. Increased
urbanization in Santa Clara County over the last few decades has resulted in increased
urban and suburban water demand, but decreased agricultural water demand.
The Water District developed the Integrated Water Resources Plan in 1997. The Plan is a
flexible, long-range water supply plan. In forecasting the projected water demand
expected in the County through 2020, the IWRP used a range of demand. This range
allows the District to develop flexible water resource strategies that can be refined over
time in response to actual conditions. The demand range accounted for demographic
changes and water conservation savings. The projected demand for 2020 is between
350,000 acre-feet at the low end and 500,000 acre-feet at the high end. The lower end of
the range is based on 1991 water-use data, which reflect drought and recession-related
behaviors. The higher end is based on pre-drought, pre-recession water use records.
Strategies developed during the IWRP process were designed to meet high-end demand;
the preferred strategy is designed to meet a range of demands up to 500,000 acre-feet.
If Santa Clara County enjoyed only average to wet years from now to the year 2020,
current water supplies could probably meet demand. But droughts are common in
California and it is likely that one will occur during the next twenty years. In future
severe droughts the County could experience a water supply shortfall of up to 100,000
                                           CNR-5

Campbell General Plan
acre-feet, according to District projections. The District has identified strategies to meet
this shortfall, including water banking, non-potable recycling, demand management and
long-term transfers.
Water Recycling
The Integrated Water Resources Plan estimates that the County uses approximately
2,000 acre-feet of recycled water per year for irrigating landscaping and crops. In 1993
the County adopted a policy to encourage development of non-potable recycling projects
to supplement the existing water and replace demand met by Water District supplies.
Water Quality
SJWC tests its water supplies for over 100 different contaminants and prepares an Annual
Quality Report describing the water's compliance with all California and Federal water
quality standards. The SJWC water met all applicable drinking water standards in 1999.
For most standards, there are no detectable contaminants at all - the water is so pure that
the required test apparatus cannot measure any contaminant present in the sample.
Regional Regulation
Point sources of water pollution are regulated through the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. Permits are required for all publicly
operated treatment plants and for specific operations or sites that generate surface-water
runoff in urban areas. The permits specify the discharge limits for certain pollutants and
require specific industries to pre-treat the pollutants that they discharge into treatment
plants.
For the purposes of administering NPDES, the State Water Resources Control Board has
oversight of nine Regional Water Pollution Control Boards located in each of the major
California watersheds. The Boards have primary responsibility for administration,
investigation and enforcement of the state's pollution abatement program. The Boards
may regulate any discharge of wastewaters including process, cleaning, cooling, or other
waters coming from a facility, or other wastes. These include discharges directly to
surface waters, to storm drains, to the ground surface or to groundwater. Campbell is
under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.
The local permits and Storm Water Management Plan are discussed in the Open Space,
Parks and Public Facilities Element.
WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
The City contracts with Green Valley Disposal Company and the Guadalupe Rubbish
Disposal Company for the disposal of municipal solid wastes. Waste Management, the
largest solid waste company in North America, purchased the Green Valley Disposal
Company in the summer of 1999. Waste Management provides collection, transfer,
landfill, recycling and waste-to-energy services to customers throughout the nation. The
Green Valley Disposal Company collects all of the City’s solid wastes and delivers them
to the 115-acre Guadalupe Landfill, which is owned and operated by Guadalupe Rubbish
Disposal Company. The Guadalupe Landfill is a Class III Landfill that accepts only
residential, commercial, industrial and demolition wastes. The Guadalupe Landfill is
expected to reach capacity and close in 2013.

                                              Conservation and Natural Resources Element
Solid Waste
The City’s agreements with Green Valley Disposal Company and Guadalupe Rubbish
Disposal Company for the disposal of municipal solid wastes extend through 2007. When
City wastes were last studied in 1991, about 39 percent came from homes, 22 percent
from businesses and 37 percent from industry.
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 requires cities and counties to
establish a local plan to cut the volume of solid waste disposed to 50 percent by 2000. In
1992, the City adopted a Source Reduction and Recycling Element, which identifies
waste diversion opportunities and programs. In 1999, the City was diverting roughly 41
percent of its solid waste from the landfill. The City is considering additional measures to
meet the mandate, including adoption of a Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling
Ordinance.
City waste diversion measures include source reduction, recycling, composting and yard
waste programs. Source reduction prevents creation of solid waste by diminishing the
amount of a product used and/or by prolonging the useful life of a product. Diversion
through source reduction may reduce landfill disposal by 20 percent.
NOISE
The Noise Element is a required element of the General Plan. Included here as a portion
of the Conservation and Natural Resources Element, it identifies and evaluates noise
problems in Campbell and includes policies to ensure that future land use decisions
minimize adverse noise impacts to the fullest extent possible.
Noise is commonly defined as a sound or series of sounds that are irritating, intrusive and
disruptive to daily activities. Sound becomes unwanted when it interferes with normal
activities, when it causes actual physical harm, or when it has adverse effects on health.
Noise sources occur in two forms: point sources, such as stationary mechanical
equipment, a water recycling plant, or individual motor vehicles; and line sources, such
as roadways with large numbers of point sources (motor vehicles).
Transportation corridors traversing the City are its primary noise sources, especially
Highways 17 and 85 and the San Tomas Expressway. The Land Use and Transportation
Element addresses noise issues in its discussion of land use compatibility. Consistent
with those elements, a goal of the Natural Resources and Conservation Element is to
sustain and improve quality of life in Campbell by minimizing noise impacts in the
community.
Policies and strategies in this Element address existing noise issues and ways of reducing
noise generation associated with new development and redevelopment, which produce
both short-term impacts during construction and long-term operational impacts, such as
traffic. A primary way of reducing the potential for noise impacts is to ensure separation
between noise-sensitive uses, such as residences, schools and churches and noise
generators, such as manufacturing businesses and major transportation corridors.
However since such incompatibilities already exist, measures should be taken to
minimize noise impacts. These include site planning, design and construction methods
that absorb or deflect sound.
                                           CNR-7

Campbell General Plan
Noise levels are reported as measurements over a given period of time in order to account
for variations in noise exposure. Noise levels also account for different degrees of noise
sensitivity during the day and night. The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn) reflect noise exposure over and average day with
weighting to account for the sensitivity to day and night time noise. The CNEL is the
reference level for State noise law and is used to describe noise levels for major
continuous noise sources, such as traffic and aircraft noise. Noise impacts on the existing
and future land uses within the City would primarily occur as a result of traffic volumes
on the adjacent and nearby roadways. The future contours for major roadways within the
City are identified in Table CNR-2 and shown in Figure CNR-2: Traffic-Related Noise
Conditions Under General Plan Buildout.

AIR QUALITY
While air quality is largely a regional issue, local activities and policies and land use
decisions can help protect air quality. The protection of air quality is vital to the overall
health of the environment and residents of Campbell.
Under the federal Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency establishes
national air quality standards for six criteria air pollutants, including ozone, carbon
monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead and particulates finer than 10 microns
(PM-10). The California Air Resources Board has established State ambient air quality
standards that are generally more stringent that the corresponding federal standards. The
EPA classifies air basis as either “attainment” or “nonattainment” for the national
standards. The State also classifies basins with respect to the achievement of State
standards.
The State is divided into 15 air basins. Campbell is located within the southern region of
the San Francisco Bay Area air basin. Air quality in the basin is monitored by the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). The BAAQMD also developed and
administers the 1991 Bay Area Clean Air Plan. This Plan was developed to address the
nonattainment status of the Bay Area with respect to the State ozone standard with the
goal of improving air quality through tighter industry controls, cleaner fuels and
combustion in cars and trucks and increased commute alternatives. The Bay Area Clean
Air Plan has been updated twice, in 1994 and 1997.
Although air quality has improved greatly in California over the last decade, the Bay
Area air basin is still classified as nonattainment for State standards for ozone and
particulate matter and as nonattainment for the national ozone standard. Two monitoring
stations near Campbell – in Los Gatos and in San Jose at 935 Piedmont Road – rank in
the top five sites with the highest measured ozone concentrations in the entire Bay Area
basin.
The BAAQMD air quality monitoring station closest to Campbell that monitors all air
pollutants is on 4th Street in San Jose. The air pollutant summary for the San Jose 4th
Street monitoring station is included in Table CNR-2.

As shown in Table CNR-2, the two pollutants that exceed the standards several days a
year and pose the greatest air quality problems are ozone and particulate matter.
The primary source of air pollutants in Campbell is motor vehicle emissions. Some light
industrial uses generate other emissions. Automobiles are expected to remain the primary
source of air quality impacts because few work site destinations exist in Campbell. Most
emissions are generated by travel to, from and through the City. The largest fraction of
photochemical smog is ozone. In the Bay Area, more than 50 percent of the reactive
organic gases and nitrogen oxides that create photochemical smog comes from cars and
trucks. The major effects of photochemical smog are aggravation of respiratory diseases,
eye irritation, visibility reduction and vegetation damage. On-road vehicles make up only
three percent of the PM-10 emissions source. Over 85 percent of PM-10 comes from
area-wide sources, such as dust from unpaved roads and agricultural operations,
residential wood burning and industrial sources.
The City is responsible for implementing certain transportation control measures outlined
in the BAAQMD Clean Air Plan. Projects in Campbell are assessed based on the 1996
BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines that were designed to assist local governments and

implementation of such mitigation.

  SECTION 1 INTRODUCTION
Community Context
Incorporated in 1952, Campbell is a
community of approximately 40,000
residents centrally located in Silicon
Valley. Nearby communities include San
Jose to the west, east and north, and Los
Gatos and Saratoga to the south. From
the mid-1850’s, Campbell was primarily
an agricultural production center, with
fruits as its major crops. By 1950,
however, croplands were beginning to be
transformed          into        residential
neighborhoods.
Campbell’s population doubled during the 1960’s, slowed down in the 1970’s, and grew again in the
1980’s. Between 1980 and 1990, the City’s population increased by 33 percent, a level of growth
unmatched by nearby communities. Since 1990, however, population growth has been limited in
Campbell. Today, Campbell is a suburban and largely built-out community. However, many of the older
strip commercial areas are showing signs of age and obsolescence. The City of Campbell has adopted a
variety of special area plans to encourage revitalization efforts in these older commercial areas.
Campbell offers a mix of housing types, including single-family homes, townhomes, garden apartments,
condominium developments, and live-work space. Of the approximately 16,000 housing units in the City,
58 percent are single-family homes, 40 percent are multi-family units, and two percent are mobile homes
or other types of residential options. Housing costs are relatively high in Campbell, as is typical in the Bay
Area and Silicon Valley in particular. In Campbell, the median price of a single-family home sold in 2013
had increased by 10 percent to $810,000 since 2008, while the market rate rents for two-bedroom
apartments ranged from $1,595 to $2,845 per month.
Since the last Housing Element adopted in 2009, the City of Campbell has been very active in processing
and approving numerous housing projects of all types. From January 2009 to December 2013, the City
has approved or issued permits for 543 new housing units. This level of housing approval and production
is equal to 61 percent of the City’s total Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) of 892 units. Due to
the economic downturn that began in 2007, not all of the approved projects have proceeded with
construction, particularly since a strong economic recovery did not begin until 2012.
This progress to date on the current “fair share” housing goals represents a validation of the 2001 General
Plan strategy to promote new in-fill mixed-use projects near transit corridors and within targeted
revitalization areas. The City has also allowed development of new housing within established
neighborhoods when consistent with adopted General Plan policies and zoning regulations.
Campbell has been proactive in developing and implementing innovative housing policies including:
        Adoption of an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance;
      General Plan vision for Transit Oriented Development;
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                              H-1

        Utilization of flexible parking requirements; and,
        Identification of Priority Development Areas as part of the Plan Bay Area process.
Like most communities in Silicon Valley, Campbell is home to employers in the high technology industry,
however most employers are small to mid-size companies. As of 2007 (the most recent data available),
Campbell had an employment base of approximately 20,650 jobs in about 1,450 businesses. Since that
time the trends in local employment have shown an increase in the retail and service sectors with a
corresponding decline of manufacturing and technology jobs. The City has been able to achieve a relative
balance between jobs and housing, and strives to maintain this balance. According to the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Campbell had a jobs/employed residents ratio of 1.2, indicating that there
is an almost equal number of employed residents and jobs within the City.
Housing affordability is a major issue in the Bay Area, with a significant number of households in the region
that are overpaying for housing. The shortage of affordable housing particularly affects lower-income
renters and first-time homebuyers, and has impacted the City’s ability to maintain civic workforce
occupations such as public safety workers and teachers. The City of Campbell has been active in
promoting housing affordability through the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requirements and
Density Bonus provisions. The City also previously supported non-profit housing providers and first-time
home buyers; however, since the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency (RDA) in 2011, the City no
longer administers these programs. As part of this Housing Element update, the City will look for additional
means to expand the supply of affordable housing, including facilitating residential development in mixed-
use and priority development areas and around light rail stations.
Campbell’s quality residential neighborhoods, strong employment base, high level of public services, and
well-regarded school system, all contribute to its attractiveness as a place to live. Over the next eight
years, Campbell is faced with various important housing issues and challenges:
        Providing housing affordable to all segments of the population;
        Preserving the quality of the housing stock;
        Maintaining a balance between employment and housing opportunities; and
        Providing new types of housing in response to changing demographic trends.
This Housing Element provides policies and programs to address these and other related issues.
Relationship to the General Plan
The 2015-2023 Housing Element is one of the five elements of Campbell’s comprehensive General Plan.
The Plan consists of the following elements: Land Use and Transportation; Open Space, Parks and Public
Facilities; Conservation and Natural Resources; Health and Safety; and Housing. The Housing Element
builds upon the other General Plan Elements and is consistent with the policies set forth in those
elements. For example, the Land Use and Transportation Element focuses residential growth along
commercial corridors and around transit stations, and provides the basis for the residential sites inventory
contained in the Housing Element. Whenever any Element of the General Plan is amended in the future,
the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified, if necessary, to ensure continued consistency
between elements.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                             H-2

Role of Housing Element
Every jurisdiction in California must have a General Plan and every General Plan must contain a Housing
Element. While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their General Plan regularly to ensure
that they remain up to date, State law is much more specific in regard to the schedule for updating the
Housing Element. Recent changes in State Law allow Campbell’s Housing Element to cover a period of
eight-years extending from 2015 to 2023. Most other elements of the General Plan typically cover a 15
to 30-year planning horizon.
The 2015-2023 Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on the following:
    1) Preserving and improving housing and neighborhoods;
    2) Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
    3) Minimizing governmental and other constraints to housing investment;
    4) Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities; and
    5) Providing adequate housing sites.
Organization of the Housing Element
The Complete Housing Element consists of four primary sections and the technical appendices which
provide additional, and more detailed, information upon which the Housing Element is based. The four
sections of the Element include the Introduction, Housing Needs Summary, Housing Resources, and the
Housing Plan. The technical appendices provide supportive information on the Housing Needs
Assessment, Governmental Constraints, Housing Element Accomplishments, and a detailed Inventory of
the Opportunity Sites.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
   A summary of the City’s existing and projected housing needs;
   An assessment of the land, financial and administrative resources available to address Campbell’s
     housing needs; and
   A Housing Plan to address the City’s identified housing needs, including housing goals, policies, and
     programs.
   The Technical Background Reports contain additional information on the following:
      o    Housing Needs Assessment (Appendix A) describes and analyzes Campbell’s population,
           household, and housing characteristics and trends;
      o    Housing Constraints (Appendix B) assesses potential market, governmental, and other
           constraints to the development and affordability of housing;
      o    Housing Accomplishments (Appendix C) evaluates the City’s progress in implementing the
           housing programs established in the 2009 - 2014 Housing Element; and,
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                           H-3

       o   Analysis of Opportunity Sites (Appendix D) which assesses the ability of the City to provide
           adequate sites to meet the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
       o   Public Outreach Description (Appendix E) which highlights the techniques used to consult
           with the public.
Public Participation
Opportunities for residents to
provide input on housing issues and
recommend strategies are critical
to the development of appropriate
and effective programs to address
Campbell’s housing needs. In 2014,
the City conducted two public
workshops as an opportunity to
gather community input for the
Housing Element.            The City
promoted the workshops through
advertisements           in       local
newspapers,        on     the     local
government access television
station, at the local library, and on the City’s website. The City also directly mailed workshop information
to local non-profit housing developers, mobile home parks, and BMR developers. Workshop participants
included homeowners, renters, developers, local housing and social service providers, and City staff.
Substantially more people attended the 2014 outreach meetings than attended the meetings for previous
housing elements.
The first workshop in February 2014 focused on informing the residents about the housing needs for the
City, and recording attendee’s comments and answering their questions. Community comments focused
on how the Housing Element would affect local development and individual property rights.
The second workshop, held two months later in April 2014, reviewed the existing policies and strategies
as well as possible locations of future opportunity sites. The participants provided their feedback on the
existing programs, where new housing should be located, and what new housing should look like in terms
of densities and style. There was a substantial amount of agreement among the workshop participants
on how future housing should be provided. The workshop participants felt that:
      Higher residential densities are more appropriate in the identified revitalization area in the
         Priority Development Area (PDAs) around the downtown and along Winchester Boulevard;
      New housing should be available for both owners and renters;
      Larger residential units (with 4 or more bedrooms) should be provided by more traditional single
         family detached styled units;
      More accessory dwelling units should be allowed; and
      Additional senior housing opportunities should be provided.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                             H-4

Following the community workshops, City staff conducted a public study session with the City Council in
June 2014. The purpose of the workshop was to ask for the City Council’s general direction on the
appropriate policies and programs to address the community’s identified housing needs in the context of
local resources. During the Study Session, a number of residents addressed the City Council and
encouraged the Council to keep the maximum residential density at 27 units per acre. As result of the
presentation, public comments, and the Council discussion the City Council members who were present
suggested that staff:
   Focus the Opportunity Sites in the PDA and around the VTA Stations;
   Consider different approaches to replace lost housing program resources; and
   Maintain the current maximum by-right residential density (27 units per acre), but review the
       possibility of allowing higher densities in certain circumstances.
Upon completion of the Draft Housing Element, the document will be reviewed by the Planning
Commission, the City Council and the public. After approval, the draft Housing Element is sent to the
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review. After review, the Planning
Commission and the City Council will hold public hearings. Comments received from HCD are required to
be heard before those decision-making bodies. To ensure that all economic segments of the community
can be involved throughout the process, notification of meeting on the Housing Element are published in
the local newspaper in advance of each hearing, and copies of the Element are available for public review
at City Hall, the Public Library, and on the City’s website. Additional information on the public outreach
process is included in Attachment E.

Data Sources
Various sources of information are used to prepare the Housing Element. Data from the 2010 Census on
population and housing is used to a large extent in the Element. Although dated, the 2000 Census, and
information from the American Community Strategies were also a good source of information. Several
additional data sources were also used to update the community and demographic information including:
     Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Housing Element Data Profiles (January 2014) and
      ABAG’s Regional Housing Needs Determination (July, 2013) provides demographic projections and
      information on future housing needs;
     Population and demographic data is updated by the State Department of Finance, and school
      enrollment data from State Department of Education;
     Housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and vacancies, is updated through
      newspaper and internet rent surveys and DataQuick sales transactions;
     Public and non-profit agencies are consulted for data on special needs groups, the services available
      to them, and gaps in the system;
     Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans are provided through the Home
      Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database.
     Major Employers are provided by the City of Campbell Finance Department;
     Comparative data for income levels of various groups is provided by the Comprehensive Housing
      Affordability Strategy, 2010;
     Information on Campbell’s development standards are derived from the City’s Zoning Ordinance;
     Property size and other Assessor’s information provided by Santa Clara County Assessor’s Office;
      and
     Information on Persons with Developmental Disabilities is provided by the California Department
      of Development Services and Department of Social Services.

 SECTION 2 HOUSING NEEDS SUMMARY
Introduction
In the 1940s, Campbell’s fruit orchard
heritage slowly began being replaced by
housing subdivisions. Today, most of the
new residential development in
Campbell occurs on commercial
property, designated for mixed-use.
The City of Campbell is committed to
assuring the availability of adequate

Campbell’s existing and future housing
needs as identified in the Housing Element Technical Report, Appendix A. Appendix A provides a more
detailed analysis of local demographic, household, and housing characteristics and trends in an effort to
determine the nature and extent of specific housing needs in Campbell.
Existing Housing Needs
The summary of existing housing needs is organized into four areas: housing availability, housing
affordability, housing adequacy and special needs households. These housing needs are summarized in
Table H-1.

Housing Availability
Campbell’s 2010 housing stock consists of 16,950 housing units, of which 58 percent are single-family
homes including attached, detached and condominium units, 40 percent are multi-family apartment units,
including duplex and triplex units, and two percent are mobile homes and other types of residential
accommodations. Residential growth during the 2000s was rather limited, with only about three percent
of the housing stock built after 2000.
Vacancies indicate the demand and availability of housing. As is the case in most Silicon Valley
communities, residential vacancy rates are fairly low in Campbell. According to 2014 State Department of
Finance statistics, the City’s overall vacancy rate was just 4.6 percent, close to the 5 percent ideal vacancy
rate for rental units and the 3 percent ideal for ownership units.
During the one year period from January 2013 to December 2013, a total of 438 homes were sold in
Campbell. Two-thirds of the recent home sales were single-family homes while one-third were
condominium units. The median sales price for a single-family home in 2013 was $810,000, an increase of
over 10% since 2008. In contrast, the median sale price for a condominium in 2013 was $515,000, virtually
unchanged since 2008. However with the rebounding economy, the prices of condominiums are also
expected to increase.
The rental market is comprised primarily of apartment units. Most of the apartment rental stock consists
of one- and two-bedroom units. In January 2014, the median rents for the one-bedroom and two-
bedroom units were $1,725 and $2,070, respectively. Very few three-bedroom rental units (either
apartments or single family detached homes) are available, thus limiting the rental options for large family
households.
Housing Affordability
The level of overpayment is commonly used as a measure of housing affordability. Overpayment is defined
as spending more than 30 percent of gross household income on housing. By this standard, 43 percent of
renters and 38 percent of homeowners in Campbell overpay for housing, similar to the overpayment rate
countywide. Rental overpayment is particularly acute among senior households, with one-third of senior
renters spending more than half their incomes on rent.
An assessment of the affordability of current market rents and housing prices in Campbell reveals the
following. Citywide median rents are above the affordability level for the many lower income households,
making it difficult for lower income occupations such as nursing aides, retail salespersons and childcare
providers to rent in Campbell. For-sale housing prices in Campbell are beyond the reach of even moderate
income households, impacting the ability of occupations such as school teachers, clergy, and computer
support specialists to purchase housing where they work.
Home foreclosures, a major problem during and immediately after the Great Recession between 2007
and 2009, had a major impact on housing sales, with foreclosures comprising 40 percent of all housing re-
sales in Santa Clara County. However, since the rebound of the regional economy after the Great
Recession, the number of new home foreclosures has dropped substantially reducing the magnitude of
the problem.

Housing Adequacy
A common measure of housing adequacy and quality is the age distribution of the housing stock. A
general rule in the housing industry is that structures over 30 years typically begin to show signs of
deterioration and often require reinvestment to maintain/upgrade their quality. Unless properly
maintained, homes older than 50 years often require major renovations to remain in good working order.
As of 2010, nearly 40 percent of housing units in Campbell were over 35 years old, and about 28 percent
of Campbell’s housing stock was constructed before 1960. Campbell’s San Tomas neighborhood, located
in the southwestern quadrant of the City, contains some of the City’s older housing stock, with many
homes in need of rehabilitation improvements.
As stated in the 2001 Housing Element, approximately nine percent of Campbell’s housing stock was
estimated to be in substandard condition, with six percent of units suitable for rehabilitation and three
percent requiring replacement. Applying these same percentages to Campbell’s current pre-1980 housing
stock, an estimated 900 units in Campbell may be substandard. Of these units, 600 are estimated to be
suitable for rehabilitation and up to 300 could require substantial rehabilitation or replacement. In
addition to the aging of the housing stock, the 2010 Census identified 216 housing units that lacked either
plumbing facilities or a complete kitchen.
The level of household overcrowding is another indicator of housing adequacy and quality. Overcrowding
occurs when a household is too large for a particular housing unit. When overcrowding happens, it tends
to accelerate the deterioration of homes. As of the 2010 Census, a total of 635 Campbell households,
about 4% of all households, live in overcrowded conditions. Seventy-two percent of the overcrowded
households are renters.
Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the community may have particular difficulties in finding decent, affordable housing
because of their special needs and circumstances. In Campbell, these special needs groups include the
elderly, disabled persons, female-headed families with children, large households, and the homeless.
   Seniors: Seniors typically have special housing needs due to three concerns: limited/fixed income,
    higher health care costs, and physical limitations. According to the 2010 Census, 17 percent (2,824)
    of households in Campbell contain one or more persons age 65 years and older. Over 60 percent of
    the City’s elderly households are homeowners. Because of physical and/or other limitations, senior
    homeowners may have difficulty in performing regular home maintenance or repair activities. Elderly
    renters also have significant housing needs. Nearly sixty percent of Campbell’s elderly renter
    households overpay for housing, reflecting their limited income and the high costs of housing in
    Campbell.
   Persons with Disabilities: Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to traditionally designed
    housing units (and other facilities) as well as potentially limit the ability to earn income. Disabilities
    refer to mental, physical, or health conditions that last over six months. The 2010 Census documented
    2,857 persons over the age of five with a disability in Campbell, representing 8 percent of this
    population group.

    Persons with Developmental Disabilities: Persons aged 18 years and older with developmental
     disabilities require continuous assistance and constitute a special needs group. Development
     disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism, as well as other disabling
     conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation (or that require treatment similar to
     individuals with mental retardation), but does not include other handicapping conditions that are
     solely physical in nature (though some developmentally disabled persons may also have physical
     disabilities). According to the State Department of Developmental Services there are 134
     developmentally disabled persons over the age of 17 in Postal Code 95008 (which comprises most of
     the City of Campbell).
    Female-Headed Families with Children: Female-headed households with children require special
     consideration and assistance as a result of their greater need for affordable housing, accessible day
     care, health care, and other supportive services. According to the 2010 Census, Campbell is home to
     1,741 female-headed households, of which 937 (or 55 percent) are with children under 18 years of
     age. These households are particularly vulnerable because these single parent households must
     balance the needs of their children with work responsibilities. Approximately 10 percent of female-
     headed families with children live in poverty, about three times the number of female-headed
     households without children under the age of 18.
    Large Households: Large households are defined as those with five or more members and typically
     consist of mostly families with children. Lower-income large households often live in overcrowded
     conditions because of the income limitations and the limited supply of affordable housing units with
     three or more bedrooms. Campbell is home to approximately 1,283 large households, of which nearly
     half are renter households (2010 Census). While there is an adequate supply of larger housing units,
     the affordability of these units for large families can be a problem and can lead to overcrowded
     conditions.
    Homeless: Homelessness continues to be one of most visible reminders of the pressing needs facing
     families and individuals in marginal economic, housing, and health conditions. This population
     consists of a wide range of persons and families suffering from domestic violence, mental illness,
     substance abuse, and joblessness among a number of other conditions. The 2013 Santa Clara county
     Homeless Census and Survey identified 91 homeless persons in Campbell. The closest homeless
     shelters are located outside of Campbell in the San Jose area.
Sustainable Community Strategy & Future Housing Needs
The primary objectives of the State's Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) process are to increase
the supply of housing and ensure that local governments consider housing needs for households at all
income levels. The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is the regional agency that distributes
the RHNA to the counties and cities. This process occurs in two steps. The first step is the allocation of
the total number of units by each jurisdiction (i.e. each county and city). The second step in the process
is to break out this total allocation into the four required income categories.
The Regional Housing Need Allocation process began in 2012 with the development of a process to
integrate transportation and housing planning through a sustainable community strategy identified in
Assembly Bill 375 (2008). AB 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008
represents an effort to reduce green house gases emissions associated with motor vehicles by
coordinating the location of new jobs, housing, and public transportation infrastructure. A key element
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                              H-10

of the Act is the integration of jobs, housing, and transportation infrastructure through a regionally
prepared Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS).
The SCS for the Bay Area was prepared by ABAG and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and
was approved in 2013; it identified Priority Development Areas (PDAs) where new housing growth and
transportation infrastructure would be focused. This integration of transportation and housing planning
resulted in a RHNA process based upon both a Sustainability Component and a Fair Share Component.
Using the PDA framework from the SCS in the RHNA methodology promotes growth in sustainable
locations and is a key to ensuring consistency between the two planning documents. Directing growth to
infill locations is a key component of protecting agricultural and natural resources. This methodology also
recognizes the multiple benefits for local communities and the region as a whole of encouraging housing,
particularly affordable housing, in the neighborhoods near transit that local communities have identified
as priorities for development and investment to create complete communities.
The Sustainability Component integrates the compact growth principles from the Bay Area Plan with the
RHNA methodology. Following the land use distribution specified in the Plan Bay Area Sustainable
Community Strategies (SCS) Plan which allocated new housing into PDAs and non-PDA areas, 70 percent
of the total housing need was allocated based on growth in PDAs and the remaining 30 percent was
allocated based on growth in non-PDA locations. The 70% in PDA goal is a regional target. Individual
jurisdictions are not expected to provide 70 percent of the new housing in the PDAs.
The Fair Share Component allocates housing need based upon local community characteristics and past
performance. All jurisdictions were assigned a minimum of 40 percent of their new housing units during
the 2015-2023 period. This establishes a starting point or minimum threshold to ensure that all
jurisdictions are planning for housing to accommodate at least a portion of the housing need generated
by the population within that jurisdiction. This base allocation was then modified based upon a variety of
fair share and equity factors. The Fair Share factors include the following:
     Upper   Housing Threshold: If the SCS Plan projects growth in a jurisdiction's PDAs that meets or
      exceeds 110 percent of the jurisdiction's expected household formation growth, that jurisdiction is
      not assigned additional units. The expected household formation is used as an indicator of the
      demand for new housing to accommodate new families/households. This ensures that cities with
      PDAs are not overburdened.
     Fair Share Factors: The following three factors were applied to a jurisdiction's non-PDA growth:
      1.     Past RHNA (Jobs:Housing Balance) Performance: Jurisdictions with a lower number of housing
             affordable to lower income households received a higher allocation.
      2.     Employment: Jurisdictions with a higher number of existing jobs in non-PDA areas received a
             higher allocation.
      3.     Transit: Jurisdictions with higher transit frequency and coverage receive a higher allocation.
The second step in the process is dividing this allocation into the four income categories defined by the
State Department of Housing and Community Development. The income allocation portion of the RHNA
method is designed to ensure that each jurisdiction in the Bay Area plans for housing for households of
every income category. The income allocation method gives jurisdictions that have a relatively higher
proportion of households in a certain income category a smaller allocation of housing units in that same
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                              H-11

category. For example, jurisdictions that already supply a large amount of affordable housing receive
lower affordable housing allocations. This promotes the state objective for reducing concentrations of
poverty and increasing the mix of housing types among cities and counties equitably. The RHNA
methodology for determining the number of units by income category is the same method that was used
for the 2007-2014 RHNA. As a result of this process, Campbell’s share of future regional housing needs is
a total of 933 new units over the 2015-2023 planning period. The income categories of Campbell’s future
housing allocation are based upon the median County income and are presented below.

Accomplishments in Previous Housing Element Cycle
The 2009-2014 Housing Element contained 24 implementation programs to meet local housing needs and
comply with State Law. Fourteen of the implementation program set out functions and activities that
corresponded to typical local government activities, while two of the programs involved adoption of an
ordinance. The remaining eight programs involved the funding and implementation of various ongoing
housing activities and programs. A summary of the items not implemented during the proceeding Housing
Element cycle is contained in Table H-2.

While the City did initiate programs identified in the 2009-2014 Housing Element at the beginning of the
Housing Element cycle, the loss of the Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-a-side Funds and a locally
controlled Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, combined with the economic
downturn effectively prevented the active implementation of many housing programs. The loss of the
Housing Set-a-side funding and reductions to the general fund resulted in the elimination of some City
staff positions, which subsequently results in the City’s inability to implement some 2009 Housing Element
programs. All of the eight programs providing funding for housing-related programs are currently without
a funding source.
The important exceptions include the planning and development related measures that are implemented
by the Planning Division as part of its normal operations. Examples of these programs include: Program
H-4.2a, Mixed-use Development; Program H-4.3a, Planned for Densities; Program H-5.1a, Density Bonus;
and Program H-5.2a, Secondary Dwelling Units. All of these programs enabled Campbell to continue to
approve new housing to meet Campbell’s identified housing need. The three large affordable and/or
senior housing projects that were either recently completed or will be completed in 2014 are examples of
these ongoing efforts to provide additional housing.
Of the two ordinance amendments contained in the 2009 Housing Element, one was adopted. The Zoning
Text Amendment to implement SB-2 and address other minor code modifications (Program H-5.3a) was
adopted in 2014. Program H-3.2a to amend Campbell’s Inclusionary Housing Provisions to provide greater
flexibility in the required income categories was not completed. This item will be carried over into the
2015-2023 Housing Element for implementation within the next two years.
Table H-3 summarizes the quantified objectives contained in Campbell’s 2009 – 2014 Housing Element
and the City’s progress in fulfilling these objectives. This information is based upon a review of residential
building permits issued between January 2009 and December 2012 with the addition of other housing
units that are currently under construction. Using the State’s standard affordability density of 20 units
per acre, most of the housing constructed in Campbell is potentially affordable for most income groups
and have been allocated to the Low Income Category. However, because of national economic conditions,

  SECTION 3 HOUSING RESOURCES
Introduction
A variety of resources are available for the
development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
housing in Campbell. This includes the City’s
ability to meets its share of regional housing
needs through the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance, the inventory of available sites, the
financial resources available to support the
provision of affordable housing, and the
administrative resources available to assist in
implementing City housing programs.
General Plan
The 2001 Campbell General Plan provided a 20 to 25 year framework for the development of the City.
The Campbell General Plan contains four elements, in addition to the Housing Element. These other
Elements are Land Use & Transportation, Open Space, Parks & Public Facilities, Health & Safety, and
Conservation & Natural Resources. The Land Use Map contains 19 land use categories identifying a wide
range of residential, commercial, industrial, mixed-use, institutional and open space land uses. The land
uses integrate with the Zoning Ordinance to identify a range of residential densities (regulated by
residential densities) and non-residential development intensities (regulated by floor area ratio).
General Plan Policies and Strategies
Campbell’s Land Use and Transportation Element establish various policies and strategies in support of
housing development. Some of these policies and strategies include, but are not limited to, the following:
Policy LUT-1.5:      Land Use Planning and the Regional Transportation System: Support land use
                     planning that complements the regional transportation system.
     Strategy LUT-1.5a: Transit-Oriented Developments: Encourage transit-oriented developments
                         including employment centers such as office and research and development
                         facilities and the City’s highest density residential projects by coordinating the
                         location, intensity and mix of land uses with transportation resources, such as
                         Light Rail.
     Strategy LUT-1.5d: Higher Floor Area Ratios (FARs): Develop provisions for allowing higher FARs in
                         new projects that provide a mix of uses, maintain a jobs/housing balance or are
                         located within proximity to Light Rail.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                           H-15

Policy LUT-3.1:      Variety of Residential Densities: Provide land use categories for and maintenance of
                     a variety of residential densities to offer existing and future residents of all income
                     levels, age groups and special needs sufficient opportunities and choices for locating
                     in Campbell.
    Strategy LUT-3.1a: Consistency with Housing Element: Ensure consistency with the City’s Housing
                         Element including ensuring that there is adequate land designated to meet
                         Housing goals.
    Strategy LUT-3.1c: High Density Residential: Allow higher residential densities in the North of
                         Campbell Area (NOCA), South of Campbell Area (SOCA), and areas near the Light
                         Rail stations as an incentive to redevelop older, less intensive uses.
Policy LUT-5.3:      Variety of Commercial and Office Uses: Maintain a variety of attractive and
                     convenient commercial and office uses that provide needed goods, services and
                     entertainment.
    Strategy LUT-5.3i: Mixed-Use in Commercial Districts: Consider revising the Zoning Ordinance to
                         include standards for mixed-use development (residential and/or office above
                         ground floor retail) in commercial districts.
Policy LUT-14.6:     Mixed Residential and Non-residential Uses: Allow residential uses that are mixed
                     whether horizontally or vertically with non-residential uses.
In addition to these general policies, the General Plan contains policies related to a number of special plan
areas within Campbell. These special planning areas include the Winchester Boulevard corridor,
Pruneyard/Creekside area (which includes portions of Bascom/East Hamilton Avenue area), the North of
Campbell Avenue (NOCA) Plan Area, the South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA) Plan Area, as well as the other
residential areas surrounding the downtown. Higher residential and mixed-use developments are also
encouraged in these areas. The City Council has also adopted other special master plans to facilitate
mixed-use and residential development along the Winchester Boulevard corridor and East Campbell
Avenue areas.
The stated intent of the General Plan mixed-use categories is to integrate residential uses with traditional
commercial and/or professional office uses. In furtherance of this goal, residential uses are permitted at
27 dwelling units per acre in mixed-use zones, and the residential component is not counted against the
allowable commercial Floor Area Ratio (FAR). In this way, sites currently occupied by commercial uses
may be redeveloped with residential and commercial uses, improving the financial feasibility of projects.
The City also provides additional zoning incentives for the inclusion of residential uses in new mixed-use
developments, such as reduced parking requirements, including shared parking between commercial and
residential uses. A reduction in the required open space for the residential component may be granted
where site characteristics preclude fulfillment of the entire open space requirement. This is discussed in
more detail in Appendix B.
Since establishment of mixed-use zoning districts under the 2001 General Plan (as described in Strategy
LUT 5.3i), development on mixed-use parcels has consisted entirely of residential uses or residential uses
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                             H-16

with ground floor commercial. None of the mixed-use sites has been developed with an entirely
commercial use.
Minimum Residential Density
Previous Housing Elements have contained provisions for a minimum residential density for each General
Plan and Zoning designation. This requirement, identified as Policy H-4.3 in the 2009-2014 Housing
Element encourages “residential development that is proposed near existing light rail stations (within 1/4
mile radius) and/or within the boundaries of the Winchester Boulevard Plan and East Campbell Avenue
plan areas, to achieve at least 75 percent of the maximum General Plan Land Use category densities.” This
provision is carried over into the 2015-2023 Housing Element and will facilitate the full
development of the identified opportunity sites.
Zoning Ordinance Provisions
Residential Densities
The Zoning Ordinance and Map implements the development envisioned on the General Plan Land Use
Plan. These policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of
land allocated for different uses within Campbell. As summarized below in Table H-5, the Land Use
Element provides for six residential land use designations, a mobile home park designation, one
commercial designation, and three mixed-use designations that allow for residential uses.

  * Residential condominium and apartment units are allowed on the upper floors only within the C-3 Zoning District. No
    maximum density standard is provided per Section 21.10.060, C-3 (Central Business District) zoning district.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                                            H-17

Each of these land use designations has one or more zoning districts to implement their vision of the
future. Each of these zones contains detailed (and often very specific) development criteria to guide their
development. The maximum densities for the zones allowing residential land uses are summarized below.
    o    Single Family Detached Residential Zones – between 3 and 6 dwelling units per acre (depending
         on the specific zone).
    o    Smaller Lot Single Family/Duplex/Triplex Residential Zones – between 6 and 13 dwelling units per
         acre (depending on the specific zone)
    o    Multiple Family Condominium/Attached Residential Zones - between 14 and 27 dwelling units per
         acre (depending on the specific zone).
    o    Mixed-use/Planned Development Residential – up to 27 dwelling units per acre.
    o    Central Business District Commercial – no numeric standard, allowable residential units are
         determined by the design of the project on a case-by-case basis.
Secondary Dwelling Units
The City allows secondary dwelling units on 10,000 square foot sized lots for the development of
secondary units, resulting in 1,000 properties being eligible for secondary dwelling units. Given their
relatively limited size and historical rent levels, secondary units will most likely be occupied by lower-
income residents, including the elderly, college students, and low-income wage earners. Secondary
dwelling units require a ministerial zoning clearance usually involving just a zoning compliance sign-off on
a building permit. Based on the level of secondary unit approval and development during the prior
planning period, the City can reasonably anticipate between 8 and 16 additional secondary units during
the current period, helping to address the needs of lower income renters.
Sites for Special Needs Housing
Consistent with the requirements of SB-2, the City allows emergency shelters by right in a portion of the
M-1 Zone. The area is located just south of San Tomas Expressway between Winchester Boulevard and
Los Gatos Creek. This location is centrally located in an area well served by transit and commercial
services. Included in the ordinance are provisions to allow Single Room Occupancy (SRO) facilities within
the R-3 High Density Residential Zoning District. The zoning ordinance also regulates transitional and
supportive housing in the same manner as other residential uses in the equivalent zone. Additional
information is provided in Appendix B.
Mixed-Use Development
Many areas in Campbell are zoned P-D (Planned Development). The P-D Zone allows for flexibility in
development standards and requirements where optimum quantity and use of open space and exemplary
building design are provided. Mixed-use development is also encouraged in these areas, allowing both
residential and commercial uses on the same parcel. A key strategy of the City’s General Plan is to
integrate residential development along designated commercial corridors to create activity along the
street, and provide a variety of housing types near work and shopping. This strategy ensures safer, more

viable commercial areas, with mixed-use residents helping to ensure the viability of the commercial uses.
Residential uses are encouraged but not included in the calculation of the FAR. Campbell also allows for
a shared parking reduction and a reduction in the required open space for the residential component.
The City has approved several mixed-use projects since adoption of the prior Housing Element.
Housing Opportunity Site Inventory
A key component of any Housing Element is an assessment of whether or not a community can provide
sufficient sites to accommodate their Regional Housing Need Allocation. This section summarizes the
number of available opportunity sites and the relative affordability of these opportunity sites. As is
demonstrated in this section, Campbell can accommodate both the number of units and appropriate
levels of affordability specified in the RHNA. The City plans to fulfill its share of regional housing needs
using a combination of the following methods by focusing (but not limiting) development in opportunity
site areas, through the development of secondary dwelling units, and residential projects with
development entitlements.
Housing Opportunity Site Availability
A detailed analysis of potential opportunity site areas was conducted during the preparation of the
Housing Element. The focus of the site selection was the need to ensure that the objectives of the Housing
Element were integrated with the other elements of the General Plan. The Land Use and Transportation
Element of the General Plan has an objective of concentrating new residential development around the
existing VTA transit stations and around the downtown (i.e. the designated Priority Development Area) to
facilitate the redevelopment of areas with under-utilized sites and/or occupied with obsolete buildings,
and to try to reduce traffic impacts. Five of the six Opportunity Site Areas meet this objective. The sixth
Opportunity Site Area, the Dot Avenue area was also included since it represents one of the largest vacant
residential sites in Campbell.
The initial screening process resulted in an extensive list of several hundred properties capable of
accommodating over 2,000 new dwelling units. This preliminary list was presented at the Second
Community Outreach Workshop held on April 29, 2014. Based upon the input from the community, six
opportunity site areas were identified. The final list of Opportunity Sites capable of accommodating the
RHNA for Campbell was then selected from within these areas. Each of the Opportunity Sites have the
appropriate General Plan and Zoning designations to accommodate housing and have access to roads,
water, sewer, electricity and/or natural gas, and telecommunication services. The individual Opportunity
Site inventories are contained in Appendix D.
Housing Opportunity Site Areas
The locations of the six major opportunity site areas are depicted on Figure H-1 and are described below.
A summary of the residential development potential for these opportunity site areas are shown in Table
H-5. Adequate infrastructure including roads, water, sewer, electricity and/or natural gas, and
telecommunication services are in place for the planned-for development for all of the Opportunity Site
areas. A detailed assessment of each opportunity site is provided in Appendix D.

Figure H-1: Map of Opportunity Site Areas
1. Bascom Avenue Corridor Area
    The Bascom Avenue Area is near the intersection of South Bascom Avenue and East Hamilton Avenue.
    This Area is located just north of the Pruneyard Area and is within a ¼ mile of the Hamilton VTA Light
    Rail Station. The General Plan Land Use Designation for the area allows Commercial/Professional
    Office/Residential land uses with densities up to 20 dwelling units per acre. Residential densities are
    not counted towards the floor area ratio calculations in mixed-use developments. During the previous
    Housing Element cycle, one opportunity site, located at 1677 South Bascom Avenue, was developed
    with 168 apartments as part of a mixed-use project.
2. North of Campbell Avenue Area Plan
    The North of Campbell Avenue Area Plan (NOCA) opportunity area is located along Salmar Avenue
    between East Hamilton Avenue and Harrison Avenue. The NOCA area is located midway between the
    Hamilton Avenue and Downtown Campbell Light Rail Stations. The area is covered by the North of
    Campbell Avenue Area Plan. The purpose of the NOCA Plan is to encourage a combination of
    residential and commercial uses in a previously industrial area. The Zoning and General Plan
    designations support new residential and mixed-use development at the City’s highest density range
    of 20 dwelling units per acre and Floor Area Ratios of up to 1.00. Residential densities are not counted
    towards the floor area ratio calculations in a mixed-use development. Much of the NOCA area has
    already been redeveloped both residentially (near the downtown) and commercially (near Hamilton
    Avenue).

3. East Campbell Avenue Master Plan Area
    The East Campbell Avenue Master Plan Area extends from Downtown Campbell east to Los Gatos
    Creek along both sides of Campbell Avenue. This area serves as an important gateway to Downtown
    Campbell and creates a connection to the Prune Yard Shopping Center (a major 40-acre retail and
    office destination for the South Bay region). The City has adopted the East Campbell Avenue Master
    Plan to guide future development in this area. The Master Plan allows for residential densities up to
    27 dwelling units per acre in a mixed-use style. This area is adjacent to the South of Campbell Avenue
    Area.
4. South of Campbell Avenue Area Plan
    The South of Campbell Avenue Plan Area (SOCA) opportunity area is located between Railway Avenue
    and Los Gatos Creek and is covered by the South of Campbell Avenue Area Plan. The purpose of the
    SOCA Plan is to encourage a combination of residential and commercial uses in a previously industrial
    area. The Zoning and General Plan designations support new residential and mixed-use development
    at the City’s highest density range of 27 du/ac and Floor Area Ratios of up to 1.00. Residential
    densities are not counted towards the floor area ratio calculations in a mixed-use development. Most
    of the SOCA area is located within ¼ mile of the Downtown Campbell Light Rail Station.
5. Winchester Boulevard Master Plan– South Area
    The Winchester Boulevard corridor area is located along both sides of Winchester Boulevard from
    Hamilton Avenue to Camden Avenue. Campbell has adopted the Winchester Boulevard Master Plan
    Area to provide a framework for the redevelopment of the area. The Master Plan and General Plan
    designations support new residential and mixed-use development at the City’s highest density range
    of 27 dwelling units per acre. This mile long corridor is divided into two subareas, for Housing Element
    purposes, at Campbell Avenue. The northern subarea includes locations around the Home Church
    center. The southern subarea includes the older highway oriented commercial south of Campbell
    Avenue and the newer shopping centers near the Winchester Light Rail Station. During the previous
    Housing Element cycle, one opportunity site located at 2041 through 2127 South Winchester
    Boulevard, was developed as a mixed-use project with 126 senior apartments and a 21-patient
    dementia care center as part of this mixed-use project.
6. Dot Avenue Properties
    The Dot Avenue opportunity area is located at the intersection with West Campbell Avenue near San
    Tomas Expressway. The General Plan Land Use Designation for the area allows Medium Density
    Residential land uses which allow residential densities up to 20 dwelling units per acre. The site is
    largely vacant, occupied by a single family home and scattered agricultural uses. This site is not
    located within ½ mile of a VTA Light Rail Station.
Housing Opportunity Site Adequacy
Table H-6 contains a summary of the detailed opportunity site assessment contained in Appendix C. As
demonstrated below, Campbell contains an adequate number of sites to accommodate the RHNA for the
2015 -2023 period. This estimated number of units for each area is calculated by multiplying the
developable acreage by the maximum density by the practical density. The Developable Acreage is based
upon the size for all of the opportunity sites within each area. The Maximum Density is based upon
information obtained from the Campbell General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. For most sites is assumed
to be 75% of the maximum density, except that for larger sites within ½ mile of a VTA Light Rail Station.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                             H-21

In these circumstances a realistic density of 90% of the maximum density is used. The 75% of the
maximum density for 27 units per acre is 20.25 dwelling units per acre. The practical density for a site
with a maximum density of 27 units per acre is 24.3 dwelling units per acre (90% of 27). These values are
above the State’s 20 du/ac threshold for unit affordability to all income levels in suburban settings.

   1.  Does not include any additional density bonus units allowed by State Law and the Local Density Bonus ordinance for
       additional affordable units.
   2.  The northern and middle portions of the Winchester Boulevard Master Plan also contain possible residential sites but
       are not included in the inventory of opportunity sites since adequate sites have already been identified.
The conservative nature of these housing unit estimates within the Opportunity Site Areas is confirmed
by an examination of newer residential projects in the Priority Development Area and surrounding core
locations. Since the implementation of the 75% minimum density and mixed-use policies, examples of
the newer residential projects include: Gateway (25 du/ac); Campbell Center (26 du/ac); Water Tower
Lofts (27 du/ac); Onyx (27 du/ac); Gilman Cottages (27 du/ac); Creekside Commons (27 du/ac); and Merrill
Gardens (34 du/ac with density bonus). This also demonstrates that Campbell’s development standards
have proven to be effective in allowing projects to achieve maximum densities, and given high land costs
in the area, the majority of multi-family and mixed-use developments are built at or near maximum
permitted densities.
Housing Opportunity Site Affordability
To evaluate the adequacy of the sites in terms of the income/affordability targets established by the
RHNA, “default affordability densities” are used. Based upon its suburban location, Campbell’s default
affordability density is 20 dwelling units per acre (i.e. development at or above 20 units per acre is
considered to be affordable to both very low and low income households). For moderate income
households, based on several moderate income projects developed in the City, the City has chosen a
threshold of 15 dwelling units per acre to reflect a reasonable density for achieving moderate income
development.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                                               H-22

Housing Element H-4.3, Planned For Densities, requires that residential development near the existing
light rail stations and/or within the boundaries of the Winchester Boulevard Plan and East Campbell
Avenue plan areas be developed within densities that are at least 75 percent of the maximum General
Plan Land Use category densities. Using these criteria, residential projects on sites with General Plan and
Zoning which allow maximum residential densities up to 27 units per acre are affordable for all income
categories. In contrast, sites with maximum residential densities of 20 units per acre are affordable for
only the Moderate and Above Moderate income categories. Sites with maximum residential densities of
13 units per acre or less are affordable by only those households in the Above Moderate income category.
Table H-7 demonstrates the potential affordability of the units identified in Table H-5. Campbell’s policy
to require at least 75% of the maximum density guarantees that, about 85% of the opportunity site units
are affordable for all income categories. Only the NOCA Plan and Dot Avenue Areas, with maximum
densities of 20 units per acre, are not considered affordable to the Very Low and Low Income categories.
However, those two areas only account for 167 (or about 14%) of the 1,161 identified opportunity site
units. All of the other Opportunity Site housing units can be used to meet the affordability provisions for
all of the income categories.

Availability of Public Facilities and Services
As an urbanized community, Campbell has in place the necessary infrastructure to support additional
residential development. All land designated for residential or mixed-use are served by sewer and water
lines, streets, storm drains, telephone, electrical and gas lines. Pursuant to the 2001 General Plan
Environmental Impact Report, there is adequate water and sewer capacity to serve future development.
To ensure the availability and adequacy of public facilities and services for future development, the City,
along with other providers of public services (e.g., water and sewer), will continue to carry out regular
infrastructure improvements and upgrading.
Financial Resources
Due to the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency (RDA) in 2012, Campbell has limited access to
funding sources available for affordable housing activities. These funding sources include programs from
local, state, federal and private resources. The loss of RDA funding has forced the elimination of a number
of programs, including: Program 1.1a, Housing Rehabilitation Loans, Program 1.1b, Emergency Home
Repair Grants, Program 2.2b, One time Rental Assistance, Program 2.3a, First time Homebuyer Assistance,
and Program 3.1a, Affordable Housing Development Assistance.
The following section describes the two largest housing funding sources currently used in Campbell which
are Section 8 rental assistance (controlled by the State and Federal governments) and the Housing Trust
Fund of Santa Clara County (a private non-profit organization). Table H-8 also provides a more
comprehensive inventory of potential funding sources.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
The CDBG program provides funds for a range of community development activities. Prior to the
dissolution of the RDA, a small portion of the CDBG funds was historically spent on housing repair and
rehabilitation as well as for non-profit service providers. However, since the dissolution of the RDA, the
City was no longer able to provide these services, and these services are now provided to Campbell
residents through Santa Clara County. Current use of CDBG funds has been used for targeted code
enforcement in a low-income census tract area and to improve accessibility (sidewalk repair and curb
cuts) in the City. Residents wanting to repair or rehabilitate their homes must apply to Santa Clara County
to get access these programs.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Section 8 program or housing voucher program is a federal program that provides rental assistance
to extremely low to very low-income persons in need of affordable housing. The Section 8 program offers
a voucher that pays the difference between the payment standard (an exception to fair market rent) and
what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30% of their income). A voucher allows a tenant to choose housing
that may cost above the payment standard, with the tenant paying the extra cost. The Santa Clara County
Housing Authority administers the Section 8 program for most communities in the County, including
Campbell. In 2014, approximately 190 Campbell households received Section 8 assistance from the
Housing Authority.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                             H-24

Housing Trust Fund of Silicon Valley
Created in 2001 as the Housing Trust of Santa Clara County (HTFSV) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) community
based organization created in 2000 through a cooperative effort of the private and public sectors,
including the Housing Collaborative on Homelessness and Affordable Housing, the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, Santa Clara County, Community Foundation Silicon Valley, and all 15 Santa Clara
towns and cities. The purpose of the Trust is to increase the supply of affordable housing in Santa Clara
County within three program areas: first-time homebuyer assistance, multi-family rental housing
development assistance, and support for local homeless assistance programs. Funds are available for
acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, predevelopment costs and supportive housing services.
Since HTFSV’s inception (as of March 2013) the HTFSV reported having raised $75 million in investment
dollars, which it has been leveraged into $1.8 billion of investment in affordable housing.
One-Time Housing Program Funds
Statewide the 20% tax increment affordable housing set-aside funds were responsible for over $1 billion
in direct funding for affordable housing. Historically these local funds were often used as seed money to
leverage other sources of funding for affordable housing. With the dissolution of Redevelopment
Agencies (RDA), the State of California deprived local jurisdictions of their largest and most significant
source of local funding for affordable homes. In response to the loss of this housing program funding, a
portion of those former tax increment funds (transferred to the State) was allocated back to local
jurisdictions as both a one-time lump sum. Campbell received $950,000 in its Housing Trust Fund and
$600,000 in “Boomerang Funds”. In 2014 the City Council committed $250,000 of its Boomerang Funds
to match Santa Clara County’s $350,000 for a future, still to be determined, affordable housing project.
Because of their one-time use only funding nature, these funding sources are not included in Table H-8
below.

San Andreas Regional Center
San Andreas Regional Center (SARC), which is located in Campbell, is a community-based, private
nonprofit corporation serving individuals and their families who reside in Monterey, San Benito, Santa
Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties. SARC is funded by the State of California to serve people with
developmental disabilities as required by the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act. The Center
reports that 78 percent of their clients with developmental disabilities live within the home of a parent or
guardian. As these parents age and become more and more frail, their disabled adult children will require
alternative housing options. The SARC works to identify community-based housing providers for persons
living with a developmental disability; including licensed community care facilities and group homes; or
supervised and subsidized apartment settings for persons able to live more independently.
Senior Housing Solutions
Senior Housing Solutions (SHS), formerly Project Match, is a Milpitas-based non-profit organization that
offers affordable housing opportunities for seniors. Under its Group Residence Program, SHS provided

of the existing affordable living accommodations is in the process of being transferred to (Catholic)
Charities Housing. The existing facilities in Campbell include three homes that provide affordable rental
opportunities for 15 seniors.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Conventional building construction, use and demolition, as well as the manufacture of building materials
have multiple impacts on our environment. In the United States, the building industry accounts for:
            65 percent of electricity consumption
            30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions
            30 percent of raw materials use
            30 percent of landfill waste
            12 percent of potable water consumption
Energy Conservation Programs Offered through State and Federal Government
One of the primary goals behind establishing a green building program is to create a holistic, integrated
design approach to green building. A green building program considers a broad range of issues including
community and site design, energy efficiency, water conservation, resource-efficient material selection,
indoor environmental quality, construction management, and building maintenance. The end result will
be buildings that minimize the use of resources, are healthier for people, and reduce harm to the
environment.
In 2004, the State of California adopted legislation requiring LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) certification for new and renovated public buildings. Many local jurisdictions have
not only adopted similar standards for their public buildings, but have also required LEED certification or
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                            H-29

LEED equivalency for larger commercial and residential developments. LEED certification building
standards are one piece of a coordinated green building program to promote energy and resource
efficient buildings.
The City of Campbell is in compliance with State regulations to encourage “green” building techniques
which illustrates Campbell’s initiative to limit the environmental impact of municipal facilities, and also
sets an example for the community at large. The requirements of the CalGreen Program are currently
being implemented by the City. In addition, the recent building code amendments requiring increased
energy efficiency have also been adopted by the City in February of 2014.
The City has adopted a Construction and Demolition Debris Ordinance that requires the diversion of 50
percent of construction waste in accordance with the mandate of the California Waste Management Act.
Under the ordinance, contractors are required to recycle or reuse at least 50 percent of the construction
and demolition debris waste tonnage from demolition projects greater than 500 square feet, and all
renovations or additions to an existing structure or construction of a new structure, greater than 2,000
square feet or where the construction of the work exceeds $250,000, as determined by the Building
Official.
Both the public and private sectors currently offer grants, refunds, and other funding for green building.
In addition, developments built to green standards assist both the owners and tenants with energy and
maintenance costs over time. The following presents a variety of ways in which Campbell can promote
energy conservation and green building:
           Develop green (energy-efficient and environmentally-sensitive) building standards for public
            buildings.
           Provide incentives, such as expedited plan check, for private developments that are building
            green.
           Encourage higher densities and mixed-use development within walking distance of commercial
            and transit, thereby reducing vehicular trips and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
           Promote financial resources available through the California Energy Commission for use of solar
            panels.
           Provide resource materials and training opportunities regarding green building and energy
            conservation.
           Ensure compliance with CalGreen building code requirements.
The State of California and the Federal government also have programs designed to increase energy
efficiency and reduce energy costs for lower income families. Some of these programs include:
         Weatherization Assistance Program funded by the Department of Energy, is a program for
          delivering energy conservation services to low-income Californians (households with less than
          60% of the median income). The Weatherization Assistance Program reduces the heating and
          cooling costs for low-income families by improving the energy efficiency of their homes and
          ensuring their health and safety. Among low-income households, the program focuses on those
          with elderly residents, individuals with disabilities, and families with children. This program is
          provided through the Sacred Heart Community Service organization based out of San Jose.

        The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Block Grant – Funded by the Federal
         Department of Health and Human Services and provides two basic types of services. Eligible low-
         income persons (via local governmental and nonprofit organizations) can receive financial
         assistance to offset the costs of heating/cooling their dwellings, and/or have their dwellings
         weatherized to make them more energy efficient. This is accomplished through these three
         program components:
               The Weatherization Program provides free weatherization services to improve the energy
                  efficiency of homes, including attic insulation, weather-stripping, minor home repairs,
                  and related energy conservation measures.
               The Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible
                  households to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling dwellings.
               The Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP) provides payments for weather-related or
                  energy-related emergencies.
Energy Conservation Programs Offered through Local Utilities
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) provides both natural gas and electricity to residential consumers throughout
Santa Clara County. The company provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents and also
participates in several other energy assistance programs for lower-income households, which can help
qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and control electricity costs. In addition to supporting
green building efforts, Campbell also supports energy conservation by advertising utility rebate programs
and energy audits available through Pacific Gas and Electric, particularly connected to housing
rehabilitation programs. Some of these programs include the following:
        The California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program – Provides a 20 percent monthly
         discount on gas and electric rates to income qualified households, certain non-profits, facilities
         housing agricultural employees, homeless shelters, hospices and other qualified non-profit group
         living facilities.
        The Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program – Provides one-time
         emergency energy assistance to low income customers who have no other way to pay their energy
         bill. REACH aims to assist those who are in jeopardy of losing their electricity services, particularly
         the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and the unemployed, who experience severe hardships
         and are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs. Customers who have experienced an
         uncontrollable or unforeseen hardship may receive an energy credit up to $200.
        The Balanced Payment Plan (BPP) – Designed to eliminate big swings in a customer’s monthly
         payments by averaging energy costs over the year. On enrollment, PG&E averages the amount of
         energy used by the household in the past year to derive the monthly BPP amount. PG&E checks
         the household’s account every four months to make sure that its estimated average is on target.
         If the household’s energy use increases or decreases dramatically, PG&E will change the amount
         of monthly payment so that the household does not overpay or underpay too much over the
         course of a year.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                               H-31

      The Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program – PG&E’s rate reduction program for large
       households of three or more people with low- to middle-income. It enables large low-income
       large households to receive a Tier 3 (131 percent to 200 percent of baseline) electric rate
       reduction on their PG&E bill every month.
      Medical Baseline Allowance Program – PG&E offers additional quantities of energy at the lowest
       (baseline) price for residential customers that have special medical or heating/cooling needs
       because of certain medical needs.
      Energy Works Program/Energy Partners Program - The Energy Works Program provides qualified
       low-income tenants free weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances to reduce gas
       and electricity usage. In order to qualify for the program, a household’s total annual gross income
       cannot       exceed     the    income       as    set    in    the   income       guidelines    (see
       http://www.hacsc.org/energy_works_program.htm). Households must receive gas and/or
       electricity from PG&E and must not have participated in the Energy Partners Program in the past
       10 years.
      PG&E's SmartAC™ Program - This program offers a simple and convenient way to help prevent
       power interruptions. When customers sign up, PG&E installs a free SmartAC device that can
       slightly reduce the energy an air conditioner uses automatically in case of a state or local energy
       supply emergency. PG&E customers get $25 for signing up for the SmartAC™ program.

                                      identify housing units (including ownership and rental units in single-
                                      and multi-family buildings) that could qualify for rehabilitation
                                      assistance.
Policy H-1.2:    Green Buildings: Encourage the use of sustainable and green building design in new and
                 existing housing.
                 Program H-1.2a:      Green Buildings: The City is concerned about the continued
                                      availability of all resources for the development of affordable
                                      housing. The City of Campbell adopted the Green policies
                                      recommended by the Santa Clara County Cities Green Building

                                      LEED Silver certification for all new or renovated municipal
                                          buildings over 5,000 square feet.
                                   Campbell promotes its Green Building Program on the homepage of
                                   the City’s website, and provides an on-line version of its required
                                   Green Building Checklist. Furthermore, staff works closely with
                                   applicants early in the process to explain the City’s Green Building
                                   goals and the long-term financial and environmental benefits of
                                   integrating sustainable features in project design. The City will
                                   strengthen its green building codes in accordance with the State’s
                                   CalGreen building code.
                                   Implementation Objective: Implement the State’s CalGreen building
                                   codes to promote climate protection strategies. Promote green
                                   building and energy conservation on City website and through
                                   brochures.
Policy H-1.3:  Energy Efficiency: Energy costs can reduce the affordability of housing for lower income
               households. The City will continue to promote programs and opportunities for improved
               energy efficiency and weatherization. To address energy conservation in existing
               buildings, Campbell’s website promotes Pacific Gas and Electric utility assistance
               programs. These programs primarily serve extremely low and very low income
               households.
               Program H-1.3a:     Promote Energy Efficiency: Promote programs and activities that
                                   reduce residential energy usage in existing buildings. Campbell’s
                                   website will promotes Pacific Gas and Electric utility assistance
                                   programs, programs offered through non-profit agencies and other
                                   related programs.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City website will promote PG&E
                                   utility assistance programs, programs offered through non-profit
                                   agencies and other related programs. Information will also be
                                   provided at the Community Development Department public
                                   counter, library, and Community Center will also be provided.

Goal H-2:      Improve housing affordability for both renters and homeowners in Campbell.
Policy H-2.1:  Preservation of Affordable Housing: Work with property owners, tenants and non-profit
               purchasers to facilitate the preservation of assisted rental housing.
               Program H-2.1a:      Preservation of Assisted Housing: As of 2014, the City has a total of
                                    747 rent-restricted units in twelve developments in its jurisdiction.
                                    While none of these units is considered at high risk of conversion to
                                    market rate rents, two projects totaling 190 units are technically
                                    considered at-risk due to the need for continued renewals by the
                                    federal government of project-based Section 8 contracts. The City
                                    will take the following actions to facilitate long-term preservation of
                                    these units:
                                        Monitor the at-risk units by continuing to maintain close contact
                                         with property owners regarding their long-term plans for their
                                         properties.
                                        Participate in the preservation of at-risk units by providing
                                         financial and/or technical assistance (as may be available) to
                                         existing property owners and/or other organizations interested
                                         in purchasing and maintaining the properties should the owners
                                         be interested in selling.
                                        Conduct tenant education by:
                                         o   Notifying tenants at least one year prior to potential
                                             conversion to market-rate housing.
                                         o   Providing information regarding tenant rights and conversion
                                             procedures should an owner decide to convert his property
                                             to non-low-income use.
                                         o   Offering tenants information regarding Section 8 rental
                                             subsidies and other available assistance through City and
                                             County agencies as well as non-profit organizations.
                                    Implementation Objective: The City will maintain contact with the
                                    owners of the at-risk properties, and provide financial (if available) or
                                    other assistance as necessary to maintain the affordability of these
                                    at risk units.
               Program H-2.1b:      Preservation of Mobile Home Park Units: Continue to enforce the
                                    City’s Rental Increase Dispute Resolution program for mobile home
                                    park units to maintain the availability and affordability of mobile
                                    home units in Campbell. The City recently entered into an agreement
                                    with the Timber Cove Mobile Home Park to maintain unit
                                    affordability.
                                    Implementation Objective: Continue to implement the provisions of
                                    the ordinance to maintain the affordability of these units.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                            H-36

               Program H-2.1c:     Monitor Lower Income Household Displacement: As regional
                                   housing costs increase, lower income households may be forced to
                                   relocate (i.e. to be displaced) to find affordable housing. This can be
                                   caused either by landlords and investors seeking tenants that are
                                   able to pay higher rents or through the replacement of more
                                   affordable housing units with newer or more expensive market rate
                                   housing. The City will monitor issues associated with rising rental
                                   costs to try to maintain the availability and housing affordable to
                                   lower income households.
                                   Implementation Objective:           The City will monitor housing
                                   affordability in the community on an ongoing basis, will consider the
                                   impacts of new housing development on the existing supply of
                                   affordable housing throughout the development review process, and
                                   will consider possible strategies to address local displacement issues
                                   as they are identified.
Policy H-2.2:  Rental Assistance: Support the provision of rental assistance to lower-income
               households.
               Program H-2.2a:     Section 8 Rental Assistance: The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
                                   extends rental subsidies to very low-income households, including
                                   families, seniors, and the disabled. The Section 8 Program offers a
                                   voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market
                                   rent (FMR) and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e., 30% of
                                   household income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing
                                   that cost above the payment standard, provided the tenant pays the
                                   extra cost. Approximately 300 Campbell residents currently receive
                                   Section 8 assistance. Given the significant gap between market rents
                                   and what very low income households can afford to pay for housing,
                                   Section 8 plays a critical role in allowing such households to remain
                                   in the community, and is a key program in addressing the needs of
                                   extremely low and very low income households.
                                   Implementation Objective: Through the County Housing Authority,
                                   the City will continue to provide Section 8 rental assistance to
                                   extremely low to very low-income residents. The City will encourage
                                   landlords to register units with the Housing Authority.
Policy H-2.3:  Homeownership Opportunities: Support the provision of homeownership assistance to
               lower- and moderate-income households.
               Program H-2.3a:     Mortgage Credit Certificate: The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
                                   program is a federal program that allows qualified first-time home-
                                   buyers to take an annual credit against federal income taxes of up to
                                   15 percent of the annual interest paid on the applicant’s mortgage.
                                   This enables homebuyers to have more income available to qualify
                                   for a mortgage loan and make the monthly mortgage payments. The
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                          H-37

                                   value of the MCC must be taken into consideration by the mortgage
                                   lender in underwriting the loan and may be used to adjust the
                                   borrower’s federal income tax withholding. The MCC program has
                                   covenant restrictions to ensure the affordability of the participating
                                   homes for a period of 15 years. Eligible first time homebuyers may
                                   apply through their mortgage lenders to participate in this program.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City will continue to provide
                                   information and promote the County MCC program. The City will also
                                   continue to make available brochures of housing programs available
                                   and provide information about the program on the City’s web site.
               Program H-2.3b:     Foreclosure Prevention: While home foreclosures are not as
                                   prevalent in Campbell as in many other areas of the County, many
                                   residents are at-risk of defaulting on their mortgages and potentially
                                   losing their homes. Several area agencies provide foreclosure
                                   intervention counseling services, including Neighborhood Housing
                                   Services Silicon Valley, Project Sentinel, and/or Acorn Housing. The
                                   City will play an active role in promoting the services of these and
                                   other agencies to provide residents with the education and resources
                                   to help reduce foreclosures.
                                   Implementation Objective: Promote available foreclosure counseling
                                   services through the City website and quarterly newsletters.
Policy H-2.4:  Special Needs Housing: Assist in the provision of housing and supportive services to
               persons with special needs, including (but not limited to): seniors, single parents with
               children, persons with disabilities, the homeless, and those at risk of becoming homeless.
               Program H-2.4a:     Shared Housing Program: The City will continue to encourage and
                                   support the provision of shared housing opportunities in Campbell.
                                   Under a shared housing program, a home provider, a person who has
                                   a home to share, is matched with a home seeker, a person in search
                                   of a home to share.
                                   Implementation Objective: Continue to provide (if available)
                                   assistance for shared housing services to single-parent households,
                                   and extremely low, very low and low income populations (if
                                   available).
               Program H-2.4b:     Homeless Assistance/Shelter Provisions: The City will continue to
                                   support area non-profit agencies that serve the homeless and those
                                   at risk of becoming homeless. These agencies offer emergency
                                   shelters, transitional housing facilities, housing assistance, food,
                                   clothing, and job referrals to persons in need.

               Program H-2.4c:       Physically Accessible Housing: Development of new housing can
                                     provide an opportunity to increase the limited supply of
                                     handicapped-accessible housing in Campbell. As part of new
                                     residential development projects, the City will work with developers
                                     to integrate physically accessible units in new developments.
                                     Implementation Objective: The City will work with developers to
                                     increase the number of fully accessible housing units compliant with
                                     American with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.
               Program H-2.4d:       Persons with Disabilities. Coordinate with other agencies and
                                     organizations, such as San Andreas Regional Center (SARC), Housing
                                     Choices Coalition, and Bay Area Housing Coalition, in meeting the
                                     needs of persons with disabilities.
                                     Implementation Objective: (1) Work with San Andreas Regional
                                     Center to increase the availability of information on programs to
                                     assistance persons with disabilities. (2) Continue to provide support
                                     to area homeless shelters and service providers to serve extremely
                                     low and very low income populations (as resources are available). (3)
                                     Explore opportunities to assist in the provision of supportive housing
                                     opportunities for persons with disabilities.
Goal H-3:      Encourage the provision of housing affordable to a variety of household income
               levels.
Policy H-3.1:  Inclusionary Housing: Support the development of additional affordable housing by non-
               profit and for-profit developers through financial assistance and/or regulatory incentives.
               Ensure that new residential development in Campbell integrates units affordable to
               lower- and moderate-income households, or contributes funds to support affordable
               housing activities (when funding is available). Create additional levels of affordability
               within the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance in a way that does not create a governmental
               constraint to housing production.
               Program H-3.1a:       Inclusionary Housing Ordinance Implementation: Continue to
                                     implement the City-wide Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to require
                                     15 percent affordable units within for-sale new residential projects
                                     of ten or more units. For-sale housing is currently required to provide
                                     15 percent moderate units. Although the City’s Inclusionary Housing
                                     Ordinance requires rental housing to provide 15 percent very low and
                                     low income units, with at least six percent very low income and nine
                                     percent of low/moderate income, the City’s ability to enforce this

                                    requirement has been overruled by 2009 Palmer vs. City of Los
                                    Angeles court case.
                                    Implementation Objective: Continue to implement inclusionary
                                    housing requirements for all new projects as required by City
                                    Ordinance.
               Program H-3.1b:      Citywide Inclusionary Housing Ordinance Amendments: The City will
                                    also consider revisions to the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to
                                    allow for case-by-case determination on the appropriate percentage
                                    of low and moderate income units within the 15 percent total
                                    requirement for for-sale unit projects. The goal is to consider
                                    providing for greater affordability levels in addition to the Moderate
                                    income units currently required.
                                    Implementation Objective: Evaluate the appropriateness of
                                    amending the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to provide more
                                    flexibility for targeting lower affordability levels and to ensure that
                                    the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance and the City’s Density Bonus
                                    provisions are integrated in a manner consistent with State Law and
                                    recent court decisions. If updating the Ordinance is appropriate,
                                    complete the update within two years of the adoption of the Housing
                                    Element.
Goal H-4:      Provide adequate housing sites through appropriate land use and zoning
               designations to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs.
Policy H-4.1:  Residential Sites: Assist developers in identifying sites suitable for residential and mixed-
               use development, and facilitate development through the provision of financial and
               regulatory incentives, as appropriate.
               Program H-4.1a:      Housing Opportunity Site Inventory: As part of the update to the
                                    Housing Element, a parcel-specific analysis of vacant and
                                    underutilized sites was conducted to identify Opportunity Sites for
                                    development within the planning period. The Opportunity Sites
                                    analysis identifies five areas that have adequate capacity to address
                                    Campbell’s 2015-2023 housing production goals. In order to
                                    specifically encourage and facilitate development on these
                                    Opportunity Sites, the City will undertake the following actions:
                                          Contact property owners within the Opportunity Site Areas
                                           (during the Housing Element update process) to discuss the
                                           City’s desire to develop housing in these areas and the
                                           availability of financial and regulatory development incentives.
                                          Allow for reductions in parking for properties within 1/4 mile
                                           of light rail.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                            H-40

                                            Post the Housing Element sites inventory on the City’s website
                                             as a tool for developers, and provide as a handout at the public
                                             counter.
                                            Summarize the Planned Development (P-D) development
                                             standards, derived from applicable Area Plans and zoning
                                             districts, in the sites inventory to provide greater clarity to
                                             developers.
                                            Update on an annual basis in conjunction with the General Plan
                                             progress report.
                                            Provide technical assistance to property owners and
                                             developers, including assessor parcel data and information on
                                             density and design incentives.
                                            Assist developers in completing funding applications in support
                                             of development, and as appropriate, provide local funds
                                             and/or land as leverage if available.
                                     Implementation Objective: Maintain an active listing of residential
                                     and mixed-use Opportunity Sites, and update annually. Where
                                     appropriate, provide regulatory concessions and financial assistance
                                     to encourage new housing development (when funding is available).
Policy H-4.2:  Mixed-Use Development: Promote mixed-use development where housing is located
               near jobs, services, shopping, schools, and public transportation.
               Program H-4.2a:       Mixed-Use Development: The inclusion of residential uses in new
                                     mixed-use developments will be encouraged through the use of
                                     incentives such as reduced parking requirements, including shared
                                     parking between commercial and residential uses. Adding residential
                                     development along some of the City’s commercial corridors will
                                     create activity along the street, provide a variety of housing types
                                     near work, shopping and transportation, and enhance public safety.
                                     The City will ensure that residential development is included in the
                                     mixed-use projects on opportunity sites in order to address RHNA
                                     goals. Mixed-use development will be located next to sidewalks or
                                     landscape setback areas adjacent to the public street to enhance
                                     visibility, pedestrian access and interaction with the commercial
                                     uses. While maximum Floor Area Ratios (FARs) are contained in
                                     specific land use policies within each Master, Area or Specific Plan,
                                     residential units are not counted against the allowable FAR. Similarly,
                                     the commercial portion of the project does not count against the
                                     density of the residential portion. A reduction in the required open
                                     space for the residential component may be granted where site
                                     characteristics preclude fulfillment of the entire open space
                                     requirement. In this way, sites that are currently being occupied by
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                             H-41

                                    commercial uses may be redeveloped with residential and
                                    commercial uses, improving the financial feasibility of projects.
                                    Implementation Objective: The City will continue to allow and
                                    promote residential uses in conjunction with commercial and/or
                                    office uses in mixed use developments. The City may provide
                                    financial, technical, and/or other assistance to facilitate mixed-use
                                    development along commercial corridors and around transit stations
                                    (when funding is available).
Policy H-4.3:  Planned For Densities: To encourage the efficient and sustainable use of land, the City
               encourages residential development that is proposed near existing light rail stations
               (within 1/4 mile radius) and/or within the boundaries of the Winchester Boulevard
               Master Plan, East Campbell Avenue Master Plan, and all opportunity site areas, to achieve
               at least 75 percent of the maximum General Plan Land Use category densities.
               Program H-4.3a:      Achieve Target Densities. The City will work closely with property
                                    owners and developers to inform them of this policy and its purpose
                                    to encourage infill development, create pedestrian oriented areas,
                                    reduce vehicle miles travelled and improve air quality. Unique site
                                    circumstances relating to interface with adjoining residential
                                    properties will require a degree of flexibility as to the application of
                                    this policy to limit potential environmental impacts resulting from
                                    projects.
                                    Implementation Objective: Inform developers of policy to strive to
                                    achieve at least 75% of General Plan density within specified areas.
                                    Review development proposals for residential and mixed-use
                                    projects to strive to achieve “planned-for” densities within the
                                    specified areas of this policy.
Goal H-5:      Minimize the impact of potential governmental constraints on the maintenance,
               improvement and development of housing.
Policy H-5.1:  Institutional Capacity: Investigate options and opportunities for Campbell to restore the
               housing program staff resources to oversee the implementation of non-development-
               related the programs and activities. Some of the possible options to restore staff
               resources could include hiring additional City staff and/or partnering with other
               jurisdictions or non-profit organizations.
               Program H-5.1a:      Housing Program Staffing: Evaluate the feasibility of re-establishing
                                    a local housing program. The evaluation may include an evaluation
                                    of funding sources and partnership opportunities.
                                    Implementation Objective: Initiate this evaluation within 24 months
                                    of the adoption of the Housing Element. Complete the evaluation
                                    process with 12 months of initiation.
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                            H-42

               Program H-5.1b:      Affordable Housing Partnerships: Look for opportunities to partner
                                    with Santa Clara County, other cities, non-profit organizations, and
                                    for profit housing providers to preserve, rehabilitate, and construct
                                    affordable housing units in and around Campbell. For example, the
                                    City Council recently committed $250,000 as matching funds to a
                                    future affordable project with the Santa Clara County.
                                    Implementation Objective: At least every two years, the City will
                                    continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to partner with non-
                                    profit organizations to rehabilitate, preserve or create affordable
                                    housing The City will also monitor and evaluate opportunities to
                                    apply for affordable housing grants in conjunction with its non-profit
                                    partners.
Policy H-5.2:  Regulatory Incentives: Provide regulatory and/or financial incentives where appropriate
               to offset or reduce the costs of affordable housing development, including density
               bonuses and flexibility in site development standards.
               Program H-5.2a:      Density Bonus: In compliance with current State law, the City offers
                                    density bonuses and regulatory incentives/concessions to developers
                                    of affordable and/or senior housing in all residential zones.
                                    Applicants of residential projects of five or more units may apply for
                                    a density bonus and additional incentive(s) if the project provides for
                                    one of the following:
                                       10 percent of the total units for lower income households; or
                                       5 percent of the total units for very low income households; or
                                       A senior citizen housing development or mobilehome park that
                                           limits residency based on age requirements for housing for
                                           older persons; or
                                       10 percent of the total dwelling units in a condominium for
                                           moderate income households.
                                    As per State Law, the amount of density bonus varies according to
                                    the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units
                                    exceeds the established minimum percentage, but generally ranges
                                    from 20 to 35 percent above the specified General Plan density.
                                    In addition to the density bonus, eligible projects may receive one to
                                    three additional development incentives, depending on the
                                    proportion of affordable units and level of income targeted. The
                                    following development incentives may also be requested:
                                       A reduction in site development standards (e.g., setback and
                                           square footage requirements, and/or parking requirements) or
                                           architectural design requirements. At the request of the
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                           H-43

                                         developer, the City will permit a parking ratio (inclusive of
                                         handicapped and guest parking) of one space for 0-1 bedroom
                                         units, two spaces for 2-3 bedroom units, and 2½ spaces for four
                                         or more bedrooms.
                                      Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing
                                         project if nonresidential land uses would reduce the cost of
                                         individual units in the housing project, and the nonresidential
                                         land uses would be compatible with the housing project and
                                         adjoining development.
                                      Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the
                                         permit applicant or the City that would result in identifiable
                                         cost reductions.
                                   In addition, the City has approved the following set of concessions:
                                      Expedited processing pursuant to a mutually agreed upon
                                         schedule; and,
                                      Deferral of the collection of impact fees on market rate units
                                         until issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City will continue to offer density
                                   bonus and/or regulatory incentives/concessions to facilitate the
                                   development of affordable and/or senior housing. The City will
                                   advertise its density bonus provisions on its website, explain how
                                   density bonuses work in tandem with inclusionary requirements, and
                                   promote in discussions with prospective development applicants.
               Program H-5.2b:     Parking Standard Modifications: In addition to parking reductions
                                   available to affordable and senior housing projects under the City’s
                                   density bonus ordinance, Campbell’s Planning Commission has the
                                   authority to determine that certain circumstances warrant an
                                   adjustment to a project’s parking requirements. Such circumstances
                                   include, but are not limited to, the proximity of a project to light rail
                                   stations, transit corridors, or major employment centers. The
                                   Commission may also allow for shared parking for mixed-use
                                   projects.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City will continue to offer modified
                                   parking standards, on a case-by-case basis, as a way to facilitate
                                   development of projects with reduced parking demands.
Policy H-5.3:  Secondary Dwelling Units: Provide for the infill of modestly priced rental housing by
               encouraging secondary units in residential neighborhoods.
               Program H-5.3a:     Secondary Dwelling Units: A secondary dwelling unit is a separate
                                   dwelling unit that provides complete, independent living facilities for
                                   one or more persons. It includes permanent provisions for living,
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                           H-44

                                   sleeping, cooking, eating, and sanitation on the same parcel as the
                                   primary unit is situated. Given the limited developable land
                                   remaining in Campbell, integrating secondary dwelling units in
                                   existing residential neighborhoods presents an opportunity for the
                                   City to accommodate needed rental housing. The development of
                                   secondary dwelling units is effective in dispersing affordable housing
                                   throughout the City and can provide housing to lower-income
                                   persons, including seniors and college students. Approximately 1,000
                                   single-family parcels in Campbell are of sufficient size to add a
                                   secondary dwelling unit.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City will facilitate the construction of
                                   new secondary dwelling units by making information available to the
                                   public.
Policy H-5.4:  Ordinance Updates: Update the Municipal Code as needed to comply with changes to
               State Law and local conditions relating the housing production and affordability.
               Program H-5.4a:     Periodic Ordinance Amendments: Update the Municipal Code as
                                   needed to comply with changes to State Law and local
                                   conditions/needs.
                                   Implementation Objective: Initiate and complete the amendment
                                   process to comply with the new requirements within 12 months of
                                   being notified of the requirement.
Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
Goal H-6:      Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing of their choice.
Policy H-6.1:  Fair Housing: Support the provision of fair housing services.
               Program H-6.1a:     Fair Housing Program: The City will continue to support programs
                                   that provide fair housing information and referral to Campbell
                                   residents. Project Sentinel, a non-profit organization, offers fair
                                   housing investigative and enforcement services in northern
                                   California, including Santa Clara County. The organization also
                                   conducts educational seminars for owners and managers of rental
                                   property, as well as free workshops for tenants to address rights and
                                   responsibilities. Project Sentinel receives funding from local cities
                                   and counties as well as the federal Department of Housing and Urban
                                   Development (HUD). The City of Campbell will continue to allocate a
                                   portion of its Business License Fees to support Project Sentinel and
                                   promote the services of the organization.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City will coordinate with Project
                                   Sentinel to conduct training for Campbell rental property owners and
                                   managers to provide information on standard lease agreements, and
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                          H-45

                                   tools to address problem tenants within the parameters of fair
                                   housing law. The City will provide fair housing information through
                                   its website and through the Profile, a quarterly newsletter that goes
                                   out to all Campbell households. In addition, fair housing posters will
                                   be posted at City Hall, the community center, and the library.
Policy H-6.2:  Rights of Tenants and Landlords: Assist in educating tenants and landlords, and settling
               disputes between the two parties.
               Program H-6.2a:     Rental Dispute Mediation Program: The purpose of the Rental
                                   Increase Dispute Resolution Ordinance is to permit landlords a fair
                                   and reasonable return on the value of their property while protecting
                                   tenants from excessive and unreasonable rent increases. The
                                   ordinance establishes a process for the resolution of tenant/landlord
                                   disputes concerning rent, housing services or proposed evictions.
                                   Under the ordinance, landlords must provide a 60-day written notice
                                   of the amount of a rent increase to tenants if the rent increase is 10
                                   percent or higher.
                                   Under the Rent Mediation Program, Campbell renters and rental
                                   property owners of four or more units participate in counseling,
                                   conciliation, and mediation regarding their rights and responsibilities
                                   under California tenant/landlord law. Participation in the program is
                                   mandatory, but the outcome is advisory.
                                   Implementation Objective: The City will continue to enforce the
                                   Rental Increase Dispute Resolution Ordinance and offer a Rent
                                   Mediation Program. The City will continue to make program
                                   brochures available at the public counter and other public locations.
                                   The City will also continue to mail out to new rental property owners
                                   a packet of information regarding the City’s Rent Mediation Program
                                   as well as contact information for tenant/landlord and fair housing
                                   services.
Policy H-6.3:  Housing Accessibility: Address the special needs of persons with disabilities through
               provision of supportive housing, homeowner accessibility grants, and provision of
               reasonable accommodation procedures.
               Program H-6.3a:     Reasonable Accommodation: The City will monitor its reasonable
                                   accommodation procedure for its effectiveness and potential
                                   impacts on housing for persons with disabilities. For example, the City
                                   will evaluate factors used to determine a reasonable accommodation
                                   request such as: the potential benefit of the requested modification,
                                   and impact on surrounding uses listed in the City’s zoning code to
                                   ensure they do not act as a constraint. The review will be conducted
                                   as part of the City’s Housing Element Annual Report submitted to the
                                   State and will evaluate criteria such as:
 Final Housing Element – City of Campbell                                                          H-46

                                         Revisions to initial applications
                                         Number of requests declined
                                         Reasons for declining request
                                    The City will evaluate potential revisions to its reasonable
                                    accommodation procedure as appropriate based on this annual
                                    evaluation.
                                    Implementation Objective: (1) The City will provide annual
                                    monitoring to ensure the reasonable accommodation procedure
                                    does not act as a constraint on housing for persons with disabilities.
                                    The responsible agency for this program shall be the Community
                                    Development Department which will also mitigate identified
                                    constraints. This monitoring program shall submit its findings
                                    annually as part of the Housing Element Annual Report submitted to
                                    the State. (2) Within two years, the City will specifically evaluate
                                    the procedure’s findings of approval and modify the Ordinance
                                    as appropriate to ensure its compliance with the requirements
                                    of State Law.
Extremely Low Income Households
Housing Element statutes also require an analysis of the needs of extremely low income (<30% AMI)
households, and programs to assist in the creation of housing for this population. The Campbell Housing
Element sets forth several programs that help to address the needs of Extremely Low Income households,
including: Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (Program H-1.1a); Preservation of Assisted Housing
(Program H-2.1a); Section 8 Rental Assistance (Program H-2.2a); Shared Housing (Program H-2.5a);
Homeless Assistance/Shelter Provisions (Program H-2.5b); and Reasonable Accommodation provisions
(Program H-6.3a).

DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
Land Uses
Mixed residential, office and commercial/retail uses are encouraged throughout the area
west of the railroad tracks.
Development Intensity
Allowable density for non-residential uses shall be a floor area ratio (FAR) of up to 1.0:1.
Residential development is allowed up to a maximum density of 20 units per gross acre,
and will not be counted against the allowable floor area ratio.
Parcel Consolidation
Property owners are encouraged to consolidate property to provide more logical building
sites and coordinated development formats.
Generally, sites of greater than three acres will be permitted to maximize densities under
the development intensity standards referred above. Project densities on parcels of
smaller size will be reduced on a sliding scale as indicated below:
                                    ACRES         FAR
                                  Up to .99        0.3
                                  1.0 to 1.99      0.6
                                  2.0 to 2.99      0.8
                                  3.0              1.0
Consolidated or larger parcels will also be permitted to mix residential and non-
residential uses up to the maximum densities allowed.
Joint use of parking facilities may be possible with mixed use development formats on
larger parcels.
Traffic
Development proposals shall assess the impact of project traffic and will be responsible
for mitigating traffic impacts.
Density
A density bonus of up to 25% may be permitted for projects which provide below market
rate housing or housing which meets a special community-wide need such as housing for
the handicapped or housing for the elderly.

The maximum floor area ratio for hotel or motel uses shall be 1.0.
Density Bonus Policy
The City shall grant a density bonus for projects, which meet the requirements contained
in the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance.
Project Design
Residential Entries
Entries to residential units along a public street shall be oriented to the street.
Public Street Elevations
The public street elevation of residential projects should create a neighborhood
appearance and provide visual interest by incorporating architectural elements such as
porches, projecting eaves and overhangs, dormer elements, variation in building wall
planes and roof elements and well-defined unit entries. The building design should
provide a pedestrian scale, which reduces the perceived mass of the structures.
Visibility into Private Developments
Residential projects shall be designed to provide visibility into the core of the project
where the project adjoins streets or the Los Gatos Creek Trail. Public parking for trail
users should be provided where possible.
Building Mass along Los Gatos Creek
Structures adjoining the Los Gatos Creek Trail shall be designed to minimize the
perceived mass of the building as viewed from the Trail and to enhance the project’s
appearance as viewed from Highway 17. The following techniques may be utilized to
accomplish this objective:
        • Minimize the width of building elevations facing the trail (eg: orient the side
             of the structure towards the trail).
        • Provide movement and variation in building wall planes.
        • Provide variation in roof elements.
        • Step-back upper story elements away from the Creek Trail.
        • Provide tree species with large, dense canopies to screen the structures.
Access to the Los Gatos Creek Trail
Additional public pedestrian/bicycle access points to the Los Gatos Creek Trail should be
provided in the SOCA area. The City should evaluate future projects for opportunities to
provide additional public access connections.
Trail Amenities
Projects adjacent to the Los Gatos Creek Trail shall provide trail amenities such as
drinking fountains and benches along the trail for public use, as appropriate
                                              A1-7

Campbell General Plan
Grading
Grading for projects in Area 2 should reflect and retain the natural topography of the site.
Parking
The City shall ensure that new projects provide adequate on-site parking to meet the
project’s parking demands. The City may require the submission of parking studies as
necessary to document that project parking needs are fulfilled on-site. Shared parking
arrangements may be considered for mixed use projects. The City shall require the
necessary parking studies to ensure that adequate on-site parking is provided under the
shared parking concept.
Structured Parking Facilities
Structured parking facilities shall be submerged to the maximum extent possible.
Structured parking shall be architecturally treated to be consistent with the overall
architectural design of the building.
Circulation
Dillon Ave. Extension
In Area 2, the roadway system should provide an extension of Dillon Avenue to improve
circulation, provide emergency vehicle access and integrate projects in this area.
Emergency vehicle access should be extended to the southern portions of Area 2. The
feasibility and desirability of extending street access to the southern portions of Area 2
should be evaluated in conjunction with review of project proposals.
Dell Ave./Camden Ave.
In conjunction with new development in Area 5, safety improvements to the on and off-
ramps from San Tomas Expressway to Dell Avenue should be evaluated. Consideration
should be given to abandonment of the existing road linking Dell Avenue to Camden
Avenue and construction of an extension of Dell Avenue easterly to Camden Avenue.
Landscaping
Street Tree Plan
The City shall develop a specific street tree plan for the SOCA area, which identifies the
tree species that will be required along streets in the area. The City shall also develop a
streetscape standard for Railway Avenue, including plant materials, pedestrian walks,
pedestrian lighting and street furniture.
Views from Highway 17 and the Creek Trail
Landscaping shall be located to screen and filter views of buildings. Tree groves shall be
provided along the eastern edge of Areas 2 and 3 to screen projects as viewed from
Highway 17 and the Los Gatos Creek Trail.
Project Tree Types
Projects shall incorporate a mix of evergreen and deciduous tree types to provide tree
screening throughout the year.

                                                                    Appendix A1: SOCA
Fencing along Los Gatos Creek
Solid fencing is strongly discouraged along the Los Gatos Creek Trail. Applicants are
encourage to use landscaping to define project boundaries along the Creek Trail frontage
rather than fencing.
Naturalized Plant Materials
Naturalized plant species are encouraged immediately adjacent to the creek trail.
Public Improvements
Area Wide Improvements
Project applicants shall be required to participate in SOCA area-wide improvements, as
specified in conditions of approval.
Light Rail Transit
Light rail transit is strongly encouraged on the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way,
including resident-serving light rail stations.

San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
  INTRODUCTION
  The purpose of the San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan is to provide a coherent framework for
  development in the San Tomas Area. This document establishes land use and transportation policies
  for use in the San Tomas Area. The Plan serves several purposes. Most importantly it establishes
  specific policies to preserve the unique character of the San Tomas Area and enhance the quality of
  life for its residents. In addition, the Plan serves as an educational resource to guide building or
  remodeling in the San Tomas Area.
  The San Tomas Area is a residential neighborhood equaling approximately 1-1/2 square miles located in the
  southwest portion of the City. The area is unique in that it retains a more informal character than other parts
  of Campbell, in part due to the large, often irregular lots and to the lack of standard curbs, gutters and
  sidewalks along its streets.

                                                                                                           Page -1-
San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
Since 1980, the City recognized the San Tomas Area as unique in terms of its rural character and has
maintained a policy of:
        1.       Maintaining the area as low-density residential
        2.       Encouraging larger-than-minimum lot sizes
        3.       Encouraging the planting of trees, shrubs, greenery and other landscaping materials in new
                 developments.
        4.       Preserving existing trees and shrubs
        5.       Considering alternate street improvements in appropriate areas
In 1991, the Campbell City Council authorized the San Tomas Study to review land use and transportation
policies for the San TomasArea. The Study responded to concerns raised by residents of the San Tomas
Area over recent projects considered out of character with the area and concerns about increasing traffic in
the neighborhood. The San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan is the result of the San Tomas Study.
The Plan was developed after extensive public participation. Approximately 30 meetings were held
in the nine month period between January 1993 and September 1993. The land use and transportation
policies contained in the Plan were developed by residents of the San Tomas Area and City
representatives through a series of neighborhood workshops.
The San Tomas Study began in January 1993 with a kick-off meeting which all residents and property
owners of the San Tomas Area were invited to attend. At the kick-off meeting, the San Tomas Area
was divided into four neighborhoods. Residents in each area selected seven representatives to serve
on a neighborhood work group.
Work group members represented their neighborhood in meetings with staff to develop goals and
suggested policies for their neighborhood. Meetings were held with residents in each neighborhood
to allow them an opportunity to comment on the recommendations made by their neighborhood work
group.
The goals developed by each neighborhood work group were then forwarded to the San Tomas Study
Task Force which reconciled the various neighborhood policies and drafted the San Tomas
Neighborhood Plan. The Task Force was comprised of the following representatives:
        •        Two members from each neighborhood work group
        •        Two members of the City Council
        •        Two members of the Planning Commission
        •        The City’s Architectural Advisor
                                                                                                        Page -2-

San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
Upon completion of the draft plan, the San Tomas Task Force held an area-wide meeting where the plan
was presented and discussed. Based on input from the area-wide meeting, the plan was modified and sent
to the Planning Commission and City Council for public hearings.
In addition to extensive public participation, the Plan is noteworthy because it is Campbell’s first neighborhood
plan. The Plan recognizes the unique qualities of the San Tomas Area and serves as a blueprint for the
concrete steps to be taken to preserve the neighborhood. As such, the San Tomas Area Neighborhood
Plan may serve as model for other areas of the City.
In 1998, the City Council authorized a limited review of the San Tomas Plan focusing on street standards and
minor additions to existing single family homes. Staff held several community meetings and surveyed residents
regarding the two issues. The amendments where then scheduled for public hearings before the Planning
Commission and City Council in late 1999 and early 2000.
                                                                                                             Page -3-

LAND USE ISSUES
Goal Statement
These policies are intended to preserve the unique qualities of the San Tomas Area. New development
and additions should respect and enhance the best aspects of the area. The San Tomas Area will remain a
primarily low-density single family residential area.
Objectives
        1.       Ensure that the size of homes are in proportion to lot size.
        2.       New developments and additions to existing homes should be integrated with homes in the
                 surrounding area.
        3.       Ensure that projects in planned developments zones are compatible with the surrounding
                 area.
        4.       Use landscaping to enhance the rural characteristics of the area.
        5.       Establish criteria to determine larger than minimum lot size.
Land Use Policies

         Additions in excess of .45 FAR maybe added
         to existing single family homes when the fol-
         lowing criteria are met:
         1. The total building area does not exceed a
             .50 FAR
         2. The home has been finaled for occupancy
             for at least one year
         3. The property owner applies for site and architectural approval
         4. The Planning Commission provides notice in accordance with the Municipal Code
         5. The Planning Commission makes the following findings and approves the addition:
             a. the addition is a simple extension along existing building lines
             b. it complies with the STANP design guidelines
             c. it is compatible with the architecture of the existing home and the adjacent neighborhood
         6. The lot area is less than 8,000 square feet.
         7. A property with a net lot area of 8,000 to 8,999 square feet may add to an existing home,
             as long as the sum of all floor area of the home does not exceed 4,000 square feet regardless
             of the FAR.
   D.    Exceptions for Legal Non-Conforming Lots
         1.       The property owner of a legally created lot that does not meet the minimum lot size
                  requirement for the district in which it is located (e.g. a 6,000 square foot lot located
                  in an R-1-10 zoning district) is permitted an exception, as provided below, to the side
                  and rear setbacks and lot coverage requirements.
         2.       The side and rear setbacks and lot coverage requirements for legal nonconforming
                  lots shall be based on the standards of the zoning district in which the lot would be
                  conforming (e.g. the setback and lot coverage requirement for a 6,000 square foot lot
                  in an R-1-10 zoning district would be based on the standards for the R-1-6 zoning
                  district.)

           1.     Extensions only apply to first story additions that are not detrimental to the public health,
                  safety or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood (e.g. an addition
                  in the front yard area along an existing building wall may not be placed in a manner that
                  impairs pedestrian or vehicular safety.)
           2.     The extension may maintain existing setbacks but shall not further encroach into any required
                  setback area.
           3.     All second story additions must comply with the standards for the San Tomas Area.

      2.      The minimum lot width for all newly created parcels on the bulb of a cul-de-sac shall be 60
              feet.
H.    Front Yard Paving
      A minimum of 50% of the required front yard setback area must remain unpaved. Increases in the

             Code.
J.    Landscaping
      1.     All new developments shall be required to provide a minimum of one tree per 2,000 square
             feet of net lot area. Existing trees within the net lot area shall be included in the total. All new
             trees shall be planted within the net lot area.
      2.     All new development shall comply with the Water Efficient Landscape Guidelines, as adopted
             by the City Council, for retention of existing plant materials.
K.    Site and Architectural Review
      1.     Construction of a building or structure on an undeveloped lot in an R-1-8, R-1-9, R-1-10
             and R-1-16 Zoning District shall be permitted only after the project receives site and
             architectural approval by the Planning Commission. The requirements for site and architectural
             approval are set forth in Chapter 21.42 of the Campbell Municipal Code.
      2.     Construction of a building or structure on an undeveloped lot in an R-1-6 Zoning District
             and additions to existing structures in all single family residential zoning districts shall be

             and the City Council to evaluate proposed new developments and additions to existing
             developments in the San Tomas Area.
             Intent
             The San Tomas Area has a distinct character from the rest of Campbell. The criteria contained
             in this section have been developed to protect and reinforce the desirable characteristics of
                                                                                                     Page -10-
San  Tomas       Area
Neighborhood Plan
           this area. The criteria are intended to provide guidance to applicants and consistency in design
           review.
           The criteria apply basic design principles which are general in nature and reflect the major
           concerns of neighborhood compatibility and site planning, including the relationship of a home
           to its neighbors. In an existing neighborhood, such as the San Tomas Area, new development
           and additions to existing homes should have their own design integrity while incorporating
           some design elements and materials found in the neighborhood. These criteria are not in-
           tended to prescribe a specific style or design.
           Compatibility
           1.        New homes and additions to existing homes should incorporate representative archi-
                     tectural features of homes in the San Tomas Area such as, shape, form, roof pitch, and
                     materials. Architectural design features historically found in the San Tomas Area are
                     described below. New projects should avoid abrupt changes that result from intro-
                     ducing radically different designs or sizes of structures.
                     Some projects have utilized design features that are not commonly found in the area
                     and are out of scale with surrounding homes. Special care must be used when intro-
                     ducing design features not commonly found in the area to ensure they are architectur-
                     ally compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
                     Architectural features historically found in the San TomasArea include the following:
                     •        Simple rectangular shaped forms
                     •        Simple rooflines: gabled or hipped
                     •        Shallow window fenestration
                     •        Visually light roof materials (composition, shingles)
                     •        Wood siding or stucco exteriors
                     •        One or two car garages (detached and attached)
                     Features not commonly found in the area include:
                     •        Complex shapes
                     •        Complex rooflines
                     •        Tall two story entry ways or heavy columns
                     •        Complex window fenestration
                     •        Stucco with heavy moldings
                                                                                                     Page -11-

San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
          2.       Use exterior materials compatible with homes in the San Tomas Area.
          3.       New homes and additions to existing homes should not be “walled-off” from
                   adjacent homes as viewed from the street.
          4.       Front yard landscape similar to the adjacent home is encouraged.
          Scale & Mass
          Building scale refers to the proportional relationship of a structure in relation to objects
          next to it, such as other buildings or people. Building mass is the size of a structure.
          1.       The perceived scale and mass of new homes should be compatible with homes in
                   the surrounding area. Minimize the use of design features that accentuates the size
                   of new houses so that they do not appear significantly larger than the adjacent homes.
                   This can be accomplished by minimizing the use of two story vertical deisgn elements
                   such as turrets and two story entry ways, where possible, use one and a half story
                   designs with dormers or partial two story designs.
             Not Desirable
                                                         Desirable
                                                                                             Page -12-

San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
        2      The perceived scale and mass of a proposed addition to an existing home should be
               of a similar shape and form as those in the original house. The perceived scale and
               mass should also be compatible with homes in the surrounding area.
        3.     Architectural elements within the design of new homes and additions to existing
               homes should be in proportion to the overall home design.
        Surface Articulation (Changes within wall and roof planes)
        1.     The amount of wall and roof plane articulation should be similar to adjacent homes.
               Most of the homes in the area have simple geometric shapes and forms. The homes
               are usually comprised either of one or more rectangular shapes with gable or hipped
               roofs or with intersecting pitched roofs.
        2.     Design of homes should avoid long unarticulated wall and roof planes especially, on
               two story elevations.
               a.      Changes within the wall and roof planes can be accomplished when one of
                       the forms is setback several feet or when a gable end fronts the street, and
                       through the use of porches that run across the front of the house.
               b.      Changes within the wall and roof planes can also be accomplished through
                       the textural use of materials. This is seen in the use of horizontal wood lap
                       siding, wood trip around windows and doors and shingle textures on the
                       roofs.
                                                                                              Page -13-

            Building Orientation
            1.      New homes and additions to existing homes should be located on the lot in a
                    similar manner as adjacent homes within the current setback requirements.
            2.      Garages should not dominate the front facade. To limit the prominence of
                    garages, projects shall incorporate at lease one of the measures below. This
                    section shall apply to new garages and additions to existing garages.
                    a.      Garages placed in front of the house should not exceed 50% of the
                            linear front elevation with the remainder of the elevation devoted to
                            living area or porch.
                    b.      Garages exceeding 50% of the linear front elevation shall either:
                            (1)      Recess the garage from the front wall of the house a minimum
                                     of five feet.
                            (2)      Provide an entry porch or trellis extending the front of the
                                     face of the garage.
                    c.      Orient the entry to the garage away fron the street.
                    d.      Other similar features as approved by the Community Development
                            Director.
            Exterior Design Variation
            1.      Exterior elevations should be significantly varied with a project. To accomplish
                    this:
                    a.      No two idential elevations should be adjacent to one another nor
                            directly across the street from one another, including mirror image
                            elevations.
                    b.      No more than 25% of the homes on a block should have the same
                            elevation.
                                                                                             Page -14-
San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
       2.      Significant varied exterior elevations means substantial changes in the shape, mass,
               roofline, front entry treatment, window usage and materials that can be seen in the
               designs.
       Grading
       Most of the homes in the San Tomas Area have pad heights close to natural grade. To avoid
       accentuating the height of buildings and to ensure the privacy of existing adjacent homes,
       grading should be limited to the minimum amount necessary to provide adequate drainage.
       Privacy Impacts
       1.      Most privacy impacts are due to the number, placement and size of second floor
               windows. To minimize adverse impacts on neighboring properties, carefully place
               windows (by studying sightlines) to avoid privacy impacts on neighboring backyards.
               Methods to accomplish this include, but are not limited to, the following:
               a.       Use smaller windows to help minimize the perception of privacy invasion.
               b.       Place sills up as high as possible in conformance with building codes.
       2.      If large windows are desired, plant non-deciduous trees in the sightline corridor
               to obscure views.
                                                                                             Page -15-
   San Tomas Area
   Neighborhood Plan
              3.      Second floor decks oriented toward the side and rear yards can be a source of privacy
                       invasion to the backyards of adjacent homes. To avoid this:
                      a.       Minimize the size of decks.
                      b.       Use a solid wall instead of an open railing (especially towards the sideyards).
              Integration of Additions with the Existing Home
              1.      Exterior materials of a proposed addition should match the existing home, unless the
                      entire exterior is being replaced to match the new addition.
              2.      Integrate second story additions into the overall design of the house in order to avoid
                      a “tacked on” appearance.
              3.      The design of the addition should be consistent with the original home. This means
                      that materials and architectural elements are used in a consistent manner. The design
                      of the home should also be visually compatible with the adjacent design.
              4.      The rooflines of the addition including roof slope should be consistent with the existing
                      house, unless a steeper slope is needed to accommodate a one and a half story design.
              5.      New windows should either match the style, material and color of the original windows
                      or the original windows should be replaced to match the ones used on the addition.
              6.      New window treatments should also be in keeping with the styles found in the adjacent
                      homes.
L.    General Plan/Zoning Amendments
      The criteria below should be applied to amendments to change the General Plan and/or the Zoning
      Designation of parcel(s) in the San TomasArea.
      1.      The proposed general plan and/or zoning designation should be at least equal to the predominate
              general plan and/or zoning designation of parcels contiguous to, or directly across a public
              right-of-way from the subject site.
                                                                                                    Page -16-

   San Tomas Area
   Neighborhood Plan
     2.      Notwithstanding the above, existing parcels that are designated for single family residential
             develoment which are contiguous to other parcels designated for single family residential must
             remain designated for single family residential.
     3.      With the exception of parcels directly abutting Winchester Boulevard, no General Plan
             Amendment in the San TomasArea should exceed the low-medium density classification of 6-
             13 units per acre.
     4.      In situations where no general plan and/or zoning designation is predominant, the Planning
             Commission and City Council shall determine the appropriate general plan and/or zoning
             designation based upon land use factors specific to the subject site. The factors to be considered
             include, but are not limited to, the following:
             •        Compatibility with adjoining land uses
             •        Privacy Impacts
             •        Traffic
             •        Noise
     5.      Notice of a public hearing for a General Plan and/or Zoning Amendment shall be as specified
             in Chapter 21.78 of the Campbell Municipal Code. In addition, a notice containing the time,
             place and general purpose of the hearing shall be placed at the project site at least 10 days
             prior to the meeting.
M.   Planned Development Zones
     The standards below shall apply to Planned Development (PD) projects in the San TomasArea:
     Low Density Residential Projects (less than six units per acre)
     1.      Low density residential projects in PD zones shall conform with the standards for single family
             development contained with this document and the Campbell Municipal Code, except that
             private local access streets shall be permitted when there is a home owner’s association
             established to maintain them.
     2.      In addition to the parking requirements for single family homes specified in Section 21.50.50
             of Campbell Municipal Code, low density residential PD projects shall provide shared guest
             parking totaling two spaces per unit. Spaces located in the driveways of the units shall not be
             included as guest parking.
                                                                                                      Page -17-

San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
    3.    The minimum lot size for low density residential projects in PD zones shall be at least equal to
          the predominant minimum lot size requirement of parcels contiguous to, or directly across a
          public right-of-way from the subject site.
          a.       In situations where no minimum lot size requirement is predominant, the Planning
                   Commission and City Council shall determine the appropriate minimum lot size based
                   upon land use factors specific to the subject site.
          b.       The minimum lot size shall not include the private local access street, common areas or
                   open space areas.
          c.       Common areas and open space areas are exempt from the minimum lot size
                   requirements.
    Low-Medium Density Projects (6-13 units per acre)
    1.    Low-Medium density developments in PD zones shall be compatible with the existing
          neighborhood. To integrate new projects with the neighborhood, low-medium density
          developments should conform to the following criteria:
          a.       To the extent possible, the public street elevation of any unit or building group shall
                   foster the appearance of single family residential design. The width of the individual
                   units should be expressed architecturally on the exterior elevation.
          b.       Building design shall contain traditional single family architectural elements. These
                   elements may include, but are not limited to, defined entries, porches, projecting eaves
                   and overhangs. The intent of this criteria is to provide a single-family residential scale
                   and help reduce building mass.
          c.       The entry way of units adjacent to a public street shall be oriented to the public street
                   and should not be walled-off or inward oriented. The backs of units and privacy
                   fences should not face public streets.
          d.       The appearance of attached garages shall be minimized by incorporating the measures
                   listed below, or other similar measures as approved by the Community Development
                   Director:
                   (1)      Limit garage doors to no more than 50% of the linear front elevation of a unit
                            or building group, with the remainder of the elevation devoted to living area or
                            porch.
                   (2)      Garages which exceed 50% of the front elevation shall either:
                            •        Provide an entry porch with a porch roof or trellis extending in front of
                                     the face of the garage.
                            •        Recess the garage from the front wall of the house a minimum of five
                                     feet.
                                                                                                    Page -18-

San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
  2.   The maximum height for a low-medium density development shall be 28 feet and not exceed
       2-1/2 stories.
  3.   Buildings shall be setback 15’ from the property line of adjacent parcels and the public right-
       of-way, except that garages or carports shall be 25’ from any public right-of-way.
                                                                                             Page -19-

TRANSPORTATION ISSUES
Goal Statement
The City should manage and develop the transportation system in the area to retain the rural character while
providing for adequate traffic, pedestrian and bicycle circulation and safety. For local streets it is undesirable
to introduce urban street standards in those neighborhoods that have remained rural.
Objectives
1.       Maintain the rural appearance of the local streets in the San Tomas Area.
2.       Take the minimum amount of right-of-way and provide only the minimum street widths necessary to
         maintain appropriate traffic function and safety.
3.       Match the actual use of streets with their functional classification and also provide for a more uniform
         physical appearance along all streets.
4.       Traffic through the area should be discouraged and routed via Winchester Boulevard, Pollard Road,
         Quito Road and Campbell Avenue.
Transportation Policies
 A.      Truck Routes
         Truck routes in the San TomasArea should be restricted to arterial routes and only those collectors
         where the predominant abutting land uses are commercial and industrial. This means that only Pollard
         Road andWinchester Boulevard are truck routes within the SanTomasArea and the Campbell Municipal
         Code should be changed accordingly.
 B.      Street Design Standard Implementation Policies
         1.       New Streets
                  All newly created streets shall be designed and built according to the San Tomas Public
                  Improvement Plan and the corresponding City Standard details. New streets shall be improved
                  with rolled curbs for improved drainage.
                                                                                                            Page -20-
San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan
    2.   Existing Streets
         Existing streets are required to be improved consistent with the San Tomas Street Improvement
         Plan (attached).
                  a.       Any proposed new development located on those streets identified for street
                           improvements would be required to dedicate right-of-way to the predominant
                           dimension and construct the street to the predominant street width,
                           install curb, gutters, sidewalks and street lights, as necessary.
    3.   Deferred ImprovementAgreements
         Deferred improvement agreements may be taken in lieu of installation of street improvements
         in the San Tomas Area, as determined by the City Engineer.
    4.   Removal of Existing Improvements
         Property owners may apply for an encroachment permit to remove existing improvements that
         are not required under the San Tomas Street Improvement Plan. The property owner shall
         remove these improvements at their cost.
    5.   Return of Excess Right-of-Way
         Property owners may request that any right-of-way no longer necessary under this policy be
         reverted to the property owner. The City’s current procedures for vacation of excess right-of-
         way will apply.
    6.   Existing Deferred Street Improvement Agreements
         Previous practice has created a number of secured improvement agreements for properties
         which under the current San Tomas Policy will no longer be required. A notice of fulfillment of
         the agreement will be recorded and the securities returned.
    7.   Exceptions
         All exceptions to the policies contained in this document shall be subject to review and approval
         by the City Council.
                                                                                             Page -21-

        BACKGROUND
The Downtown is the birth place of Campbell. Established in the late 1800’s as an
agricultural community, Campbell was one of the largest processed fruit exporters in the
country. The City incorporated in 1952, and by that time the Downtown was firmly
established as the commercial, civic and cultural center of the City. Since the 1970’s,
the Downtown core has been defined as the area along East Campbell Avenue bound
by the loop streets, Civic Center Drive and Orchard City Drive. Historically, this stretch
of East Campbell Avenue, especially between Second Street and the light rail tracks,
has provided a full range of retail and commercial services and has been the heart of
the city. In the late 1960's and 1970's, the area declined in importance due to the
closure of the fruit packing plants and the rise of strip commercial developments along
Hamilton Avenue, Bascom Avenue and Winchester Boulevard. The following years saw
suburban malls and suburban neighborhoods replace fruit orchards. Retail shopping
patterns changed throughout the Santa Clara Valley leading to the demise of the central
business district in traditional downtowns such as Campbell.
The Central Campbell Redevelopment Project Area was created in 1983 with the
primary goal of reestablishing the Downtown as the City’s vibrant core. One of the first
major steps in the redevelopment process was to develop a Downtown Revitalization
Plan. In 1988, the Campbell Downtown Development Plan was completed as a result of
one and a half years of study and discussion of various planning and revitalization
issues. The Downtown Plan helped form policy as it relates to density, building form,
historic preservation, infrastructure and parking; and, direct the growth and development
of the Downtown.
In 1996, the Plan was updated to take into account changing conditions and a revised
vision for public parking, density and scale. Also, light rail was being planned for the
Downtown that would bring new opportunities. Since 1996, considerable progress has
been made in the redevelopment of the Downtown that includes new commercial
buildings, destination retail businesses and new restaurants. Blighted properties have
been redeveloped into new residential homes, mixed use development and a new public
parking structure. Gross sales generated in the Downtown has grown annually from
approximately $3 million in 1990, to over $26 million in 2006.
Moving forward, the City looks to build on that progress and help bring the Downtown
into the 21st century, while preserving its historic character, and working to position it in
the competitive marketplace that is Silicon Valley.

       INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this document is to provide a vision for Downtown Campbell and a
framework for the physical development, business development and preservation of the
Historic Downtown. Since the first Development Plan was adopted over 18 years ago, a
number of identified revitalization projects have been completed under the guidance of
the Redevelopment Agency and the City. These major projects include:
 Underground Utilities: The undergrounding of utilities on East Campbell Avenue;
 Streetscape Improvements:          The construction of a $2.5 million streetscape
   improvement project which enhanced the Downtown with attractive landscaping,
   hardscape, lighting and traffic improvements;
 Ainsley House Relocation: The relocation of the historical Ainsley House to the Civic
   Center Compels to serve as a community focal point;
Ainsley House, Built 1925

Downtown Development Plan                                                        Page 7
 Traffic Enhancements: The conversion of East Campbell Avenue from one-way to
  two-way traffic to enhance retail accessibility;
 Public Parking: The addition of a 300 space parking structure and the addition of 100
  parking spaces on the loop streets;
 Light Rail: Light rail connecting Downtown Campbell with Downtown San Jose and
  beyond;
                Downtown Campbell Light Rail Station
 Mixed Use: The construction of a 50,000 square foot mixed use retail/residential
  project; and,
 Storefront Improvement Program: A storefront improvement program that has
  leveraged $150,000 to achieve approximately $500,000 worth of improvements to

 ........ VISION
The vision for Downtown Campbell is to continue to reinforce its place as the center for
community activity, cultural and civic events, and as a vibrant central business district.
It is intended that the Downtown be an active, walkable central business district that
attracts local residents and visitors to experience a variety of retail businesses and
restaurants. The ground level along East Campbell Avenue is slated for retail and
restaurant to provide a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented streetscape.
The Downtown is distinguished from other commercial districts by its scale, density,
continuous pedestrian-oriented retail frontage, and the historic character. The new light
rail connection from Campbell to San Jose and beyond presents opportunities to grow
the Downtown with mixed use development that incorporates residential built close to
commercial and transportation services. Having residential in the Downtown area is an
essential ingredient to balancing day time and night time activities that support a thriving
and vibrant central business district.
New development in the Downtown should look to take advantage of opportunities to
create viable retail and/or mixed use buildings that contribute to the context and scale of
the Downtown, while maintaining its small town scale. Architectural styles should
complement the traditional context of the Downtown and avoid contemporary designs
that may be more appropriate in larger urban centers.
Downtown Campbell is unique because of its small town, historic character. Furthering
its growth while keeping its heritage intact will be accomplished through partnership
between the City and its stakeholders. By implementing the Goals, Policies and
Strategies outlined in this Plan, Downtown Campbell will continue to flourish as a vital
and successful central business district.

                            development compatible in design with existing and newly-
                            approved development.
              Strategy D-4.1a:      Meet with developers and architects early in the
                                    design process to provide them with clear direction
                                    regarding the context of traditional architectural styles
                                    in the Downtown.

             Strategy CPT-1.1a: Evaluate the east entrance into the Downtown core to
                                 determine an alignment that facilitates traffic more
                                 efficiently into the Downtown via Campbell Avenue
                                 rather than traverse around the current layout that
                                 moves traffic around the Downtown via Civic Center
                                 Drive.

                                 cuts shall be reviewed with the intention of looking at
                                 alternative access points over time in order to provide
                                 comfortable pedestrian movement between shops
                                 and buildings.

Campbell General Plan
STREETSCAPE
Campbell’s community image is created in large part by the major image streets, which
pass through the City. The image streets, including Hamilton Avenue, Bascom Avenue
and Winchester Boulevard, and parts of West Campbell Avenue, are wide commercial
avenues with varying streetscape treatments and building setbacks. They give Campbell
much of its character, are some of its strongest elements of community form and
delineate many of its districts. Most major image streets in Campbell lack a cohesive and
consistent image. Instead, the streets have inconsistent street treatment. The streets are
auto-dominated and not pedestrian friendly. The strongest consistent image is asphalt.
Based on the desired community image developed in the 1991 Community Design Study,
the City Council and Planning Commission have been requiring the installation of an
upgraded streetscape treatment along major streets. Some developments that have
installed the streetscape include Hamilton Plaza, Home Depot, Kirkwood Plaza,
Campbell Gateway Square and Campbell Plaza.
In the preparation of the Standards, various components of the streetscape system, such
as land use, traffic movements, building setbacks, on and off-street parking, existing
sidewalk type and existing plant materials were studied. The resulting Streetscape
Standards provide the requirements to achieve consistent streetscape treatments along the
specified streets. Implementation of the streetscape treatments will primarily be the
result of private development efforts, however, public projects will also be subject to
these standards.
The Interim Streetscape Standards were adopted by the City Council on August 3, 1993,
and they will be effective until the final streetscape standards are adopted with this
General Plan Update.
The Streetscape Standards were developed to ensure consistency in the streetscape
treatment along Campbell’s major streets. The “streetscape” refers to the land directly
adjacent to the street in both private and public ownership. The Standards establish the
required design and materials for sidewalks and landscaping.
The Streetscape Standards intend to:
        • Provide a consistent streetscape treatment along major streets that utilizes
            street trees as a strong component in design.
        • Enhance Campbell’s identity and community image.
        • Improve the pedestrian environment along Campbell’s major streets.
        • Screen parking areas by providing landscaping between the street and the
            parking lots.
The Streetscape Standards are not intended to replace the existing landscaping
requirements listed in Chapter 21.57 of the City’s Municipal Code. Instead, the two shall
be used in tandem.

1. The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each use classification. Residential density is
   expressed as housing units per gross acre. Maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to the site area (FAR) is
   specified for non-residential uses. FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual prominence
   and traffic generation. Building area devoted to structured or covered parking is not included in FAR calculations
   for non-residential developments. However, parking garages are included in the FAR limitations for residential
   uses. Special Area Plan requirements supercede the above listed FARs. The Zoning Ordinance could provide
   specific exceptions to the FAR limitations for uses with low employment densities. The density/intensity
   standards do not imply that development projects will be approved at the maximum density or intensity specified
   for each use. Zoning regulations consistent with General Plan policies and/or site conditions may reduce
   development potential within the stated ranges.
2. San Tomas Area Neighborhood Plan (STANP) Categories
3. In addition to mixed-use areas, the PD designation may be considered in any neighborhood. See the San Tomas
   Area Neighborhood Plan for details for the San Tomas Neighborhood. The PD is a Zoning Designation that
   allows a degree of flexibility that is not available in other zones, so as to allow developments to create an optimum
   quantity and use of open space and good design. The PD allows uses that conform to the General Plan.
4. C-PD Zoning Designation is established to provide for the construction of new or conversion of older buildings
   into residential, industrial and commercial condominiums. The C-PD allows uses that conform to the General
   Plan.
5. Area plans may need to be developed for some mixed-use areas.

APPENDIX A. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City’s population and housing
stock as a means of better understanding the nature and extent of unmet housing needs. Appendix A,
the Housing Needs Assessment is comprised of the following components: (1) Demographic Profile; (2)
Household Profile; (3) Housing Stock Characteristics; and (4) Regional Housing Needs.
1. Demographic Profile
The type and amount of housing needed in a community are largely determined by population growth
and various demographic variables. Factors such as age, race/ethnicity, occupation, and income level
combine to influence the type of housing needed and the ability to afford housing. This section addresses
population, age, race/ethnicity and employment of Campbell’s residents.
A. Population Trends
Table A-1 displays population growth trends for the City of Campbell from 1990-2010, and compares this
growth to neighboring jurisdictions and the entire County of Santa Clara. As indicated below, the recession
between 2007 and 2009 dramatically slowed the rate of population increase for most of the depicted
jurisdictions. As the economy has improved, the rates of population growth have also increased. Much of
the increase in population growth for most of the established cities has been from the redevelopment of
existing sites into higher density residential projects.

      Sources: 1990, 2000, 2010 Census
According to the State Department of Finance, local populations have continued to increase since the
2010 Decennial Census. All of the Cities described in Table A-1 have shown continuing population growth
through 2013. In 2013, according to the State Department of Finance, the population for the City of
Campbell had increased to 40,404. If the current rates of growth for these cities continued from 2010
through 2020, the percent change in their populations would have ranged between 9 and 14 percent.
According to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the population for the City of Campbell is
expected to continue to increase through 2040. The estimated population in 2020 is 41,900, increasing
to 48,100 in 2040. ABAG expects to see rates of change between 6.5 and 7.5 percent for each decade
through 2040.

B. Age Characteristics
A community’s housing needs are determined in part by the age characteristics of residents. Each age
group has distinct lifestyles, family type and size, income levels, and housing preferences. As people move
through each stage, their housing needs and preferences also change. As a result, evaluating the age
characteristics of a community is important in addressing housing needs of residents.
Table A-2 below summarizes the age characteristics of Campbell residents between 1990 and 2010, and
compares this with the County as a whole. For the most part, the population characteristics of the
community have stayed fairly constant except for a decrease in the number of Young Adults and the
corresponding increase in the number of Middle Age Adults. This appears to have occurred because of
the aging in place by large numbers of Young Adults between 1990 and 2010. The Young Adult population
(25 to 44) remains the largest segment (33%) of the City’s population though the size of this group has
steadily decreased since 1990. The next largest group is the Middle Age Adults (45-64) which comprised
28% of the population in 2010.

Sources: 1990, 2000, 2010 Census.
Like many communities nationwide, Campbell’s population is aging. The City’s median age increased from
32.5 years in 1990 to 38.3 years in 2010. During this same time the countywide median age increased
from 32.0 to 36.2. This appears to correspond with the gradual increase in the number of Senior Adults
(65+). This aging in place trend is expected to continue into the near future. Many seniors are
homeowners and typically live in single-family homes, but may begin to consider trading down their larger
homes for smaller dwellings as their children leave home. To remain in their homes, some seniors may
also participate in home sharing programs.
Several trends could become apparent over the coming decade. Senior citizens can be expected to
continue to comprise a growing segment of Campbell’s population as the City’s middle age “baby
boomers” (45 to 64) age in place. Eventually, this pattern of aging in place will result in the recycling of
existing neighborhoods as Young Adults move back into the areas vacated by the Senior Adults and start
new families. Given this trend, there is a continued need to expand housing opportunities for seniors.

C. Race and Ethnicity
The Bay Area has been gradually changing in the racial and ethnic composition of its population. These
changes have implications for housing needs to the extent that different groups may have different
household characteristics, income levels, and cultural background that affect their need and preferences
for housing.
Campbell, like many Bay Area communities, has also experienced gradual changes in the racial and ethnic
composition of its population. The White group continues to comprise the largest race/ethnic group in
Campbell at 58 percent, but this group’s share of the population has decreased steadily over the past two
decades, while the other race/ethnic groups grew noticeably both in size and proportion. This trend is
reflected in both the Dicennial Census and local school enrollments.
Among the major race/ethnic groups, the largest percentage increase in population between 1990 and
2010 was attributable to Asians (representing 78% of the population growth between 1990 and 2000) and
Hispanics (representing 64% of the population growth between 2000 and 2010). As shown inTable A-3,
the Asian/Pacific Islander share of the population increased from 9 percent in 1990 to 16 percent in 2010.
The Hispanic share grew from 11 percent to 18 percent. The number of residents in the “Other Race”
category grew dramatically in large part because unlike prior Census efforts, the 2000 and 2010 Censuses

The student population in Campbell is diverse as well and reflects the demographic shift within the
community. An examination of recent enrollment data for local schools in the Campbell Union Elementary
that primarily serve the City of Campbell indicate that the traditional minority groups comprise the
majority of the student population.2 In academic year 2013/14, 54% of the student population are
Hispanic, 25% White, 12% Asian and Pacific Islander, 4% Blacks or African American, and 5% were
identified as an Other Race. This variation indicates that much of the older cohorts of the population are
predominantly White while the younger cohorts of the population are more diverse and more
representative of the current multi-ethnic California.
1 For 2000, the “Other Race” category includes American Indians and Alaska Natives, and persons who identified themselves as
“Some other race” and “Two or more races.”

D. Education
Education and employment also have an important impact upon housing needs to the extent that
different jobs and income levels determine the type and size of housing a household can afford. According
to the 2010 Census, the educational level of Campbell residents is generally higher than that of the County
as a whole. For instance, the percentage of residents over age 25 without a high school diploma is 10
percent in the City, compared to 16 percent Countywide. Similarly, Campbell has a higher percentage of
residents with some college education and with a Bachelors Degree, though a smaller percentage of Post
Graduate Degree holders. The educational attainment of Campbell residents and residents countywide
are displayed in the Figure A-4.

E. Employment Market
Table A-5 describes the types of occupations held by Campbell residents. As of 2010, three-quarters of
residents were employed in either managerial/professional occupations (50%), or
sales/technical/administrative occupations (26%). Relatively higher paying jobs are in both categories,
except for certain sales positions, translating into higher incomes for the residents engaged in these
activities. In contrast, there were noticeable declines in the number of residents engaged in the
occupational categories of production/crafts/maintenance; and farming/ forestry/ fishing. The long term
trend appears to be away from manufacturing and production and toward the professional and service
sectors. Furthermore, the primary growth within the Sales, Technical and Administrative sectors has been
in the technical and administrative areas.

The State Employment Development Department estimates that, as of November 2013, the labor force
for the City of Campbell was 23,000. The unemployment rate for City residents was 5.3%, compared to a
countywide unemployment rate of 6.2% and a statewide rate of 8.3%. Since the height of the recession
in early 2009, the unemployment rates for the City, County, and State has fallen by 2.4%, 1.5%, and 0.8%
respectively. The improved economy has the potential to improve many families access to affordable
housing.

According to the 2007 Economic Census (the most recent information available), there were
approximately 20,652 jobs in Campbell in 1,452 workplaces. In 2007 the local economy was a combination
of service/retail, professional, and manufacturing sectors. Since that time several of the larger
manufacturing and information service businesses have either relocated or have gone out of business. As
a result, the local economy is based primarily on the retail/service and professional sectors.
F. Jobs and Housing
The Jobs:Housing Ratio (or Jobs:Housing Balance) is a method used to indicate whether a community is
“balanced” from a housing and employment perspective. A community is considered balanced when
there are approximately an equal number of housing units and jobs (though the Jobs:Housing Ratio does
not consider the quality of the jobs in terms of the household incomes or affordability). In regional
planning programs, balancing jobs and housing is generally believed to reduce the amount of long distance
commuting, as well as achieving a number of other related goals such as reducing traffic congestion on
major freeways and arterials, improving regional air quality, and enhancing a community’s economic base.
Jobs and housing are considered to be balanced when there are an equal number of employed residents
and jobs within a given area, with a ratio of approximately 1.0.
Table A-7 compares the Jobs:Housing ratio for Campbell and other selected local jurisdictions. The
balance between jobs and housing is an important consideration in establishing housing production and
affordability goals. Based on ABAG estimates for 2007, Campbell has a Jobs/Housing ratio of 1.3. This
means that, within Campbell there are on average 1.3 jobs for each housing units. In comparison to many
of the surrounding jurisdictions, Campbell is relatively balanced community with slightly more jobs than
housing.

2. Household Characteristics
Household type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other household
characteristics determine the type of housing needed by residents. This section details the various
household characteristics affecting housing needs.
A. Household Type
According to the 2010 Census, Campbell is home to 16,163 households, of which 60 percent are families.
Families are comprised of married couple families with or without children as well as other family types,
such as female-headed households with children. Non-families, including singles and other households,
make up the other 40 percent of households in Campbell. Other households include residents in group
homes, roommates, and other unrelated persons occupying the same housing unit. As was the case in
1990, singles comprised roughly 30 percent of all households in the City. The household type trends are
shown in Table A-8.
      Table A-8: Household Characteristics-City of Campbell

      Sources: 1990, 2000, 2010 Census.
The composition of households in Campbell remained relatively unchanged between 1990 and 2010.
There are, however, two noteworthy trends. These trends are the increase in the number of families with
children and the increase in the average persons per household since 1990. These trends reflect the
growth in the number of families with children as well as an increase in the number of households
“doubling up” to save on housing costs during the recent economic downturn commonly referred to as
The Great Recession (2007-2009).
B. Household Income
Household income is the most important factor affecting housing opportunity, determining a household’s
ability to balance housing costs with other basic necessities of life. Income levels can vary considerably
among households, based upon tenure, household type, location of residence, and/or race/ethnicity,

Median Household Income
Based on the 2012 American Community Survey, the median annual household income of Campbell
households was $81,108. As shown below, the median household income in Campbell was comparable
to that in San Jose, and about 11% less than the median household income for Santa Clara County. The
median household incomes for Campbell and several surrounding cities are shown in Figure A-9.

Income Definitions
The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings based upon the
relationship to the County Adjusted Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household size. The State of
California utilizes the income groups presented in Table A-10. However, federal housing programs utilize
slightly different income groupings and definitions with the highest income category beginning about 95
percent of the County AMI. For purposes of the Housing Element, the State income definitions are used
throughout, except for the data that have been compiled by the Federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD). When the Federal criteria are used, this fact will be specifically noted.

Households by Income Levels
According to information compiled for the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy, 69% of the
households in the City of Campbell are in the Moderate Income and Above Moderate Income categories.
While the absolute number of these households has increased since 1990, the relative percentage of these
higher income households has declined since 1990 (from 70.9% to 68.8%). The number of households by
the four income categories is depicted in Table A-11.

This decrease in the Moderate Income and Above Moderate Income categories has been paired with a
noticeable increase in the Extremely Low Income category. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of
Extremely Low Income Households increase from 1,599 to 2,015. Of the nearly one thousand households
added to City between 1990 and 2010, most of the growth occurred in either the Extremely Low or the
Moderate Income and Above Moderate Income categories. This indicates that while much of the
community is economically prosperous, there continues to be increased affordability issues for the
Extremely Low Households.
Income by Household Tenure
Table A-12 shows the income level of Campbell residents by household tenure. A significantly higher
percentage of renter households (51%) were in the lower income categories (with household incomes less
80% of the AMI) compared to residents who owned their homes (20%). In contrast, the 41% of rental
households and 19% of owner households were in the lower incomes categories in 2010. The presence
of approximately 2,500 extremely low and very low income renter households is of particular significance
as market rents in Campbell exceed the level of affordability for these households.

The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy identifies four conditions that create severe housing
problems. These four conditions are: incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more
than one and a half persons per room, and cost burdens of greater than 50% of the household income.
According to the 2010 Census, less than 2% of the units had incomplete kitchen or plumbing features.
This means that the vast majority of the housing issues identified in the Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy are related to the cost burden of housing and the number of persons living in the
unit (which can also be an indicator of a higher cost burden for housing).
As described in Table A-13, 43% of renter households and 38% of owner households spend more than
30% of their income on housing costs each week, while 19% of renter households and 16% of owner
households spend more than 50% of their income on housing in 2010. The high incidence of lower income
renter households is of particular significance as market rents in Campbell exceed the level of affordability
for lower income households, discussed in greater detail in the Housing Affordability Section of this Needs
Assessment.

Campbell.
Senior Households
Senior households typically have special housing needs due to three primary concerns – income, housing
and health care costs, and physical disabilities. Seniors are typically on fixed incomes, therefore an
increase in rents can have a considerable impact on extremely low income senior renters. Senior
homeowners with extremely low incomes also face significant needs related to maintaining their homes.
According to the 2010 Census, seniors (age 65 and older) comprise 11 percent of the City’s households.
Some of the special needs of seniors are as follows:
        Disabilities: Of Campbell’s senior population, 36 percent (1,569 persons) have a work disability
         and/or self-care or mobility limitation.
        Limited Income: Many seniors have limited income available for healthcare and other expenses.
         Because of their retired status, 57 percent of Campbell’s senior households earn extremely low
         to very low-incomes (<50% AMI). An increase of about 7 percent since 2000.

        Overpayment: About half of Campbell’s senior households spend more than one-third of their
         incomes on housing costs. This problem is particularly acute among renting senior households
         where nearly 60 percent of these households are comprised of lower income.
About two-thirds of elderly households in Campbell are homeowners. Because of physical and/or other
limitations, senior homeowners may have difficulty in performing regular home maintenance or repair
activities. Furthermore, the installation of grab bars and other assistance devices in the home may be
needed. Also, nearly 47 percent of the City’s senior households live alone. In the past there were programs
to encourage home sharing and to extend the ability of seniors to remain in their homes. Unfortunately
these programs are no longer provided due to funding cutbacks and limitations. Campbell is home to an
estimated 1,055 senior renter households. Fifty-seven percent of Senior Households are in the Very Low
and Low Income categories.
Through the Campbell Senior Center, which caters to seniors over the age of 50, the City also provides
programs and services for seniors to facilitate social interaction and foster independence. Services include
information and referrals, education classes, physical, leisure activities and social activities, transportation
assistance and lunches. The Senior Center is a nutrition site under the Countywide Senior Nutrition
Program, where congregate meals are made available to persons over the age of 60. There are two Meals
on Wheels Programs serving residents in Campbell, one through the Council on Aging and the other
through Health Trust Programs. These programs provide hot or ready meals for homebound seniors who
have difficulty cooking or shopping for themselves. The Adult Center services also include providing a case
manager who provides in-home, comprehensive social service assistance, to the City’s isolated, low-
income, at-risk elderly; employment/housing referrals and seasonal homeowners and renters’ assistance.
Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an individual’s mobility, ability to work, or
ability to care for themselves. Persons with disabilities include those with physical, mental, or emotional
issues that make it difficult to live without special assistance or attention. Persons with disabilities often
have special housing needs because of their fixed income, the lack of accessible and affordable housing,
and the higher living and health costs associated with their disability.
In 2011, a total of 2,857 persons with disabilities resided in Campbell, representing about eight percent
of the City’s population over the age of five. Of these persons with disabilities, approximately 38 percent
of these residents are faced with mobility/self care limitations, 20 percent have physical limitations, and
the remaining 42 percent have both sensory and mental disabilities. Of the City’s senior population, over
one-third has one or more types of disabilities.
The living arrangement of disabled persons depends on the severity of the disability. Many persons live
at home in an independent fashion or with other family members. To maintain independent living,
disabled persons may need assistance. This can include special housing design features for the disabled,
income support for those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for persons with
medical conditions among others. Accessible housing can also be provided via senior housing
developments. Campbell has adopted Reasonable Accommodation procedures to facilitate zoning
modifications for persons with disabilities.

The State of California Community Care Licensing Division identifies three adult residential facilities in
Campbell that provide 24-hour non-medical care for adults ages 18-59 who are unable to provide for their
own daily needs. The Silicon Valley Independent Living Center (SVILC) provides a variety of services to
persons with disabilities in Santa Clara County. SVILC serves over 1,000 County residents annually. Services
offered include: information and referral, vocational training and placement, residential training, legal and
personal advocacy, peer and individual counseling, housing referrals, and personal assistance referrals
and placement. To help its clients locate affordable, accessible housing, SVILC maintain a database of
accessible and subsidized housing throughout Santa Clara County. Rental assistance through the County
Housing Authority also helps disabled persons afford housing in Campbell. Transportation service for
persons with disabilities is available through OUTREACH paratransit, a non-profit agency, operating as the
ADA paratransit broker for the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). OUTREACH is based on a reservation
system with clients making reservations for trips one day to 14 days in advance. This service is provided
with taxies or accessible vans.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A development disability is defined as a disabling condition that originated before an individual become
18 years old, and continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual. Developmental disabilities include mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, and autism, as well as the disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation
(or that require treatment similar to individuals with mental retardation), but does not include other
handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature (though some developmentally disabled
persons may also have physical disabilities).
According to the State Department of Developmental Services there are 134 developmentally disabled
persons over the age of 17 in Postal Code 95008. Postal Code 95008 encompasses over 98% of the
incorporated City and is representative of the City of Campbell as a whole. For all persons with
developmental disabilities in Postal Code 95008, 71% live at home with a parent, family member or
guardian, 13% live in community care facilities, while 10% live in an independent supported living facility.
The remaining 6% have a variety of other less common living arrangements.
Many of the organizations that provide support to persons with disabilities also provide assistance to
persons with developmental disabilities. According to the State Department of Social Services there are
three Adult Residential Facilities for Persons with Special Care Needs in Postal Code 95008. These three
facilities have a total capacity of 15 beds. The Zoning Ordinance allows in-home care facilities for less than
6 persons as a permitted use in all residential zones. In-home care facilities designed to accommodate up
to 12 beds are allowed with a conditional use permit in all residential zones. Campbell has also adopted
Reasonable Accommodation procedures that can also facilitate zoning modifications for the families and
caretakers of persons with developmental disabilities.
Large Households
Large households are defined as having five or more members residing in the home. These households
constitute a special needs group, because there is often a limited supply of adequately sized, affordable
housing units in a community. In order to save for other basic necessities of food, clothing and medical
care, it is common for lower-income large households to reside in smaller units, which frequently results
in overcrowding. To accommodate larger households, units with three or more bedrooms are generally
appropriate for large households. According to the 2010 Census, Campbell is home to 1,283 Large
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment                                                               Page A 13
                                                                                            City of Campbell
                                                                              2015-2023 Housing Element
Households, or about eight percent of all households. Fifty-three percent (681) of large households live
in owner occupied units while 47 percent (602) of large households live in renter-occupied units.
Approximately 48 percent (7,811) of all housing units in Campbell have three or more bedrooms. While
the total number of larger units appears to be adequate to accommodate large households, virtually all
of the available units require at least Above Moderate Incomes to afford. According to the recent home
and condominium sales (Table A-20), 88% of all units sold in 2013 had 3 or more bedrooms. However,
the median sale price for a 3-bedroom home in Campbell in 2013 was $750,000, this equates to a
minimum household income of over $165,000 per year to meet State’s affordability criteria. This
minimum household income is well above the median household income for Campbell residents.
Large households renting housing have a similar, though different, problem. In contrast, according to the
recent rental survey (Table A-21), only 12% of the available for rent units had 3 or more bedrooms.
However, with median rents for 3-bedroom apartments at $2,900 and median rents for 3-bedroom homes
at $3,350 (when these larger units are available), the affordability of large rental units for even Moderate
Income households remains an issue. Because of limited availability, combined with limited affordability,
lower income large households will have difficulty finding housing in Campbell.
Female-headed Households
Female-headed households with children often require special consideration and assistance as a result of
their greater need for affordable housing, accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services.
Because of their relatively lower incomes and higher living expenses, such households usually have more
limited opportunities for finding affordable, decent, and safe housing.
Campbell is home to 1,741 female-headed households, of which 54% have children under 18 years old.
Of those households with children, 10% had incomes below poverty level. This is in contrast to the general
population where only 3% had incomes below the poverty level and 9% of female-headed households
without children had incomes below the poverty level. These households are a particularly vulnerable
group because the household head must try to balance the needs of their children with work and other
household responsibilities.
Homeless Persons
The 2013 Homeless Census and Survey for Santa Clara County were conducted on January 29 and 30,
2013. The 2013 Census and Survey involved two components: 1) a point-in-time count of unsheltered
and sheltered homeless, and 2) one-on-one interviews with about 850 homeless. The comprehensive,
two-day homeless count identified approximately 5,600 homeless people on the streets, and an additional
2,000 people in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and domestic violence shelters. Key findings of
the homeless count and supplementary interviews include:
        56 percent indicated they had been homeless for more than one year.
        Approximately half of those surveyed indicated that this was their first experience being
         homeless.
        About two-thirds of the homeless identified as male.
        Only 25 percent of the County’s homeless lived in formal shelters or transitional housing.
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment                                                                Page A 14

                                                                              2015-2023 Housing Element
        Over one-third of the County’s homeless were living in vehicles and encampments and almost
         one-third were living on the street.
        40 percent of survey respondents indicated the primary cause of their homelessness was due to
         the loss of a job and 17 percent indicating alcohol or drug use was the primary factor.
        About two-thirds of respondents indicated they were experiencing one or more disabling
         conditions with 35 percent reported experiencing some form of mental illness.
Within the City of Campbell, the 2013 Homeless Census and Survey identified 91 homeless people, a
decrease of 12 persons from the 2011 Survey. Despite the recent decrease in the number of homeless
individuals in Campbell, the total number of homeless persons has stayed relatively constant ranging
between 90 and 105 individuals. All of the homeless individuals identified in the Survey were unsheltered
because there are no homeless shelters within the City.
There are three major types of facilities that provide shelter for homeless individuals and families:
emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent housing. These types of facilities are defined
below:
        Emergency Shelter: provides overnight shelter and fulfills a client’s basic needs (i.e. food, clothing,
         and medical care) either on-site or through off-site services. The permitted length of stay can vary
         from one day at a time to two months, depending upon whether the shelter is short-term or long-
         term.
        Transitional Housing: a residence that provides housing for up to two years. Residents of
         transitional housing are usually connected to rehabilitative services, including substance abuse
         and mental health care interventions, employment services, individual and group counseling and
         life skills training.
        Permanent Housing: refers to permanent housing that is affordable in the community or
         permanent and service-enriched permanent housing that is linked with on-going supportive
         services (on-site or off-site) and is designed to allow formerly homeless clients to live at the facility
         on an indefinite basis.
As a smaller city, Campbell does not have any permanent emergency shelters. Numerous regional service
providers serve the homeless in the greater San Jose area. Homeless individuals identified in Campbell are
usually referred to one of the emergency shelters located nearby.
As the Santa Clara County’s largest provider of shelters and services for the homeless, EHC Home First
provides emergency shelters, transitional and permanent housing and support services through a network
of program locations throughout the County. InnVision operates four inns in San Jose, which provide to
a variety of persons in need, including working men, women and children, and mentally ill persons.
InnVision serves clients in Campbell based on the availability of space in the inns at San Jose. However, if
there are no available spaces, clients get referred to any one of the 20 sites of InnVision, some of which
are located outside of San Jose. As exhibited in Table A-15, EHC and InnVision provide a significant number
of beds in transitional housing facilities and emergency shelters for the homeless.

Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through seasonal
agricultural labor. They have special housing needs because of their relatively low income and the
unstable nature of their job (i.e. having to move throughout the year from one harvest to the next).
According to the 2010 Census, there were 83 Campbell residents employed in farming, forestry, and
fishing occupations. These individuals accounted for less than one percent of the City’s total employed
residents. Given that there are so few persons employed in agricultural-related industries, the City can
address their specific housing needs through its overall housing programs.

3. Housing Stock Characteristics
This section of the Housing Element addresses various housing characteristics and conditions that affect
the well-being of City residents. Housing factors evaluated include the following: housing stock and
growth, tenure and vacancy rates, age and condition, housing costs, and affordability, among others.
A. Housing Growth
As of January 2013, the State Department of Finance estimates identified 17,301 housing units in
Campbell. Between 1990 and 2000, the City’s housing stock increased by less than three percent, with an
additional 3.8% increase from 2000-2010. Figure A-16 compares Campbell’s housing growth during the
past two decades with nearby communities and the County as a whole. As shown, housing growth levels
in Campbell are similar to the comparably small-sized cities of Saratoga and Los Gatos. In contrast, the
larger cities of San Jose and Santa Clara are where much of the housing growth has occurred in the recent
decades.

B. Housing Age and Condition
Housing age is an important indicator of housing condition within a community. Like any other tangible
asset, housing is subject to gradual deterioration over time. If not properly and regularly maintained,
housing can deteriorate and discourage reinvestment, depress neighboring property values and
eventually impact the quality of life in a neighborhood. Thus maintaining and improving housing quality
is an important goal for the City.

Figure A-17 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by the year built from the 2010 Census. As of 2010,
77 percent of housing units in Campbell are over 30 years old and 28 percent of the total housing stock is
over 50 years old. A general rule in the housing industry is that structures older than 30 years begin to
show signs of deterioration and require reinvestment to maintain their quality. Unless properly
maintained, homes older than 50 years require major renovations to remain in good working order.
Comprising the southwestern quadrant of the City, the San Tomas Area is one of the older neighborhoods
in Campbell and has the greatest rehabilitation needs. In recent years, with the recovery of the economy,
there has been an increase in owner reinvestment into some older homes in this area to address individual
rehabilitation needs. This trend is expected to continue through the period of this Housing Element.

The City administers a Code Enforcement program that aims to preserve and maintain the livability and
quality of neighborhoods. The City received targeted CDBG funding for a code enforcement program in
the identified low-income areas of the City. Code enforcement staff investigates violations of property
maintenance standards as defined in the Municipal Code as well as other complaints.
C. Housing Type and Tenure
Table A-18 presents the mix of housing types in Campbell. Of the City’s nearly 17,000 housing units in
2010, 58 percent were single-family homes (including attached and detached) and 40 percent were multi-
family units. The City also contains over 300 mobile homes, comprising two percent of the City’s housing.
The vacancy rate in Campbell is currently estimated at 4.6%.

According to the Department of Finance, since 2010 Campbell has added 52 additional Single Family
Detached Units and 27 Single Family Attached Units, or approximately 28 new units per year. This is a
slightly slower rate of growth than was seen between 2000 and 2010, when an average of 60 new units
were constructed each year. This slowdown in the construction of new housing is not unexpected since
the lingering effects of The Great Recession halted new home construction between 2007 and 2010. As
the economy continues to improve the number of new housing units is expected to return to their former
levels. The most recent vacancy information provided by the Bureau of the Census identified a total of
426 vacant units in Campbell. Sixty percent of these units were identified as rental housing. The
remaining units were identified as either seasonal, recreational, or occasional use properties.
Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or is vacant. Tenure is an important
indicator of the housing climate of a community, reflecting the relative cost of housing opportunities, and
the ability of residents to afford housing. Tenure also influences residential mobility, with owner units
generally evidencing lower turnover rates than rental housing. The housing tenure trends since 1990 are
depicted in Table A-19.

According to the 2010 Census, a little over half of Campbell’s housing units were owner occupied, a shift
in the historic tenure pattern where more residential units were renter occupied versus owner occupied.
However, the percent of ownership in Campbell is still less than the 58 percent ownership rate
Countywide. This is most likely because much of the newer housing in Campbell has been higher density
(and more commonly rental housing).

D. Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to extent of housing problems in a community. If housing costs are
relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a correspondingly higher prevalence of
overpayment and overcrowding. This section summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock
to Campbell residents.
Sales Survey
Table A-20 provides information on all sales of existing and new single-family homes and condominiums
in Postal Code 95008 within the Campbell city limits during 2013. Postal Code 95008 encompasses over
98% of the incorporated City and is representative of the City of Campbell as a whole. The information
summarized in Table A-20 also excludes several larger parcels that appeared to have been priced for
future subdivision purposes.
A total of 292 single-family home sales were recorded during this period, with nearly 60 percent
comprised of three bedroom units. Median sales prices ranged from $680,000 for two-bedroom units to
$1,125,000 for five (or more) bedrooms with sale prices varying significantly based on location. The
average age of the units sold were generally representative of the overall housing stock where most of
the homes in Campbell were built between 1950 and 1989. Unit sizes were relatively modest, averaging
only 1,730 square feet on typical 7,000 to 9,000 square foot residential lots. The overall median price for
a home sold in 2013 was $810,000. This median priced unit had three bedrooms and was built in the
1960s. Single family homes in Campbell are generally not affordable to modest income households.

Approximately one-third of all units sold in Campbell during calendar year 2013 were condominiums. The
median sales prices for condominiums ranged from $321,500 to $664,000 (for the one- and four-bedroom
units, respectively), with an overall median price of $515,000. In comparison, median sale price for a
condominium documented in Campbell’s 2009 Housing Element was $505,000, indicating little increase

in sales prices over the past four to five years. Whereas the vast majority of single-family homes were
three and four bedroom units, condominiums were predominately two and three-bedroom units, selling
for significantly less than similarly sized single-family homes. Condominiums in Campbell are thus helping
to fill a gap for smaller, less expensive ownership housing in the City and are generally affordable for
Moderate Income households.
Rental Survey
Current rental housing costs in Campbell were obtained through a rent survey compiled from internet
sources on January 13 and 27, 2014. Table A-21 enumerates the rental ranges, as well as the median rents,
for apartment/townhome units, single family homes, and single rooms for rent in Campbell. This data was
assembled from over 60 advertised rental reviewed during the second half of January 2014.
The median rents for apartment units in Campbell range from $1,400 for a studio, $1,725 for a one-
bedroom unit, $2,070 for a two-bedroom unit, up to $2,900 for a three-bedroom unit. The most
commonly available apartments have two bedrooms.

Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in Campbell with
the maximum affordable housing costs to households which earn different income levels. Taken together,
this information can provide a picture of who can afford what size and type of housing as well as indicate
the type of households that would likely experience overcrowding or overpayment.
Affordable Ownership Housing Cost
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50052.5) defines affordable owner housing costs as follows:
      Housing costs consist of mortgage debt service, homeowner association dues, insurance, utility
          allowance and property taxes.
      Affordable costs are up to 35 percent of the defined household income.

      Affordable costs for moderate income households are based on a standard of 110 percent of Area
           Median Income (AMI) for a household size equal to one more person than the number of
           bedrooms in the unit.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household income
surveys nationwide, including Santa Clara County, to determine the maximum affordable payments of
different households and their eligibility for federal housing assistance. The 2013 median Income Limits
for a four-person household in Santa Clara County is $116,050. Based on these definitions of income and
affordable housing cost, Table A-22 presents the maximum affordable purchase price for moderate
income households (110% AMI), and compares this with market sales prices for single-family homes and
condominiums in Campbell as previously documented in Table A-20.

As illustrated, median single-family home prices in Campbell are well beyond the Ievel of affordability for
Moderate Income households. For example, the maximum affordable purchase price for a moderate
income four person household is $530,000, whereas the median priced three bedroom home in Campbell
is $750,000, an affordability gap of $220,000.
However, condominiums are still within close reach for households earning moderate incomes. As shown
in Table A-22, the maximum affordable purchase price for a three person household is $480,000, whereas
the median priced two-bedroom condominium in Campbell sells for $490,000, an affordability gap of just
$10,000. However if housing costs continue to rise faster than the household incomes, these presently
affordable condominium units will become less affordable over time. A first-time homebuyer program
implemented by Santa Clara County can provide assistance to moderate income households to close this
affordability gap.

Affordable Renter Housing Cost
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50053) defines affordable renter housing costs as follows:
      Housing costs include rent plus utilities paid for by the tenant.
      Affordable rent is up to 30 percent of the defined household income.
      Affordable rents are based on a standard of 50 percent of AMI for very low income households;
         60 percent of AMI for low income households; and 110 percent AMI for moderate income
         households for a household size equal to one more person than the number of bedrooms in the
         unit.
Table A-23 presents the maximum affordable rents for very low, low and moderate income households
by household size, and compares these income levels with median room and apartment rents in Campbell.
For Very Low Income wage earners, there is little affordable rental housing in Campbell. Even the median
price for individual rooms for rent exceeds the affordability levels for Very Low Income households. For
Low Income households, while studio units are generally affordable, the larger the units size, the greater
the affordability gap. This is a particular burden for Low Income families requiring units with two or more
bedrooms. Apartment rents in Campbell are affordable to Moderate Income households regardless of
the unit size.

E. Assisted Rental Housing
State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for currently rent-restricted low income
housing units to convert to market rate housing, and to propose programs to preserve or replace any units
“at-risk” of conversion. This section presents an inventory of all assisted rental housing in Campbell, and
evaluates those units at risk of conversion during the ten year, 2015-2025 planning period.

Table A-24 is an inventory of assisted rental housing projects in Campbell. A total of 747 assisted units are
provided in twelve developments, including units assisted through a variety of federal and local
government programs/funds. These programs include HUD Section 8, Section 221 and Section 236, CDBG,
and the City’s Inclusionary Housing requirement.

At-Risk Projects
This section evaluates those lower income rental projects in Campbell at-risk of converting to market-rate
uses prior to January 31, 2025. Of the 747 assisted units identified in Table A-24, 390 units in two projects
are determined to be at low risk of conversion over the next ten year period: Corinthian House, Rincon
Gardens and Wesley Manor. All of these projects maintain Section 8 project-based Housing Assistance
Plan (HAP) contracts with HUD subject to periodic renewals. To maintain the existing affordable housing
stock, the City must either preserve the existing assisted units or facilitate the development of new units.
Depending on the circumstances of at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace
the units. Preservation options can include transferring the project to non-profit ownership, providing
rental assistance to tenants using non-federal funding sources, and/or purchasing affordability covenants.
In terms of replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted multi-family housing
units. These options are described below.
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment                                                                            Page A 24

                                                                                                        City of Campbell
                                                                                          2015-2023 Housing Element
o Transfer of Ownership: Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit housing provider is
   generally one of the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units remain affordable for the long
   term. By transferring property ownership to a non-profit organization, low-income restrictions can be
   secured indefinitely and the project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of
   governmental assistance. This preservation option is, however, not applicable in Campbell because
   both at-risk projects are already owned by non-profit organizations. These projects are determined to
   be at “low” risk of conversion largely due to their non-profit status.
o Rental Assistance: If Section 8 rent subsidies are terminated at the federal level, rent subsidies using
   alternative State or local funding sources could be used to maintain affordability of the 390 at-risk
   units. Subsidies could be structured similar to the federal Section 8 program, where HUD pays the
   owners the difference between what tenants can afford to pay (30% of household income) and what
   HUD estimates as the Fair Market Rent (FMR) on the unit. The feasibility of this alternative depends
   upon the availability of non-federal funding sources necessary to make rent subsidies available and the
   willingness of property owners to accept rental vouchers if they can be provided.
   Table A-25 shows the total cost of subsidizing the rents at all at-risk units currently assisted through
   the Section 8 program. As indicated below, the total cost of providing rent subsidizes to all 190 at-risk
   units in Campbell (the difference between HUD Fair Market Rents and maximum affordable rents to
   Very Low Income households) is generally estimated at about $55,000 per month or $660,000 annually,
   translating to roughly $13 million over a 20-year period. Another way rent subsidies could be
   structured is as a rent buy-down. This would involve the City or County providing a one-time assistance
   loan to the property owner to cover the present value of the decrease in rents associated with the
   extended affordability term compared with market rents achievable on the units. This approach offers
   a benefit to the owner in that they receive cash upfront from the loan.

o   Acquisition or Construction of Replacement Units: The construction or purchase of a replacement
    building is another option to replace at-risk units should they be converted to market-rate units. The
    cost of developing housing depends upon a variety of factors, including density, size of the units,
    location, land costs, and type of construction. Using a conservative estimate of total development
    costs of $250,000 per affordable housing unit, the cost to replace Campbell’s 190 at-risk units can
    generally be estimated at approximately $48 million.
Cost Comparisons: Given their non-profit and public ownership, it is highly unlikely that either of the two
“at risk” projects will convert to market-uses. Nevertheless, the above analysis attempts to estimate the
cost of preserving the at-risk units under various options. In terms of cost effectiveness, 20 years' worth
of rent subsidies ($13 million) is less expensive than the cost of new construction or the purchase of

replacement units ($48 million). However, long-term affordability of the units cannot be ensured through
rent subsidies, unless it was structured as a one-time rent buy-down. The option of acquiring or
developing 190 replacement units is very costly and constrained by a variety of factors, including limited
purchase opportunities of large multi-family properties and the scarcity of land for new development.
The best option to preserve the at-risk units thus appears to be the purchase of affordability covenants
through a one-time rent buy-down.
Redevelopment Housing Program Funding
Because of the loss of Redevelopment Agency (RDA) funding in 2012, the City of Campbell no longer
administers the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The loss of RDA funding
forced the City to eliminate the position of Housing Program Coordinator, who also coordinated CDBG-
funded programs. The part-time Housing Program Coordinator implemented many of the City’s housing
programs and functions and was partially funded by RDA and CDBG funds.
Since 2012, some of the functions and responsibilities of the Housing Program Coordinator were
transferred to the City’s Planning Division after the City turned over administration of the CDBG program
to Santa Clara County (except for targeted code enforcement and capital improvements for pedestrian
accessibility). Consequently Campbell no longer administers any of the CDBG Housing programs (though
Campbell still administers the previously awarded RDA/CDBG funded loans). Even though the City no
longer administers any of the housing activities funded through CDBG, Campbell residents still have access
to rehabilitation and repair funding through Santa Clara County.
The City has not yet identified alternative funding sources for the activities previously funded by the RDA
Housing Set Aside and CDBG programs.
4. Regional Housing Needs
State law requires all regional councils of governments, including the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) to determine the existing and projected housing need for its region (Government
Code Section 65580 et. seq.) and determine the portion allocated to each jurisdiction within the ABAG
region. This is called the Regional Housing Needs Determination (RHND) process.
A. Existing Housing Needs
A continuing priority of communities is enhancing or maintaining their quality of life. A key measure of
quality of life in a community is the extent of “housing problems.” The federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) has developed an existing needs statement that details the number of
households earning lower income, living in overcrowded conditions, or overpaying for housing. These
housing problems are defined as follows:
        Lower Income: Refers to a household earning less than 80 percent of the median family income,
         as adjusted by family size. For a four-person household, the median income was $114,514 for
         Santa Clara County in 2011 (American Community Survey, 2007-2011).
        Overcrowding: Refers to a housing unit which is occupied by more than one person per room,
         excluding kitchens, bathrooms, hallways, and porches, as defined by HUD.
Appendix A: Housing Needs Assessment                                                               Page A 26

                                                                                  2015-2023 Housing Element
       Overpayment: Refers to a household paying 30 percent or more of its gross income for rent
        (either mortgage or rent), including costs for utilities, property insurance, and real estate taxes,
        as defined by HUD.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding occurs when housing costs are so high relative to income that families double up to devote
income to other basic needs of food and medical care. Overcrowding also tends to result in accelerated
deterioration of homes, a shortage of street parking, and additional traffic. Therefore, maintaining a
reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing the quality of life in
the community.
The Census defines overcrowding as an average of more than one person per room in a housing unit
(excluding kitchens, porches, and hallways); severe overcrowding is defined as greater than 1.5 persons
per room. The incidence of overcrowded housing is a general measure of whether there is an available
supply of adequately sized housing units. Table A-26 shows the incidence of overcrowding in Campbell by
tenure, as estimated by the Bureau of Census. The prevalence of overcrowding and overpayment is
particularly higher among lower-income households, because they have less income for housing costs.
Tables A-26 and A-27 document the prevalence of overcrowding and overpayment among all households
in Campbell.

                  Note: Severe Overcrowding is a subset of Overcrowding
Since 2000, the percentage of overcrowded units has generally declined throughout Santa Clara County.
For example, according to the 2000 Census there were over 1,200 overcrowded units in Campbell or about
8 percent of the housing stock. Santa Clara County experienced a more dramatic reduction in
overcrowding during this same period, with a reduction from 14 percent to 7 percent. This change is
mostly likely due to several factors including: the economic recovery that allowed some people to afford
their own housing (rather than sharing with friends and family) and from people moving out of the region
during the recession in search for work.

Overpayment
Housing overpayment refers to spending more than 30 percent of income on housing; severe
overpayment is spending greater than 50 percent. As is the case in throughout the Bay Area, it is not
uncommon to overpay for housing in Campbell. However, to the extent that overpayment is often
disproportionately concentrated among the most vulnerable members of the community, maintaining a
reasonable level of housing cost burden is an important contributor to quality of life. Table A-27 shows
the incidence of overpayment in Campbell.

According to the most recent information on housing costs, 38 percent of homeowners and 43 percent of
renters in Campbell were overpaying for housing, an increase from 2000 by 11 percent and 3 percent,
respectively. The level of overpayment is similar to the amount of overpayment Countywide. In terms of
overpayment for lower income households, this percentage also increased from 15 percent in 2000 to 19
percent in 2010. Severe overpayment impacts 19 percent of the City’s renters as opposed to only 9
percent of owner households. In terms of lower income (<80% AMI) households, 994 of lower income
homeowners and 2,590 lower income renters were faced with overpayment for housing in Campbell.
Many of the lower income households also experience severe overpayments for housing.

B. Future Housing Needs
California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local housing programs to
meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income groups, as determined by the
jurisdiction’s Council of Governments. This “fair share” allocation concept seeks to ensure that each
jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident population, but also for
the jurisdiction’s projected share of regional housing growth across all income categories. Regional growth
needs are defined as the number of units that would have to be added in each jurisdiction to
accommodate the forecasted number of households, as well as the number of units that would have to
be added to compensate for anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate.
In the Bay Area region, the agency responsible for assigning these regional housing needs to each
jurisdiction is the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The regional growth allocation process
begins with the State Department of Finance’s projections of population and associated of housing
demand for the planning period. ABAG is responsible for allocating the region’s projected housing needs
among its jurisdictions by income category. This is referred to as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) process. The RHNA represents the minimum number of housing units each community is required
to provide “adequate sites” for through zoning and is one of the primary threshold criteria necessary to
achieve State approval of the Housing Element.
In devising the formula for allocating the 187,990 units amongst jurisdictions, ABAG had to consider how
each of these statutory factors could be incorporated into the mathematical equation. ABAG staff and
members of the Housing Methodology Committee sought input from every jurisdiction in the Bay Area on
the factors and how they could be used. The final allocation method adopted by ABAG’s Executive Board
includes factors related to housing and employment growth, and public transit.
As defined by the RHNA, Campbell’s new construction need for the 2015-2023 time period has been
established at 933 new units as distributed among the four income categories as shown in Table A-28.
Through this Housing Element, the City will demonstrate the availability of adequate sites to
accommodate these projected new units.

APPENDIX B. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City’s population and housing
stock as a means of better understanding the nature and extent of unmet housing needs. Appendix B,
the Housing Needs Assessment is comprised of the following components: (1) Market Constraints; (2)
Governmental Constraints; and (3) Environmental Constraints. The provision of adequate and
affordable housing opportunities is an important goal of the City. However, there are a variety of
factors that can encourage or constrain the development, maintenance, and improvement of the
housing stock in Campbell. These include market mechanisms, government codes, and physical and
environmental constraints. This section addresses the potential market, governmental, and
environmental constraints in Campbell.
1. Market Constraints
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing reinvestment,
and can potentially hinder the production of new affordable housing. Although many constraints are
driven by market conditions, jurisdictions have some leverage in instituting policies and programs to
addressing the constraints.
A. Development Costs
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multi-family housing
generally less expensive to construct than single family homes. However, there is wide variation within
each construction type depending on the size of unit and the number and quality of amenities
provided, such as fireplaces, swimming pools, and interior fixtures among others. Land costs may vary
depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing use which must be removed.
Ways to reduce development costs include a reduction in amenities and the quality of building
materials (above a minimum acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) which could,
in theory, result in lower sales prices. In addition, prefabricated factory-built housing may provide for
lower priced housing by reducing materials and labor costs. Another factor related to construction
costs is the number of units built at one time. As the number increases, overall costs generally decrease
as builders can benefit from economies of scale.
Another key component is the price of raw land and any necessary improvements. The diminishing
supply of residential land combined with a high demand for such development keeps land cost high in
cities across the Bay Area. One large lot vacant land sale occurred in 2013. A 2.6 acres parcel on Abbott
Avenue sold for $4.1 million. The property is located in the R-1-9 Zone. An evaluation of the number
of units that could be constructed on the site, based upon the need to extend Abbott Avenue across

B. Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including the type of
lending institutions active in the community, lending practices, rates and fees charged, laws and
regulations governing financial institutions, and equal access to those institutions. Through analysis of
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on the disposition of residential loan applications, an
assessment can be made of the availability of residential financing within a community.
Chart B-1 summarizes HMDA data for both Campbell and Santa Clara County as a whole, providing
information on the approval status of all home purchase and home improvement loan applications in
2012. Of the total of 530 applications for home purchase loans in Campbell, 81 percent were approved,
9 percent denied, and 10 percent withdrawn or incomplete. In comparison to the County-wide
average, mortgage loan approval rates were slightly higher in Campbell (81%), than the County (78%).
Approval rates for home improvement loans were however somewhat lower in Campbell than Santa
Clara County as a whole, at 67 percent compared to 70 percent County-wide.

Review of mortgage loan denial rates by census tract identifies one area in Campbell with a denial rate
more than double the citywide average of 9 percent. Of the 65 applications for mortgage loans in
Census Tract 5066.06, (located in northwest Campbell immediately west of the San Tomas
Expressway), 19 percent (12 applications) were denied.
2. Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and in particular, the
provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and exactions,
permit processing procedures, and various other issues may present constraints to the maintenance,
development and improvement of housing. This section discusses potential governmental constraints
in Campbell.
A. Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element of the General Plan sets forth the City’s policies for guiding local development.
These policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land
allocated for different uses within Campbell. As summarized below in Table B-2, the Land Use Element
provides for six residential land use designations, a mobile home park designation, one commercial
designation, and three mixed-use designations that allow for residential uses. The Commercial/Light

B. Zoning Standards
The Campbell Zoning Ordinance, Title 21 of the Municipal Code, contains the primary
development provisions that implement the development of private land under the General
Plan (include the Housing Element).
Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily through
the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the City’s General Plan. The Zoning
Code also serves to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. The Code sets forth
the City’s specific residential development standards, which are summarized in Table B-3.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                              Page B 3

         Avenue Area Plan, South of Campbell Avenue Area Plan, East Campbell Avenue Master Plan, and Winchester
         Boulevard Master Plan).
Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirement for residential districts varies by housing type and anticipated parking
needs. The City calculates the parking requirements by unit type with one standard for Studio and One-
Bedroom units and a slightly higher standard for 2 or more Bedroom units. Table B-4 below
incorporates the new parking standards adopted in 2011 for Transit Oriented Developments and for
Small Lot Single Family housing projects.

The standard parking requirement for small lot single family projects is slightly higher than that for
single-family homes because small lot single family developments commonly do not have private
driveways or open street frontage for additional parking. The City has also found that the parking need
for these projects is greater than those for apartments or other multiple-family uses because they are

often larger in size and have more bedrooms. Small lot single family projects commonly have more
drivers per household than apartments, and consequently, often have more vehicles.
The City permits carports in lieu of garages for all housing units, which can serve to reduce
development costs. Under the City’s density bonus program, projects that provide affordable (below
market rate) or senior housing may be eligible for a reduction in the parking requirements (per Zoning
Code Section 21.28.050). Additionally, the Planning Commission has the authority to adjust the parking
requirements for specific projects when they determine that there are circumstances that warrant an
adjustment. These circumstances may include proximity to light rail stations, transit corridors, or major
employment centers. The Planning Commission or City Council may also permit projects consisting of
two diverse land uses (such as residential and commercial) to jointly occupy the same parking spaces
when their parking demands occur at different times.
Examples of parking modifications/reductions approved by the City Council during the previous
Housing Element cycle include:
   Bay West Development, 1677 S. Bascom Avenue, the Planning Commission approved the use of
    tandem parking spaces for nine of the 168 units in the project.
   Merrill Gardens, 2014 Winchester Boulevard, the City Council approved 54 parking spaces for 126
    senior housing units.
   651 West Hamilton Avenue, the Planning Commission approved a reduction in the amount of
    required parking of approximately 70 spaces (2.3 parking spaces per unit versus 3.0 parking spaces
    per unit).
Special Master Plan and Area Plans
Campbell has adopted numerous area plans. Most of these are located around the Downtown area
and around the existing VTA light rail stations. The four master and area plans which contain most of
the opportunity housing sites are discussed below.
The North of Campbell Avenue (NOCA) Area Plan is located north of the civic center and south of East
Hamilton Avenue along Salmar Avenue. This Area Plan was developed to guide this area from primarily
industrial land uses to small lot and single family residences. About half of the original plan area has
been converted to residential uses. Residential densities up to 20 units per acre are envisioned in this
area.
The East Campbell Avenue Master Plan is located along East Campbell Avenue between the Downtown
and Highway 17. The goal of the Master Plan is to implement Land Use Policy 6.1, “Expansion of
Downtown: Facilitate and encourage the evolution of the Downtown beyond the loop streets,
eastward to the Hwy 17 overpass and westward to the Community Center, through public
improvements, urban design and land use patterns that connect both visually and physically this
stretch of Campbell Avenue.” Residential densities up to 27 units per acre are envisioned in this area.

The South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA) Area Plan is located immediately south of the East Campbell
Avenue Master Plan between Campbell Avenue on the north, San Tomas Expressway on the south, Los
Gatos Creek on the east, and Railway Avenue (the current VTA light rail line) on the west. This Area
Plan was developed to guide the redevelopment of this area from older single family residential mixed
with commercial and industrial land uses toward more higher density residential density and office
development near the VTA Downtown Campbell light rail station and Downtown Campbell. Residential
densities up to 27 units per acre are envisioned in this area.
The Winchester Boulevard Master Plan runs along both sides of Winchester Boulevard. The purpose
of this Master Plan The goal of the Master Plan is to transform Winchester Boulevard into a vibrant
mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented street, lined with ground-level businesses with residential or office
above. The plan also intends to facilitate the physical and visual connection to Downtown and
Campbell Avenue, as well as help increase Central Campbell’s walkability and livability by providing
increased housing and shopping opportunities. Residential densities up to 27 units per acre are
envisioned in this area.
Flexible Design Provisions
The City offers various mechanisms to provide relief from development standards that are typically
required of all residential projects under the Zoning Code. These mechanisms include mixed-use
development provisions and the density bonus program in conjunction with the P-D Zone.
Planned Development (P-D) Zone
The purpose of the P-D Zoning District is to provide a degree of flexibility that is not generally available
in other zoning districts. The flexibility is intended to allow developments that are more consistent
with site characteristics while creating an optimum quantity and use of open space and good design
consistent with the underlying General Plan Land Use Designation and any adopted guidelines for the
area. The P-D Zone also facilitates mixed-use development, development concessions, and modified
parking standards. Most of the Area Plan and Master Plan areas are zoned P-D.
Mixed-Use Development
Within the City of Campbell, there are several areas where mixed use development is encouraged, both
as residential and commercial uses combined on a single parcel, and as components of a single
development. A key strategy of the City’s General Plan is to integrate residential development along
designated commercial corridors to create activity along the street, provide a variety of housing types
near work and shopping, and enhance public safety. This strategy ensures safer, more viable
commercial areas, with mixed-use residents helping to ensure the viability of the commercial uses.
Mixed-use development is located next to sidewalks or landscape setback areas adjacent to the public
street to enhance visibility, pedestrian access and interaction with the commercial uses.
The City’s zoning ordinance provides several incentives to encourage mixed use. The allowable density
of a mixed-use project is defined by the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) contained in specific land use policies
within each Area or Specific Plan; residential uses are encouraged but not included in the calculation
of the Floor Area Ratio. Campbell also allows for a shared parking reduction where two or more uses
have distinct and differing peak parking usage periods. Furthermore, a reduction in the required open
space for the residential component of a mixed-use project may be granted where the full amount of
open space is unable to be accommodated due to the urban infill characteristics of the site. The City

                                                                                        City of Campbell
                                                                          2015-2023 Housing Element
has approved several mixed-use projects since adoption of the prior Housing Element. In addition,
many of the previously approved projects that had been put on-hold because of The Great Recession
of 2007-2009 are currently under development. The current City approved projects include the
following:
        The Merrill Gardens Project (2041 – 2127 S. Winchester Blvd.) initially approved in 2007,
         slightly modified by 2011, and was completed in December of 2013 and is now occupied. This
         project consists of 126 total units including 99 senior market rate units, 27 non-age restricted
         apartments, and an Alzheimer’s care unit. Of the 126 units, 19 very low income units are
         distributed throughout the project. The project also includes 18,000 square feet of retail space
         fronting Winchester Boulevard. The City Council approved several concessions including
         waiving the park fees for the affordable units.
        Bay West Development (1677 S. Bascom Ave) – The City approved this mixed-use project in
         2012 at the maximum zoned density of 27 units per acre. The project provides 126 market rate
         apartments and 15,295 square feet of retail space fronting Hamilton Avenue. Campbell
         approved a density bonus project of 14 Below Market Rate units as part of this project.
Affordable Housing Density Bonus
The City of Campbell continues to offer density bonus incentives for the provision of affordable housing
and routinely updates the Zoning Ordinance as program requirements change. These provisions were
last amended in 2008 to incorporate recent changes to State Law. The density bonus provisions include
both the additional density requirement and the development concession provisions. The Density
Bonus provisions are contained in Chapter 21.20 of the Municipal Code and incorporate the
requirements of Government Code Section 65915.
For incorporating any of the following items, a housing developer will receive a twenty percent density
bonus above the density normally allowed by the Zoning Ordinance. To receive this density bonus a
project must incorporate one of the following:
      Ten percent of the total units for lower income households; or
      Five percent of the total units for very low income households; or
      A senior citizen housing development (or mobile home park) that limits residency based on
         age requirements for housing for older persons.
In addition, by providing ten percent of the total units for moderate income households, an additional
five percent density bonus is also available. The moderate income density bonus applies only to for
sale units in a common interest development (as defined by Section 1351 of the California Civil Code).
The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled varies according to the amount by which
the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the minimum percentage established in this
section, but generally ranges from 20 to 35 percent above the specified General Plan Residential
Density. In addition to the density bonus, eligible projects may receive up to three additional
development incentives, depending on the proportion of affordable units and level of income
targeting.

                                                                                        City of Campbell
                                                                          2015-2023 Housing Element
Zoning Code Chapter 21.20 also includes provisions to allow development standard concessions for
projects receiving a density bonus. The typical concessions/incentives that are offered include the
following.
      A reduction in site development standards (e.g., setback and square footage requirements,
         and/or parking requirements) or architectural design requirements. At the request of the
         developer, the City will permit a parking ratio (inclusive of handicapped and guest parking) of
         one space for 0-1 bedroom units, two spaces for 2-3 bedroom units, and 2½ spaces for four or
         more bedrooms.
      Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if nonresidential land
         uses would reduce the cost of individual units in the housing project, and the nonresidential
         land uses would be compatible with the housing project and adjoining development.
      Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the permit applicant or the City that
         would result in identifiable cost reductions. Examples include a reduction in the amount of
         required on-site parking, expedited processing pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule,
         and, the deferral of the collection of impact fees on market rate units until issuance of a
         certificate of occupancy.
The City advertises the availability of density bonus incentives on its website, and provides information
to prospective residential applicants. The Merrill Gardens and Bay West Development projects were
both granted an affordable housing density bonus of 35% for the incorporation of Very Low Income
units into the projects.
Inclusionary Housing
Particularly since Campbell now requires 15 percent inclusionary units on a citywide basis, density
bonuses offer a means of offsetting the cost of providing the required affordable units. Zoning Code
Chapter 21.24 requires new residential projects with ten or more units to provide at least 15 percent
of the total units for low and moderate income households at an affordable housing cost. Rental units
are required to be made available to very low and low income households (minimum 40% to very low),
while owner units are to be available to low and moderate income households. Previous regulatory
agreements are recorded on inclusionary projects that require affordability for a period of 45 years for
ownership units and 55 years for rental units.
The Inclusionary Housing Program originally addressed both rental and ownership units, however, due
to a recent court case, the provisions which apply to rental units have been temporarily suspended.
As a means of providing flexibility in compliance with inclusionary requirements, the City allows the
following alternatives to provision of on-site affordable units:
      Off-site construction of affordable units;
      Provision of rental units in for-sale projects (subject to Very Low and Low income affordability);
      Dedication of land sufficient to accommodate the required affordable units; or
      Payment of an in-lieu housing fee (for projects with densities at or below six units per acre).
         The current fees are $34.50 per square foot for ownership housing units and $21.50 for rental
         housing units.

                                                                                       City of Campbell
                                                                           2015-2023 Housing Element
Campbell’s inclusionary ordinance also provides for a reduction or waiver of the inclusionary
requirement if an applicant can show there is no reasonable relationship between the project and the
requirement for affordable units, or if application of the inclusionary requirements represents a taking.
Since the adoption of the Ordinance, several larger projects have been required to provide affordable
units. Examples include of these project include the senior housing project by Merrill Gardens on
Winchester Boulevard and the Bay West Development on South Bascom Avenue. During this time
many smaller projects, with less than 10 units, have been exempt from the ordinance. The City has
not received negative feedback from developers of these larger projects in terms of affecting project
viability. The ordinance is similar to surrounding cities and is generally accepted by the regional
development community.
C. Provisions for a Variety of Housing
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various
types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family homes, multi-
family housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, supportive housing, and
transitional housing. Table B-5 below summarizes housing types permitted within all residential and
commercial zones. The Condominium-Planned Development (C-PD) is required for all projects
proposing a condominium ownership project. Development under the C-PD Zone is processed using
the P-D Zone development review processes.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                 Page B 9

Multi-Family Rental Housing
The City’s Zoning Code provides for apartment (rental) developments in the R-M, R-2, R-3, and P-D
Zoning Districts by-right, and with approval of a conditional use permit in the C-3 (Central Business
District) Zone. Densities of up to 27 dwelling units per acre are permitted, with additional densities for
affordable and senior housing. The General Plan also provides for high density residential on
designated commercial corridors surrounding the Valley Transit Agency (VTA) Light Rail Stations at
Downtown Campbell and at Winchester. The VTA light rail system allows easy access to the rest of the
urbanized core of Santa Clara County.
Campbell’s development standards have proven to be effective in allowing projects to achieve
maximum densities. Given high land costs, the majority of multi-family and mixed use developments
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                              Page B 10

                                                                                         City of Campbell
                                                                             2015-2023 Housing Element
in Campbell are built at or near maximum permitted densities. Recent examples include: Creekside
Commons (27 du/acre with density bonus) and Merrill Gardens senior housing (34 du/acre with density
bonus). These and other infill project examples demonstrate that the City’s development standards
have not served as a constraint to achieving maximum zoned densities.
Condominiums
Similar to many jurisdictions, Campbell’s Zoning Code distinguishes between condominium
(ownership) and multiple family (rental) housing. The C-PD (Condominium-Planned Development)
zoning district provides for the construction of new condominiums, or conversion of existing rental
housing into condominium ownership subject to a planned development permit. Condominiums are
also conditionally permitted in the C-3 (Central Business District) Zone.
In order to provide maximum flexibility for projects and provide the city appropriate levels of
discretion, large areas of the City are zoned Planned Development (P-D). This designation has proven
over time to be an excellent vehicle for providing unique, custom tailored development solutions to
generally small, heavily constrained in-fill sites. The City requires a zoning designation of Condominium
Planned Development for condominium projects. This zoning requirement has not been a barrier to
the approval of numerous condominium projects in the past.
Secondary Dwelling Units
The purpose of permitting additional living units in single-family districts is to allow more efficient use
of the existing housing stock and infrastructure to provide the opportunity for the development of
small rental housing units designed to meet the special housing needs of individuals and families, while
preserving the integrity of single-family neighborhoods. Zoning Code Section 21.36.200 addresses the
requirements for both attached and detached second units as an accessory use in Single Family (R-1)
zoning districts. Campbell’s Zoning Code contains the following standards for secondary dwelling units.
        The minimum lot size is at least 10,000 square foot.
        The maximum size is limited to 640 square feet, one bedroom and one-story in height, unless
         the lot is larger than 250% of the minimum required size in zone (when these size limitations
         for the units do not apply).
        In conjunction with the primary single-family dwelling, a total of four parking spaces are
         required, two of which shall be covered. Spaces may be allowed in tandem in a driveway of a
         two-car garage if the garage meets minimum setbacks and lot configuration precludes
         placement of parking areas elsewhere on the property.
        Must meet all of the applicable development standards of the zoning district (for example,
         setbacks, lot coverage, and floor area ratio);
        Required to be designed so that the appearance of the property remains that of a single-family
         residence (for example, the entrances to secondary dwelling units must not be visible from the
         street); and,
        A deed restriction is required that stipulates that only one of the two units on the property
         may be rented at any one time.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                  Page B 11

                                                                                       City of Campbell
                                                                           2015-2023 Housing Element
Campbell receives an average of 1 to 2 second unit applications annually with a total of 4 second units
constructed between 2009 and 2013. Approximately one thousand Single Family zoned parcels in
Campbell meet the minimum lot size requirement. This provides a significant additional capacity for
second units.
Manufactured Housing/Mobile Homes
Section 65852.3 of the California Government Code requires jurisdictions to administratively allow
manufactured homes on lots zoned for single-family dwellings if they meet certain standards. More
specifically, the Government Code requires the following:
       “Except with respect to architectural requirements, a city … shall only subject the
       manufactured home and the lot on which it is placed to the same development standards to
       which a conventional single-family residential dwelling on the same lot would be subject,
       including, but not limited to, building setback standards, side and rear yard requirements,
       standards for enclosures, access, and vehicle parking, aesthetic requirements, and minimum
       square footage requirements. Any architectural requirements imposed on the manufactured
       home structure itself, exclusive of any requirement for any and all additional enclosures, shall
       be limited to its roof overhang, roofing material, and siding material. These architectural
       requirements may be imposed on manufactured homes even if similar requirements are not
       imposed on conventional single-family residential dwellings. However, any architectural
       requirements for roofing and siding material shall not exceed those which would be required
       of conventional single-family dwellings constructed on the same lot. At the discretion of the
       local legislative body, the city or county may preclude installation of a manufactured home in
       zones specified in this section if more than 10 years have elapsed between the date of
       manufacture of the manufactured home and the date of the application for the issuance of a
       permit to install the manufactured home in the affected zone. In no case may a city, including
       a charter city, county, or city and county, apply any development standards that will have the
       effect of precluding manufactured homes from being installed as permanent residences.”
The City treats manufactured homes as simply another form of construction and does not apply any
requirements to them other than what normally applies to new residential construction. A number of
manufactured homes have gone through the normal design review process and been approved and
built. Manufacture home on individual lots are allowed in the R-1 Single Family Zoning District.
Mobile Home Parks
Campbell permits mobile home parks in the P-D Zoning District on parcels with a Mobile Home Park
General Plan land use designation. There are currently two mobile home parks in Campbell: Paseo de
Palomas (106 units) and Timbercove Mobile Home Park (137 units).
Residential Care Homes and Residential Service Facilities
Campbell’s Zoning Code defines Residential Care Homes as licensed facilities where care, services, or
treatment is provided to persons living in a community residential setting. Residential Service Facilities
are defined as a residential facility where the operator receives compensation for the provision of

occupants) and large (seven or more occupants) Residential Care Homes and Residential Service
Facilities.
Section 1566.3 of the California Health and Safety Code requires residential facilities serving six or
fewer persons to be considered a residential use of property for purposes of local zoning ordinances.
No local agency can impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these residential
facilities – such as a conditional use permit (CUP), zoning variance or other zoning clearance - than is
required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone. The Campbell Zoning Code permits
Residential Care Homes and Residential Service Facilities serving six or fewer persons by right in all
residential zones (R-1, R-D, R-M, R-2, R-3, P-D), and does not subject such facilities to a use permit,
building standard, or regulation not otherwise required of single-family homes in the same zone.
The Health and Safety Code further states that no local zoning ordinance can include residential
facilities which serve six or fewer residents in the definition of a boarding house, rooming house,
institution or home for the care of minors, the aged, or the mentally infirm, foster care home, guest
home, rest home, sanitarium, mental hygiene home, or other similar term which implies that the
residential facility is a business run for profit or differs in any way from a family dwelling. In compliance
with the State statutes, the Campbell’s Zoning Code provides the following separate definition for
Rooming and Boarding Facilities, which are conditionally permitted in R-D, R-M, R-2 and R-3 zones:
     “Rooming and Boarding houses means houses with individual bedrooms that are rented to
     between three to five persons for profit, whether or not meals are provided.”
Due to the unique characteristics of larger (more than six persons) residential care homes/facilities,
most jurisdictions require a CUP to ensure neighborhood compatibility in the siting of these facilities.
As indicated previously in Table B-5, the Campbell Zoning Code provides for Residential Care Homes
and Service Facilities with more than six occupants in most all residential zone districts, subject to
approval of a CUP by the Planning Commission. The required findings for approval of a CUP in Campbell
are directed towards ensuring compatibility of the proposed use and not tied to the user, and therefore
are not viewed as a constraint per se to the provision of residential care facilities.
The California courts have invalidated the following definition of “family” within jurisdictions Zoning
Ordinances: (a) an individual, (b) two or more persons related by blood, marriage or adoption, or (c) a
group of not more than a certain number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit. Court
rulings state that defining a family does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose
recognized under the zoning and land planning powers of the city, and therefore violates rights of
privacy under the California Constitution. A zoning ordinance also cannot regulate residency by
discrimination between biologically related and unrelated persons. In 2014, Campbell’s Zoning Code
was amended to redefine the term of “family”. Family now means: “an individual or group of persons
living together who constitute a bona fide single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit. "Family" shall
not be construed to include a fraternity, sorority, club, or other group of persons occupying a hotel,
lodging house, or institution of any kind.” The revised definition is now consistent with State and
Federal law on the definition of family.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                     Page B 13

                                                                                          City of Campbell
                                                                           2015-2023 Housing Element
The previous definition of family (while not entirely consistent with the new definition) did not function
to preclude residential care or other group housing from the City’s residential zone districts, as
evidenced by the State Community Care Licensing Division which identified three Adult Residential
Facilities, three Adult Residential Facility for Persons with Special Health Care Needs, and fourteen
Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly in Campbell.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
During the 2014 Zoning Ordinance amendment, Campbell provided specific definitions for supportive
housing, transitional housing, and target population to comply with State Law. The new definitions
area as follows:
        Transitional housing means “buildings configured as rental housing development, but operated
         under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the
         assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that
         shall be no less than six months from the beginning of the assistance.”
        Supportive housing means “housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
         target population, and that is linked to an onsite or offsite service that assists the supportive
         housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing
         his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.”
        Target population means “persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities,
         including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or
         individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities
         Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code)
         and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children,
         elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from
         institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.”
Until recently, Zoning Code Section 21.36.230, included requirements for a conditional use permit as
well as a 300 foot separation requirement between transitional facilities and another similar facility or
single-family zoned parcel. However, in 2014 Transitional and Supportive Housing became permitted
uses in all residential zoning districts (R-1, R-D, R-M, R-2, R-3, and P-D). This is also shown in Table B-
5.
Emergency Shelters
State Law requires that local jurisdictions allow for emergency shelters. In compliance with SB 2,
Campbell has reviewed its zoning districts and determined a portion of the M-1 Zoning District is best
suited to be most conducive to house an emergency homeless shelter. The 2014 amendment defined
Emergency Shelter as “temporary housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons
that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or
household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.” Emergency Shelters
are now allowed, without a conditional use permit, in a portion of the M-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning
District bounded generally by Camden Avenue, Los Gatos Creek County Park, Hacienda Avenue and
Winchester Boulevard.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                   Page B 14

                                                                                        City of Campbell
                                                                           2015-2023 Housing Element
This sub-area of the M-1 Zoning District provides for light industrial and commercial uses, and is located
centrally within the city and has good proximity to transit (bus and light rail service). While there are
a limited number of vacant parcels within the identified M-1-S Sub-area, a large number of properties
are either underutilized or have existing structures which could potentially be suitable for conversion
to shelter use. The Sub-area encompasses 53 parcels with an average lot size of approximately 33,000
sq. ft (0.75 acres).
The emergency shelter by-right area is shown on Figure B-1. Emergency shelters in other locations will
still approval of a conditional use permit in accordance with Title 21 of the Campbell Municipal Code.
              Figure B-1: Emergency Shelters as a Permitted Use
As discussed in the Homeless section of the Housing Needs Assessment, the 2013 Santa Clara Homeless
Survey identified 91 homeless people in Campbell and there are currently no homeless shelters in the
City. Pursuant to SB 2, jurisdictions with an unmet need for emergency shelters are now required to
identify a zone(s) where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a conditional
use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at least one year-round shelter.
Permit processing, development and management standards for emergency shelters must be objective
and facilitate the development of, or conversion to, emergency shelters.
Based on the 2013 estimate of Campbell’s homeless population (91 persons), it appears that this area
is suitable for this purpose and of adequate size to provide sufficient opportunities to meet this
requirement. This area is depicted in Figure B-1.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                 Page B 15

                                                                          2015-2023 Housing Element
Section 21.36.085 of the Municipal Code establishes the standards for emergency shelters. The
development standards in the Emergency Shelter Sub-Area are the same as for all other development
in the M-1 Zone. The operational standards for emergency shelters are outline below.
         Maximum number of beds. Shall be based upon the number of homeless persons identified in
          the current Santa Clara County Homeless Census and Survey (the 2013 Homeless Census
          identified ninety-one homeless persons in the City).
         On-site parking. The shelter shall provide for one (1 ) parking space for each three (3) beds.
          Parking modifications, authorized by Section 21.28.050 of the Zoning Code, are routinely used
          to reduce the parking requirements for affordable housing, high density residential, and mixed
          use projects. There are no restrictions on the types of land uses, including emergency
          shelters, that are eligible to receive parking modifications.
         Waiting and intake area. The shelter shall provide a private area to receive clients for waiting
          and intake.
         Length of stay. Residents may stay for thirty days. Extensions up to a total of one hundred
          eighty (180) days may be provided by the on-site manager if no alternative housing is available.
         Lighting. The shelter shall have adequate outdoor lighting for security purposes.
         Security. On-site security and security cameras shall be provided.
         On-site management. The shelter shall provide 24-hour, professional on-site management
          pursuant to a Management and Operation Plan approved by the City.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single Room Occupancy facilities are defined as “a residential facility providing dwelling units where
each unit has a minimum floor area of 150 square feet and a maximum floor area of 220 square feet,
and are rented to a one- or two-person household. These dwelling units may have kitchen or bathroom
facilities, and are provided for a weekly or monthly period of time, in exchange for an agreed payment
of a fixed amount of money or other compensation based on the period of occupancy.” SRO’s can
provide an entry point into the housing market for extremely low income individuals, formerly
homeless and disabled persons. Campbell has reviewed the City’s zoning districts and determined that
a portion of the R-3 zone is the most conducive to provision of SROs, either through new development
or reuse of an existing building.
The City intends to conditionally allow SRO’s in the R-3-S Multiple-Family Zone. This zoning district is
the City’s highest density residential zone and allows development up to 27 dwelling units per gross
acre. This zoning district is distributed in areas throughout Campbell with the largest single area
concentrated along Union Avenue on the eastern side of Campbell, in proximity to South Bascom
Avenue. There are 92 parcels in the R-3 zone, with an average lot size of 48,000 sq. ft (1.1 acres),
providing sufficient sites for SRO use.

                                                                                       City of Campbell
                                                                          2015-2023 Housing Element
Farm Employee Housing
The Census identifies fewer than one hundred Campbell residents employed in farming, fishing and
forestry occupations, representing less than one percent of the City’s labor force. No parcels in the City
remain in agricultural use. Therefore, given the extremely limited presence of farmworkers in the
community, the City has not identified a need for specialized farmworker housing beyond overall
programs for housing affordability.
Accessibility Accommodations
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an
affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it
may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties that have
already been developed to accommodate residents with mobility impairments.
It is the policy of the City of Campbell to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with
disabilities seeking fair access to housing in the application of its zoning laws. In furtherance of this
policy, Chapter 21.50 of the Zoning Code sets forth the process for making a request for reasonable
accommodation. Campbell’s process and findings for reasonable accommodation can be summarized
as follows:
       The applicant is provided a form to identify the Zoning Code provision, regulation or policy
          from which accommodation is being requested, and to provide the basis for the claim and why
          the accommodation is necessary.
       The Community Development Director serves as the reviewing body for the request, unless
          the project for which the request is being made requires some other discretionary and use
          permit or approval.
       The following factors are considered in determining the reasonableness of a requested
          accommodation:
                Special need created by the disability;
                Potential benefit that can be accomplished by the requested modification;
                Potential impact on surrounding uses;
                Physical attributes of the property and structures;
                Alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit;
                In the case of a determination involving a single-family dwelling, whether the
                 household would be considered a single housekeeping unit if it were not using special
                 services that are required because of the disabilities of the residents.
                Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or
                 administrative burden on the city
The factors for consideration of a reasonable accommodation request do not serve as deterrents to
housing accessibility. The “potential benefit” factor is a standard finding that is a restatement of the
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                Page B 17

                                                                                        City of Campbell
                                                                           2015-2023 Housing Element
City’s policy that the granting of a reasonable accommodation is a benefit by definition as it facilitates
providing fair access to housing. The “potential impact on surrounding uses” factor can be addressed,
to the extent necessary, by evaluating alternative approaches to addressing the accessibility needs of
the disabled to minimize the potential impact on the surrounding neighborhood.
Since adoption of the Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance in 2004, the City has had one request for
a modification. The request involved a new market rate development which incorporated three
affordable units pursuant to the City’s inclusionary requirements. An income eligible applicant for one
of the affordable units was physically disabled. The City approved the modification request through a
ministerial process, and in addition provided funding to retrofit the affordable unit – including lowered
countertops and a fully accessible bathroom.
D. Development Permit Procedures
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals varies depending
on the scope of the project. Smaller projects typically require less time and larger projects more time.
The City strives to keep its permit procedures streamlined and processing times minimal. The Planning
Division is the lead agency in processing residential development applications and coordinates the
processing of those applications with other City departments such as the Public Works Department
and the Building Division of the Community Development Department.
Multi-family and Mixed-Use residential projects typically require some type of discretionary action.
Projects with Planned Development (P-D) zoning designation require a P-D permit from the Planning
Commission and City Council. Processing times for a P-D project take typically four to six months. This
provision for P-D approvals is not a constraint on projects because the project usually requires other
entitlements such as a parking adjustment, deviation from other development standards and/or
subdivision map that would require public hearings. The requirement for a P-D approval for multi-
family projects or mixed-use projects in P-D zoning districts allows for a case by case approach that can
achieve maximum flexibility.
As residential neighborhoods in Campbell are nearly built-out, the majority of new residential
development has been accommodated through mixed-use projects within the P-D Zoning District. The
P-D mechanism allows for deviations in minimum lot size, lot coverage, building setbacks and building
height standards.
Development certainty and predictability are provided through the General Plan, which clearly defines
development scenarios for all areas zoned P-D. The General Plan Land Use Element provides for
specific development types such as Central Commercial, Professional Office/Retail/Residential and
describes mixed-use development as the preferred development type. These areas are described by
the General Plan as follows:
        Central Commercial: This designation includes parts of Campbell and Winchester Avenues in
         Downtown Campbell and is intended to provide shopping, services and entertainment. It
         requires that the building forms in this designation edge the street, and should include retail
         commercial uses on the ground floor with either office or residential uses on the second and
         third floors.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                 Page B 18

                                                                                            City of Campbell
                                                                             2015-2023 Housing Element
         Low-Medium Density Residential and/or Professional Office: This designation occurs
          primarily near Downtown, where there is a need for office uses to buffer the single family
          homes from commercial impacts. Many parcels have homes that are on the Historic Inventory.
         Medium to High Density Residential and/or Commercial: This designation occurs near the
          Downtown in the South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA), where the General Plan identifies parcels
          for commercial or mixed use, promoting commercial on the ground floor, and residential uses
          above.
         Residential/ Commercial/Professional Office: This designation includes many areas in the City
          including the North of Campbell Avenue (NOCA), where the intention is to provide a residential
          component to traditional commercial and/or professional office uses. This designation also
          maintains commercial and office uses on the ground floor and residential uses on the upper
          floors.
Development standards are derived by two different sources for properties within the P-D zone. If the
site is located in a Master Plan or Specific Plan area (e.g. for 11 of 17 opportunity sites) the development
standards of the Master Plan are used as the starting point for the design and review of the P-D project.
These Plans include the East Campbell Avenue Master Plan, the Winchester Boulevard Master Plan,
and the South of Campbell Avenue (SOCA) and North of Campbell Avenue (NOCA) Area Plans. In areas
where there is no Master Plan for an area (e.g. for 11 of 17 opportunity sites) development standards
for the underlying zoning district are used. For example, projects in the Hamilton/STEX Area are
evaluated using development standards of R-3, while those in the West Campbell Avenue Area use
development standards of R-M, R-2, and R-3 Zones, depending on the site. Each of these zones has
clear development standards that can be used while developing the project design.
However, because of the sufficient flexibility built into the P-D zone to resolve any project design
challenges, the P-D zoning designation requires that specific findings be made, which focus on the
exemplary architecture and high quality physical project design rather than simply the land use, and
density or other numeric criteria. The review and approval of a P-D project are based upon
considerations relating to site circulation, traffic congestion, and traffic safety; considerations related
to landscaping; and considerations relating to structure and site lay-out.
These findings have allowed for a long track record of successful mixed-use projects including the
Gateway mixed use (25 du/acre); Water Tower Lofts (27 du/acre); Onyx (27 du/acre); Campbell Center
(26 du/acre); Gilman Cottages (27 du/acre); Creekside Commons (27 du/acre with a density bonus);
and Merrill Gardens (34 du/acre with density bonus). These projects have all been approved by the
City in a timely fashion (4 to 6 months typically) without impacting project feasibility.
Campbell’s development process can be summarized in the following seven steps. All of these steps
may not be necessary depending on the nature of a project. The first four steps in the development
process are commonly referred to as the planning process, ending with project approval. Project
construction and occupancy is addressed in the final three steps. The typical lengths of time for the
planning process are shown in Table B-6.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                     Page B 19

                                                                         2015-2023 Housing Element
    Preliminary Application: The preliminary application process is offered at minimal cost to
      applicants. The submitted plans are routed to all the applicable departments of the
      Development Review Committee for review and comment. The Development Review
      Committee consists of representatives from City Departments and the County Fire
      Department. Approximately three weeks after the application is submitted, the applicant is
      invited to meet with staff from the various departments to go over the comments, discuss any
      particular concerns, and explain any special requirements of the projects. This process can save
      developers time and money by addressing potential concerns at an early stage thereby
      avoiding delays later in the process.
    Application Submittal: The planning application submittal process is when a developer
      submits a development application, required fees, and application materials.
    Plan Review: After the application is received, it is routed through the Development Review
      Committee. A planner is assigned to serve as the developer’s liaison helping to expedite the
      permit process and coordinating the department reviews. Individual departments assess the
      completeness of the application and prepare preliminary Conditions of Approval. A review of
      the environmental issues associated with the proposed project (as required by the California
      Environmental Quality Act) will also be completed at this time.
    Planning Commission/City Council Approval: If a project is determined to require
      discretionary action, it will be scheduled for the Site and Architectural Review Committee (if
      necessary) and Planning Commission meetings. Public Notice will be provided and all property
      owners within 300 feet of the project site will be notified by mail. In some instances (for
      example, Planned Development Permits), the project will require City Council approval. After
      projects receive approval by the Planning Commission there is a ten-day appeal period during
      which the project may be appealed to the City Council. The City Council decision is final.
    Plan Check: After the project receives any required approvals, the full plans may be submitted
      to the building division for plan check for building permits. The plans will be routed to the City’s
      Public Works Department and Planning Division. The project planner will review the plans for
      conformance with the Zoning Code, any required Conditions of Approval, and with the plans
      approved by the Planning Commission or City Council. The building division will verify that all
      building, fire, mechanical, plumbing and electrical code requirements are fulfilled in
      compliance with the Uniform Building Code and other State requirements.
    Building Permit: After the project plans receive approval from the relevant departments, the
      building division issues a building permit. Construction can begin after this point. Regular
      inspections are required throughout the construction process. The final inspection requires
      clearance from all relevant City departments and the County Fire Department.

     Occupancy Permit: Once the final inspection is complete, the developer needs to secure an
        occupancy permit. If park impact fees are required, the remaining balance must be paid at this
        time. Buildings or structures cannot be used or occupied until the Building Official has issued
        a certificate of occupancy. The Table below shows the average processing time for typical
        residential development applications.

          * Note: Processing times shown are averages and should not be used to assume that a specific project will be
             processed within this time period. The processing times apply to the first four phases of the development

E. Fees and Exactions
The City of Campbell collects various fees from developments to cover the costs of processing permits
and providing the necessary services and infrastructure related to new development projects. Fees
levied by the City are comparable to those charged in surrounding communities and thus not
considered a constraint to housing development. Table B-7 below summarizes the planning and
development fees collected by the City.

As a means of assessing the cost that fees contribute to development in Campbell, the City has
calculated the total Planning, Building, Public Works, and Non-City Agency fees associated with
development of two different residential prototypes. The first prototype consists of two new single
family residences, with parcel map on a lot with an existing single family residence. The building permit

related costs are based upon an estimated construction valuation of approximately $255,000 for a
1,900 square foot single family residence with a 400 square foot garage. The second prototype is a
new four unit multi-family project. The construction valuation for the four-plex is estimated to be
approximately $351,000 for four 800-square feet units. The building permit associated fees used in
this evaluation were based upon recent building permits issued by the City of Campbell.

As indicated in Table B-8, average development fees for the prototypical single-family in-fill project
was approximately $35,978 per unit while the cost for a small multi-family attached residential project
was approximately $20,038 per unit. In 2008, a similar case study analysis indicated that the typical
costs were about $32,000 and $24,000 per unit, respectively.
F. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Campbell has adopted the International Building Code of 2013, as amended by California’s
State Building Regulations (Title 24), which establishes standards and requires inspections at various
stages of construction to ensure code compliance. The City’s building code also requires new
residential construction to comply with the federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA), which
specifies a minimum percentage of dwelling units in new developments that must be fully accessible
to the physically disabled. Although these standards and the time required for inspections increase
housing production costs and may impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties which are
required to be brought up to current code standards, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally
sound, safe, and energy-efficient housing.
The City administers a Code Enforcement Program that aims to preserve and maintain the livability and
quality of neighborhoods. Code enforcement staff investigates violations of property maintenance
standards as defined in the Municipal Code as well as other complaints. When violations are identified
or cited, staff encourages property owners to seek assistance through the rehabilitation assistance
programs offered by Campbell or by the County of Santa Clara.
G. Site Improvements
Developers of single-family residential tracts in the City are required to improve arterial and local
streets; curbs, gutters, sidewalks; water lines; sewer; street lighting; and trees in the public right-of-
way within and adjacent to a tract. These capital improvements are in most cases dedicated to the City
or other agencies that are responsible for maintenance. Without improvement requirements, there
are no other means of providing necessary infrastructure. Requirements for site improvements are at
a level necessary to meet the City's costs and are necessary to protect health, safety, and welfare. The
cost of these required improvements vary upon the width of property frontage. The developed
portions of Campbell are already improved with necessary infrastructure, such as streets, electrical
and water facilities. Depending on the project and the condition of the existing infrastructure, some
projects may see a reduction in some site improvement costs. This reduction can help make some
projects more affordable.
The Circulation Element of the City of Campbell’s General Plan establishes the City’s street width
standards. Residential streets are required to have a standard 40 foot curb-to-curb width, with park
strips and sidewalks. The City does allow reduced 36 foot street widths, although due to the impact on
fire truck access, reduced street widths trigger fire sprinkler requirements in single-family homes. Most
projects utilize private streets where the site constraints determine the specific street design.
The City has also allowed rolled curbs in situations where there is a reduced parkway/sidewalk width
as a means of facilitating handicapped access for persons using the sidewalk. An example is the San

                                                                                         City of Campbell
                                                                            2015-2023 Housing Element
Tomas Area, a 1.5 square mile area in the southwest of the City governed by the San Tomas Area
Neighborhood Plan. This Plan requires rolled curbs and no sidewalks on minor streets to create a semi-
rural atmosphere, resulting in a reduced cost for off-site improvements.
3. Availability of Public Facilities and Services
As an urbanized community, Campbell has in place the necessary infrastructure to support additional
residential development. All land designated for residential or mixed-use are served by sewer and
water lines, streets, storm drains, telephone, electrical and gas lines. Public water supplies are
provided by the San Jose Water Company and public sewer is provided by the West Valley Sanitation
District. Natural gas and electricity is provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Pursuant to the
2001 General Plan Environmental Impact Report, there is adequate water and sewer capacity to serve
future development. To ensure the availability and adequacy of public facilities and services for future
development, the City, along with other providers of public services (e.g., water and sewer), will
continue to carry out regular infrastructure improvements and upgrading.
4. Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints and hazards affect, in varying degrees, existing and future residential
developments in Campbell. Discussed below are the major environmental hazards in the City. (More
detailed discussion of environmental safety issues is provided in the Health and Safety Element of the
General Plan)
A. Geologic and Seismic Hazards
Campbell is subject to the effects of earthquakes due to its location at the tectonic boundary between
the Pacific and North American Plates. The movement of these plates leads to the accumulation of
strain energy in the crustal rocks of the Bay Area. The release of strain energy by the sudden movement
of a fault creates earthquakes. Several active faults in the Bay Area region create a high likelihood of
future seismic events affecting Campbell. In particular, the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward-Rodgers
Creek Fault and the Calaveras Fault pose the greatest earthquake threat because they have high quake
odds and run through the Santa Clara Valley region’s urban core.
Within Campbell, earthquake damage to structures can be caused by ground rupture, near-field
effects, liquefaction and ground shaking. Damage associated with ground rupture is normally confined
to roads, buildings and utilities within a narrow band along a fault. The primary earthquake hazards
are ground shaking (acceleration of surface material) and liquefaction (sudden loss of soil strength due
to the upward migration of groundwater as a result of ground shaking). Liquefaction in Campbell is
most likely to occur in areas with fine-grained alluvial soils.
Unreinforced masonry buildings are extremely susceptible to ground shaking. The 1989 City
Unreinforced Masonry Ordinance identified ten potentially hazardous buildings identified in the City.
All of these buildings are non-residential structures.
Appendix B: Housing Constraints                                                                  Page B 25

                                                                                        City of Campbell
                                                                          2015-2023 Housing Element
B. Fire Hazards
Campbell may be affected by brush and structural fires that can threaten life and property. Brush fires
may occur due to natural or human causes on vacant lots where accumulation of weeds has increased
the fuel load. Structure fires are most likely in buildings constructed prior to the advent of modern
building codes, which comprise an increasingly smaller share of fire activity in Campbell. Most new
buildings are equipped with fire protection features such as alarm systems and sprinklers. Campbell
is not located in or immediately adjacent to areas subject to the hazards associated with wild land fires.
C. Flood Hazards
A flood is a temporary increase in water flow that overtops the banks of a river, stream, or drainage
channel to inundate adjacent areas not normally covered by water. Only a very small portion of
Campbell is subject to flooding, according to maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). Although natural factors such as overgrown brush and trees in creek channels can
obstruct water flow and increase flood damage, development poses the highest potential to increase
the magnitude and frequency of flooding. Campbell is primarily a suburban community with few
undeveloped areas where storm water can percolate into the ground. Additional paving will further
reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff. Localized flooding may also occur in low spots or where
infrastructure is unable to accommodate peak flows during a storm event. In most cases, localized
flooding dissipates quickly after heavy rain ceases. Many streets in the San Tomas neighborhood
annexed into the City in the 1970s have a rural character with no curb, gutter or paving, which
precludes installation of storm drain facilities. Although some nuisance flooding results, the City
anticipates preserving the rural character of the area. No opportunity sites are located within the San
Tomas neighborhood.
D. Impact of Environmental Constraints on Development
In summary, while Campbell is subject to the environmental constraints described above, the City’s
General Plan Health and Safety Element sets forth a series of actions to minimize these constraints.
Campbell incorporates this knowledge of safety hazards into its land use planning and development
review processes.
The residential opportunity sites identified in the Housing Element were all evaluated for their
suitability for housing as part of the environmental impact report (EIR) on the City’s 2001 General Plan.
The EIR concluded that all the opportunity sites – many of which were newly designated for mixed use
under the General Plan – were suitable for residential use and their development would not result in
a significant environmental impact. Campbell’s General Plan EIR is a program EIR which is based on the
concept of “tiering”, which means that as project proposals are made on specific sites, the need for
additional environmental analysis will be determined. If a proposed project has the potential for
impacts which exceed those discussed in the General Plan EIR, additional environmental analysis will
be required at that time.

APPENDIX C. HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City’s population and housing
stock as a means of better understanding the nature and extent of unmet housing needs. Appendix C,
the Housing Needs Assessment is comprised of the following components: (1) Evaluation of the
Accomplishments under the Adopted Housing Element; and (2) Summary of the Quantified Objectives.
In order to develop an effective housing strategy for the 2015 to 2023 planning period, the City must
assess the achievements of the existing housing programs. This assessment allows the City to determine
the effectiveness and continued appropriateness of the existing programs and make necessary
adjustments for the next eight years.
1. Evaluation of Accomplishments under the Adopted Housing Element
Under State Housing Element law, communities are required to assess the achievements under their
adopted housing programs as part of the update to their housing elements. These results should be
quantified where possible (e.g. the number of units that were rehabilitated), but may be qualitative where
necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental constraints). The results should then be compared with what
was projected or planned in the earlier element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was
planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such differences must be discussed.
A. Housing Element Goals and Policies
Campbell’s last Housing Element was adopted on August 27, 2009, and contained six goals that provided
a foundation for a series of housing programs. The goals and related policies from the 2009—2014
Campbell Housing Element are as follows.
Goal H-1:       Maintain and enhance the quality of existing housing and residential neighborhoods
                in Campbell.
  Policy H-1.1 Property Maintenance: Encourage property owners to maintain properties in sound
                  condition through the City’s residential rehabilitation assistance programs and code
                  enforcement efforts.
  Policy H-1.2: Acquisition and Rehabilitation: Strengthen multi-family neighborhoods through
                  partnership with non-profit housing providers in the acquisition and rehabilitation of
                  older residential structures, and maintenance as long-term affordable housing.
Goal H-2:       Improve housing affordability for both renters and homeowners in Campbell. 1
  Policy H-2.1: Preservation of Affordable Housing: Work with property owners, tenants and non-profit
                  purchasers to facilitate the preservation of assisted rental housing.
1
  There was no Policy H-2.4 in the 2009-2014 Element. Policy H-2.4 was originally included in the 2001 Housing
Element but was not carried over into the 2009 document. The original numbering has been retained in this Appendix
for continuity purposes.

B. Housing Element Implementation Program Accomplishments
This section reviews the progress in implementing the housing programs since 2009, and their continued
appropriateness for the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Table C-1 summarizes the City’s housing program
accomplishments since 2009 through 2013 and assesses the appropriateness of continuing the program.

                                                 working with Senior Housing Solutions to transfer ownership of 3 senior
                                                 residences to Catholic Charities. No set-aside funds were used during this period
                                                 for this program.
                                                 Effectiveness: The program is very successful at preserving assisted rental
                                                 housing.
                                                 Appropriateness: Preservation of assisted rental housing remains highly
                                                 appropriate. The Planning Department maintains a list of affordable housing
                                                 projects, and it will be important for the City to continue to verify the status of

                                               Appropriateness: The need for the program remains appropriate for the
                                               upcoming Housing Element cycle. However, no funding sources have been
                                               identified. If this program is continued in the future, the lack of identified local
                                               funding source(s) represents an obstacle to meeting this goal.

                                               Effectiveness: The loss of RDA funding limited the effectiveness of this program
                                               after 2011.
                                               Appropriateness: The program remains appropriate however the loss of RDA set

                                               represents an obstacle to meeting this goal.

                                                Appropriateness: At $570,000, the maximum purchase prices for existing units
                                                under the MCC program could still apply in Campbell (although few new units
                                                would fall within the $630,000 maximum purchase price for new construction).
                                                While the MCC program remains appropriate, rather than a numeric goal, the

                                                cycles, however the loss of RDA funding means that no records were kept
                                                regarding this program.
                                                Appropriateness: The program remains appropriate for the upcoming period.

                                                Appropriateness:       The program remains appropriate for single parent
                                                households and seniors. However, there is no funding for this activity and long

                                                the future, the lack of identified local funding source(s) represents an obstacle

                                                Appropriateness: The 2013 Homeless Census and Survey indicated that
                                                there are 91 homeless persons in Campbell. As a result, the program
                                                remains appropriate for the upcoming period.

                                               housing remains critical to addressing the City’s housing needs. Future programs
                                               will not have the powers and resources previously utilized by the Redevelopment

  Policy H-3.2: Inclusionary Housing
  Ensure that new residential development in Campbell integrates units affordable to lower- and
  moderate-income households, or contributes funds to support affordable housing activities. Create
  additional levels of affordability within the Inclusionary Housing ordinance in a way that does not create
  a governmental constraint to housing production.
  Program                                      Accomplishments

                                               Effectiveness: The inclusionary ordinance has been effective in integrating
                                               affordable units within market rate developments. Two projects have taken

                                               Appropriateness: The inclusionary ordinance remains appropriate to continue in
                                               the next Housing Element cycle.

2. Summary of Quantified Objectives
Table C-2 summarizes the quantified objectives contained in Campbell’s 2009 – 2014 Housing Element,
and compares the City’s progress in fulfilling these objectives. This summary is based upon actual building
permits from 2009 -2013 with the addition of residential units currently under construction.
As illustrated in Table C-2, based on review of residential building permits issued between January 2009
and December 2012, the City fulfilled 61 percent of its total regional housing construction needs as
indicated by RHNA. This is based upon the standard of project building at densities greater than 20 units
per acre that are potentially affordable by most income groups. This is demonstrated by the large number
of Low Income-affordable housing that was constructed during the period. However, housing production
during this period was adversely effected by The Great Recession. In recent years the amount of housing
production has increased to pre-recession level.

The City and its Redevelopment Agency facilitated development of several affordable and mixed income
projects during the planning period. The City’s Below Market Rate Housing program resulted in the
construction of 32 Very Low Income units. In addition five secondary dwelling units were also constructed
and are shown in the Moderate Income category.
Rent levels for second units can be approximated by looking at rents for one-bedroom apartments, which
average around $1,725 in Campbell, compared to a low income rent threshold of $1,600 for a one-
bedroom unit and $2,435 for moderate income households.
In terms of housing rehabilitation, the City provided assistance to 61 single-family homeowners, fulfilling
its goal to assist 50 households prior to the loss of the RDA and CDBG funding.

APPENDIX D. INVENTORY OF OPPORTUNITY SITES
1. Introduction
Appendix D contains a detailed opportunity sites analysis of specific sites that has been prepared to
demonstrate that an adequate inventory of vacant and underutilized land with appropriate general plan
and zoning designations currently exists to meet the City of Campbell’s Regional Housing Need Allocation
(RHNA) requirements. The following table provides a parcel-specific detailed analysis of the various
Opportunity Sites for the City of Campbell, suitable for development within the 2015-2023 planning
period.
2. Local Setting
Campbell is a substantially built out City with very few vacant properties. In the context of this discussion,
“built-out” means the existence of a structure or an active use on virtually all properties in Campbell. In
addition, many of the currently vacant sites were also once occupied by a structure. Consequently,
virtually all new development involves the removal of existing structures and the re-use or redevelopment
of a site. This condition has not prevented the development of new housing in Campbell and is the
common practice in substantially built-out urban areas.
3. Opportunity Sites
A. Methodology
The identification of potential sites was based upon several criteria. A detailed analysis of potential
opportunity site areas was conducted during the preparation of the Housing Element. The focus of the
site selection was the need to ensure that the objectives of the Housing Element were integrated with the
other elements of the General Plan. The Land Use and Transportation Element of the General Plan has
an objective of concentrating new residential development around the existing VTA transit stations and
around the downtown (i.e. the designated Priority Development Area) to facilitate the redevelopment of
areas with under-utilized sites and/or occupied with obsolete buildings, and to try to reduce traffic
impacts. Five of the six Opportunity Site Areas meet this objective. The sixth Opportunity Site Area, the
Dot Avenue area was also included since it represents one of the largest vacant residential sites in
Campbell.
If this initial screening process had not succeeded in identifying adequate opportunity sites, then other
lower priority areas (e.g. more remote to transit, etc.) would have been included. Each of the Opportunity
Sites have the appropriate General Plan and Zoning designations to accommodate housing and have
access to roads, water, sewer, electricity and/or natural gas, and telecommunication services.
Several opportunity site areas from the 2009-2014 Housing Element were removed from consideration in
the 2015-2023 Element. Much of the 2009 Area 2 (West Campbell Avenue), 2009 Area 4 (East Campbell
Avenue), and 2009 Area 6a (NOCA) were removed from the list of sites because many of the areas have
already been developed with new higher density housing or with revitalized commercial development.
The remaining vacant sites in these areas (NOCA, East Campbell Avenue, and Dot Avenue) are still on the
Appendix D: Inventory of Opportunity Sites                                                      Page D 1

                                                                                         City of Campbell
                                                                            2015-2023 Housing Element
list of opportunity sites. The northern and central portions of the Winchester Boulevard corridor were
also removed since these previously developed sites were more remote from the transit stations and
because the City was able to meet its RHNA requirements with higher priority sites located closer to
transit.
B. Opportunity Site Areas
Using the criteria discussed above, six Opportunity Site Areas were identified by the City. Most of the
Opportunity Sites Areas are located in and around the Priority Development Area and/or are within one-
half mile of a VTA Station. Most of the identified Opportunity Site Areas have a realistic potential for
mixed use development and many correspond to actual master or area plan boundaries intended to
facilitate the development of mixed use projects. The exceptions are the Bascom Avenue Corridor, Dot
Avenue, and West Hamilton Avenue Areas which are grouped geographically. The general locations for
the Opportunity Site Areas are depicted in Figure D-1.
Figure D-1. Opportunity Site Areas
The six general opportunity site areas are described below and summarized in Table D-1.
     o   Area 1 is the Bascom Avenue Corridor is located near the intersection with E. Hamilton Avenue
         and includes property along Campisi Way. This area is located in close proximity to the Hamilton
         VTA Light Rail Station. Number of Sites - 9, Total Area – 5.01 acres, Estimated Residential Yield -

4.       Inventory of Opportunity Areas & Sites
The inventory of opportunity sites is included in Table D-2. The inventory identifies the location, land use,
general plan and zoning designations, and the development potential of each site. Most of the sites are
created by the consolidation of adjacent smaller parcels to create suitable-sized development sites. The
probable development potential of each site is based upon the size and shape of the consolidated sites.
An explanation of each column label is provided below.
 Site ID                     A unique Housing Element site identification number to facilitate the
                             quick identification of each potential opportunity site.
 Address/APN                 The street address (if available) and the Assessor’s Parcel Number used
                             by the Santa Clara County Assessor’s Office. Not all parcels have street
                             addresses.
 Application Status          Description of any existing development entitlement applications. For
                             most sites there is no activity.
 Existing Use                General land use activity type, as determined by a site inspection.
 Building Condition          The condition of the building ranging from Poor, Fair to Good. Largely
                             based on the age/life expectancy of the building.
 General Plan Designation    As shown on the current General Plan Land Use Map.
 Zoning                      As shown on the current City Zoning Map.
 Site Size                   The size of the project site in acres. In most cases lots have not been
                             consolidated into larger areas unless a single ownership is known or a
                             proposal for development has been applied for or approved.
 Realistic Units             The site size multiplied by the Useable Density. This does not include any
                             units allowed under the local Density Bonus Program.
 Useable Density             A conservative density estimate based upon the following assumptions:
                                  Minimum Density Assumption: 75% of maximum density based upon
                                  the requirements of the Housing Element.
                                  Enhanced Density Assumption: 90% of the maximum density for
                                  larger regularly-shaped parcels.
 Description/Comments        An additional description or information about the site that may be
                             relevant or important in any future development consideration.
 Development Standards       Floor Area Ratio, density, and building setback standards as determined
                             by the Zoning Ordinance or the Area/Master Plan (as applicable).

                                                                                 2015-2023 Housing Element
While it is the intention of the City to make every effort to encourage and enable the development of
housing for all income categories, it is important to note that the unit estimates contained in Appendix D
cannot be construed as a guarantee of actual buildable density. There are a number of factors that will
ultimately determine the site density including the following:
       The size and shape of the actual project site;
       The characteristics of the actual project design;
       Site constraints that cannot be determined until specific feasibility and engineering studies have
        been completed, such as soil stability, slopes, street dedication, frontage requirements, and
        vehicular access;
       Site specific land use compatibility issues; and,
       Environmental impact issues and mitigation measures identified during the CEQA compliance
        process.
The inventory identifies the potential for 1,161 additional units based upon the existing General Plan and
Zoning Designations. Of these units, 1,008 result from the development of properties that allow
residential densities in excess of 20 units per acre and are potentially affordable for all income categories.

100-Year Flood. That flood event that has a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one
year.
Acre, Gross. Area of a site calculated to the centerline of bounding streets and other
public rights-of-way.
Acre, Net. The portion of a site that can actually be built upon. Not included in the net
acreage of a site are public or private road rights-of-way, public open space, and flood
ways.
Ambient Conditions. Initial background concentration sensed/measured at a
monitoring/sampling site, as in air quality or noise.
Aquifer. A natural underground formation that is saturated with water, and from which
water can be withdrawn.
Arterial. A street whose primary function is to carry high-speed through-traffic in a
continuous route across an area.
Attainment Area. An area determined to have met federal or State air quality standards,
as defined in the federal Clean Air Act or the California Clean Air Act. An area may be
an attainment area for one pollutant and a non-attainment area for others.
Auto-oriented Uses. Land uses designed to accommodate customers who use autos to
travel to the site, including automobile sales and service, building supplies and materials
and drive-up or drive-through uses.
Bike Lanes. Lanes on the outside edge of roadways reserved for the exclusive use of
bicycles, so designated with special signing and pavement markings.
Buildout. That level of development characterized by full occupancy of all developable
sites in accordance with the General Plan; the maximum probable level of development
envisioned by the General Plan under specified assumptions about densities and
intensities. Buildout does not necessarily assume parcels are developed at maximum
allowable intensities.
Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). The multi-year scheduling of public physical
improvements based on studies of fiscal resources available and the choice of specific
improvements to be constructed.
Carbon Monoxide (CO). A colorless, odorless gas formed by the incomplete
combustion of fuels, which is toxic because of its tendency to reduce the oxygen-carrying
capacity of the blood.
Collector. A street that connects arterials with local streets and provide access and
circulation within neighborhoods.
Curb Cut. The opening along the curb line at which point vehicles or other wheeled
forms of transportation may enter or leave the roadway. Curb cuts are essential at street
corners for wheelchair users.
Day-Night Average Sound Level (Ldn). The A-weighted average sound level in
decibels during a 24-hour period with a 10 dB weighing applied to nighttime sound levels
(10 p.m. to 7 a.m.). This exposure method is similar to the CNEL, but deletes the

additional weight given in that measurement to noise during the evening time period
(7 p.m. to 10 p.m.).
Decibel (dB). A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the
human ear. The decibel measuring scale is logarithmic. Zero (0 dB) on the scale is the
lowest sound level that a normal ear can detect under very quiet ("laboratory") conditions
and is referred to as the "threshold" of human hearing. On the logarithmic scale, 10
decibels are 10 times more intense, 20 decibels are 100 times more intense, and 30
decibels are 1,000 times more intense than 1 decibel.
Easement. A right given by the owner of land to another party for specific limited use of
that land. An easement may be acquired by a government through dedication when the
purchase of an entire interest in the property may be too expensive or unnecessary.
Equivalent Noise Level (Leq). A single-number representation of the fluctuating sound
level in decibels over a specified period of time. It is a sound-energy average of the
fluctuating level.
Fault. A fracture in the earth's crust forming a boundary between rock masses that have

persons, livestock, or the natural environment.
Hazardous Waste. Waste which requires special handling to avoid illness or injury to
persons or damage to property. Includes, but is not limited to, inorganic mineral acids of
sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, chromium, phosphorous, selenium and arsenic and
their common salts; lead, nickel, and mercury and their inorganic salts or metallo-organic

balance. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates a net in-commute; less than 1.0 indicates a net
out-commute.
Level of Service (LOS). A qualitative measure of the effect of traffic flow factors such
as special travel time, interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driver comfort, and

described by a letter rating system of A through F, with LOS A indicating stable traffic
flow with little or no delays and LOS F indicating excessive delays and jammed traffic
conditions.
Liquefaction. A sudden large decrease in the shearing resistance of a cohesionless soil,
caused by a collapse of the structure by shock or strain, and associated with a sudden but
temporary increase of the pore fluid pressure.
Neighborhood Shopping Centers. A small retail center with up to 120,000 square feet

with volatile organic compounds, in the presence of heat and sunlight to form ozone. It is
also a major precursor to acid rain.
Ozone. A compound consisting of three oxygen atoms, that is the primary constituent of
smog. It is formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving volatile
organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and sunlight. Ozone can initiate damage to the
lungs as well as damage to trees, crops, and materials. There is a natural layer of ozone in
the upper atmosphere, which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
PM-10. The current standard for measuring the amount of solid or liquid matter
suspended in the atmosphere ("particulate matter including dust"). Refers to the amount
of particulate matter over 10 micrometers in diameter. The smaller PM-10 particles
penetrate to the deeper portions of the lung, affecting sensitive population groups such as
children and people with respiratory diseases.
Peak Hour. The busiest one-hour period for traffic during a 24-hour period. The PM
peak hour is the busiest one hour period of traffic during the evening commute period.
The AM peak hour is the busiest one hour period during the morning commute.
Pedestrian-oriented Development. Development designed with an emphasis on the
street sidewalk and on pedestrian access to the building, rather than an auto access and
parking areas.
Point Source. A source of pollutants which may be traced to a discrete point of emission.

Riparian habitat is defined by the surrounding vegetation or presence of known wildlife
movement pathways; it borders or surrounds a waterway.
Sedimentation. Process by which material suspended in water is deposited in a body of
water.
Sensitive Receptors. Persons or land users that are most sensitive to negative effects of
air pollutants. Persons who are sensitive receptors include children, the elderly, the
acutely ill, and the chronically ill. The term "sensitive receptors" can also refer to the land
use categories where these people live or spend a significant amount of time. Such areas
include residences, schools, playgrounds, child-care centers, hospitals, retirement homes,
and convalescent homes.
Siltation. The process of silt deposition. Silt is a loose sedimentary material composed of
finely divided particles of soil or rock, often carried in cloudy suspension in water.
Solid Waste. Unwanted or discarded material, including garbage, with insufficient liquid
content to be free flowing.
Sphere of Influence (SOI). The ultimate service area of the City of Rohnert Park as
established by Sonoma County LAFCO.
Stationary Source. A source of air pollution that is not mobile, such as a heating plant or
an exhaust stack from a laboratory.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2). A heavy, pungent, colorless air pollutant formed primarily by the
combustion of fossil fuels. It is a respiratory irritant, especially for asthmatics and is the
major precursor to the formation of acid rain.
Threatened Species, California. A species of animal or plant is endangered when its
survival and reproduction in the wild are in immediate jeopardy form one or more causes,
including loss of habitat, change in habitat, over-exploitation, predation, competition,
disease, or other factors: or when although not presently threatened with extinction, the
species is existing in such small numbers that it may become endangered if its
environment worsens. A species of animal or plant shall be presumed to be rare or
endangered as it is listed in: Sections 670.2 or 670.5, Title 14, California Code of
Regulations; or Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations Sections 17.11 or 17.12 pursuant to
the Federal Endangered Species Act as rare, threatened, or endangered.
Threatened Species, Federal. A species which is likely to become an endangered
species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
