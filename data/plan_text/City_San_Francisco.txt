Preface
The Housing Element is a major part of San Francisco’s General Plan that seeks to ensure adequate housing for
current and future San Franciscans. Housing element law requires local governments plan for their existing
and projected housing need, by providing opportunities for housing development, rather than constraining
opportunities. The State allocates the region’s share of the statewide housing need to regional agencies; in the
San Francisco Bay Area, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) provides this allocation, based on
the region’s forecast for population, households, and employment. San Francisco’s share of the regional housing
need for 2015 through 2022 has been pegged at 28,870 new units, with almost 60% to be affordable.
Since 2002, the regional population, household and job forecast has been “policy-based,” meaning that
it promotes policy objectives which increase housing development and alternative transportation modes,
specifically by increasing the proportion of growth near transit and in existing urban areas. Furthermore, with
the adoption of SB375 and its requirement that regional planning agencies create a plan to meet targets for
greenhouse gas emissions reduction tied to land use, the City can expect to see further development directed
towards existing urban areas like San Francisco to increase housing near jobs, reduce urban sprawl, and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
This Housing Element details objectives and policies that address this growing housing demand, focusing
on strategies that can be accomplished within the city’s limited land supply and that meet the housing goals
developed during the outreach for this document, which include 1) prioritizing permanently affordable
housing; 2) recognizing and preserving neighborhood character; 3) integrating housing, jobs, transportation
and infrastructure; and 4) continuing to be a regional model of sustainability.
The Housing Element consists of two parts. Part I contains the background data and needs analysis, forming
the basis for policy formulation. Part II lists objectives and policies and describes the programs to be carried out
over the next five years to implement these objectives and policies.
1.	        Part I describes and analyzes changes in San Francisco population, households, and housing stock
characteristics. It analyzes existing and projected housing needs resulting from job growth and population and
household projections. It identifies the needs of special user groups such as the homeless, physically disabled,
elderly, minorities, families with children, and artists, and specifies the housing affordability levels needed by
these households. Part I also contains an inventory of land suitable for residential development and examines
potential constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs. It notes that meeting the estimated housing need will
require a rate of housing production far greater than what has been achieved in previous years.
2.	        Part II contains a comprehensive set of housing objectives and policies that are the framework for
decision-making, priority setting and program implementation. It continues many existing City housing
policies that emphasize affordable housing production, permanent affordability, and the protection of the
existing housing stock. New policies strive to create a range of new housing to meet spatial needs of all of our
residents, particularly those who cannot afford market-rate housing; ensure development is appropriate to the
unique needs of individual neighborhood they are located within; use community planning processes to ensure
that the best qualities of neighborhoods are not only maintained, but strengthened; link new housing to public
infrastructure such as transit, open space and community facilities, and privately provided infrastructure such
as retail and neighborhood services; and prioritize housing development that reduces the impacts of greenhouse
gas emissions.

These objectives and policies are followed by related Implementation Actions that will
implement the Housing Element including timelines, steps, projected outcomes and entities
responsible for each action. They are also followed by a series of Strategies For Further
Review, which require further examination and study prior to their implementation.
Implementation involves various City agencies, including the Planning Department,
the Mayor’s Office of Housing, the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure
(formerly known as the Redevelopment Agency), the Board of Supervisors and the Planning
Commission, the San Francisco Housing Authority, the Department of Building Inspection,
the Department of Human Services, the Department of Public Health, the City Attorney’s
Office, the Rent Stabilization Board, and the Human Rights Commission; but it also
depends on the work of community housing organizations, non-profit and for-profit housing
developers, and the community organizations and citizens of San Francisco.
Consistency with San Francisco’s General Plan
The San Francisco General Plan, including this Housing Element, is an integrated, internally
consistent and compatible statement of objectives and policies. The other elements of the
City’s General Plan, as well as the area plans which cover specific geographic areas of the city,
are consistent with this Housing Element.
San Francisco Charter Section 4.105 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco
provides to the Planning Commission the opportunity to periodically recommend Planning
Code amendments to the Board of Supervisors. It states: “The General Plan shall consist of
goals, policies and programs for the future physical development of the City and County
that take into consideration social, economic and environmental factors. In developing their
recommendations, the Commission shall consult with commissions and elected officials,
and shall hold public hearings as part of a comprehensive planning process. The Planning
Department, in consultation with other departments and the City Administrator, shall
periodically prepare special area, neighborhood and other plans designed to carry out the
General Plan, and periodically prepare implementation programs and schedules which link
the General Plan to the allocation of local, state and federal resources.”
This section requires that proposed General Plan amendments are consistent across the
General Plan and the eight priority policies of the Planning Code Section 101.1. As such,
the San Francisco General Plan is regularly updated to ensure consistency. Any amendment
to the General Plan, including adoption of this Housing Element, is accompanied by a
comprehensive review of the General Plan for consistency. Where necessary, Planning staff
will recommend conforming amendments to the General Plan, so that the General Plan is
aligned across its elements and area plans.

                                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT 2014: PREFACE
Section 101.1(b) of the San Francisco Planning Code provides the City’s eight Priority
Policies, and designates these policies as the basis upon which inconsistencies in the General
Plan are resolved, should they occur. Two General Plan Priority Policies relate specifically to
housing, and are supported directly by this Housing Element. These are:
• That the City’s supply of affordable housing be preserved and enhanced (See Objectives
1-3, Objectives 7-9, and all related policies under those objectives).
• That existing housing and neighborhood character be conserved and protected in order
to preserve the cultural and economic diversity of our neighborhoods (See Objective 2,
Objective 11, and all related policies under those objectives).
The other Priority Policies are supported by, and not impacted by, this Housing Element.

I. Population,
   Employment and
   Income Trends
   San Francisco continues to grow and has surpassed its population peak of the 1950s; by 2012,
   some 808,000 people called San Francisco home. A slight shift in the city’s racial composition
   was noted in the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) estimate but
   San Francisco continues to be a culturally and racially diverse place. San Francisco households
   are generally better off and median incomes are rising; the 2012 ACS estimated San Francisco’s
   median income at about $73,802. San Francisco is also growing older. The median age of San
   Francisco residents has been rising since 2000, especially as the baby boom generation ages.
   In 2012, the estimated median age was 38.5 years. Families with children constitute a small
   portion of San Francisco households. Under 12% of the city’s total population is 14 years old
   and younger, giving San Francisco the distinction of having the fewest children per capita of
   all major U.S. cities.
                                                                                                   I.3

         A. Population and Demographics
         1. Population Change
         San Francisco has seen an increase in population and jobs in recent years. The 2010 Cen-
         sus counted over 805,235 San Franciscans while the Association of Bay Area Governments
         (ABAG) estimated some 568,720 jobs in the city.
         The 2012 American Community Survey estimated San Francisco’s population to be about
         807,755. ABAG projects continued population growth to 981,800 by 2030 or an overall
         increase of about 174,045 people who will need to be housed over the next 18 years (Table I-1
         and Figure I-1). Household growth, an approximation of the demand for housing, indicates
         a need for some 72,530 new units in the 18 years to 2030 just to accommodate projected
         population and household growth (Table I-1).

                            2. Age
                            San Francisco’s population, in line with national trends, is getting older as the baby boom
                            generation ages. San Francisco also has the distinction of having the fewest number of children
                            per capita of all major American cities. Table I-2 and Figure 1-2 show recent population trends
                            and projections by age group. The median age for San Francisco was estimated to be 38.5 years
                            old in 2012, an increase from 37.6 in 2010. ABAG’s Projections 2013 calculated the median
                            age to increase steadily, reaching 40.9 years in 2030.
                            In 2010, San Franciscans 14 years and younger constituted about only 11% of the city’s
                            population, slightly decreasing from 2000. The number of young San Franciscans, however, is
                            expected to increase by 56% to 140,600 in 2020 and make up 15.8% of the total population.
                            Their numbers will taper off the following decades and eventually return to a smaller propor-
                            tion of the population by 2040.
                            From 2000 to 2010, the 45-59 age group grew approximately 15%, the highest growth rate
                            of any group in the population for that period. San Franciscans 45 years and older are also
                            forecast to increase, making up 22.8% of the population by 2020 and 18.1% by 2040. The
                            city’s older residents – those 60 years and older – will grow the most over the coming years,
                            accounting for 33.2% of the total population by 2040.

         San Francisco’s population is ethnically diverse (Table 1-3 and Figure I-3) despite a slight
         shift since the 2010 Census. Since 2010, the percentage of San Franciscans claiming white
         racial affiliation increased, totaling nearly 51% of the city’s population according to the 2012
         American Community Survey (ACS). San Francisco’s African-American population continues
         to decline, dropping from 6.1% in 2010 to 6% in 2012. San Franciscans of Chinese origin
         declined from 21.4% of the total population in 2010 to 21.2% by 2012. The proportion of
         San Franciscans identifying with Hispanic origins (of any race) has increased from 14.1% in
         2010 to 15.1% in 2012. Household size and household incomes by ethnicity point to varied
         housing needs and abilities to pay for housing and will be discussed in later sections of this
         report.

                           As in most urban centers, there are concentrations of major ethnic groups in San Francisco
                           neighborhoods. Many Latino households live in the Mission District, extending along Mission
                           Street south to the Daly City border. A distinct Filipino community follows a similar resi-
                           dential pattern, with additional concentrations in the Excelsior area and, to a smaller degree,
                           South of Market. Concentrations of several East Asian populations reside in the Richmond
                           and Sunset Districts, in addition to a traditional presence in Chinatown. Residential concen-
                           trations of African Americans occur in the Western Addition, South Bayshore, and Ingleside
                           Districts. Southeast Asian communities have a strong presence in the Tenderloin District north
                           of Market Street and in neighborhoods throughout the Bayview and Visitacion Valley areas.
                           4. Household Characteristics
                           According to the 2010 Census, the number of San Francisco households grew from 329,700
                           in 2000 to 345,811, an increase of over 16,111 new households or about 5% growth (Table
                           I-4). ABAG’s Projections 2013 estimates that the number of total households will continue to
                           increase, growing to 379,600 by 2020 and to 413,370 by 2040 or an annual average of about
                           1,700 new San Francisco households over 20 years.

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         As shown in Table I-4, the average household size in San Francisco has been relatively constant,
         hovering at 2.3 persons and tending to be smaller than the Bay Area average. ABAG also proj-
         ects that the number of persons per Bay Area household will be increasing in the next 20 years.
         San Francisco continues to have a comparatively small number of family households and this
         proportion is holding steady. According to the 2010 Census, family households comprised just
         43.7% of all households in San Francisco (Table I-5), compared to over 44% in 2000. This
         decline does not necessarily indicate that families are leaving, as there were over 5,800 more
         family households in 2010; rather it indicates that non-family households are increasing at a
         much more rapid rate. The Census Bureau’s definition of a family household – counting only
         those households with people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption - also
         obscures the actual diversity of San Francisco’s families and households. At the time of the
         American Community Survey in 2012, the estimated proportion of Census-defined family
         households in San Francisco remained steady about 45%. This is considerably less than the
         percentage for the entire Bay Area, where around 65% of all households are family households.
         Average family households are also likely to be larger than non-family households. The 2012
         American Community Survey estimates these numbers to be 3.2 persons and 2.31 persons,
         respectively.
                                                                                                          Table I-5

         SOURCES: Census Bureau; ABAG
         In 2010, about 70% of all households in the city were comprised of one or two people and
         household sizes are expected to remain proportionally about the same as the previous decades
         (Table I-6). The recent ACS estimate shows that the proportion of one- and two-person house-
         holds has grown slightly. In 2012, they both increased by a little less than 1%, compared to all
         other household types that either increased insignificantly or decreased slightly. The expected
         growth in households and the composition of these new households present specific housing
         needs.

                             Average household size varies by ethnicity. Table I-7 below shows that households falling under
                             the “Other Race” and the “Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander” categories tend to be larger,
                             averaging 3.38 and 3.33 people per household, respectively. Hispanic or Latino households
                             are similarly larger than the citywide average, with 2.94 people per household. There are, on
                             average, 2.75 people in an Asian household, while the Black household average size is generally
                             close to the citywide average. White households are smallest in size, averaging less than two
                             persons per household.

                             Household size in San Francisco tends to reflect existing neighborhood housing stock (see
                             Maps I-1 and I-2). Larger households of four or more persons are generally found in the south-
                             eastern neighborhoods of the Mission, Bayview, Visitacion Valley, and the Excelsior where
                             typical housing units have two or more bedrooms. Somewhat smaller households however
                             are found in the western neighborhoods. The central and northeastern portions of the city
                             generally have the smallest households—two or less than two persons—with the residential
                             population tapering off near the commercial and industrial areas of the Financial District and
                             South of Market.

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         B. Employment
         1. Jobs
         Employment growth in San Francisco and the region directly affects the demand for housing
         as new jobs attract new residents. As shown in Table I-8, total employment in San Francisco is
         recovering from the economic crisis of the late 2000s. The crash of dot-com ventures and the
         2008 great recession show a net job loss in the years between 2000 and 2010 of approximately
         65,700 (see Table I-8). ABAG forecasts a recovery in San Francisco, with employment steadily
         increasing to 759,000 by 2040. During the 2020 to 2030 period, the ABAG model shows
         36,440 new jobs (5.4% increase) in San Francisco; from 2030-2040, 51,830 additional jobs
         are projected—a 7.3% gain.
                                                                                                                            Table I-8

         From 2020 through 2040, the entire nine-county Bay Area is expected to add almost 518,080
         jobs. Of that total, about 88,270 will be created in San Francisco and the city’s share of regional
         employment will remain at about 17% (Table I-9). Maintaining this job share ensures San
         Francisco’s continuing role as an employment hub, making full use of existing infrastructure.
         Future targeted infrastructure enhancements to core job centers such as San Francisco will
         support overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the region.

                                 rial Services” industry (53,830 new jobs), followed by the “Health and Educational Services”
                                 category (23,800), and the “Arts, Recreation, and Other Services” segment (25,460) (see Table
                                 I-10). In terms of percentage growth for the 2020-2040 period, “Health and Educational
                                 Services” (25.7%) and “Professional and Managerial Services” (25%) industries lead the way.
                                 Almost all sectors of the local economy will have experienced net employment gains between
                                 the decennial censuses. Only the “Transportation and Utilities” (2,050 less jobs) sector will see
                                 job loss. By 2020, “Professional and Managerial Services” will have experienced the largest gain
                                 – some 35,840 or 25% of this sector’s jobs. “Arts, Recreation, and Other Services” employment
                Table I-10       will have gained some 18,270 jobs during that time—a gain of 19%.

         The number of workers per household is also projected to increase between 2010 and 2015,

         As of 2010, commuters into San Francisco held 27.3% of the jobs in the city (Table I-13).
         According to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s Plan Bay Area, which includes
         the region’s Sustainable Communities Strategy and 2040 Regional Transportation Plan, over half
         of these workers commute into the city via the Bay Bridge corridor. By 2020, it is estimated
         that commuters will take up 43% of jobs in San Francisco.
         As a regional job center, San Francisco will continue to have a larger share of commuters than
         other cities in the Bay Area. The regional transportation goal in the next ten years is to reduce
         commuting with a smaller share of new jobs created in San Francisco being taken by non-San
         Francisco residents. Table 1-13, however, is not a job forecast nor does it show distribution of
         jobs throughout the area. Rather, it assumes that more of the future jobs in San Francisco are
         expected to be taken by San Francisco residents than has occurred in the past.

                            The 2010 Census noted San Francisco’s median household income at $71,304. This represents
                            an increase of about 29% in the 10 years between Census counts (Table I-14). Table I-14 also

                            holds. The 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates the median household income
                            at just under $73,802 or about a 3.5% increase in the last twelve years. Table I-15, however,
                            shows these same incomes adjusted for inflation, where median household and median family
                            household incomes have decreased slightly, and median non-family household incomes have
                            decreased by almost 29%.

                            Table I-16 below shows household incomes by household type, tenure and ethnicity. In
                            addition to the difference between median family income and median non-family income,
                            disparities exist between home-owning households and renters, and amongst ethnic groups.
                            This array of income, as well as household type, affects housing demand and affordability.
                            For example, the median household income is not enough to afford the average 2012 rent
                            for a two-bedroom apartment at $1,799 a month. And while the median family income is
                            somewhat higher than that of a non-family household, it is spread among more people in the
                            household and would have to pay for larger housing to accommodate the larger average family
                            household size. There is thus a need for larger units affordable to families and large households
                            in San Francisco and an ongoing need for affordable housing for the population in general.

         2. Employed Residents, Household Workers and Income
         Generally, the overall number of employed persons in a city is probably not correlated with
         income. Rather, income levels relate more directly to general economic characteristics of an
         area, fluctuations in wages earned, inflation, and most directly, job mix. However, data suggest
         that some family incomes may rise as a result of increased employment. It is reasonable to
         expect that as employment increases, families would benefit from increased employment, thus
         increasing family income. This is evidenced in the higher median family income presented in
         Table I-15 above. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of families with no workers increased
         from 12.8% to 13.2% (Table I-17). Additionally, this table shows that the number of families
         with two or more workers decreased by about 2%, implying that those families earned less.
         However, one cannot be sure because, for instance, a family may have lost two jobs and re-
         placed it with one higher-paying position.
                                                                                             Table I-17

                              Income disparity is even more significant when households’ median incomes
                              are compared by ethnicity. Table I-18 shows that across all types of house-
                              holds and per capita measures, white households have significantly higher earn-
                              ings than other ethnicities. Only White households earn more than the 2010
                              Census citywide averages. African American households’ median income of $30,840 is 43%
                              of the city’s median income, while White households’ median income is $83,796 or 118% of
                              the city’s median income. “Two or More Race” households have a median income that is 93%
                              of the city’s overall median income, followed by Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
                              households whose median incomes are about 85% and 81% of San Francisco’s median income

                              As noted earlier, ethnic households tend to be larger than the city’s overall average household
                              size (Table I-7). Thus a look at per capita income provides a starker reality of income disparity.
                              The 2010 Census shows that per capita income of San Franciscan of Native Hawaiian or
                              Pacific Islander heritage is equivalent to only 44% of the city’s overall, but for White San
                              Franciscans, it is 133%. And while Asian households earn on average about 85% of the city’s
                              median income, per capita income of San Franciscans of Asian decent is $31,449 or 69%.
                                                                                                                                 I.17

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         4. Employment Trends and Income
         The housing needs of San Francisco are based on providing housing to support the city’s work-
         force, which includes both San Francisco residents and commuters. While San Francisco serves
         as a regional center for employment, a substantial portion of its workforce lives within the city
         boundaries. San Francisco’s share of the regional housing needs assessment reflect the con-
         tinuing need to provide housing for its workforce. The average income for the San Francisco
         workforce demonstrates the lack of housing affordable to many San Francisco workers, both
         residents and commuters. Table I-19 below shows the average wage by sector and total jobs in
         each sector. The office sector was by far the largest employer with 231,908 jobs. The retail and
         industrial sectors had 106,305 and 75,637 jobs respectively. The cultural/institutional sector
         also had a large number of jobs with 132,851 employees as of 2012. With an average rent of
         $1,799 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in 2012, a household must have an annual
         income of at least $74,150 to afford such a unit.

         Because each sector in Table I-19 contains a variety of occupations, it is useful to call out the
         fastest growing categories of jobs in San Francisco, as shown in Table I-20. Of these, only
         three job classifications – Lawyers, General and Operations Managers, and Computer Software
         Engineers and Developers, Registered Nurses, Management and Market Research Analysts,
         Marketing Specialists and Accountants and Auditors – have estimated annual wages around
         or above the $74,150 required to afford asking rents of an average two-bedroom apartment in
         San Francisco.

                                  Much of the growth forecast to occur in the coming years will be in low- to medium-skilled
                                  jobs such as waitpersons, retail salespersons, personal care aids, janitors and cleaners, and food
                                  preparation workers, with approximate annual pay scales ranging from $22,006 to $26,291
                                  (Table I-20). Some of this growth may be absorbed by San Francisco residents through the
                                  First Source Hiring Program. However, this is a limited program since it only applies to city
                                  contracts and commercial development that is over 25,000 square feet.1
                                  1	  San Francisco’s First Source Hiring Program (Chapter 83 of the Administrative Code) was created to foster construction and permanent employment op-
                                      portunities for qualified economically disadvantaged individuals. Participation in this program is required in City contracts and City property contracts.
                                      Between 2006 and 2011, the First Source Hiring Program has employed at least 1,310 people. These numbers represent minimums, because not all hires
                                      are recorded.
                                                                                                                                                                                                 I.19

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
 I.20
II. Housing
    Characteristics
    This section provides background information on the physical and qualitative characteristics
    of San Francisco’s housing stock. Totaling about 376,083 units by the end of 2013, the city’s
    housing stock is roughly divided into low-, medium-, and higher-density structures. The city’s
    housing stock is older than other West Coast cities, with almost 50% of the city’s housing
    units constructed before World War II. San Francisco’s housing tends to be smaller in size, with
    about 72% of all units containing two bedrooms or less. San Francisco, like most large cities,
    is a city of renters who live in 62.5% of occupied housing units in the city.
    About 3,520 new housing units were added to the city’s housing stock in the three years
    following the 2010 Census; of these, 95% were in structures with ten or more units. Since
    2010, almost 35% of all new housing was constructed in the largely industrial areas of the
    South of Market planning district; an additional combined total of 11% were built in the
    residential-zoned Inner and Outer Sunset, the Richmond, and Central and South Central
    planning districts.
    Housing affordability continues to be a major concern as San Francisco has one of the least
    affordable housing markets in the nation. In 2013, 36% of new housing built qualified as
    affordable to households making 120% or less of the area median income. Moreover, 93% of
    those affordable units were rentals affordable to very low- and low-income households. The
    housing market is heating up once more, and homeownership in San Francisco remains elusive
    for most residents. Only 16% of all San Francisco households could afford the $855,500
    median housing price. Average asking rents stood at $3,300 in 2013.

         A. EXISTING Housing Stock
         1. General Characteristics
         Structure Type and Tenure: According to the 2010 Census, San Francisco’s over 372,560
         housing units consisted of roughly equal proportions of low-density single family units, two
         to nine unit medium density structures, and ten unit plus high-density buildings (Table I-21).
         This has not changed dramatically in the last 12 years. San Francisco is also city of renters: an
         estimated 63% of all households rent according to the latest American Community Survey
         estimates (2012). This latest Census survey, however, estimated that there has a decrease in
         the rate of homeownership, with 33% of all households owning their homes, down from 35%
         12 years earlier. Table I-21 also shows that a vast majority of single-family units are owner-    Table I-21
         occupied (72%).                                                                                   Housing Characteristics,

Structure Size:/Bedroom Counts Dwelling units in San Francisco are generally small in size.
The 2010 Census showed that 72% of all units had two bedrooms or less. Only 9% of housing
units had four or more bedrooms. These units were primarily in single-family homes and
two unit residential flats. Renters, who make up two-thirds of all households in the city, tend
to have smaller units. Almost of fifth (19%) of renting households live in units without a
bedroom, compared to just 1.3% of home owning households.
Age of Housing Stock: Almost 50% of San Francisco’s housing stock was built prior to 1940.
New construction since 2010 accounts for just under 1% of the city’s total housing stock.
Unlike some jurisdictions where older housing stock is targeted for demolition or replacement,
most of San Francisco’s older housing stock is in sound condition. Indeed, the city’s iconic
Victorians are over 100 years old. (See page 58 for discussion on replacement of units.) Table
I-21 details other differences in housing characteristics by household tenure status.
Location and Structure Type: Table I-22 in the following page shows the distribution of the
city’s housing inventory by planning district (see Map I-3) and by structure size. The Northeast
planning district has the most housing units, followed by the Downtown, Richmond, West-
ern Addition and South Central planning districts. The largely residential districts of Bernal
Heights, South Bayshore, the industry-strewn Bayview and the Inner Sunset account for the
fewest units. Single-family homes are concentrated in the residential-zoned districts of South
Central, Outer Sunset, Ingleside and Bernal Heights. The Downtown planning district has the
most high-density structures, followed by South of Market, Northeast and Western Addition.
                                                                                                 I.23

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         2. Changes to the Housing Stock, 2004–2013
         Despite the economic downturn at the beginning of the new millennium, housing produc-
         tion in San Francisco seemed unaffected. Accounting for new production, demolitions, and
         alterations, the city has seen a net increase of over 19,316 housing units – an annual average of
         almost 1,932 units – in the last ten years. In comparison, a net total of 13,634 housing units
         were added between 1994 and 2003 or an annual rate of about 1,363 units per year. After the
         three-year spike in demolitions between 2003 and 2005, demolitions have been steady. San
         Francisco has a one-to-one replacement policy for demolitions and these units have since been
         replaced.

         a. Type and Location of New Construction, 2004–2013
         Most of the new construction in the last ten years has occurred in larger structures, with 91%
         of the housing developed in buildings with more than ten units (Table I-24). South of Market
         absorbed most of the new housing development since 2010, accounting for about 1,230 new
         units or almost 35.3% of all new housing during that period; Downtown and the Western
         Addition follow with roughly 729 and 424 respectively, together accounting for about 33% of
         new housing (Table I-25 and Map I-4). The largely residential districts of the Outer and Inner
         Sunset, Bernal Heights, South Central, Marina and Richmond, combined, netted only 1.9%
         of the additional units to the city’s housing stock.

                                      b. Construction of Low and Moderate Income Housing, 2000–2013
                                      Between 2000 and 2013, 6,370 new affordable housing units, including inclusionary afford-
                                      able units, were added to San Francisco’s housing stock. San Francisco, however, did not meet
                                      its fair share of the regional housing needs production targets, especially for low and moderate
                                      income housing. (See Appendix A for details of the city’s housing production performance in
                                      the evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element.)
                                      Since 2010, 33% of all new housing units built in the city have been affordable units. Nearly
                                      65% of these qualified as affordable at very low-income levels and another 20% that was
                                      considered affordable for low income households (Table I-26). An affordable rental unit is
                                      defined as housing for which rent equals 30% of the income of a household earning 80% or
                                      less of the area median income (AMI).1
                                      These totals represent construction of new units, including new units from alterations and
                                      conversion of commercial structures, but do not include permanently affordable units that
                                      result from the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing residential buildings by non-profit
                                      housing organizations. Of these affordable units, almost 660 units were specifically targeted
                                      for families and featured three- and four-bedroom units. Another 100 units were reserved for
                                      senior citizens and about 590 units were efficiency units or one-bedroom units to house the
                                      formerly homeless. About 115 units were for first-time homeownership. The Mayor’s Office
                                      of Housing (MOH) noted that about 480 affordable units were acquired or rehabilitated since

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         c. Units Demolished
         A total of 1,520 housing units were demolished between 2004 and 2013, or an annual average
         of over 150. This is higher than the number of units demolished in the nine years between
         2000 and 2008 with an annual average of about 133 units. The city has a one-to-one unit
         replacement policy that requires units lost through demolition be replaced with the same
         number of units or more. As shown in Table I-27, 87% of all units demolished were in larger
         multi-unit structures. Single-family homes represented 13% of residential units demolished
                                                                                                                                Table I-27

         d. Other Changes to the Housing Stock
         In addition to changes resulting from new construction and demolition, the quantity of hous-
         ing in the city can be altered by other factors including the subdivision of units, dwelling unit
         mergers, and building conversion (e.g. converting housing to commercial space).
         a. Alterations: Since 2004, over 2,925 net units have been added to the city’s housing stock
         by some type of alteration. The majority of alterations that produce additional housing usually
         result in a single new unit. Most losses through alterations result from removal of illegal units
         (over 210 units), although recent legislative efforts have a goal of curbing historically high
         trends by encouraging processes to legalize illegal units. A number of unit are also removed
         through unit mergers from the housing stock each year. About 210 housing units were re-
         moved in this fashion.
         b. Conversions: A slowing trend in alterations is the                                                                  Table I-28

                             Table I-30 describes units in San Francisco that receive support under the Federal Section 8
                             rent subsidy program or are managed by the San Francisco Housing Authority. In the Section
                             8 program, residents pay 30% of their monthly income in rent, and the government subsidizes
                             the difference so that the property owner receives a HUD-determined fair market rent each
                             month. Section 8 subsidies are associated either with a particular housing unit (project-based)
                             or with a qualifying household (voucher/certificate program). Section 8 housing units and
                             those managed by the Housing Authority total over 8,774 units, representing about 1% of the
                             city’s total housing stock.

         5. Residential Hotel Stock
         Residential hotel units (also called Single Room Occupancy or SROs) typically provide afford-
         able rental housing for solo occupancy and generally rented to lower income persons. There are
         over 500 residential hotels in San Francisco containing about 19,380 rooms (Table I-31); most
         of these SRO units have shared bathroom and kitchen facilities. Since 1990, non-profit organi-
         zations have purchased residential hotels and now maintain nearly a quarter of the units with a
         guaranteed level of affordability and, in some cases, related supportive services to residents. Of
         the residential hotels operated by private entities, about 2,940 of the 13,900 rooms operate as
         tourist rooms and therefore do not contribute to the affordable housing stock..

         With the adoption of the Residential Hotel Ordinance in 1980, and subsequent amendments
         to that ordinance strengthening its enforcement in 1990, conversion of residential hotel rooms
         has significantly decreased. Over 480 units were lost due to demolitions or fire from 2000
         to 2007 (Table I-32). These units are slated to be replaced or have already been replaced by
         permanently affordable units.

         6. Live/Work
         The Planning Department no longer tracks information on live/work units. As of 2008, over
         4,570 live/work units have been completed since 1987. Most live/work development occurred
         in such areas where land was relatively cheaper and many industrial buildings were converted
         to residential lofts. As commercial development, live/work units were exempt from obligations
         and conditions typically required of residential development such as school fees, inclusionary
         affordable housing requirements and open space provisions. Displacement of viable businesses
         and land use conflicts also prompted the Planning Commission to adopt interim zoning con-

trols for southeastern portions of the city aimed at preserving industrially zoned lands from
competing uses. These controls created Industrial Protection Zones where new housing and
live/work units are not allowed, and accompanying Mixed Use Districts where housing would
be encouraged. Concerned with distortions in the housing supply and with displacement of
industrial space, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors also passed a six-month moratorium
on the construction of new live/work units in February 2001. The temporary moratorium was
intended to halt the approval of new projects while a study on the impact of live/work units
on the city’s housing market and industrial lands was being conducted. This moratorium was
extended several times and eventually live/work loopholes were mended. Live/work units built
after the moratorium were from development projects that were grandfathered in at the time
of the legislation.
B. HOUSING TENURE AND Affordability
1. Owner-Occupied Housing
The rate of homeownership estimated in 2012 (33%) has decreased since the 2000 Census
(35%) and is still much lower than the national average (65.5%). Table I-33 below shows rates
of home ownership by planning district. About 50% of homes owned are in the Inner Sunset,
Outer Sunset, South Central, and Bernal Heights planning districts. Home ownership rates are
lowest in the Downtown, with only one percent of people owning their home.
San Francisco’s housing prices are among the highest in the nation. And despite recent price
declines, at year-end 2012, the median price for an average single family home in San Francisco
exceeded $855,500 and was over 1.2 times the cost of similar housing in the Bay Area and
four times the national average (Table I-34). It is estimated that only 16% of San Francisco’s
households can afford a median priced home in the city.

         Home sales prices in San Francisco has been steadily climbing since 2000 before peaking
         in 2005. With the global recession, prices dropped between 2005 and 2011 (Figure I-4).
         Since 2011, the price of housing in San Francisco continues to grow and based on the trend
         since 2000, the price of housing is projected to is to surpass the high prices seen in 2005.
         Compared to the Bay Area region, the housing prices trend follows a similar path as San
         Francisco. Still, the high cost of home ownership is still prohibitive for San Francisco’s low
         and moderate-income households and homeownership for these households would require
         substantial subsidies. As stated earlier, only 16% of San Francisco households can qualify to
         purchase homes at these prices.

                                        2. Rental Housing
                                        The 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) estimated that about 63% of San Francisco
                                        households are renters; this is almost double the national average of 34.5%. San Francisco is
                                        nevertheless typical of other larger cities where renters outnumber homeowners. Average ask-
                                        ing rents in San Francisco dropped slightly with the dot-com bust but remain high, climbing
                                        to $2,750 in 2007 and remaining constant until about 2011. After 2011, asking rents for a
                                        two-bedroom apartment skyrocketed to an average of $4,100 in 2014 (Figure I-5). To afford
                                        this level of rent in 2013, a household would need to earn about $170,000 a year.
                                        Rental affordability continues to be a citywide problem. Traditionally, neighborhoods in the
                                        southeast portions of the city have been relatively affordable; however there is still a significant
                                        gap for low and very-low income households (Table I-35). The lowest median asking rent for
                                        a two bedroom by district ($2,525 in South Bayshore) has an affordability gap of $763 for low
                                        income households (i.e., those households with income from 51%-80% of the area median
                                        income).

         C. Vacancy
         The overall housing vacancy rate in San Francisco is indicative of an enduring tight market.
         In 2010, vacancy rates at 5.4% for rentals and 2.3% for homeownership inevitably led to
         intense bidding and rising housing costs. Just about 8% of the city’s housing stock was vacant
         at the time of the Census in April 2010 (Table I-36). This is considered a healthy fractional
         rate in most housing markets in the United States. The 2012 American Community Survey
         shows units that are vacant and for sale stood at 1.4% and vacant units for rent at 4.3%. The
         unusually high total vacancy rate of 9.3% in 2012 may suggest an increase in time-shares and
         corporate homes used for employee housing. However, sampling error could also be a factor.

                            properties in large metropolitan areas throughout the country. The methodology used to create
                            this survey is different from that used for the decennial Census. Therefore, the results are not
                            comparable. For example, the decennial census calculated a rental vacancy rate of 5.4% for
                            2010 while the Housing Vacancy Survey calculated a vacancy rate of 1.8%. Unlike in 2000
                            when it just accounted for San Francisco, the Housing Vacancy Survey now takes into ac-
                            count the whole metropolitan statistical area (San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont). The Housing
                            Vacancy Survey data may not be as reliable as the decennial census because of sampling error,
                            it nevertheless allows for yearly comparisons. Both data are provided here. Figure I-6 and I-7
                            below show vacancy rates for San Francisco from 2005-2010 based on this annual survey. This

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         D. COASTAL ZONE HOUSING
         California state regulations require that the Housing Element detail new construction and
         demolition activity occurring within California Coastal Zone areas. The city’s entire western
         shoreline is within California’s coastal zone area. The coastal area zone boundary includes
         about 30 residential blocks that front the Pacific Ocean (Map I-5).
         Two new units in two structures were added to the housing stock between 2007 and 2013, or
         an average of less than one new unit a year. In this same period, two buildings with two units
         were lost. The current development pipeline includes a 56-unit residential project within the
         coastal zone.
         Within the larger census tract areas fronting the coastal shoreline (about 150 blocks), new
         construction in in-fill sites has generated no new units. This has been deepened by 16 units
         lost and six units added due to alteration projects. Some 14 new units are slated to be built in
         9 structures in this larger area. In this larger area, about 957 units were built between 1982
         and 2008.
                                                                                                                   Table I-37

         Residential development in the Coastal Zone must conform to City Planning Code density
         requirements. Development projects in the coastal zone also are required to apply for a coastal
         permit and are reviewed for consistency with Western Shoreline General Plan policies con-
         tained in the Western Shoreline Plan and Proposition M policies, one of which aims to preserve
         the City’s supply of affordable housing.
         In addition, new construction and demolition permits are reviewed for consistency with Ar-
         ticle 10 of the California Government Code which requires that affordable lower income units
         converted or demolished in the Coastal Zone Area be replaced on a one-for-one basis, and that
         new housing developments, where feasible, provide housing units for persons and families of
         low or moderate income.

III.                    Housing
                        Needs
                        This section examines the type, amount and affordability of new housing construction needed
                        in San Francisco, as determined by the Association of Bay Area Governments, through June
                        2022. It is based, in part, on the data presented in the preceding Sections.
                        A. REGIONAL Housing Need ASSESSMENT
                        The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), in coordination with the California State
                        Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), determine the Bay Area’s
                        regional housing need based on regional trends, projected job growth and existing needs. San
                        Francisco’s fair share of the regional housing need for January 2015 through June 2022 was
                        calculated as 28,870 units, or about 3,850 units per year (Table I-38). This goal seeks to
                        alleviate a tight housing market stemming from forecast household and employment growth as
                        well as allocating regional household and employment growth to jurisdictions with established
                        or planned transit infrastructures. More important, the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
                        (RHNA) determination includes production targets addressing housing needs of a range of
                        household income categories. A total of about 16,333 units or 57% of the RHNA target must
                        be affordable to households making 120% of the area median income (AMI) or less.

         The Department of Housing and Urban Development determines the annual area median
         income (AMI) for the San Francisco Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes the
         counties of San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo. In 2014, the area median income for a single
         person household was almost $68,000 and $97,100 for a household of four people.

         The median income in San Francisco, however, is lower than the area median income. This is
         due in part to higher median incomes in San Mateo and Marin counties and the concentra-
         tions of lower-income families in the city. For example, in 2012, Marin County’s median
         household income of $90,962 and San Mateo’s $87,751 were quite higher than the city’s me-
         dian household income of $73,802.1 Roughly 43% of all San Francisco households make less
         than 80% of the San Francisco PMSA area median income, and fall under the Department of
         Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s low and very low income categories (Table I-40).

         In order to account for this income variance, the Mayor’s Office of Housing publishes a local
         AMI standard (Table I-41). San Francisco’s Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program regu-
         lates housing assistance based on the San Francisco Area Median Income (SFAMI).

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         B. Housing Affordability Needs
         1. Affordability of New Housing Construction
         State law requires that the city address the housing needs for all income levels. ABAG estimates
         housing need by income group to provide a basis for determining what income levels need
         to be most served by new construction. ABAG figures are based on income distribution of
         all existing households in the city and in the Bay Area. ABAG’s estimates split the difference
         between the city and the regional figure in an effort to move the city closer to the regional
         income distribution. Table I-38 (see page 41) shows that the city must construct almost 28,870
         new housing units to meet its fair share of the Bay Area region’s estimated housing need. At
         least 38% of these new units must be affordable to very low and low-income households.
         Another 19% should be affordable to households with moderate incomes.
         The high cost of housing leads to numerous troublesome effects including overwhelming rent
         burden (as more of a household’s income is needed to go toward rent); overcrowding as more
         people squeeze into smaller affordable units to share costs; an increase in workers per household
         needed to pay mortgage or meet monthly rent; increased commuter traffic from San Francisco
         job holders who cannot afford to live in the city; and an increase in the homeless population.
         2. Households Overpaying
         Rising housing costs lead to overpayment as more of a household’s income is spent on hous-
         ing. The 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) estimated median monthly rent in San
         Francisco at $1,328 and median monthly housing costs for owner occupied units at $3,163.
         Overpayment comes about when 30% or more of a household’s income goes to paying rent
         or 35 percent or more of household income for mortgage payments. A higher percentage
         of poorer households thus tend to overpay, as Table I-42 shows, almost 72% of low income
         renting households overpay, compared to 41% of all renting households. Table I-42 below also
         shows that about 38% of all San Francisco owner-occupied households spent more than 30%
         of its income on housing costs in 2010. The number and percentage of households overpaying
         has also grown since the 2000 Census. In 2000, housing costs for over two-thirds are very
         low income households represented 30% or more of their household income. Table I-42 also
         shows that a higher percentage of renting households tend to overpay. The marked increase
         in homeowning households overpaying by 2010 may be due in large part on the relaxation of
         criteria for mortgage financing.

                              3. Overcrowded Households
                              A household is considered overcrowded when there is more than one person per room in the
                              dwelling unit. The 2012 Census reported that 20,520 or 6% of all San Francisco households
                              were overcrowded (Table I-43). Of these households, 11,617 (3.4% of all San Francisco
                              households) are severely overcrowded, with more than 1.5 occupants per room. Since 2000,
                              the number of overcrowded households reduced by 50%, however. the number of severely
                              overcrowded households increased by 23%. Renter households are also more likely to be over-
                              crowded than home-owning households.

                              Asian-American and Hispanic/Latino households make up a disproportionate number of
                              overcrowded households (14%) (Table I-44). This table also shows that a substantial percent-
                              age of Other Race and American Indian/Alaska Native households are also overcrowded.
                              These households are likely to be larger (see Table I-7 on page 9) and have lower incomes (see
                              Tables I-16 and I-18). Larger households have difficulty securing housing with three or more
                              bedrooms, especially with the city’s very limited stock of larger units. High housing costs also
                              forces overcrowding. To afford the cost of housing, many low-income families crowd into
                              smaller units.

         4. Expiration of Units at Risk of Conversion or Expiration
         Government Code Section 65583(a)(8)(A-D) requires that the Housing Element update
         inventory assisted housing developments at risk of expiration or conversion to market rate dur-
         ing the next 10 years (2015-2025). Assisted housing developments include multifamily rental
         housing complexes that receive government assistance under any of the following federal, State,
         and/or local programs (or any combination of rental assistance, mortgage insurance, interest
         reductions, and/or direct loan programs) which are eligible to change to market-rate housing
         due to termination (opt-out) of a rent subsidy contract (e.g., Housing Choice Vouchers, Sec-
         tion 8) mortgage prepayment (e.g., FHA), or other state or local programs with expiring use
         restrictions. Entities that are qualified to manage assisted units in San Francisco are listed in
         Table I-45 below.
         Some 3,434 units, funded through tax-credit and HUD are identified as at-risk with expira-
         tions between 2015 and June 2025. This is only to say that the contracts could expire and may
         have the possibility of converting to market-rate housing. In most cases (like in the case of
         non-profit owned projects) these units will not convert and will likely continue. According to
         the San Francisco Housing Authority, as of June 2014, Section 8 housing is the only housing
         type at risk of conversion to market rate in San Francisco. As many as 1,082 low-income
         units are at risk of losing their Federal Rental Section 8 subsidies by 2025. Separately, the SF
         Housing Authority manages contracts for about 10,074 Section 8 units. Section 8 units receive
         Federal subsidies that provide the owners of these units with the difference between 30% of the
         tenant’s income, and a HUD established rent for the units.
         Expiration of Section 8 subsidies in privately owned projects could force tenants to pay market
         rate rents for their unit, or face eviction. Expiration of Section 8 contracts in nonprofit owned
         projects will burden organizations that lack sufficient income to meet operating costs and
         mortgage payments. The existence of older buildings with Section 8 contracted units can pose
         as an additional financial burden. According to the Mayor’s Office of Housing, during the
         2013-2014 fiscal year, the total production and preservation of 1,759 units cost about $82.5
         million. Assuming that all units were treated equally, that would mean that the approximate
         cost to produce and/or preserve one unit would be $47,000. This cost per units varies based
         on need and project size. Preservation costs for these units can run up to about $160 million.

     C. Housing Needs of Special Population
     Groups
     All San Francisco households require specific unit sizes and levels of affordability; various
     population groups have more specific housing requirements. Special housing needs are those
     associated with specific demographic or occupational groups which call for specific program
     responses, such as preservation of single-room occupancy hotels or the development of units
     with more bedrooms. Housing element law specifically requires analysis of the special hous-
     ing needs of the elderly, the disabled, female-headed households, large families, and homeless
     persons and families, as well as the needs of any other group deemed appropriate by the city.
     These other groups include: the mentally ill; persons with HIV/AIDS; immigrants, refugees
     and undocumented workers; artists; and students. Most of special needs groups require some
     degree of affordable housing.
     The permanent housing needs of specific population groups are summarized below with state
     required categories discussed first and locally determined groups following (Table I-47). It
     is important to note that these population groups are not mutually exclusive and needs may
     overlap. For example, a person can be both elderly and homeless. About 37% of the homeless
     suffer from mental illness and as many as 40% of the elderly have mobility or self-care limita-
     tions. Roughly between 50% to 80% of all homeless individuals may suffer from one or more
     physical disability, mental illness, or substance addiction.

         and some 33% were in shelters or transitional housing. Sixty-five percent of the homeless were
         single adults, 26% of the homeless with unaccompanied children or youth under the age of 25,
         and the remaining 9% counted in this survey were persons in families. Homeless households
         require affordable housing that is appropriately sized, with appropriate services.

2. Persons with Disabilities
San Francisco’s housing stock and housing market present challenges to persons living with
disabilities. This segment of the population, which includes individuals with mental, physi-
cal, and developmental disabilities, require a variety of living arrangements depending on the
severity of their disability. Some can live at home in an independent environment with the help
of other family members; others live independently with some assistance that includes special
housing design features. Those who cannot work may require income support; and those with
medical conditions would need in-home supportive services. Accessible housing can also be
provided via senior housing developments.
The majority of persons with disabilities live on an income that is significantly lower than the
non-disabled population. Many disabled individuals live on a small fixed income which severely
limits their ability to pay for housing. The Task Force on Family Diversity estimates that at
least one-third of all persons with disabilities in the United States live in poverty. Persons with
disabilities have the highest rate of unemployment relative to other groups. For most, their
only source of income is a small fixed pension afforded by Social Security Disability Insurance
(SDI), Social Security Insurance (SSI), or Social Security Old Age and Survivor’s Insurance
(SSA), which will not adequately cover the cost of rent and living expenses even when shared
with a roommate. In addition, persons with disabilities oftentimes experience discrimination
in hiring and training. When they find work, it tends to be unstable and at low wages.
a. Physical Disabilities
The 2010 Census estimated almost 49,000 non-institutionalized adults having a physical dis-
ability, which is defined as a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical ac-
tivities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting or carrying. Well over half of disabled
adults are over 65 and may require appropriate housing. There are over 19,600 people between
18 and 64 with a physical disability. If one in five of disabled non-seniors require affordable
housing, this specific population group would have a need for roughly 3,920 subsidized units.
Some physically disabled people require accessible housing with features such as: wheelchair
accessible entrances, wide interior spaces for wheelchair circulation, accessible bathing facilities,
adjustable heights for counters and cabinets, and other amenities. Since almost three-quarters
of San Francisco’s housing stock was built before 1950, much of the existing stock was not built
with these accommodations in mind; some, but not most, can easily be converted to acces-
sible standards. Most subsidized units developed by the Housing Authority, the San Francisco
Redevelopment Agency (now called Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure), or
otherwise supported by other public funds are accessible.
b. Mental Disabilities
According to the 2010 Census, almost 37,450 San Franciscans identify as having a mental
illness; about 96% are over the age of 18. Not everyone with a mental illness has special
housing needs. However, a substantial number of persons with severe psychiatric disabilities
often have extremely low incomes and are consequently forced to live in substandard housing
without the supportive services and assistance that would allow them to live independently.
                                                                                                      I.51

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         De-institutionalization of the state’s mental institutions in the late 1970s left the charge and
         housing of psychiatrically disabled residents to private board and care facilities. In 1977 there
         were 1,278 board and care beds. By 1995 this number shrank to 465.
         In 1999, licensed board and care facilities in San Francisco managed 525 beds for San Fran-
         cisco’s mentally ill. However, the growing costs of patient care have reduced the modest gain in
         out-patient service. At current supplemental security subsidy levels, operators are finding the
         provision of board and care for the mentally ill financially unattractive.
         A survey conducted by the San Francisco Mental Health Association indicated an overwhelm-
         ing desire on the part of mentally disabled persons to live alone or with one to two friends
         in apartments with support services as needed. The absence of affordable housing linked to
         supportive services, however, sends many of the city’s mentally ill to a cycle of short-term acute
         care and homelessness. While large scale supportive housing is a cost-effective way of meeting
         this group’s housing needs, advocates working with special needs groups emphasize the need
         to balance large-scale development with small site development and rehabilitation of units
         within existing neighborhoods, to enable people to live within their neighborhood of origin
         wherever possible, and to avoid geographic concentration that often hinders the transition to
         independent living. The Department of Public Health’s Division of Mental Health estimates a
         need for 3,000 supportive housing units for San Francisco’s mentally ill.
         c. Developmental Disabilities
         Developmental disability is defined by the State of California as a lifelong disability caused by
         a mental and/or physical impairment manifested prior to the age of 18 and are expected to
         be lifelong. Conditions included under this definition include: mental retardation, epilepsy,
         autism, and/or cerebral palsy, and “other conditions needing services similar to a person with
         mental retardation.”
         Persons with developmental disability may also suffer multiple disabilities as the Developmen-
         tal Disabilities Board Area 5 estimates below show:
           •	 Mental Illness: a conservative estimate of 10% as the portion of people with a develop-
              mental disability who are also living with a mental disability.
           •	 Mobility Impairment: Staff and service providers report that approximately 10 % of
              all people with a developmental disability also have a physical disability; their mobility
              impairment will call for housing that is ADA accessible, or certainly readily adaptable
              to their needs.
           •	 Visual/Hearing Impairment: It is estimated from prior experience that 2% to 3% of the
              developmental disabled population are living with a visual and/or hearing impairment,
              and require reasonable accommodation to their disability.
           •	 Medically Fragile: 2% of the developmental disabled population require 24/7 medical
              care, in housing specifically rehabilitated or constructed to include features like those
              in hospital settings, with space for care-givers and specialized equipment.

                                                DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
Many individuals with developmental disabilities are independent and can live in their own
apartments or homes with very little support. Other individuals will have more severe disabili-
ties, and may require 24-hour care and assistance in residences that are modified specifically to
accommodate their individual needs.
The Developmental Disabilities Board Area 5 estimated that there are some 11,500 San Fran-
ciscans have a developmental disability. Its report also noted that seven out of 10 people with
developmental disabilities are unable to earn substantial gainful income and must rely on
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to support themselves. With SSI capped at under $720,
people with developmental disabilities are finding it increasingly difficult to find affordable,
accessible, and appropriate housing that is inclusive in the local community. In the past, many
people with developmental disabilities were institutionalized in large hospital-like settings,
often for life. Current practice, made possible by the Lanterman Act and the Olmstead Deci-
sion, now calls for the “maximum possible integration into the general community.” This is
realized through the creation of housing, with affordable rents and appropriate supportive
services, dedicated to the long-term needs and empowerment of this population.
Based on a survey of 2,640 developmentally disabled clients, the Developmental Disabilities
Board Area 5 estimated a housing need of 850 units for the 2009-2014 period. According to
the Board Area 5, types of housing opportunities appropriate for people living with a develop-
mental disability include:
  •	 Rent-subsidized affordable housing, with services, accessible, close to transit and com-
      munity
  •	 Licensed and unlicensed Single Family homes, modified, of 3-4 bedrooms
  •	 Inclusionary within larger housing developments serving the general population
  •	 SECTION 8 Apartment Housing Choice Voucher
  •	 Home purchase through special programs (first time home buyers, Fannie Mae)
  •	 HUD Section 811/ MHP-SHP developments for disabled populations
  •	 Housing specially modified for the Medically Fragile (SB 962 Homes)
3. Elderly
The 2010 Census counted 154,730 or 19% of San Francisco’s population as 60 years or older.
San Francisco’s elderly population is expected to grow to 205,000 by 2020 and to 360,800
by 2040; this growth is consistent with national trends. The recent Census also estimated
that 30% of all San Francisco households have one or more persons over 65 years old. About
33,869 elderly householders, representing about 51% of all households in 2010, lived alone.
Senior citizens have different housing needs especially as they develop health problems or expe-
rience decreased mobility. The 2010 Census estimated that 40% of persons 65 and over have
mobility or self-care limitations. Older and disabled adults who require long-term care have a
need for a broad range of on-site and off-site services including central dining, transportation
services, limited or complete medical care, recreational and other services. For seniors living
                                                                                                  I.53

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         independently, there is a need for safe and easily maintained dwelling units. Table I-49 below
         shows that 40% of all elderly and one- to two-person households overpay; generally a larger
         proportion of lower income households have heavier housing burdens.

         4. Families with Children and Large Family Households
         Approximately 56,940 or 37% of family households include children. Some 19% of San
         Francisco households include a person under 18 years of age. Many of these children are
         in low-income households in ethnic communities that tend to be larger and poorer (Tables
         7 and 18 on pages 9 and 17, respectively). The high cost of housing and limited supply of
         larger units can result in overcrowding. These communities require that the existing affordable
         housing stock be adequately maintained and rehabilitated where necessary, and that new larger
         affordable units are constructed.
         Virtually all large households, or those containing five or more persons, are family households.
         Family households as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau include only those households with
         persons related to the householder by birth, marriage or adoption, residing together. About 8%
         of all family households, or roughly 27,140, have five persons or more. Table I-50 below shows
         the number of suitable accommodations available for larger families and/or households. This
         mismatch is exacerbated as only a small portion of new construction consist of two bedrooms
         or more.
         Based on the current waiting list managed by the San Francisco Housing Authority, there is an
         estimated unfilled need for over 17,000 affordable housing units for low-income families. Two-
         thirds of these families require a two or three-bedroom unit due to their larger family sizes.
         Families with children generally earn less per capita than the average San Francisco house-
         hold, yet require larger housing units. Table I-51 shows that larger family households tend to

                                                                                                 DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
                             overpay more than typical households. Like most groups, families also require public transit
                             and neighborhood serving retail in close proximity. But they have specialized needs as well:
                             accessible routes or transit connections to schools, nearby childcare (if it cannot be provided
                             on-site), laundry and storage facilities on-site, recreational opportunities that are directly ac-
                             cessible from each unit on-site.
                             Even more important for families is their ability to access housing. Because many families are
                             two-worker households, they have very little time to pursue affordable housing opportunities
                             which can be listed in multiple locations under various agencies. They require a simple, easily
                             accessible “one-stop” system to help them find housing opportunities, as well as significant
                             support such as counseling agencies to move towards homeownership opportunities.

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         5. Female-Headed Households
         Many families with a single parent are in households headed by women. Female-headed house-
         holds in 2010 comprised about 8% of all households. Women still suffer from income dispari-
         ties in the job market, forcing them to survive with less income than their male counterparts.
         At the time of the last Census, about 16% of female headed households were under poverty
         level, compared to about 7% of all families under poverty level (Table I-52). Two years later,
         the American Community Survey estimated that about 8% of families were under the poverty
         level while about 19% of female-headed households were under the poverty level. This increase
         in poverty exacerbates the need for affordable housing in order to avoid an increase in homeless
         families, especially female-headed households.
                                                                                                            Table I-52

         6. Persons with HIV/AIDS and Terminally Ill Patients
         San Francisco has the third highest number of total AIDS cases in the United States, compris-
         ing almost one in five of California AIDS cases and about 3% of AIDS cases nationwide. As of
         December 2012, San Francisco accounted for 13% of California’s HIV living cases and 2% of
         persons living with HIV reported nationally. The number of deaths from AIDS has decreased
         significantly from a high of over 14,700 in 2004 to fewer than 177 in 2012, in part because
         most deaths are listed under other causes given AIDS patients’ compromised immune system.
         The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has decreased from about 15,757 in 2008 up
         to, according to the San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH), over 15,705 in 2012.
         Approximately 9% of people living with AIDS were homeless in 2012. The San Francisco
         Department of Public Health’s Annual HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Report for 2007 noted that
         “Homeless persons suffer from high rates of substance abuse, mental illness, tuberculosis, in-
         fectious hepatitis, and insufficient health care. Among HIV-infected persons, unstable housing
         has been associated with poor utilization of health care services including greater reliance on
         emergency departments, more frequent hospitalizations, and fewer ambulatory care visits. Use
         of antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic illnesses is less frequent among
         the homeless. Among homeless persons, prescribed antiretroviral therapy and adherence to
         these medications is suboptimal.” The 2007 report continues on to note that “After taking
         into account those factors that are known to affect AIDS survival (such as age and use of
 I.56

                                                DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
antiretroviral therapy), homelessness increased the risk of death by more than 20%.”
The Housing Waiting List (HWL), created in 1995, is a centralized wait list that makes re-
ferrals to most housing programs designated for people living with HIV/AIDS except for
hospices and emergency shelters. Most HOPWA funded (Housing Opportunities for Persons
with AIDS) projects use this wait list. As of August 2006, approximately 7,500 people were
active on the list. This list was closed to new applicants in November 2001 and the list’s
administration was transferred to DPH’s Housing and Urban Health. According to the AIDS
Housing Alliance, some 13,000 or 72% of people with HIV/AIDS have an unmet housing
need. The Alliance also says that only 60% of people with HIV/AIDS in the city’s REGGIE
database have stable housing.
Compounding the barriers facing people living with HIV/AIDS in San Francisco is the highly
competitive local housing market. People living with HIV/AIDS with very low incomes com-
pete with high-income prospective tenants in a private, consumer driven rental market. For
this reason, a tenant-based rental subsidy program is one of the largest HOPWA-funded pro-
grams in San Francisco. Unfortunately, due to increasing housing costs, and despite extensive
cost-containment measures, this program is able to subsidize fewer people over time.
The San Francisco HIV Health Services Planning Council is a community planning group
that oversees the prioritization and allocation of Ryan White CARE Act Title I and II funds
for the Eligible Metropolitan Area of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin Counties. The
federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers these funds. The
Planning Council conducted the 2008 Comprehensive Needs Assessment, which focused on
underserved and populations in the most severe need of HIV/AIDS-related health and social
services. Housing was consistently rated as one of the top ten most needed and most requested
among these populations. Changes to CARE Act funds further limit the amount of CARE Act
funds that can be spent on housing, which creates additional barriers to providing appropriate
affordable housing for people living with HIV/AIDS in San Francisco.
In 2006, the Board of Supervisors requested that a new citywide HIV/AIDS Housing Plan be
done. The Department of Public Health’s Housing and Urban Health section led this process,
which included assembling an HIV/AIDS Housing Work Group. The result of this process is
the Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Housing Plan. This Plan estimates that 13,000 people living
with HIV/AIDS in San Francisco have an unmet need for housing. Among these, up to 2,500
are estimated to be currently homeless.
7. Immigrants, Refugees and Undocumented Workers
San Francisco has long been a “port of entry” to the United States for immigrants and refugees.
San Francisco also shelters a number of undocumented persons who are in the United States
without legal status. Although data on the number of total number of immigrants, refugees,
and undocumented workers is not available, the 2010 Census found that about 14% of all
households, or about 105,570, are linguistically isolated. Many of these new arrivals need low
cost housing and support services; a limited number of housing and immigrant agencies in San
Francisco provide multicultural and multilingual assistance.
                                                                                                I.57

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Shelter providers for the homeless also assist homeless persons who are undocumented. These
         persons have an urgent need for shelter because they are ineligible for public assistance pro-
         grams such as General Assistance. Most immigrants and refugees, regardless of immigration
         status, also need housing services that are provided in a multicultural and multilingual context.
         8. Artists/Artisans
         Artists have special housing needs for affordable accommodations that provide large wall space,
         high ceilings, lofts, lighting, and the ability to work at all hours of the day or night. There is
         high demand for such flexible space in the city. Past efforts to secure housing for artist in San
         Francisco through the live/work program failed to meet the target housing market. While there
         are not official counts of artists, the cultural and economic value of artist to San Francisco is
         undisputable.
         9. Students
         Institutions of higher learning have not provided sufficient housing for their student popula-
         tions. For example, the University of California, San Francisco has a student enrollment of
         2,940 in degree programs, 1,620 residents, and 1,030 postdoctoral scholars but only have 920
         units that can accommodates 1,454 persons available. San Francisco State University had a
         student enrollment of 29,905 in 2013 but only were able to provide about 2,700 student hous-
         ing units. Students generally require smaller housing units near their school and job centers.
         Without dedicated housing, students often end up in overcrowded and/or costly accommoda-
         tions.
         D. Housing Preservation Needs
         San Francisco has an older housing stock, with 75% of all units over 50 years old. This is the
         largest concentration of older housing stock in the state. Seismic retrofitting requirements also
         create the greatest housing preservation need for San Francisco.
         1. Private Housing Rehabilitation
         Housing restoration, remodeling and maintenance is an ongoing activity throughout the City.
         Renovation projects completed between 2008 and 2013 totaled $1.57 billion, affecting some
         356,770 units. Over 60% of these permits were for residential improvements in one and two
         unit buildings. Almost 50% of the total rehabilitation costs were for projects in single-family
         units where the average cost of improvements was just under $54,580 per unit.
         2. Public Housing Rehabilitation
         According to the San Francisco Housing Authority’s (SFHA) 2013-2014 Agency Plan, there
         were 1,148 public housing units in five HOPE VI developments located throughout the City.
 I.58

                                                                        DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
Recent programs have rehabilitated 1,149 units of new and affordable housing with 2,883
bedrooms. The 2009 Comprehensive Physical Needs Assessment performed by the SFHA
indicated that there is a backlog of immediate physical rehabilitation needs that will cost $269
million. An additional $15 million a year is needed to forestall physical deterioration in SFHA
housing. This trend has been significantly forestalled with a $17.9 million American Reinvest-
ment and Recovery Act grant and $15.5 million in Capital Fund Recovery Act competitive
grant funds. The SFHA has identified projects totaling $14 million to comprehensively address
all of the physical problems that currently exist for the fiscal year 2014.2
3. Seismic Retrofitting
In the early 1990s, there were approximately 11,850 units in 399 unreinforced masonry resi-
dential hotels and apartment buildings (UMB), most of which are occupied by low-income
households. As of May 2014, approximately 30 buildings, including about 90 units, have yet
to comply with the City’s retrofit requirements.3 The San Francisco Department of Building
Inspection and the City Attorney are working together to bring these remaining buildings into
compliance. Rehabilitation and seismic upgrade costs vary depending on the type of building,
the level of retrofit, and the availability of construction expertise. `
In addition to unreinforced masonry buildings, much of San Francisco’s older housing stock is
in need of some type of seismic upgrading such as foundation bolting and structural reinforce-
ment. Soft-story, wood frame, multifamily housing -- typically wood-frame buildings with
open fronts, usually large openings on the ground floor such as multiple garage doors or large
storefront windows -- is particularly at risk. The City’s Community Action Plan for Seismic Safety
(CAPSS) looked at potential methods of instigating their retrofit, as well as other action steps
to improve the City’s earthquake resilience by addressing the performance of existing buildings
during an earthquake and facilitating the repair of damaged buildings after an earthquake. Ef-
fective in September of 2013, the Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit Program was signed into law
requiring the evaluation and retrofit for “multi-unit soft-story buildings,” defined as: wood-
frame structures, containing five or more residential units, having two or more stories over a
“soft” or “weak” story, and permitted for construction prior to January 1, 1978. These types
of building are found primarily in the Mission, Western Addition, Richmond, North Beach,
and Marina Districts. As of May 28, 2014 there were 49 permits filed, 53 permits issued and
eight projects completed.

         E. Replacement of Lost Units
         Demolitions, abatement enforcement, mergers and conversions, and fires all diminish the city’s
         housing stock, and lost units need to be replaced. Table I-53 below anticipates losses based on

         1. Loss of Units through Building Demolition
         Since 2010, building demolition has accounted for the loss of almost 810 units (Table I-27 on
         page 30), a rate 9% lower than the annual demolition average of 123 units between 2000 and
         2009. The City has a one-to-one unit replacement policy and units lost through demolition
         are subsequently replaced with the same number of units or even more. Housing demolitions
         in this period included the demolition of the old Trinity Plaza apartments (418 units) in
         2013, which coincided with the new construction of 418 units as Phase II of the new 1,900
         unit Trinity Plaza; and the demolition in Hunter’s View as a part of the revitalization and new
         construction of the 267-unit HOPE SF project. Similar housing renewal projects are foreseen
         in the near future.
         2. Loss of Units through Mergers
         Dwelling unit mergers result in fewer but larger units. Smaller units are generally considered
         more affordable. However larger units enable families to grow without leaving their com-
         munities. The City established legislation that aims to limit dwelling unit mergers that result
         in larger and more expensive units. A slight decline in dwelling unit mergers followed this
         legislation. Between 1995 and 1999, dwelling unit mergers resulted in the loss of some 233
         units, an average of 47 a year. Trends slowed down even further, between 2000 through 2008,
         only 287 units were merged to make larger dwelling units, a loss of about 32 units a year.
         Trends continued to slow down between 2009 and 2013, yielding 147 merged units with a
         loss of about 26 units a year.

3. Loss of Illegal Secondary Units through Code Enforcement
A secondary unit is generally a smaller unit that does not have the same amenities as the pri-
mary unit or units on a lot. Often these units are built in basements, garages, attics, or in rear
yard structures. While many illegal secondary units may not meet existing code requirements,
they still constitute a major supply of affordable housing. Some illegal units create life safety
hazards; other units require alternative standards for open space, parking, rear yard require-
ments, or density requirements to be legalized. In Spring 2014, the City and County of San
Francisco passed legislation to allow the legalization process for secondary units built without
a building permit. The legislation amends the Planning Code, the Building Code, and the
Administrative Code to establish a legalization process for such units. The new law allows one
authorized unit per lot and the applicants interested must go through a pre-screening process
through the Department of Building Inspection. The Planning Department will maintain a
master list of units authorized through this process.
Between 2004 and 2013, 226 illegal secondary units were removed and 76 units were legalized
(Table I-54). Based on a projected average loss of 23 units per year, it is estimated that about
207 units will be needed between January 2015 and June 2022 to replace these typically
affordable units.

4. Loss of Units from Conversions to Commercial Use
Seventy-five housing units were legally converted to commercial uses between 2000 and 2013
(Table I-28). This is comparable with the annual average of about five units removed between
1990 and 1999. While the conversion of residential use to commercial uses has declined
significantly from the high rates experienced in the late 1970s, illegal conversions are still a
concern in a number of areas. Unfortunately, no reliable data can detail the extent of illegal
conversions, but based on trends in the previous decade, at least 50 new housing units will
be needed to replace housing lost to legal conversion to commercial use expected during the
period covering January 2015 and June 2022.
                                                                                                        I.61

         5. Loss of Units from Owner Move-In and Ellis Act Evictions
         Changes in tenure status through Ellis Act evictions or owners move-in is seen to result in a loss
         of affordable units. These units are affordable through rent control, rental status or smaller unit
         size. Units held off the market through owner move-in and the Ellis Act and have decreased
         over the past 10 years by 49% and 34%, respectively (Table I-55). Based on the last 10 years, it
         can be projected that over the next 10 years there will be an annual average of 40 notices filed
         for both owner move-in and Ellis Act evictions. However, total eviction notices, including all
         other reasons for removal from the market have increased by 11% over the last 10 years.

IV. Meeting
    Housing Needs
    This section provides an analysis of the overall capacity for meeting the city’s projected housing
    needs. The first part presents and inventory of the land use capacity for new housing based on
    the existing zoning, including an analysis of their suitability to a variety of affordable housing
    types. The second part discusses constraints to housing development in the city that could
    forestall the City’s ability to meet San Francisco’s RHNA allocation. The third part presents
    information on potential future projects and recent community plans. An estimate of housing
    development over the next five to ten years is also provided. This section shows that while
    San Francisco may have the land capacity to meet overall housing needs for the next planning
    period, the City must make programmatic and policy changes in order to meet targeted levels
    of affordability and achieve local and regional sustainability objectives.
    San Francisco is already highly developed. It is also bounded on three sides by water, limiting its
    ability to expand outwards to meet the need for more housing. As San Francisco has relatively
    few large undeveloped sites and the following analysis is based on a cumulative examination
    of vacant and underdeveloped sites’ potential development at less than the theoretical maxi-
    mum capacity allowed under current zoning in acknowledgement of existing neighborhood
    characteristics. Nevertheless, some 47,020 new housing units could potentially be built on
    numerous in-fill development opportunity sites under current zoning allowances. In addition,
    some 22,870 can be accommodated in vacant or nearly vacant lands currently or previously
    zoned “Public” such as Mission Bay, Treasure Island and Hunter’s Point Naval Shipyard.
                                                                                                        I.65

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         A. New Housing Development Potential
         Under Existing Zoning
         Residential development is allowed as-of-right in most of the city’s zoning districts. All resi-
         dential and residential-commercial (RH, RC and RM) districts permit dwelling units as of
         right. Housing is also permitted in most of the South of Market’s mixed-use districts and all
         of the mixed-use districts in Chinatown; similarly, residential developments are allowed in
         downtown and commercial zoned districts. In the neighborhood commercial districts, housing
         is permitted but generally encouraged above the commercial ground floor in new construction
         projects. Housing development is a conditional use in industrial districts and the South of
         Market’s Service and Secondary Office (SSO) district. The only zoning district wherein hous-
         ing projects are not permitted unless they are affordable to low-income households is in the
         South of Market’s Service-Light Industrial (SLI) district. New residential development is not
         allowed in the new Production, Distribution and Repair (PDR) districts.
         Residential uses in San Francisco include single and multi-unit housing, residential care fa-
         cilities, and group housing. Group housing in San Francisco include homeless shelters and
         transitional supportive housing. Group housing is not permitted in low density, single-family
         residential districts (RH-1, RH-2 and RH-3) and in the South of Market’s residential enclave
         districts (RED). They are accommodated in the moderate density residential, downtown, com-
         mercial, and neighborhood commercial districts where other supportive amenities are more
         accessible. Group housing are also allowed on a conditional basis in low- to medium-density
         residential districts, the industrial districts and most South of Market districts. Emergency
         shelters, considered hotel use because these offer only short-term residency, are not permit-
         ted in low density, single-family residential districts but are allowed as conditional use in the
         moderate density residential districts, downtown commercial and neighborhood commercial
         districts. (Attachment D-2 in Appendix D lists residential development types and standards for
         all zoning districts.)
         1. Land Inventory
         Housing Element law requires local governments to prepare an inventory of land suitable for
         residential development to help identify sites that can be developed for housing within the
         housing element planning period. It is a general estimate of the city’s total housing capacity
         and is determined without specifying which sites may or may not be developed within the
         next five to seven years. This land inventory does not include sites that are under construction
         or are already slated for development in the next five to seven years, i.e. parcels with building
         permits already obtained and ready to start construction, or parcels that have received Planning
         Department entitlements and have applications for building permits filed.
         The housing potential estimates shown in Tables I-56 and I-57 were derived using a computer
         model based on current zoning standards and an inventory of existing uses citywide. (See
         Appendix D for additional details on methodology, terms used.) The largely undeveloped Treasure
         Island and Hunter’s Point Naval Shipyard are currently zoned “Public” and thus considered
         separately in this exercise. The number of units listed are currently proposed for these redevel-
 I.66

                                                                                  DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
                             opment areas. Similarly, parcels in Mission Bay are treated as distinct from the rest of the city’s
                             housing opportunity sites. Some 3,455 units out of the 6,000 proposed units have already been
                             built in the Mission Bay redevelopment area. Construction for Phase I of the Hunter’s Point
                             Naval Shipyard is coming to a completion, in which 1,600 homes will be built. Phase II is
                             projected to include an additional 10,500 units to be located on the Shipyard and Candlestick
                             Point. Approximately 27% to 40% of units in these redevelopment areas are programmed to
                             be affordable.
                             A database listing all parcels in the city, along with current land uses, zoning designation, and
                             development or lot improvements forms the basis of this evaluation. Land use information
                             collected included type of use, building square footage, number of stories, building height, lot
                             area, floor area ratio, and other pertinent data.
                             Table I-56 categorizes the housing opportunity sites by zoning districts and lists the build-out
                             capacities of potential housing sites according to permitted residential densities. Over half
                             (55%) of the new housing can be accommodated in neighborhood commercial and mixed
                             use districts; a little over a third (31%) can be expected to be built in traditional residential
                             districts.

Tables I-56 and I-57 disaggregate this new housing potential according to the parcels’ existing
state of underutilization or lack of development. There are about 5,480 parcels totaling 1,134
acres that are classified as undeveloped where nearly 33,340 new housing units could potentially
be constructed. Another 1,922 parcels are also seen as developable for residential uses, possibly
yielding about 9,750 new units. As detailed in Appendix D, only parcels developed up to 30%
of parcel potential are considered in this inventory. Due to high demand for housing, new
construction have occurred in developed parcels, not just vacant or underdeveloped parcels.
Hence, parcels with more than 50% of zoned capacity have been and are being redeveloped;
rehabilitation and conversion of existing buildings are examples. Given San Francisco is largely
built-up, parcels such as these would not have been considered in estimating the remaining
zoned land capacity but were nevertheless redeveloped; the estimates in this section are thus
conservative for considering only vacant and up to 30% developed parcels.
In addition, redevelopment of Mission Bay, Treasure Island and Hunter’s Point Naval Shipyard
will bring an additional 22,873 units. Undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels with proposed
residential developments in the pipeline are not included in this assessment. About 230 of 800
acres of soft sites fall in areas with recently adopted area plans (Eastern Neighborhoods, Market
& Octavia, Balboa Park, Rincon Hill, Visitacion Valley). The residential development pipeline,
which accounts for some 47,020 units at the time of this report’s writing, will be discussed at
a later section of this report.
2. Suitability of In-Fill Housing Development Under Existing
Zoning
Approximately one-half of San Francisco’s developable land is devoted to residential use. Of
the residentially zoned acreage, a majority of the area (76%) is zoned for single family and two
unit housing, at a housing density of approximately 10 to 29 units per acre. Other residential
areas with higher housing densities, such as the Van Ness corridor and neighborhoods north of
Market Street, bring average housing density citywide to 15 net dwelling units per acre.1 Table
I-57 lists the City’s zoning categories that permit residential development, grouping these
by generalized housing density levels. Map I-6 provides a generalized illustration of housing
densities citywide.
The location of San Francisco’s housing stock is detailed in Table I-22 (page 24) and the geo-
graphic boundary used for this data is the Planning District (shown on Map I-3, page 25).
The Northeast and Richmond districts have the most units. Over one-third (36%) of the city’s
units are located in buildings with ten or more units, while single family homes account for
almost another third (33%).
All parcels considered in this estimate meet the minimum lot requirement for development.
Sixty of these parcels are vacant or undeveloped, and cover half an acre or more. Most non-
profit developers of affordable housing consider 0.5 acre as the minimum lot size necessary
to meet economies of scale. Altogether, these parcels - about half of which are one acre or
larger - can accommodate over 4,565 new housing units.

         3. Locating New Housing Development in Existing                                                             Districts, San Francisco,
         Neighborhoods and Planned Areas                                                                             2013
         As Table I-57 on page 68 shows, residential and districts contain a substantial number of
         undeveloped lots. Locating new housing development in these districts makes sense, as hous-
         ing should go where other housing already exists. These in-fill sites are scattered throughout
         all residential neighborhoods and construction of additional units will have very minimal
         cumulative effect on infrastructure needs. The build-out assumption for these districts also
         takes into account typical housing types (single-family homes in RH-1, for example); and
         there would be little impact on the neighborhoods’ residential character.
         Neighborhood commercial districts are also ideal for additional housing because of these
         neighborhoods’ proximity to transit and services. Typically, the calculation assumes upper sto-
         rey residential development over ground floor commercial uses, although height limits in some
         neighborhood commercial districts may have a dampening effect on residential development.

Downtown districts are similarly ideal for residential development given proximity to jobs and
transit. The higher densities allowed under current zoning in these districts could bring almost
4,180 new units. Some industrial lands may be more suitable than other industrial sites for
residential development based on its proximity to existing residential districts and transit. At
least 3,160 units can be accommodated in these industrial lands.
The city’s mixed-use districts in Chinatown and South of Market are generally built up and
yielded smaller numbers of developable sites. However, with higher densities allowed in these
areas, in-fill development could accommodate at least an additional 9,870 units.
The Mission Bay Plan, adopted and being carried out by the San Francisco Redevelopment
Agency (now known as the Office of Community Investment and infrastructure), is envision-
ing a new neighborhood arising from one of the city’s few vast and underused vacant industrial
tracts. Projected land uses include a mix of housing and job opportunities. Mission Bay North
will accommodate 3,000 units of housing while Mission Bay South will have 3,090 units. Over
a quarter (28% or 1,700) of the units will be affordable to moderate, low and very low-income
households. As of 2013, 3,455 units were built and the remaining 4,373 are expected to be
completed by 2020.
Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, another redevelopment project, will involve re-use of the 500-
acre former military base and 200-acre former Candlestick Point. The HPNS Redevelopment
Plan sees the decommissioned shipyard transformed into a mini-city with housing, job op-
portunities and recreational uses. The residential component of the Redevelopment Plan will
bring about some 10,500 new housing units. Construction on the Shipyard Phase 1 has begun
and the first residents of the redeveloped sites have moved in early 2013; this phase will have
a total of 1,600 new homes.
Redevelopment of Treasure Island, while not expected to commence during the 2015-2022
RHNA reporting period, has been included in the land inventory because of its long-term
potential for housing. The current proposal includes up to 8,000 units.
a. Housing in Residential Areas
Housing development on remaining vacant, residentially zoned sites will occur as market pres-
sure intensifies to build on available residential sites throughout the city. These sites generally
have low or moderately low density residential-house zoning designations (RH-1, RH-2 or
RH-3), which permit only one, two or three units per lot in most cases. Most housing – espe-
cially family housing – is already located in these residential districts. It is estimated that there
is an in-fill housing potential of approximately 2,388 units on vacant and underutilized RH-1
and RH-2 parcels, which allow for single-family and duplexes, respectively. Typical densities
range from a maximum of 16 units per acre for RH-1 districts and 28 units per acre for RH-2.
An additional 662 units can also be accommodated in RH-3 parcels that allow for develop-
ment of triplexes at about 37 units per acre density.
                                                                                                      I.73

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Residential mixed districts (RM) and residential commercial combined districts (RC) permit
         non-residential uses but remain predominantly residential in character. These areas are gener-
         ally adjacent to commercial zones and can have intense, compact development. Medium den-
         sity residential districts typically contain a mixture of dwelling types found in RH districts but
         have a significant number of apartment buildings. About 2,280 new units can be developed in
         low-density residential mixed districts (RM-1). This zoning category allows for a maximum of
         50 units per acre. About 507 and 1,290 additional new units can be in the RM-2 and RM-3
         districts respectively. Almost 1,800 new units can be in-fill development in the downtown
         residential districts ringing the city’s downtown core, where higher densities are permitted. All
         told, there is the potential for almost 5,880 new units on vacant or underutilized parcels in
         these medium- and high-density residential zones.
         b. Housing in Neighborhood Commercial Districts
         Both Planning Code regulations and General Plan policies encourage housing over commercial
         spaces in districts throughout the city. More recently, regional and national interest in transit-
         oriented development has grown considerably. The close proximity of neighborhood com-
         mercial districts to transit preferential streets makes in-fill sites in these districts particularly
         suitable for development. There is also a proven strong market for mixed-use development.
         Mixed-use projects, with commercial and residential components, accounted for a significant
         amount of the new building construction in the last decade. Opportunity sites in neighbor-
         hood commercial districts cover over 290 acres of land in the city. This represents the potential
         for roughly 20,070 new housing units over ground floor commercial spaces.
         c. Better Neighborhoods Program
         The Better Neighborhoods Program was initiated by the Planning Department to address the
         city’s related housing and transportation challenges. It seeks to do so by strengthening the
         linkages between land use and transportation planning, so that each one effectively supports
         the other. Market and Octavia, Balboa Park, and the Central Waterfront were chosen as three
         pilot neighborhoods and selected to serve as a model for other areas in the city. Glen Park and
         Japantown were later added as compact versions of the Better Neighborhood planning pro-
         cess. These neighborhoods’ proximity to transit and essential services are ideal for additional
         housing, including units in upper stories above commercial uses. The Market Octavia Plan,
         promising an additional 5,900 units, was adopted in mid-2008. The Central Waterfront Plan
         was adopted, along with three other Eastern Neighborhoods, at the end of 2008. Balboa Park
         was also adopted in December 2008. The Central Waterfront Neighborhood Plan allows for
         the potential development of about 1,100 to 1,500 new units while Balboa Park could mean
         some 800 to 3,150 additional units.
         Development opportunities in the Better Neighborhood areas vary. About 1,600 units can be
         built in vacant or near parcels in the Market and Octavia area while underdeveloped parcels
         can accommodate about 2,730 units. The demolition of the Central Freeway and its replace-
         ment with Octavia Boulevard in the Market and Octavia Plan Area freed up about seven acres
         for redevelopment. All told, these publicly owned parcels have the zoned capacity to accom-
 I.74

                                                  DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
modate over 1,000 units and have been included in the overall estimate for the area. In Central
Waterfront, vacant or near vacant parcels have the zoned capacity to accommodate 290 units.
Underdeveloped sites, mostly industrial uses such as warehouses, can be redeveloped and yield
about 1,020 units. Balboa Park, on the other hand, can see about 310 units in vacant or near
vacant properties. Another 660 units can be built in underdeveloped parcels that have existing
uses such as single-storey commercial buildings or gasoline stations.
d. Housing in Industrial Areas and the Eastern Neighborhoods
A significant portion of new housing construction (over 40%) in the last decade occurred in
the areas south of Market Street. These industrially zoned parts of the city provided a ready
supply of flexible and inexpensive industrial space well suited for conversion to office space
required by dot-com start-ups. At the same time, these same areas became highly desirable
residential locations, especially for live/work or loft-style housing. Many traditional occupants
of industrial space — notably production, distribution and repair businesses (PDR) — were
displaced by rising rents brought on by new office and residential uses. Conflicts between new
residents and remaining businesses, especially over noise and smells associated with many PDR
activities made it difficult for businesses to operate. Some businesses found space elsewhere in
San Francisco; many others left the city altogether, and a number went out of business.
Interim zoning controls and Planning Commission policies underscored the importance of
retaining PDR activities and encouraging these uses on certain industrially zoned parcels while
permitting housing and mixed-use activities on other industrially zoned parcels. Recently ap-
proved community planning in the Eastern Neighborhoods, where most industrially zoned
lands are located, proposed new zoning controls that define uses permitted on these parcels.
An additional potential of 7,400 new housing units in industrial lands came about with the
passage of new zoning standards. As of now, 1,890 units can be built in vacant or near vacant
parcels while 1,270 units can be built in underdeveloped parcels.
The mostly industrial Bayview neighborhood can see an additional 743 new units with the
development of vacant or mostly vacant parcels. Redevelopment of underdeveloped sites in
the area could mean an additional 1,255 units. Vacant or near vacant parcels in SoMa have
the zoned capacity to accommodate about 256 units. Underdeveloped parcels in East SoMa
are largely mostly low industrial buildings and can potentially be redeveloped to 1,370 units.
Development of vacant or near vacant parcels in the Mission can add 730 to the area’s housing
stock. Underdeveloped sites in the Mission – largely commercial and some industrial buildings
– have the potential to be redeveloped into some 4,690 units. In Showplace Square/Potrero
Hill, about 340 units can be built in vacant parcels and another 1,080 units in underdeveloped
sites. With rezoning of the largely residential Visitacion Valley, development of vacant or near
vacant sites can result in 250 units and 290 units in underdeveloped sites. Vacant or near vacant
sites in West SoMa have the potential to be developed into 165 units while underdeveloped
sites can accommodate almost 270 units.
                                                                                                  I.75

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         4. Suitability of Potential Affordable Housing Sites
         Affordable housing in San Francisco includes subsidized multi-family units, single room oc-
         cupancy units (SRO), emergency shelters, transitional housing, and other types of group hous-
         ing. As noted earlier, such housing types are generally permitted in as of right or as conditional
         use in all zoning districts in San Francisco except in the low-density, single-family residential
         districts, the South of Market’s residential enclave districts, and the industrial/PDR districts.
         In other municipalities, affordable housing includes housing for agricultural workers and low
         cost manufactured housing. San Francisco is highly urbanized and generally a distance from
         agricultural employment. Some manufactured single-family housing have been erected in San
         Francisco but prefabricated units may not be appropriate for high density, affordable housing
         in San Francisco, especially given seismic safety concerns.
         Affordable housing projects with on-site services require a minimum of 90 units per site to
         gain economies of scale for construction and operations. Of all potential in-fill sites, over 750
         parcels – with a total capacity of 16,480 units – would permit this type of development.
         Construction of affordable multi-family units generally require a minimum lot size of 0.3
         acre or roughly 40 units per project to meet economies of scale. There are around 945 such
         potential sites that are vacant or undeveloped. Altogether, these larger parcels, which average
         0.7 acres each, could accommodate up to 19,540 new housing units.
         5. Accommodating Housing Suitable for Persons With
         Disabilities
         San Francisco building code ensures that new housing developments comply with California
         building standards (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal requirements
         for accessibility. The San Francisco building code incorporates the 2012 International Building
         Code. It provides reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the enforcement
         of building codes and the issuance of building permits through its flexible approaches to retro-
         fitting or converting existing buildings and construction of new buildings that meet the shelter
         needs of persons with disabilities.
         a. Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
         While single-family and duplex or 2-family dwellings are generally not required to be acces-
         sible except when they are part of a condominium or planned-use development, multi-family
         building accessibility requirements are contained in the California Building Code Chapter
         11A, Chapter 10, Chapter 30, and section 101.17.9.1. Commercial building access require-
         ments are contained in the California Building Code Chapter 11B, Chapter 10, Chapter 30,
         and section 101.17.11. The Planning Code additionally requires parking spaces be specifically
         designated for persons with physical or mental disabilities.

                                                   DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
b. Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning, Permit Processing, and
Building Codes
The City provides information to all interested parties regarding accommodations in zoning,
permit processes, and application of building codes for housing for persons with disabilities.
c. Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
There are no zoning or other land-use regulatory practices in San Francisco that could dis-
criminate against persons with disabilities and impede the availability of such housing for these
individuals. The City permits group homes of all sizes in most residential districts; as noted
above, group housing is allowed on a conditional basis in low density, single-family residential
districts (RH-1, RH-2 and RH-3), as well as the industrial districts and most South of Market
districts. All of the City’s commercial zones also allow group homes: they are permitted as of
right in the moderate density residential, downtown, commercial, and neighborhood commer-
cial districts where other supportive amenities are more accessible. In addition, San Francisco
does not restrict occupancy of unrelated individuals in group homes and does not define family
or enforce a definition in its zoning ordinance. The Planning Department has developed a
legislative ordinance that will enable persons with disabilities who require reasonable accom-
modation as exceptions to the City’s Planning Code to bypass the currently required variance
process, and to access a streamlined procedure permitting special structures or appurtenances
such as access ramps of lifts and other non-physical accommodations and was implemented
in the Fall of 2014.
d. Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
The State has removed any City discretion for review of small group homes for persons with
disabilities (six or fewer residents). The City does not impose additional zoning, building code,
or permitting procedures other than those allowed by State law. The City has also made zon-
ing accommodations to encourage housing for persons with physical and mental handicaps.
Planning Code Section 207.4 and 209.1 set the dwelling unit density for dwellings specifically
designed for and occupied by senior citizens or physically or mentally handicapped persons
at twice the density ratio established by any residential or neighborhood commercial district.
Planning Code Section 135 reduces the minimum amount of usable open space to be provided
for use by each dwelling unit to increase development feasibility.
e. Permits and Processing
The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could impede the
retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits and inspec-
tions are the same as for other residential projects and are straightforward and not burdensome.
City officials are not aware of any instances in which an applicant experienced delays or rejec-
tion of a retrofitting proposal for accessibility to persons with disabilities.
                                                                                                  I.77

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         B. constraints to housing access,
         production and conservation
         Housing development in California is a complex and lengthy process. San Francisco in par-
         ticular is one of the more challenging environments to build housing. Factors including high
         land and construction costs, protracted entitlement and permitting processes, and organized
         opposition pose real obstacles to developing housing in San Francisco.
         One result of this difficult landscape has been the development of new housing in areas not
         fully appropriate for residential development, such as in predominantly industrial areas without
         the sufficient services and social infrastructure to support a pleasant and vital neighborhood. In
         meeting the City’s housing goals, it is important to focus on areas that can absorb new develop-
         ment in the context of creating viable neighborhoods. The first part of Section IV, “Meeting
         Housing Needs,” discussed suitable locations for potential new housing. This second part will
         discuss the challenges to new housing production and conservation.
         1. Equal Housing Opportunity
         All residents have the right to housing that is available without discrimination – that is, without
         limitations based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. The
         federal Fair Housing Act of 1968, and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act, as well
         as other non-discrimination acts, were enacted to prohibit discrimination; and San Francisco
         has adopted a number of local anti-discrimination ordinances addressing housing and public
         accommodations (Administrative Code Sections 12 A & 12 B, Police Code Sections 33, 38,
         and 1.2). These federal, state and local provisions are enforced by the City’s Human Rights
         Commission (HRC), which offers mediation services for filed complaints, technical assistance
         with referrals to nonprofit organizations and City agencies, and fair housing training for hous-
         ing providers.
         However, with all of these protections, discrimination still occurs. Some of the major impedi-
         ments to fair housing include discrimination in access to housing, condition, evictions and
         even lending practices.
           •	 Discrimination: The most common forms of housing discrimination in San Francisco
              occur in rental housing, when tenants – who may be facing racial discrimination, pov-
              erty, mental and physical handicaps, or have alternative sexual orientation or gender
              identity – are denied housing, discriminated against in the terms or conditions other-
              wise available to other tenants, or harassed by a landlord or fellow tenant. Section 8
              tenants in particular have difficulty accessing market rentals, as many landlords choose
              to not rent to Section 8 tenants.
           •	 Poor conditions: Many available housing units are maintained in poor condition, at
              the expense of the quality of life for their tenants. The need to make physical improve-
              ments is critical to improve living conditions in low-income housing. Also, given the
              city’s high percentage of renters with disability, it is particularly critical for persons with
              special needs, to provide improved accessibility to existing housing units.
 I.78

                                                  DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
  •	 Formal and informal evictions: Even with state and local regulations against formal
      evictions, abuses occur as many residents are unaware of their protections. “Buyouts”
      (where the landlord pays the tenant an agreed upon dollar amount to vacate the prop-
      erty and therefore avoid any eviction processes) are also prevalent throughout the city.
  •	 Lending practices: Predatory lending, often directed towards low-income and minor-
      ity communities, has arisen as a facet of housing discrimination. The current foreclosure
      crisis is affecting those communities disproportionately, and is also affecting renters of
      those foreclosed units, who are without traditional eviction rights
Connecting all of these issues is a lack of education about fair housing issues and a lack of in-
formation connecting people to resources. Often, fair housing issues pit landlords with access
to capital, legal advice and time, against renters who may not be aware of their rights and who
may face other impediments in the system such as a language barrier. While San Francisco is
fortunate to have a number of nonprofit organizations in addition to the City’s Human Rights
Commission (HRC) that provide public education, access to legal services and counseling, and
even funding, they often lack resources to reach the majority of the population in need.
2. Non-Governmental Constraints
Government Code Section 65583(a)(5) requires that the Housing Element update include
an assessment of non-governmental constraints to housing development. Such constraints
include the price of land, the cost of construction, and availability of financing.
a. Land Availability and Costs
Much of San Francisco exhibits an established, relatively dense development pattern and is
considered by many to be substantially built-out. While there are parcels of land still poten-
tially available for development (see Tables I-56 and I-57 on pages 67-69), San Francisco’s
tight land market increases pressures on land values. Both market-rate and affordable housing
developers report that acquiring land for housing in the city is a challenge. The heightened
values of land make some of the land identified as a potential housing site infeasible for actual
housing development, especially housing affordable to lower income households.
The city’s finite supply of land, coupled with strong development pressure, means that land-
owners can expect high prices for parcels they own, if they choose to sell for housing develop-
ment at all. Sites identified as potential housing sites may not be sold to residential developers
as some property owners are satisfied with the state of their properties’ development. Institu-
tions, for example, may keep surface parking uses to support other adjacent properties’ more
intense uses. Similarly, building owners may keep smaller but profitable commercial buildings
instead of fully developing their properties. Furthermore, except in purely residential zoning
districts, housing developers must compete with other potential users. If it is more profitable
for a landowner to hold or sell land for a commercial project, the land will not be available for
housing. Private vacant or underdeveloped lands identified as housing opportunity sites will
only see development if landowners decide to sell, and the prices they demand from housing
developers will allow for profitable development.
                                                                                                   I.79

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Average land values vary greatly by zoning district as development potential varies greatly.
         Table I-59 below details the average sales price per square foot of vacant lands sold between
         2008 and 2013. It shows that vacant lands in the industrial zoning districts were the least
         expensive and sold, on average, at just over $78 per square foot.
                                                                                                                            Table I-59

         SOURCE: SF Assessor-Recorder’s Office; SF Planning Department
         Vacant land in single-family zoned districts, where typically one unit is permitted per lot,
         cost on average $108 a square foot. Vacant parcels in moderately low density residential zones
         (where duplexes and triplexes are permitted) and the neighborhood commercial districts, aver-
         aged $549 and $369 per square foot respectively. Vacant land in the downtown and high
         density residential zoning districts was the costliest, averaging above $738 per square foot.
         Vacant lots in the densely built mixed use districts had sold, on average, just under $400 per
         square foot.
         Though specific land costs varied greatly depending on an area’s location and underlying zon-
         ing, the price of land is a major component of a developer’s overall cost of producing housing
         (see Table I-60 below).
         b. Housing Development Costs
         In addition to high land costs, other direct costs of building new housing – the cost of labor,
         of construction materials and contractor fees – continued to escalate. Steep construction costs
         are generally seen as a major constraint on housing development and especially impacts afford-
         ability. In 2013, total development cost for an average two-bedroom condominium totaling
         800 sq. ft. was about $469,800 a unit or $587 per square foot. Table I-60 below breaks down
         these costs.
         In this estimate, planning, entitlement, and other permitting fees – discussed in the section
         above – totaled less than 4% of development costs. Specific site conditions may also add to
         the cost of new housing construction. For example, building demolition may be required with
         the re-use of a site; toxic waste clean-up needed to mitigate chemical contamination in some

                            Note: San Francisco Housing Cost Calculation Per Unit for a 100-Unit Building. This is very simplified and does not include construction financing expenses,
                                   contingencies or developer’s profit, among other things. Calculations are based on a 100 unit building assuming 800 square feet per unit, which is
                                   approximately 640 square feet of usable space based on typical building efficiency.
                            c. Availability of Open Space
                            Most of the potential housing sites identified – some 5,049 (out of 5,487) parcels – are
                            within walking distance (1/4 mile) of open space amenities. Many of the remaining sites are
                            located in new plan areas that include plans for more open space. For example, the Mission
                            Bay project includes new public open spaces to serve the residents of its 6,000 new units and
                            those of surrounding areas. The Rincon Point-South Beach Redevelopment area includes two
                            new shoreline parks while Guy Place Park is currently being implemented per the Rincon Hill
                            plan, due to open late 2016. The Recreation and Open Space Element 2013 update prioritizes
                            new open space in underserved areas. As new areas are planned for housing, additional open
                            space will need to be provided and should be included as part of future redevelopment plans,
                            area plans, rezoning provisions, and subdivision projects.
                            d. Access to Commercial and Other Services
                            Many of the areas where new housing is likely to occur offer a rich mixture of uses that can
                            readily serve new residents. About – 91% or 5,001 out of 5,487 parcels – of potential housing
                            development sites are within a five-minute walk (1/4 mile) from a neighborhood commercial
                            district. Additionally, much of the future housing development will be in mixed use projects
                            that will likely include local serving commercial activities. If these new, larger scale develop-
                            ments are well planned and designed, the additional residents and businesses will enrich exist-
                            ing neighborhoods nearby. Major new housing developments that are isolated from requisite
                            services do not create livable neighborhoods, and can contribute to citywide transportation
                            problems. Plans for new neighborhoods, and specific plans for improving existing areas, must
                            respond to the commercial and service needs of new residents.
                                                                                                                                                                                          I.81

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         e. Transportation
         San Francisco’s transportation system has been strained by the availability of free and relatively
         inexpensive parking in many parts of the city, which promotes driving. Coupled with job and
         population growth, this has increased congestion while decreasing the efficiency of public
         transit services. Recent planning efforts seek to address this issue and continue to closely ex-
         amine the interaction of land use and transportation to assure that current and future residents
         are able to travel conveniently and efficiently to jobs, services, and recreational opportunities.
         Also, planners at the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) are currently
         preparing the Countywide Transportation Plan that will prioritize numerous improvements to
         the city’s transportation system.
         f. Infrastructure Standards
         The City imposes fees on sponsors of new development for various on- and off-site infrastruc-
         ture improvements when necessary. Various standards for street widths, curb requirements, and
         circulation improvements have been developed over time and are not believed to be excessive or
         to impose undue burdens on development. They apply citywide and conform to the developed
         pattern of the city. More specific infrastructure improvements, such as particular streetscape
         design treatments, may be required of major new developments in the city’s project areas.
         Given the densities at which residential land is developed in San Francisco, these infrastructure
         costs, even when borne partially by the developer, represent a relatively small cost per unit.
         San Francisco’s current housing stock is approximately 376,080 units. The housing production
         goal set by HCD/ABAG for San Francisco is 28,869 units by 2022. This represents an increase
         of about 7.7%. The capacity of the city’s infrastructure including water, sewage treatment, and
         utility services is generally not a constraint to meeting San Francisco’s housing goals. Many
         potential development sites are in areas that are well-served by the existing infrastructure.
         Some proposed area or neighborhood plans and very large development projects may require
         additional local infrastructure improvements.
         The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission’s (SFPUC) 2010 Urban Water Management
         Plan (UWMP) for the City and County of San Francisco (SFPUC, June 2011) projects water de-
         mand from residential and commercial customers. While the SFPUC does project an increase
         in total demand, it also expects residential water use to decline, even as population increases,
         because of increased conservation measures and efficiency. The 2010 Plan also relies on greater
         use of groundwater supplies and recycled water. The UWMP projects sufficient water supply in
         normal years, though during drought years demand will exceed supply. During drought years,
         plans are in place to institute varying degrees of water rationing depending on the severity of
         the drought. The SFPUC has begun the implementation of a 13-year Water Supply Improve-
         ment Program (WSIP) approved by the voters of San Francisco in the November 2002 General
         Election as Proposition A. The $4.3 billion WSIP will ensure that safe and reliable drinking
         water service will be provided to meet projected San Francisco retail customer demand antici-
         pated in the UWMP through 2018.

                                                 DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
The WSIP will maintain compliance with state and federal drinking water standards while
ensuring that the system will be functional in the event of a natural disaster, and will attempt
to provide adequate water supplies during drought conditions. The SFPUC also has an ongo-
ing program to repair and replace outmoded and aging components of the city’s water delivery
and distribution infrastructure.
The SFPUC has committed to a number of programs to reduce water demand, which are
described in greater detail in the UWMP. The SFPUC is also implementing a Recycled Water
Program to produce recycled water for non-potable irrigation purposes. As of June 30, 2013,
construction was underway on 14 regional projects valued at $2.6 billion, while construction
had been completed on 29 other regional projects valued at $634 mission.
In 1997, the City completed a 20-year program to upgrade its wastewater treatment system
to bring it into full compliance with federal and state clean water regulations. Because San
Francisco has a combined sanitary and stormwater system, the largest volume of wastewater
occurs during wet weather.
In 2005, the SFPUC launched a citywide $150 million, Five-Year Wastewater Capital Im-
provement Program (WWCIP) to improve the reliability and efficiency of San Francisco’s
combined wastewater and storm water system. Over the next few years, the program helped
address the most critical needs of the aging wastewater system, improve the capacity of sewer
mains, and upgrade treatment facilities.
The Water Pollution Control Division of the SFPUC reports that treatment capacity is avail-
able to serve expected growth. However, there are areas where local sewers, which transport
waste to the treatment system, might be undersized and will need to be examined on a case by
case basis. In 2012, the SFPUC began a public process to update the completed Clean Water
Master Plan to identify the future course of the city’s wastewater and storm water collection
and treatment system, including repair or replacement of structurally-inadequate sewers to
address localized flooding problems. Some proposed area plans or very large development
projects may need local infrastructure improvements to connect to the city’s system.
In 2006, pursuant to SB 1087 and Government Code Section 65589.7, the SFPUC approved
Resolution 06-0185 adopting a written policy to provide water and sewer service to new
developments on an income-neutral basis. The SFPUC will also give priority to applicants
for developments that include the sale or rental of housing that is affordable to lower-income
households during any period when supply, treatment, or distribution capacity is limited.
San Francisco’s solid waste is transferred to the Altamont Landfill, in Alameda County. In
1988, the City signed a long-term disposal agreement that provides for the disposition of up
to 15 million tons of solid waste at Altamont. As of March 2013, San Francisco’s remaining
landfill capacity at Altamont Landfill was about 1 million tons out of the original 15 million
ton capacity. At current disposal rates, San Francisco’s available landfill space under the existing
contract will run out in January 2016.
                                                                                                     I.83

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         In 2002 the City’s Board of Supervisors adopted a goal for San Francisco of 75% landfill
         diversion by the year 2010, and authorized the Commission on the Environment to adopt a
         long term goal of zero waste when the 50% diversion goal is met. In 2003 the Commission
         adopted a date of 2020 for the City to achieve a goal of zero waste to landfill and directed the
         Department of the Environment to develop policies and programs to increase producer and
         consumer responsibility to achieve the goal. Currently, the City’s 3 bin system, policies, finan-
         cial incentives, and extensive outreach to residents and businesses, has helped San Francisco
         achieve the highest diversion rate of any major city in North America. San Francisco exceeded
         its goal of 75% in 2010 and diverted 80% (1,593,830 tons) of its discards from the landfill.
         Despite recent supply problems, future gas and electricity supply should meet projected needs.
         Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has filed a “Load Forecast” for San Francisco
         through 2022 with the California Energy Commission. This forecast is the basis for capital
         and operating plans, and covers both residential and commercial demand. In addition, the
         City and County of San Francisco in 2004 commenced the San Francisco Electric Reliability
         Project that calls for a new City-owned power plant to operate during periods of peak demand.
         In December of 2010 the project’s license, however, was terminated.
         g. Environmental Features
         San Francisco is a built-up city. The sites inventory in the previous section identified par-
         cels that are suitable for infill development. Unlike other jurisdictions, development in San
         Francisco is not constrained by environmental features such as protected wetlands or oak tree
         preserves. However, major programmed redevelopment efforts are proposed in areas that have
         been identified in the 2010 Floodplain Management Ordinance as potentially flood-prone.
         This list includes Mission Bay, Treasure Island, Candlestick Point, Bayview Hunters Point Area
         C, and the Hunters Point Shipyard. Floodplain management requirements are incorporated
         into redevelopment plans in these areas to ensure that any land at risk of flooding will be raised
         above the floodplain prior to redevelopment.
         San Francisco has several brownfield designations that have been identified under the Califor-
         nia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). San Francisco has initiated planning efforts in each
         of these areas to facilitate the clean-up process. Full clean up of the sites to residential standards
         has been required under the EIR’s for each plan area:
           •	 Mission Bay: The Mission Bay redevelopment area has been the subject of extensive
               clean-up since the mid 1980s, when the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corporation began to
               remediate and redevelop the former railyard at Mission Bay in California. New housing
               construction in Mission Bay is now more than 50% complete.
           •	 Hunter’s Point Shipyard: The Hunters Point U.S. naval shipyard, a federally designated
               Superfund site contaminated by toxic waste, has been the subject of redevelopment
               plans for 20 years. In July 2010, the Environmental Impact Report for a redevelopment
               plan which would clean up the site and add 10,500 homes (32% affordable), as well as
               320 acres of parkland and open space was certified. Clean up on the site was initiated
               in 2008.
 I.84

                                                  DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
  •	 Eastern Neighborhoods: The industrial character of many sites in these neighborhoods
     meant that individual clean up efforts may be necessary. Recently, several sites have
     been fully cleaned and converted to residential activities, most recently the Deres Lofts,
     where a former paint manufacturing plant converted into 500 units.
  •	 Schlage Lock Site: The former Schlage Lock factory operations polluted the groundwa-
     ter at their site and on adjacent parcels. In 2009, the Board of Supervisors adopted the
     Visitacion Valley/Schlage Lock Redevelopment Plan, including a remedial action plan.
     Since then, the entire site has undergone remediation. When California eliminated its
     redevelopment agencies in 2012, the City of San Francisco initiated a new effort to
     develop the site with reduced public funding. The plan to develop 1,679 units on the
     site was adopted and approved in July 2014.
San Francisco’s Maher Ordinance (San Francisco Public Works Municipal Code, article 20)
also mandates soil analysis for hazardous waste by the Department of Public Health. This
regulation requires site history and soil analysis reports for all building permit applicants in
areas where dumping may have occurred in the past. Affected areas have been mapped by staff,
and cover the majority of the city’s Downtown area and its eastern shoreline. The Hazardous
Waste Program staff continues to review and process the reports required in the Analyzing the
Soil for Hazardous Waste Ordinance (Maher) and oversee activities in the city.
Like most coastal cities, San Francisco is vulnerable to sea level rise. However, recent plans for
shoreline development include measures to protect development from rising sea levels. The
Treasure Island Master Plan concentrate development at the island’s center, elevates the build-
ing pad for the island’s proposed developed area, and protects the buildings with a levee and
a wide setback. Hunters Point Shipyard also elevates the total building pad for development,
and also designed a flexible management strategy including incremental strategies on how
to deal with shoreline based on actual rise levels. San Francisco staff continues to collaborate
with the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) on overall
adaptation strategies for the city.
Finally, San Francisco has taken seriously the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2001, the
City adopted Resolution No. 010-01, which mandated local efforts to curb global warming,
included adoption of a greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals for the City and County of
San Francisco and continued actions towards achieving these goals. A primary component of
meeting these goals is directing development towards transit-served areas to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions from transportation. The City’s area plans serve to direct development to transit
served areas. Numerous policies in Part II of the City’s Housing Element also support this aim.
h. Community Acceptance
San Francisco has a strong tradition of public involvement in policy discussions and pos-
sesses a very engaged citizenry on development issues. This activism often takes the shape
of organized opposition to housing projects across the city, especially affordable housing for
low-income residents and even towards well planned and designed developments. Such vocal
opposition poses very real impediments to project sponsors and can lead to significant time
delays, additional cost, or a reduction in the number of residential units produced. The City is
                                                                                                   I.85

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         committed to the involvement of citizens in the planning process and to the need to expound
         on the importance of working towards citywide housing objectives. Two recently approved
         planning initiatives – the Market/Octavia plan and the Eastern Neighborhoods Community
         Planning plan and re-zoning – have engaged residents, property owners, workers, and other
         stakeholders and sought broad public community backing through participatory programs of
         education, public dialogue and input, and consensus building.
         3. Governmental Constraints
         Housing production in San Francisco is affected by a number of governmental regulations,
         from local policies and codes to state and federal land use regulations and state environmental
         laws. This section will examine the impacts of local governmental regulations on residential
         development as these can be addressed by local housing policy. These regulatory controls have
         been carefully crafted over time to balance citywide needs and address public concerns. These
         regulations were established to be consistent with the City’s General Plan priorities to conserve
         and protect existing housing and neighborhood character. They also regulate new development
         to be compatible with and not detrimental to the area with respect to size, shape, traffic and its
         generated noise, open space and urban design requirements. The time required to administer
         and approve projects can add to the cost of housing production. But without these standards,
         an even greater check on new housing construction could result from public opposition to new
         development.
         Addressing these constraints must be balanced against other citywide needs and will also be
         tempered by public concerns. Most of San Francisco’s existing regulations were established to
         be consistent with the City’s General Plan priorities to conserve and protect existing housing
         and neighborhood character, regulating development to be compatible with neighborhood
         character, and not detrimental to the area with respect to size, shape, traffic and its generated
         noise, open space and urban design requirements.
         To address these issues, the City has made a number of improvements to remove hurdles in the
         City’s General Plan and Planning Code, including:
           •	 Using community planning processes to adopt streamlined regulations around discre-
              tionary process and reducing Conditional Uses;
           •	 Using community planning processes to increase development capacity, including
              height, density and required lot sizes;
           •	 Reduction of parking and open space requirements.
           •	 Through Mayor Ed Lee’s Executive Directive 13-01, the City has prioritized the per-
              mitting process for 100% affordable housing projects, and market rate projects with at
              least 20% on-site BMRs or 30% off-site BMRs.
           •	 Through the Mayor’s Housing Working Group, the City is working to identify stream-

     ing units that do not expand the building envelope (Legislative Board File 13-1148)

a. Entitlements
Proposed developments that deviate from or exceed permitted development standards, or that
bring up other planning concerns, are subject to additional assessment and would require
conditional use approvals, variances, Downtown Project Authorizations, Large Project Autho-
rizations and discretionary reviews. These take longer to process as they require greater study
and analysis, public notifications and hearings, and approvals from the Planning Commission
or the Zoning Administrator.
	         1) Land Use Regulations and Community Plans. The Planning Code, in particular,
can present constraints to housing development. Height and density limits, exposure, parking
and open space requirements, for example, can constrain housing form and increase produc-
tion costs; discretionary processes such as Conditional Use authorizations can extend both the
timeline for and the cost of housing construction.
The San Francisco Planning Department has prepared a number of community plans intended
to shape growth in our urban neighborhoods, by encouraging housing where it makes sense
and by using that housing growth to strengthen neighborhoods. The community planning
process provides a neighborhood-based forum to grapple with issues such as appropriate
height and density. It also provides the opportunity to shape new regulations for development
which streamline the housing approval process yet make sure appropriate development still is
designed according to the neighborhood character.
In the last five years, the Planning Department has completed several plans for the Downtown
area (Rincon Hill and Transbay), a series of “Better Neighborhoods Plans” (Market & Octavia,
Balboa Park and the Central Waterfront), and the Eastern Neighborhoods Plans (East SoMa,
Showplace Square/Potrero Hill, and Mission). Adoption of these plans into the City’s General
Plan enabled clearly stated housing development policies. Each new neighborhood plan is
also accompanied by a set of new regulations, including amendments to the General Plan,
Planning Code, and other required documents. The goal of these amendments is to establish
parameters for new development that give residents and developers a clear sense of what is and
is not allowed in these neighborhoods. Amendments reduce discretionary processes such as
Conditional Use authorizations as much as possible while still ensuring adequate community
review (in the Better Neighborhoods and Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans, most housing is
permitted as-of-right, and conditional use requirements for design aspects such as height have
been eliminated). In many cases, the amendments also include a public review and approval
process that reduces permitting time and hearings.
Planning Code amendments adopted with each new neighborhood plan also served to expand
potential development capacity in each of these areas, using tools such as height increases,
                                                                                                I.87

         removal of maximum densities, and removal of minimum required lot sizes. This increases
         flexibility for development on all sites in the project areas, and has resulted in an expanded
         development capacity which is detailed in Appendix D.
         	          2) Parking Requirements: Providing parking represents a significant cost to developers
         and can affect housing prices, adding as much as $100,000 to the price of a new unit. Surface
         level parking also takes up valuable real estate that could be devoted to housing or other uses.
         As such, parking requirements can act as a constraint to housing development.
         Parking requirements vary throughout the city’s zoning districts, based on factors like density
         and transit access. For example, in the city’s low density districts (one-, two- or three-family
         housing districts), one parking space is required for each dwelling unit. The City’s high-density
         residential districts, including RC-4, RSD, and other mixed use areas, require one parking
         space for every four units. In downtown districts such as the DTR, NCT, RTO or C-3
         Districts, no parking is required. Provision of guest parking is not required by the City for
         any housing development; it is only required for temporary stay uses such as hotel, motel or
         medical institution. Parking is not required for housing designed for and occupied by senior
         citizens, for group housing or for single-room occupancy dwellings; parking requirements for
         100% affordable housing projects can be modified as a “variance” to reduce the 1:1 parking
         ratio requirement.
         Recent amendments to the Planning Code removed parking requirements altogether in a num-
         ber of zoning districts; instead, a maximum number of parking spaces serves as a cap. Newly
         adopted zoning districts such as Downtown Residential (DTR), Neighborhood Commercial
         Transit (NCT), and Residential Transit Oriented (RTO) Districts, have been established in
         several parts of the city do not require parking; where the provision of parking space is capped
         at one car for every four dwelling units (or less without the need for a conditional use).
         To address the cost parking adds to the development price tag, the “unbundling” of parking
         spaces has also been institutionalized through the Planning Code. The adopted Section 167
         of the Planning Code requires that parking costs be separated from housing costs in housing
         developments of 10 or more units. Off-street parking spaces that are accessory to residential
         uses can be leased or sold separately from the rental or purchase fees for dwelling units for the
         life of the dwelling units, so potential renters or buyers have the option of renting or buying a
         residential unit at a price lower than would be the case if there were a single price for both the
         residential unit and the parking space.
         	          3) Open Space Requirements: The City’s Planning Code currently requires that all new
         multi-family residential development provide outdoor open space, ranging from 36 to 125
         square feet per unit, based on density, available public open space, and other factors. This open
         space may be provided on the ground, or in spaces such as balconies, terraces or rooftops.
         To reduce the burden of open space requirements, as well as to gain the benefits that common
         space provides (collective place for residents to gather; residents get to know their neighbors
         well; space can foster a sense of community; etc.), the Planning Department has reduced open
         space requirements for developments in certain zoning districts which provide usable open
         space as publicly accessible.

	         4) Redevelopment Project Areas: The San Francisco Redevelopment Agency used the
state tool of redevelopment to revitalize local neighborhoods where appropriate. Redevelop-
ment provided several tools that aid with the preservation of, rehabilitation of and production
of affordable housing for low-and moderate-income families. San Francisco’s local redevel-
opment ordinance specifically required that 50% of redevelopment tax increment funds be
committed to housing programs.
The San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, along with all 400 redevelopment agencies in
California, was dissolved on February 1, 2012 by order of the California Supreme Court in a
decision issued on December 29, 2011 (California Redevelopment Association et al. v. Ana
Matosantos). On June 27, 2012, the California Legislature passed and the Governor signed AB
1484, a bill making technical and substantive changes to AB 26, the dissolution bill that was
found largely constitutional by the Supreme Court on December 29, 2011.
In response to the requirements of AB 26 and AB 1484, San Francisco has created the Office
of Community Investment and Infrastructure (formerly known as the San Francisco Rede-
velopment Agency). Under AB 26 and AB 1484, the Successor Agency is only authorized to
continue to implement three major redevelopment projects that were previously administered
by the former Redevelopment Agency: 1) the Mission Bay North and South Redevelopment
Project Areas, 2) the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Project Area and Zone 1 of
the Bayview Redevelopment Project Area, and 3) the Transbay Redevelopment Project Area
(collectively, the “Major Approved Development Projects”). In addition, the Successor Agency
continues to manage Yerba Buena Gardens and other assets within the former Yerba Buena
Center Redevelopment Project Area (“YBC”).
	         5) California Environmental Quality Act review procedures: Like all projects in Califor-
nia, proposed residential projects in San Francisco are subject to environmental review under
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA can act as a constraint to housing
development because it can increase both the costs and the time associated with develop-
ment review. Environmental analysis can take upwards of 18-24 months to complete. In San
Francisco, environmental review fees are calculated based on a project’s calculated construction
costs and can easily exceed $100,000; independent consultants are often involved, also at a
substantial cost. Moreover, under state law CEQA determinations may be appealed directly
to the Board of Supervisors, an appeal body that is available to very few other types of land
use decisions in San Francisco. It is not uncommon for the Planning Department’s CEQA
documents of any type to undergo lengthy appeals processes, further increasing the time and
costs associated with environmental analysis.
The Department is implementing a variety of initiatives to increase the efficiency of the en-
vironmental review process and thereby reduce the time and costs associated with this effort.
CEQA itself affords a variety of opportunities to streamline environmental review for urban
infill and/or affordable housing projects, particularly in locations under an adopted area plan.
The Planning Department takes advantage of these opportunities as available; however, when
a project could result in significant environmental impacts (such as impacts to historical re-
sources) the ability to streamline environmental review is substantially reduced.
                                                                                                   I.89

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Some common environmental impacts and their mitigations are relatively standard and could
         be addressed on a legislative level by ordinance and thereby incorporated into the building
         permit process. The benefit of this approach is that it would make more projects eligible for
         exemption from environmental review, because the necessary measures to avoid significant
         environmental impacts would be required for compliance with relevant code provisions. The
         Board of Supervisors has enacted such legislation such as adoption of the Environment Code,
         the Green Building Ordinance, and the establishment of the Department of the Environment,
         and others with regard to several air quality-related concerns; other such ordinances could be
         pursued in the future to address other areas of environmental impact.
         With regard to the time and fees required for environmental review, sponsors of 100% af-
         fordable housing projects and market rate housing projects that include at least 20% on-site
         or 30% off-site BMRs are granted priority permit processing status and are also eligible for
         deferred payment of environmental evaluation fees. These measures reduce the amount of time
         that a project is in the environmental review process and facilitate the initiation of applications
         for environmental review.
         	          6) Discretionary Review: The Discretionary Review process can result in a significant
         cost to developers. The costs are typically the result of architectural fees, holding costs associated
         with extended time delays, and compensation that is sometimes requested by the Discretionary
         Review requestor in order to mitigate concerns or withdraw the Discretionary Review Applica-
         tion. Due to the ambiguous outcome and undefined timeline associated with the filing of a
         Discretionary Review Application, many project sponsors forgo projects altogether because of
         the additional time and financial burdens caused by this process. The additional time and costs
         caused by Discretionary Review Applications are absorbed into the price of new or renovated
         dwelling-units, and therefore, the Discretionary Review process acts as a constraint to housing
         development and increases the overall cost of housing particularly in the city’s lower density
         neighborhoods.
         The City’s Discretionary Review process is the Planning Commission’s authority to review
         Code-complying projects and take action if the Commission finds that the case demonstrates
         “exceptional and extraordinary” circumstances. Conceptually, Discretionary Review is a sec-
         ond look at building permit applications that have already been determined to comply with
         the minimum Planning Code standards and applicable design guidelines. The idea is that
         additional scrutiny might be necessary in some cases to judge whether the design guidelines
         were applied appropriately or if there are circumstances unique to a case that warrant further
         modifications to the project. The problem with the Discretionary Review process is that be-
         cause there are no guidelines for this process, it eliminates a developer’s sense of predictability
         and certainty in the entitlement process. There are no barriers to file a Discretionary Review
         Application – other than a nominal fee of $535 – and there are no limitations as to the amount
         of time the process can take.
         The Discretionary Review process is most frequently used as a response to development in
         the city’s low density districts, (RH – one-, two-, or three-family housing districts) and high
         income areas, like Supervisorial Districts 2 and 7. The costs associated with Discretionary

                                                 DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
Review in lower density districts have a greater impact to the affordability of housing, as there
are fewer dwelling units associated with each project to absorb the additional costs of the
process. Furthermore, the minimal filing cost of $535 for a Discretionary Review Application
does not nearly reflect the actual cost of processing the Application, which is about $3,680.
The Department recovers the difference by adding a Board of Appeal surcharge fee of $25 to
the cost of every building permit application. This too adds to the overall cost of construction
in the city, which increases the cost and acts as a constraint of housing development.
As part of the Department’s Action Plan, the Department is working on a reform the Discre-
tionary Review process. The Department is working on to improve the design review process
to help minimize the number of Discretionary Reviews filed.
b. Permit Processing
A typical timeline for a medium-density, multi-family residential project (50 to 100 units)
is about one year to 2½ years from the initial conceptual project review with the Planning
Department to commencement of construction. This schedule assumes concurrent proce-
dures for review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and entitlements
requiring Planning Commission review and approval. If an environmental impact report is
required, it can take up to 2 years for all necessary studies and analyses to be conducted and
the EIR heard before the Planning Commission. Applications can be filed at the same time
or filed and heard upon completion of the environmental review. Both procedures are subject
to public comment and appeals periods. The conditional use permit can be appealed before
the Board of Supervisors within 30 days following the Planning Commission’s approval. Once
planning entitlements are secured, the project sponsor can prepare detailed building plans to
be reviewed and approved by the Department of Building Inspection. Depending on the pro-
posed project’s complexity, the plan preparations, review and approval process can take from
four to six months before building permits are issued. If no building permit appeals are filed
against this project after the 15-day period following permit issuance, building construction
can begin. But if this typical project has received a conditional use, then the Bureau of Permit
Appeals has no jurisdiction.
Minor alterations and new housing projects of up to three single-family dwelling units or up
to six units in a single structure may not require substantial environmental review. Projects
proposing principally permitted uses (or “as of right”) meeting all applicable Planning Code
requirements and not triggering mandatory discretionary review will involve less permit pro-
cessing time. Construction of these kinds of projects can typically begin within nine months
of initial project review.
As the City’s permitting and review agencies, the Planning Department, the Department of
Building Inspection, and other related agencies have a significant effect on the efficiency of the
housing construction process. To address this, the Planning Department initiated in 2008 an
Action Plan containing procedural and operational reforms to improve the professionalism
and efficiency of the City’s planning process. Improvements to the Planning Code and its effect
on permit processing are already underway. Mayor Ed Lee convened an interagency working
                                                                                                   I.91

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         group in early 2014 which focused on actualizing the production of 30,000 housing units
         by 2020. Every agency has committed to further process improvements to expedite housing
         production, including prioritized review procedures, and reduced process time for housing
         projects.
         	          1) Planning Code Improvements: The Planning Code itself could be considered a de-
         facto constraint on housing production, because of its complexities. Many projects, particularly
         larger projects, might require a Conditional Use authorization for aspects such as dwelling unit
         density. Variances are required to deviate (even slightly) from dwelling unit exposure require-
         ments and parking minimums, and a Discretionary Review in order to demolish an existing
         dilapidated building.
         Acknowledging this, and as an effort to establish a single and more straightforward entitlement
         path, the Department has adopted a ‘one-stop’ review path in the fairly recent rezoned eastern
         portions of San Francisco. Housed in Planning Code Section 329, this authorization process is
         an effort to provide greater certainty and expediency for those development applications which
         meet the fundamental requirements of the Planning Code, regardless of minor deviations so
         long as they are in keeping with the intent of the Code and neighborhood character. Section
         329 approval is available to projects of moderate scale (small projects have largely been made
         as-of-right) and requires a single public hearing and entitlement by the Planning Commis-
         sion based mainly on the physicality of the proposal rather than the land use and density
         characteristics.
         	          2) Application Processing: Processing time for projects can be a constraint to hous-
         ing development, especially during economic boom times when multiple applications are
         submitted simultaneously. Staffing levels, staff workloads and level of review required can all
         affect the Planning Department’s processing time, staffing levels, applications that were filed
         consecutively may have different processing times. Planning, entitlement and other permitting
         fees – to be discussed in a separate section below– totaled less than 2% of development costs.
         The San Francisco Planning Department adheres to a set of Application Processing Guidelines,
         to ensure that all project applicants receive equitable treatment as the Planning Department
         reviews applications in the order received. However, under those guidelines, the Planning
         Department has established priority criteria to ensure that housing projects that help meet
         the City’s identified Housing Element or other General Plan goals are prioritized. Affordable
         Housing Projects, “green” housing construction projects (i.e. those that meet or exceed a Gold
         Rating using the LEED Building Rating System® or that achieve high sustainability standards
         under another “green building” rating systems approved by the Director); and other applica-
         tions which are needed to secure the health or safety of users, promote disabled access, etc,
         receive prioritized review by staff.
         The overwhelming majority of projects which seek to create additional housing are subject
         to some level of neighborhood notification. Such notice can stem either from a required
         discretionary entitlement, such as a Conditional Use authorization, or from Planning Code
         provisions which apply to as-of-right projects and are seek to inform and solicit input from the
 I.92

                                                  DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
broader community. Required notification periods generally span 10 to 30-days and include
notices mailed to property owners and/or occupants, notices posted at a project site, notices
appearing in local newspapers, and all combinations thereof.
	          3) Permit Tracking: The Planning Department is also pursuing the development of an
integrated permit tracking system to coordinate and streamline planning and building permit-
ting processes. This system will establish a single intake application system for all Planning and
Building cases to provide early and comprehensive information to applicants, and should have
a significant effect on processing time. The new Permit & Project Tracking System (PPTS) was
launched in Fall 2014.
c. Permit Application and Development Impact Fees
The Planning Department and the Department of Building Inspection require fees for en-
titlements and building permits based on a project’s estimated construction costs. Projects of
much smaller scale – such as interior rehabilitation, minor alterations or upgrading – generally
require over-the-counter Planning Department approval and a building permit. Projects that
are broader in scope, however, may require additional permits, or may require other actions
such as a variance, a zoning re-classification, a subdivision, or a more in-depth environmental
evaluation. Payment of an application fee may be required for these additional permits. The
application fee for most of these additional permits is also based on the total estimated cost
of construction of the project. Other new housing construction fees include water and sewer
hook-up and school fees. Table I-61 on the following page provides an example of various fees
imposed on new construction.
New housing development in the City of San Francisco is subject both processing fees, which
support staff review of development proposals, and development impact fees which sup-
port additional infrastructure needed to support new residents, such as transit, open space,
community centers, schools, affordable housing, and water capacity. According to the state
Department of Housing and Community Development’s 1999 Pay to Play survey, residential
development fees in San Francisco were lower than Bay Area and California average develop-
ment fees (including entitlement and permitting fees). According to this report, for example,
development fees for an in-fill house in San Francisco totals $15,476 while the Bay Area aver-
age is $25,859 and California, $20,327.

         Table I-61 summarizes current processing fees for new development by cost of construction.
         Larger projects generally require more review from environmental planners, land use planners,
         and building inspectors; however economies of scale generally result in a lower per unit cost
         for processing. Projects that are consistent with the planning code and general plan and do
         not require variances or conditional use authorization, have lower processing costs. The City
         generally updates fees annually based on inflation. Periodically processing fees are evaluated to
         insure accurate cost recovery for staff time, materials, and overhead.
         Development impact fees fund public infrastructure to support new residents. There are a
         number of citywide fees to fund affordable housing, water and sewer hook-up and school fees.
         Recently planned areas of the city (Rincon Hill, South of Market, Visitacion Valley, Market
         & Octavia, Eastern Neighborhoods and Balboa Park) include additional localized impact fees
         which have been imposed to fund the infrastructure needed to support growth, including
         transportation infrastructure, open space, childcare, and other community facilities. These
         community based planning processes enabled the City to more closely evaluate localized in-
         frastructure needs, especially in areas where zoning was adjusted to accommodate additional
         growth. New impact fees were determined through a needs assessment, nexus study and a
         financial feasibility analysis before their adoption to ensure they to not constrain new housing
         production. To further ensure feasibility, development impact fees may be deferred until the
         project receives certificate of occupancy. Table I-62 depicts what fees would look like for a
         1,000 square foot housing unit in San Francisco.

Processing and impact fees are critical to the City’s ability to ensure that new housing is safe,
sustainable, consistent with current policies and supported by the infrastructure necessary for
maintaining the service levels. Table I-60 (page 81) shows entitlement fees are an insubstantial
proportion of development costs and are not seen as a significant constraint on housing devel-
opment. Development projects by non-profit housing organizations are eligible for reduced or
deferred City Planning permit fees pursuant to City Planning Code Section 351(a), (e), (g),
(h), and (i).
d. Building Code Standards
San Francisco’s Building Code is based on the 2012 California Building Code. San Francisco
made certain amendments to the California Building Code, which local governments are
permitted by the State to do if these amendments are proven and justified by local topography,
geology or climate. The Building Code is intended to assure health and safety. Some San
Francisco amendments to the State code, while maintaining health and safety standards, ease
the production of housing by recognizing the particular local conditions. For example, the San
Francisco Building Code permits fire escapes for certain required exits in existing buildings,
whereas the State Code does not. Local amendments to the Building Code do not make hous-
ing more difficult or expensive than housing elsewhere in California.
Federal and state laws require that commercial and public use buildings, and new housing, be
designed and constructed to be accessible to persons with disabilities. Local agencies do not
enforce the federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibiting discrimination against
persons with disabilities. The San Francisco Department of Building Inspection, implement-
ing the San Francisco Building Code, requires all new construction and rehabilitation projects
to comply with the Code’s disability access requirements. (San Francisco does not make any
amendments to the California Code’s disabled access provisions.) Generally, one and two-
family dwellings are not required to be accessible. Existing privately funded multi-family
dwellings can generally undergo alterations with little or no accessibility upgrade. All new
buildings of three or more units must meet the accessibility standards of the Code. Exceptions
may be granted if compliance would result in an unreasonable hardship, in which case any
                                                                                                                  I.95

         reasonable accessible features will still be required.
         In addition, San Francisco’s 2013 Electrical Code consists of the 2013 California Electrical
         Code with local amendments. Similarly, the 2013 San Francisco Mechanical Code and the 2013
         San Francisco Plumbing Code consist of the 2013 California Mechanical Code and the 2013
         Plumbing Code, respectively, with local amendments. The 2013 San Francisco Energy Code is es-
         sentially the same as the 2013 California Energy Code, as it does not include local amendments.
         4. Financing
         This section is a discussion of the availability of financing as a non-governmental constraint
         to housing development as required by Government Code Section 65583(a)(5). The Planning
         Department’s regulatory capacity can encourage housing – especially affordable housing –
         development and conservation but, actual housing production or rehabilitation can only be
         realized with adequate financing. Some of the costs of providing housing occur at one time
         (capital expenditures such as land acquisition, construction or rehabilitation costs). Conserva-
         tion of affordable housing, however, requires recurring annual funding for rental subsidies,
         operating subsidies and supportive services. Assembling the necessary funding to produce
         and maintain adequate affordable housing for the city’s low- and moderate-income residents
         remains an enormous challenge.
         a. Private Financing Sources
         Private lenders offer construction loans on a conservative loan to appraised value ratios and pay
         particular attention to a project’s costs. This limits the lenders’ risk but may also reduce avail-
         ability of financing for new housing construction. Larger, multi-unit condominium projects
         can be especially difficult to finance as lenders assume that construction costs tend to be higher
         as developers provide more amenities and that units may take longer to sell, stretching the
         period to recover construction costs.
         Private financial institutions provide financing to affordable housing projects – often as con-
         struction loans – to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act requirements. Private
         lenders also participate in first-time homeownership programs that enable moderate-income
         households.
         b. Public Financing Sources
         Affordable housing development and conservation depends largely on the availability of public
         funding sources. Table I-63 lists the various federal, state and local funding available for af-
         fordable housing production for fiscal year 2013-2014. The total allocation is also inclusive of
         rollover from years prior to the fiscal year. Clearly, these funds will not cover the tremendous
         affordable housing need described in previous sections.
         Public financing covers capital funding for the acquisition, rehabilitation, construction, and
         preservation of affordable housing. Other public financial programs also provide for supportive
         services, rental assistance, and assistance to first-time home buyers, and administrative costs
         to city agencies and non-profit corporations that provide affordable housing and other com-

                          munity development and human services.
                          Some of the funding programs below – such as CDBG, HOME – are expected to be stable
                          sources of affordable housing funds. However, these are also subject to budgetary constraints.
                          Similarly state funding sources are vulnerable to the budgeting process. Most local sources
                          such as the Hotel Tax Fund and the Jobs-Housing Linkage Fund are even more dependent on
                          economic trends.

                          Some public funds are restricted to particular housing types and/or population groups; for
                          example the elderly housing program (Section 202, Hotel Tax Fund), the disabled housing
                          program (Section 811, Hotel and Tax Fund), and HOPWA (Housing Opportunities for Per-
                          sons with AIDS). Administrative costs are also not covered by most public funding sources.
                          Federal grants often carry a number of restrictions and regulations that can make the funds
                          difficult to use. For example, some federal programs require matching grants while others are
                          impossible to combine with other funds. Most affordable housing programs require three or
                          more sources of funding to become feasible. Different funding sources may have to be tapped
                          for pre-development, construction, and permanent financing costs – leading to considerable
                          transaction and legal costs and delays in the development process.

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         C. Quantified Housing Goal
         The state Department of Housing and Community Development, with the Association of Bay
         Area Governments, determined San Francisco’s fair share of the regional housing need for the
         period covering January 2007 through June 2014 at 31,193 units. Even with very aggressive
         policies and programs, given that San Francisco is a mature, built-up city with limited large
         tracts of undeveloped land and the previous decades’ housing production record, the “fair
         share” of affordable housing units was not achieved. Table I-64 below shows that 58% of
         the state mandated production targets and 31% of the affordable housing production for
         the period covered by the 2009 Housing Element were achieved; this statistic is a result of
         the overproduction of market rate units. Appendix A provides details of the City’s housing
         production performance in the evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element.
                                                                  Actual                                         Table I-64

         More than the performance in the production of low-income housing, the deficit of 12,793
         units affordable to low and moderate income households has been seen as critical in turning
         the city’s housing problem into a crisis of affordability. Table I-65 below shows the new RHNA

                                                  D. REALIZATION OF HOUSING POTENTIAL
                                                  1. Projects in the Pipeline
                                                  Housing in the production pipeline is an important indicator of future development. For the
                                                  purposes of this report, the Planning Department defines the pipeline as those projects under
                                                  construction, projects that have been approved by the Building Department within the past
                                                  three years or filed within the past five years. It should be noted that project applications and
                                                  permitting activities in the near future could increase the number of new housing production
                                                  in the next five years.
                                                  Housing projects move through a multi-tiered approval process. A development proposal
                                                  is first reviewed by the Planning Department for compliance with the Planning Code and
                                                  consistency with the General Plan. The project then goes through review by the Department of
                                                  Building Inspection (DBI) for approval and issuance of a building permit. Once construction
                                                  is finished and the project passes inspection by DBI, it is issued a certificate of final comple-
                                                  tion. Only when a project receives a certificate of final completion can the housing units be
                                                  officially counted as part of San Francisco’s housing stock.
                                                  During the time of this report, the 2015-2022 planning period has not begun and therefore
                                                  the housing pipeline is being used to provide an estimate of the future quantity of housing
                                                  and how it fares against the RHNA targets. As of June 31, 2014, there were 10,959 residential
                                                  units in the pipeline (Table I-66). According to the Mayor’s Office of Housing, as of Septem-
                                                  ber 2014, 485 units are to be rehabilitated and 4,519 units are to be conserved or preserved
                                                  through to 2021. The total estimated shortfall in meeting the RHNA targets is estimated to be
                                                  about 12,900 units. It is possible that some of these projects, especially those in the early stages
                                                  of development such as Planning review, may not go forward due to shifts in economic and
                                                  legislative conditions. Production trends over the last decade, however, show that as much as
                                                  85% to 90% of pipeline projects units are completed within five to seven years.

         Through multi-year community planning efforts, the City of San Francisco had updated zon-
         ing controls for over 1/3 of the city. These planning efforts developed appropriate zoning,
         heights, bulks, and densities in balance with infrastructure and funding strategies to support
         new growth.

         3. Plans for Future Affordable Housing Construction
         Stable government support in the last few years covered almost all of the affordable housing
         production. Public subsidies tend to fund very low and low-income housing, with very limited
         grants allocated for moderate-income home buyers. The revised and expanded inclusionary
         affordable housing requirement is expected to improve the provision of new housing for
         households earning moderate incomes. For example, 1,045 inclusionary units were built from
         2004 to 2008, or an annual average of 209 units. However, the trend has slowed. An annual
         average of 88 inclusionary affordable units were built in the five years from 2009 to 2013 as a
         result of this change.

                            Tables I-56 and I-57 indicated that there are more than enough in-fill housing opportunity
                            sites to meet the projected housing needs. Yet historic housing production trends, together
                            with recent public financing flows, could mean only some of these sites would be developed.
                            Capital subsidies needed to bridge this estimated shortfall can be enormous (Table I-67).
                            Funds available for new affordable housing construction, rehabilitation and supportive service
                            provision in the 2013-2014 fiscal year totals just about $40 million. The estimated additional
                            capital subsidies needed to meet the City’s regional housing share would require over $7.3

                            With the availability of future public subsidies impossible to predict at best, an optimistic
                            assumption would anticipate funding that would sustain the last decade’s affordable housing
                            production. Achieving the housing production and affordability targets set by HCD-ABAG
                            is clearly very difficult. But setting the goals to be more “realistic” and “achievable” could only
                            weaken efforts at seeking and obtaining resources necessary to meet the city’s urgent housing
                            needs.
                            A practical solution would be to uphold these long-term targets and annually assessing pri-
                            orities against the reality of available resources. The City, therefore, will take the production
                            targets set by HCD-ABAG for its quantified housing production objectives. Each year, as
                            resources are known to be, or reasonably expected to become available, shortfalls in achieving
                            goals can be assessed, program targets shifted appropriately, and resources allocated efficiently
                            and effectively.
                            4. Opportunity Sites on Public Land
                            Most San Francisco city agencies do not own large tracts of land that do not serve as part
                            of their stated mission. There are occasional exceptions; for example, when new technology
                            results in operational changes or when departmental objectives change over time. A few city
                            agencies, notably the SF Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA, formerly Muni) and the
                            San Francisco Unified School District, have found over time that some of their parcels can be
                            disposed of or can be utilized for a mixture of other uses (see summary, Table I-69 ).
                                                                                                                                                                        I.101

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
           •	 San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency: The SFMTA, in particular, has
              been exploring new uses for its surplus sites where future housing development might
              be possible.
              ▪▪ Phelan Loop and Balboa Park Station area — Alternative use options are being
                   explored for Muni property near Balboa Park as part of the Better Neighborhoods
                   program. The 1.4-acre Phelan Loop (Ocean and Phelan Avenues) is currently the
                   terminus for the 49-Van Ness-Mission, 9AX-San Bruno Express, 9BX-San Bruno
                   Express, and 9X-San Bruno Express lines. This site has the capacity to accom-
                   modate ground floor commercial uses and some 80 dwelling units. In addition,
                   SFMTA and Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) properties collectively called Upper
                   Yard and BART Station area, with some in-fill development along San Jose Avenue
                   can together have capacity for more than 400 new units. A transfer of the site to
                   the Mayor’s Office of Housing is underway.
              ▪▪ Presidio Trolley Coach Division (at Geary and Masonic) — Covers 5.4 acres
                   and services about 170 trolley coaches. It is an attractive location for retail, office
                   and housing development. If rezoned from P (Public) to NC-3 (Neighborhood
                   Commercial-Moderate Scale) like the adjacent properties along Geary Boulevard,
                   the site has a capacity of 392 units.
              ▪▪ Woods Motor Coach Division (adjacent to the 22nd Street Caltrain Station)
                   — At the end of the Dogpatch’s main neighborhood commercial street, this 3.9
                   acre site is ideal for high-density, mixed use residential development. It lies within
                   the Central Waterfront plan area and is estimated to have a housing potential
                   capacity of about 1,000 new units.
              ▪▪ Potrero Trolley Coach Division Yard (Mariposa and Bryant) — Currently
                   housing about 180 trolley coaches on 4.4 acres. SFMTA is looking at a multi-story
                   parking garage above the yard, or market-rate and affordable housing. If developed
                   as a Planned Unit Development (PUD), this site could accommodate 318 units.
              ▪▪ 18th & Castro Streets — The SFMTA is also in conversation with the AIDS
                   Housing Alliance to develop the two parking lots in the Castro for some 100
                   housing units specifically for people with HIV/AIDS.
           •	 San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD): The SFUSD prepared a Facilities
              Master Plan that identifies possible surplus land that could become available for hous-
              ing development. The SFUSD’s Seven/Eleven Committee for Long-Term Leasing and
              Property Sales has determined that approximately 20% of the District’s current square
              footage is considered surplus. They have engaged Bay Area Economics to study the
              potential and viability of housing for some of these areas. SFUSD concluded the study
              and its recommendations at the end of 2009. The following is a list of vacant land
              owned by the SFUSD:
              ▪▪ 11001 Connecticut Street
              ▪▪ 7th Avenue @ Lawton
              ▪▪ Florence Martin CC (1155 Page Street)
              ▪▪ Former Phoenix School (1950 Mission Street)
              ▪▪ Former San Miguel Elementary School Campus (300 Seneca Avenue)

                        share ownership of the 25-acre Balboa reservoir site. The reservoir is also within the
                        Planning Department’s Better Neighborhoods Balboa Park Station study area. Plan-
                        ning estimates between 575 to 1,000 new housing units could be built on this site. A
                        planning process for this site is underway.
                     •	 Central Freeway Parcels: Demolition of the Central Freeway freed up some seven
                        acres of public lands for residential development. The freeway parcels have an estimated
                        housing development potential capacity of 900 units. About half of these public lands
                        will be dedicated to affordable housing.

A. Evaluation of the
   2009 Housing Element
   As part of the Housing Element update process, California Government Code Sections
   65588(a) and (b) require an evaluation of San Francisco’s existing Housing Element. This
   review consists of three parts: 1) a summary of San Francisco’s housing production during the
   2007-2014 reporting period; 2) a review of the programs and analysis of the appropriateness
   of the 2009 Housing Element goals, objectives and policies and the effectiveness of the hous-
   ing element in achieving those goals and objectives; and, 3) an evaluation of the progress in
   implementation of the housing element.
   A review and evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element objectives and policies is essential to an
   effective housing element update. Reviewing housing targets and production measures, exam-
   ining the appropriateness and effectiveness of objectives and policies as stated in the existing
   element, and evaluating implementation programs initiated during the reporting period will
   all serve to strengthen the revised Housing Element and help address the city’s ongoing housing
   challenges. An evaluation of the implementation programs is presented in a matrix at the end
   of this appendix.
   Housing Targets and Production
   The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and the Association
   of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) set San Francisco’s fair share of the regional housing need
   for the 2007-2014 reporting period at 31,193 units. This Regional Housing Needs Allocation
   (RHNA) process also established that 61% of these units (18,878 units) be affordable to lower
   income households and the remaining 39% (12,315 units) could be met by market rate hous-
   ing production. The 2009 Housing Element suggested that the total number of housing units
   allocated to San Francisco by the RHNA process was not realistic given the national recession,
   funding constraints and impediments to housing production, but still accepted the allocation
   as its quantified housing production goal.
                                                                                                    A.1

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Although San Francisco is falling short of meeting its state mandated fair share housing targets,
         approximately 18,080 new housing units were built from 2007 to the first quarter of 2014
         (Table A-1); this is about 600 units more than that built between 1999 and 2006. Furthermore,
         an additional 4,680 units were under construction at the end of March 2014. If these units
         are fully constructed by the end of 2014, it would represent 15% of the RHNA production
         targets. At the time of this report’s writing, the City is about 300 units short of meeting is its
         market rate production target. Given the number of units under construction, San Francisco
         will meet its production targets for market rate housing. With increased production targets,
         San Francisco only met 41% of its production goal for low income housing, a noticeable
         decline from the 74% produced in the previous reporting period. Shrinking federal and state
         subsidies have affected construction of units affordable to lower income households.

         The greatest deficiency for the reporting period continues to be in the production of moderate-
         income housing, where the city produced just 16% of its target. Nevertheless, this represents
         a significant increase in moderate-income housing - an additional 53% from the 725 units
         produced during the 1999-2006 reporting period. The primary obstacle to the production
         of moderate-income housing in high land cost markets such as San Francisco is profitability.
         ABAG’s 2007 study, A Place Called Home, shows that other communities in the Bay Area
         with high land values have also failed to produce sufficient moderate-income housing. Almost
         all of the moderate-income housing produced during the reporting period came from the
         inclusionary housing programs and, with increasing land and production costs, there is little
         reason to think this trend will change.

Housing Programs and Initiatives
The 2009 Housing Element reorganized but retained the intent of the 2004 Residence Ele-
ment. The 2009 Housing Element continued to place greater emphasis on identifying ap-
propriate locations for new housing citywide, especially increased density near downtown; on
implementing area plans to build new neighborhoods in appropriate locations; on improv-
ing the livability of existing neighborhoods through good design, mixed-use development,
increased density near transit, improved infrastructure and public amenities, and reduced
parking requirements; on protecting the affordability of existing housing and building more
new affordable housing; on streamlining the housing production process through program
EIRs and Area Plan EIRs; on creating mixed-income communities; on providing more family
housing; and on managing homelessness through supportive housing.
New Area Plans
Several new area plans were adopted during the 2007-2014 reporting period. These plans
seek to capitalize on each area’s unique assets for current and future residents, and strengthen
neighborhoods by encouraging new housing in transit-rich areas where neighborhood shops
and services are concentrated.
  •	 The Better Neighborhoods Program was started in 2000 and used intensive commu-
     nity-based planning to incorporate recognition of citywide needs, including housing
     goals, into the planning process for each neighborhood. Three neighborhoods – Balboa
     Park, Central Waterfront, and Market and Octavia – were initially selected to serve as
     models for similar future programs in other parts of the city. The Market Octavia Plan
     was adopted and approved in May 2008 and Balboa Park in April 2009. The Central
     Waterfront Plan was included in the Eastern Neighborhoods environmental review and
     plan adoption process and adopted December 2008.
  •	 The Eastern Neighborhoods (EN) planning process is a large-scale community plan-
     ning effort in several neighborhoods in the eastern portion of San Francisco originally
     including the South of Market, Mission, Potrero Hill/Showplace Square, Bayview,
     and Visitacion Valley neighborhoods. Eventually the Bayview, (adopted by the San
     Francisco Redevelopment Agency in June 2006), and Visitacion Valley (adopted in
     December 2008, re-adopted in 2014) neighborhoods underwent separate planning
     and plan adoption processes. The Central Waterfront was incorporated into the EN
     environmental review and plan adoption process. These EN plans were adopted in
     December 2008.
  •	 Treasure Island, Parkmerced and Hunters Point/Candlestick Point (Phase I & II) are
     three large developments that received entitlements through Development Agreements,
     approved by the City in 2010 and 2011. Together, they are expected to produce up to
     26,000 units, up to 6,300 of which will be affordable (23,700 net units and 5,400 net
     affordable), over the next several years. In each case, the developer has committed to
     funding and building significant transit and transportation improvements, as well as
     parks and other amenities to serve future residents.
                                                                                                 A.3

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Program Environmental Impact Reports
         A major new policy in the 2009 Housing Element encouraged the preparation of detailed
         Program Environmental Impact Reports (EIR) and the use of subsequent community plan
         exemptions, where appropriate, for new planning areas in order to streamline environmental
         review by reducing duplication in the EIR process. The pilot project for this type of program
         EIR was the Market/Octavia Area Plan, which analyzed the area plan at a programmatic level
         while also providing project-level environmental review of former freeway parcels where the
         plan foresees specific residential growth. The Market/Octavia program EIR was completed in
         the summer of 2008, and the first Community Plan Exemption (CPE) for a project was issued
         for a 25-unit mixed use building. Subsequent area plans, including the Eastern Neighborhoods
         and Transit Center District Plans, also approved programmatic EIRs. To date, over 40 projects
         have received CPEs from the Planning Department.
         Affordable Housing
         San Francisco faces a continuing shortage of affordable housing residents of all but the highest
         income levels. In response to the high projections of housing needs for San Francisco set forth
         in the 2009 and previous Housing Elements, San Francisco has instituted several strategies for
         producing new affordable housing units. These strategies seek to support affordable housing
         production by increasing site availability and capacity for permanently affordable housing, and
         to encourage the distribution of affordable housing throughout all neighborhoods, thereby
         offering diverse housing choices and promoting economic and social integration.
           •	 Planning Department - Inclusionary Housing Program. In 2001, San Francisco greatly
              increased the capacity for affordable housing production through expansion of its
              Inclusionary Housing Program and increased fees to the Affordable Housing Fund.
              Between 2007-2013, the inclusionary program produced 986 affordable units. This
              represents an annual average of 140 units compared to the average 112 units produced
              during the 1996-2006 reporting period. This is also more than a thirteenfold increase
              from the 73 units produced from 1992 (when the program first began) to 1998. The
              inclusionary program also contributed almost $28.4 million to the Affordable Housing
              Fund in in-lieu fees between 2007 and 2013.
              In 2006, the program was further modified as follows: expanded coverage with a lower
              threshold to include projects with five or more new units; increased the percentage of
              affordable units required to 15% on-site and 20% off-site; increased the amount of
              in-lieu fees in order to cover the increasing costs of constructing affordable units; and
              required off-site affordable units to be rental affordable to households making up to
              60% of the San Francisco Area Median Income (SFAMI) - or if for ownership, units
              affordable to those making 80% to 120% of SFAMI - and be located within a mile of
              the subject development. Because median income for the City of San Francisco is lower
              than area median income, program affordability levels are tied to the metropolitan
              median income or SFAMI. This better reflects local conditions and further enhances
              program affordability. The threshold reverted to 10 units or more and affordability
              requirements were reduced to 12% for on-site inclusionary units in 2010.
              In late 2009, the Second District Court of Appeal issued Palmer/Sixth Street Properties

      vs. City of Los Angeles, which held that the California Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing
      Act preempts local municipalities from mandating that newly constructed dwelling
      units be rented at low-income rents. As this case impacts future rental units provided
      through San Francisco’s Inclusionary Program, the City is proceeding with amend-
      ments to this legislation which would clarify the Program as fee-based, and retain the
      option of building the units on-site or off-site to for-sale projects only, yet offering
      rental projects the ability to take advantage of on-site or off -site options should they
      wish to waive their Costa-Hawkins rights.
  •	 Redevelopment Agency – Housing Participation Policy. Changes to the Redevelopment
      Agency’s Housing Participation Policy also occurred in 2002, with required unit per-
      centages and affordability requirements similar to the City’s Inclusionary Affordable
      Housing Program. However, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency was dissolved
      along the rest of redevelopment agencies in California in 2012. Nevertheless, prior
      to its dissolution, the agency produced 340 affordable units during the 2007-2014
      reporting period.
  •	 Jobs Housing Linkage Program. In February 2001, the Office-Affordable Housing
      Production Program (OAHPP) was revised and expanded; it was also renamed the
      Jobs-Housing Linkage Program (JHLP). The original OAHPP required office develop-
      ment project sponsors to directly provide housing or to contribute land or in-lieu fees
      to a housing developer as a condition of approval for large-scale office development.
      The JHLP was expanded in scope and application to include all types of commercial
      development (e.g., hotels, entertainment, R&D, large retail etc.); monitoring and col-
      lection of fees paid was also enhanced.
      From 2007-2013, JHLP contributions to the Affordable Housing Fund fell to under
      $1 million, compared with over $42 million collected during the previous reporting
      period of 1999-2006. This was largely due to funds being returned to developers of
      projects canceled during the Great Recession. However, almost $6 million JHLP
      funds were collected in fiscal year 2012-2013 as the development environment began
      to recover, and fee collections are expected to increase substantially during the next
      reporting period, as the economy continues to grow.
HOPE SF Program
The City developed the 2006 HOPE SF program to increase affordable housing production.
Modeled after the federal HOPE VI program, HOPE SF will provide up to $95 million in
funding to replace existing public housing and add mixed-income units, while planning for
needed transit improvements, community facilities, and public amenities. HOPE SF will
replace all publicly assisted units (without displacing existing residents) in five public housing
sites across the city, while also creating up to 3,500 new homes. The pilot project for HOPE SF,
Hunter’s View in the Bayview District, broke ground in 2010 and welcomed its first residents
in January 2013.
                                                                                                   A.5

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         At-Risk Affordable Housing
         The number of affordable housing units at risk of converting to market rate, including Single
         Resident Occupancy (SRO) units, has been substantially reduced by the Mayors Office of
         Housing (MOH) and the Redevelopment Agency (SFRA). At risk units were transferred
         to non profits and provided operating subsidies, ensuring their long term affordability. As
         called for in the 2004 Housing Element capital improvement projects were implemented
         for distressed public housing, and several public housing projects, such as Hayes Valley and
         Valencia Gardens, were rebuilt during the reporting period using federal HOPE VI funds.
         The Residential Conversion and Demolition Guidelines, the Condominium Conversion Or-
         dinance (which limits the annual number of apartments that can convert to condominiums),
         and the City’s Rent Control policies all continue to limit the demolition or conversion of
         existing affordable housing.
         Emergency Shelters and Supportive Housing
         The Department is currently drafting legislation that would allow emergency shelters as of
         right in at least one zoning district in the city, bringing San Francisco into compliance with
         California state law. Currently there are two Zoning Administrator interpretations that shape
         the City’s definition of “homeless shelter.” Per these interpretations, shelters operating on a
         long-term basis (more than one month) are considered to be “group housing” while those
         operating on a short-term basis (night-to-night) are considered to be “hotel uses” under the
         Planning Code. Group housing in principally permitted (“as of right”) in several zoning dis-
         tricts, including the C-2 and C-3 Zoning Districts. Hotel uses do not appear to be principally
         permitted in any zoning district (where allowed, they are allowed with Conditional Use Au-
         thorization). The Department intends for the legislation to be adopted before December 2014.
         Density Bonus
         The City has continued the policy of establishing special use districts (SUDs) and height
         exceptions intended to support the development of affordable housing by allowing density
         bonuses for higher percentages of affordable or special needs housing. Almost all new Area
         Plans adopted during the 2007-2014 reporting period also include these policies, as well as
         additional affordable housing impact fees. Floor area ratio (FAR) limitations have been re-
         moved in the downtown areas to encourage housing development. The Board of Supervisors
         is currently considering legislation to exempt on-site inclusionary units from existing density
         limits in certain districts, essentially giving developers who include affordable units within
         their projects a density bonus.
         In February 2014, the Department released an RFP for consultant support to develop a more
         proactive program to implement government Code Section 65915. For example the proactive
         approach may follow the model of other municipalities which indicate which exemptions will
         be not be deemed as potentially having an adverse impact on health and safety. The Planning
         Department intends to draft a proposal for a proactive program before December 31, 2014.

ADA Reasonable Accommodations
The Department is working to adopt an ordinance that establishes a procedure for making
requests for reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations, policies,
practices and procedures of the jurisdiction to comply fully with the intent and purpose of fair
housing laws. The Department is working with the Mayor’s Office on Disability and other
City agencies to create a streamlined process for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to
housing. Specifically, the process would exempt applications for certain non-compliant park-
ing facilities, ramps and elevators from the standard variance process, eliminating the need for
the project to be approved at a hearing. Instead, applications would be approved through an
administrative variance. The City passed this legislation December 2014.
Accessory Dwelling Units
Allowing an additional on-site unit in existing residential structures is an effective and inex-
pensive way to realize greater housing potential. Several measures seeking to create additional
housing opportunities through such a mechanism have been introduced in the last 20 years, but
were deemed politically infeasible due to neighborhood opposition. In the past year, however,
the Board of Supervisors has passed several pieces of legislation around secondary dwelling
units. One ordinance, approved in April 2014, waives some restrictions for homeowners in
and around the Castro Neighborhood Commercial District who wish to add a dwelling unit
within the existing building envelope. Another, passed soon after, created an amnesty program
for illegal dwelling units that were built before January 1, 2013.
OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES - IMPLEMENTATION
PROGRAMS EVALUATION
The following review of past and current implementation programs is organized by the eight
issues identified in the 2009 Housing Element: 1) Adequate Sites; 2) Conserve and Improve
Existing Stock; 3) Equal Housing Opportunities; 4) Facilitate Permanently Affordable Hous-
ing; 5) Remove Constraints to the Construction and Rehabilitation of Housing; 6) Maintain
the Unique and Diverse Character of San Francisco’s Neighborhoods; 7) Balance Housing
Construction and Community Infrastructure; and 8) Prioritizing Sustainable Development.
1. ADEQUATE SITES
Objective 1 details San Francisco’s strategy for increasing the overall net supply of housing.
Production of new housing and increasing density of development was the primary strategy.

         New Housing Production
         From 2007 – Q1 2014, net addition to San Francisco’s housing stock was over 14,800 units.
         This unit gain reflects the cumulative efforts of a range of public agency programs and private
         investment throughout the city. This total is the net balance of new construction, demolished
         units, alterations.

         Major Plans and Developments
         A number of area and community planning efforts were also adopted during the 2007-2014
         reporting period. The resulting plans and rezoning in these areas increase potential housing
         capacity. As shown in Table A-3 below, these programs created capacity for growth estimated
         to be over 49,500 units.

                                      In addition, there were several other initiatives pursued by the City from 2007-2014 to create
                                      more housing units. These include:

                                           opportunities on public lands. In particular, the City seeks to take advantage of new

 114 Elmira                                Neighborhoods Program, the City is pursuing the development of affordable housing
 155 & 165 Grove                           on several significant public sites. The Market-Octavia Plan calls for the development
 195 Portola                               of up to 900 units of housing on the former Central Freeway parcels, one-half of
 301 WIlde                                 which could be affordable and/or senior units. The Balboa Park Plan recommends the
 341 Corbett                               construction of affordable housing on portions of the Phelan Loop owned by the San
 395 Justin                                Francisco Community College District, on existing bus yards owned by the Municipal

                                           potential use as homeless housing. It also established a Citizens Advisory Committee
 Alemany & Ocean
                                           to explore affordable housing development at sites determined to be surplus, or, if
                                           identified as such, if this land should be sold to raise money for affordable housing
                                           development. The removal of the Central Freeway created a variety of surplus parcels
                                           in the Market-Octavia plan area that will be developed as housing, and several publicly
                                           owned sites in the Eastern Neighborhoods are also being considered for affordable
                                           housing development. Table A-4 lists other sites that have been transferred to MOH
                                           for consideration as affordable housing.
                                        •	 Secondary Units. Allowing an additional on-site unit in existing residential structures
                                           is an effective and inexpensive way to realize greater housing potential. Several measures
                                           seeking to create additional housing opportunities through such a mechanism have
                                           been introduced in the last 20 years, but were deemed politically infeasible due to
                                           neighborhood opposition. However, in 2014 the Board of Supervisors passed several
                                           pieces of legislation around secondary dwelling units. One ordinance, approved in
                                           April 2014, waives some restrictions for homeowners in and around the Castro Neigh-
                                           borhood Commercial District who wish to add a dwelling unit within the existing
                                           building envelope. Another, passed soon after, created an amnesty program for illegal
                                           dwelling units that were created before January 1, 2013. Although 43 secondary units
                                           were legalized from 2007-2013, 154 were removed during the same period.
                                        •	 Institutional Master Plans. The City requires that large institutions create Institutional
                                           Master Plans (IMPs) whose purpose are to provide the public with information regarding in-
                                           stitutional operations including future expansion, construction, and property acquisition.
                                           Although IMPs are informational only and do not explicitly require that institutions
                                           provide housing for its students or workers, the process has directly contributed to
                                           increasing the amount of housing large institutions must plan to accommodate
                                           demand. For example, through the IMP process, San Francisco State University in-
                                           creased the amount of student housing it planned to provide from 845 to 1,200 units.
                                                                                                                                      A.9

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
              During the 2007-2014 reporting period, a total of 22 IMPs were completed, among
              which the following included residential components:
                    1. The Art Institute of California – San Francisco
                    2. University of San Francisco

                    5. California College of Arts and Crafts
           •	 30K by 2020. On December 18, 2013, Mayor Ed Lee issued Executive Directive
              13-01: Housing Production & Preservation of Rental Stock, which directed all City
              departments to prioritize the construction and development of all net new housing, in-
              cluding permanently affordable housing. In his 2014 State of the City address, Mayor
              Lee set a goal for the production of 30,000 new and rehabilitated housing units by
              2020, at least 30% of which would be permanently affordable to low and moderate-
              income families.
         2. CONSERVE AND IMPROVE EXISTING STOCK
         Objectives 2 and 3 focus on retaining the existing supply of housing, particularly rental hous-
         ing, affordable units and residential units located in commercial and industrial areas, and
         maintaining existing housing in decent condition.
         Objective 2
         RETAIN EXISTING HOUSING UNITS, AND PROMOTE SAFETY AND
         MAINTENANCE STANDARDS, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING AFFORDABILITY.
           •	 The City has codified controls on applications that propose the loss of dwellings and
              live-work units by merger, conversion or demolition. Except in the case of unsound or
              unsafe housing, or the most expensive single family homes, dwelling removal requires
              a hearing before the Planning Commission, and applicants must meet a majority of
              the criteria for dwelling loss to be approved, in order to retain the city’s existing sound
              housing stock. Roughly 950 units were demolished between 2007 and 2013, represent-
              ing about 0.3% of the city’s housing stock. However, the City’s one-to-one replacement
              policy requires almost all of the demolished units to be replaced with the same number
              of new units or more. Compared with the just over 1,000 units demolished during the
              1999-2006 period, the annual rate of demolitions has increased slightly.
           •	 The City’s dwelling unit merger policy was codified in 2008 to require Planning Com-
              mission review of any proposal to merge dwelling units. Planning Code Section 317
              establishes criteria to evaluate such proposals, and emphasizes the importance of exist-
              ing units to the city’s housing stock. From 1999-2006, 315 dwelling units were lost
              due to a merger with another unit, while from 2007-2013, 191 dwelling units were lost
              due to mergers. This represents a 40% decrease in the annual average number of units
              lost due mergers. Table A-5 lists annual units lost through demolitions, conversions
              and mergers.

                        •	 The Residential Hotel Conversion Ordinance preserves the city’s valuable supply of
                           single room occupancy (SRO) residential units and restricts their conversion to com-
                           mercial uses. Originally adopted in 1980 and strengthened in 1990, this program
                           is still in effect and the loss of SRO units has been minimized. The total number
                           of residential rooms held steady during the 2007-2013 reporting period, increasing
                           slightly to 19,380. However, the share of rooms owned and operated by non-profit
                           organizations (which ensure permanent affordability) increased from 17% in 2000 to
                           28% in 2013. The SRO Hotel Safety and Stabilization Task Force continues to moni-
                           tor SRO units in the city.
                           Several measures have been implemented to slow the loss of single-room occupancy
                           (SRO) residential hotel units in San Francisco, such as increased safety regulations,
                           transfer of residential hotel buildings to non-profit organizations, ensuring the long-
                           term affordability of these units, and the reauthorization of the Single Room Occupancy
                           Hotel Safety and Stabilization Task Force that was set to expire in 2009. Many SROs
                           in the city have now been transferred to non-profit ownership or management, helping
                           ensure the continued viability that these important affordable housing resources pro-
                           vide, but operating and rehabilitation subsidies are needed for many of the properties
                           acquired 10-15 years ago. New affordable SROs are being built with supportive services
                           for this population.
                        •	 Legalization of existing illegal secondary units. Several attempts were made over
                           the past 20 years to legalize some of the estimated 20,000 illegal secondary units scat-
                           tered throughout the city as a way to retain this supply of housing that is generally
                           more affordable. In April 2014, legislation was enacted amending the Planning and
                           Building Codes to provide a process for granting legal status to existing dwelling units
                           constructed without the required permits and temporarily suspending the code en-
                           forcement process for units in the process of receiving legal status.
                        •	 Publicly Funded Rehabilitation. The City sponsored the rehabilitation of 969 units
                           during the last reporting period. Funding from these programs, administered by the
                           Mayor’s Office of Housing and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, enabled the
                           units to be revitalized while retaining affordability.
                        •	 HOPE-SF Program. Until the mid-2000s, the Federal HOPE VI program provided
                           funds for rehabilitating public housing projects throughout the country. As the amount
                           of funds available through the HOPE VI program began to dwindle, the City began
                           exploring other funding options, and launched the HOPE-SF initiative in 2006.
                           HOPE-SF calls for using City funds to rebuild 2,500 units of public housing in several
                           distressed sites across the city. These developments would be rebuilt at higher density
                           and as mixed-income communities with neighborhood services. An important part
                           of the HOPE-SF program is the one-to-one replacement of subsidized housing units
                           and the programs established to ensure right of return for existing residents. The first
                           completed HOPE-SF project welcomed its first residents in January 2013.
                                                                                                                    A.11

           •	 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings. There are approximately 90 units in 30 unrein-
              forced masonry buildings that require seismic upgrading. The Department of Building
              Inspection is currently pursing abatement actions for these structures. This number is
              down from 11,850 units and 399 buildings in 2002. Most of these rehabilitated units
              are in residential hotels (SROs) and apartment buildings occupied by lower income
              households.
           •	 Property Maintenance Assistance. The CERF/CHRP programs continue to assist
              low-income property owners in repairing code violations that might otherwise lead to
              abatement of housing units. New CERF loans average four to five per year, and new
              CHRP loans average 10-15 per year.
         Objective 3
         PROTECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK,
         ESPECIALLY RENTAL UNITS.
           •	 Rent Control. The San Francisco Rent Ordinance was enacted effective June 13, 1979
              by the Board of Supervisors and signed by the Mayor to alleviate the City’s affordable
              housing crisis. The Ordinance applies to most rental units built before June 1979, and
              places limits on the amount of rent increases which can be charged and on the reasons
              for evicting a tenant. Although the number of rent controlled units continues to de-
              cline, particularly in smaller two-unit buildings that are not subject to condominium
              conversion controls, approximately 170,000 rental units are protected by rent control.
              Tenants in these units are safeguarded from excessive rent increases.
           •	 First-time Homeowner Assistance Programs. The Mayor’s Office of Housing offers sev-
              eral funding programs to assist moderate and low-income households in purchasing
              their first property. These funds include the Downpayment Assistance Loan Program
              (DALP), City Second Loan Program, and Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC)
              that assist with the funding of a down payment and increase a household’s ability to
              qualify for a mortgage. The Office of Housing also administers assistance programs
              targeted specifically at police and first responders (First Responders Downpayment As-
              sistance Loan Program and Police in the Community Program) and teachers (Teacher
              Next Door Program).
           •	 Community Land Trusts. The City established a Community Land Trust Task Force
              in 2001 to explore the feasibility of using land trust structures to enhance affordable
              housing opportunities in San Francisco. Land trusts and other limited equity owner-
              ship models may be an effective way of retaining affordability in tight housing markets.
              A pilot project sponsored by the San Francisco Community Land Trust (SFCLT) was
              approved in 2006 and opened in 2009 at 55 Columbus Avenue. The building contains
              21 apartments housing 80-plus tenants, primarily elderly Chinese immigrant families.
              SFCLT will retain ownership of the land, but will sell the apartments to existing tenants as
              the Columbus United Cooperative. Resident-owners will own a limited equity stake al-
              lowing them to sell their units in the future, but the resale price will be controlled to ensure
              permanent affordability. SFCLT has since acquired several other properties throughout
              the city, and is exploring a variety of tools to ensure permanent affordability for residents.

   In May 2012, the SFCLT acquired its second property – a 10-unit property that was
   scheduled for public foreclosure auction in April 2012. This house became SFCLT’s
   first resident operated non-profit cooperative in January 2013. In addition, the SFCLT
   also purchased a five-unit property that was at risk of Ellis Act eviction in January 2013
   through the SoMa Stabilization Fund and community partnerships. More recently, in
   June 2014, the SFCLT assisted residents of the Merry Go Round House to purchase
   their 14-unit building.
•	 Affordable Housing Monitoring Programs. The Mayor’s Office of Housing manages
   a number of programs to set and implement monitoring standards and procedures
   for projects receiving housing subsidies. Monitored subsidies include loans for
   owner-occupied single-family homes, multi-family rental units, and the refinancing
   of affordable housing projects. Through an annual recertification process, MOH staff
   review management practices, income and rent levels, and occupancy status at subject
   properties to ensure compliance with affordability requirements. MOH significantly
   improved its Asset Management and BMR and Inclusionary monitoring programs
   near the end of the reporting period through investments in technology and process
   improvements. MOH and the Planning Department regularly update the Inclusionary
   Procedures Manual (most recently in 2013), which contains procedures for monitoring
   and enforcing the policies that implement the program.
•	 Acquisition of At-Risk Affordable Housing. The acquisition of affordable housing units
   at-risk of converting to market rate due to expiring HUD mortgages or other subsidies
   has been an important part of the City’s efforts to increase the stock of affordable hous-
   ing. Concerted efforts by MOH and SFRA have resulted in securing financing for most
   of these properties to come under non-profit ownership to ensure permanent afford-
   ability. From 2007 to 2013, a total of 969 affordable units were preserved through these
   efforts. Assisted housing developments include multifamily rental housing complexes
   that receive government assistance from federal, State, and/or local programs (or any
   combination of rental assistance, mortgage insurance, interest reductions, and/or direct
   loan programs) which are eligible to change to market-rate housing due to termination
   of a rent subsidy contract (e.g., Housing Choice Vouchers, Section 8) mortgage prepay-
   ment (e.g., FHA), or other state or local programs with expiring use restrictions. While
   most traditionally at-risk conversions have been averted, a new need has emerged to
   preserve affordability and community stability of rental housing stock restricted by the
   City’s rent stabilization ordinance. Because many such sites are too small for traditional
   local financing models (less than 20 units) MOH is currently working on a “small site”
   program that could allow the acquisition and rehabilitation of smaller sites, requiring a
   creative model addressing the specifics of these properties.
•	 Single Room Occupancy (SRO). Residential hotels in San Francisco are regulated by
   Administrative Code Chapter 41 – the Residential Hotel conversion and Demolition
   Ordinance, enacted in 1981. This ordinance preserves the stock of residential hotels
   and regulates the conversion and demolition of residential hotel units. At the end of the
   2007-2014 reporting period, 19,382 residential hotel rooms existed in San Francisco;
   71% were in for-profit residential hotels and 29% were in non-profit hotels. `
•	 Other Programs. The Condominium Conversion Ordinance puts a cap on the number
   of rental units converted to ownership units at 200 per year in order to limit the loss of
   rental units, which are generally more affordable housing opportunities. These controls
   remain an important feature of the City’s ability to retain its rental housing stock. The
                                                                                              A.13

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
              Rent Control Board also continues to implement rent control as a measure to retain
              affordability in rental housing. However between 2007 and 2013, 2,718 units were
              converted to condominiums in two-unit buildings, which continue to be exempted
              from the condominium conversion ordinance. From 2007-2013, a total of 2,718 rental
              units were lost due to two-unit building condominium conversions.
         3. EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
         Both the 2004 and 2009 Housing Elements called for increasing production of affordable
         housing, preserving affordable housing, encouraging economic integration in housing devel-
         opment, and the expansion of financial resources for permanently affordable housing. Several
         objectives and policies from the 2009 Housing Element made significant contributions to San
         Francisco’s efforts to provide, retain, and fund affordable housing citywide.
         Objective 4
         FOSTER A HOUSING STOCK THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL
         RESIDENTS ACROSS LIFECYCLES.
           •	 Inclusionary Housing Program. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors
              adopted new code language in 2002 that placed a 10% affordable requirement on
              all housing projects over 10 units and a 12% affordable requirement on develop-
              ments over 10 units that seek conditional use approval. Prior to this adoption,
              inclusionary housing was only encouraged, not required. A total of 869 units were
              produced by the City’s inclusionary policy during the 1999-2006 reporting period.
              The City modified and expanded the requirements again in 2006, eliminating the dis-
              tinction for conditional use applications, and now requires 15% on-site inclusionary
              and 20% off-site. The program was also expanded to include projects containing five to
              nine units. Between 2007 and 2013, 986 inclusionary units were produced.
           •	 Redevelopment Agency Housing Participation Policy. Changes to the San Francisco Rede-
              velopment Agency’s Housing Participation Policy also occurred in 2002, with required
              unit percentages and affordability requirements similar to the City’s Inclusionary
              Affordable Housing Program in effect at that time. In September 2008, the Agency
              recommended adoption of new requirements similar to those adopted by the City in
              2006. The Redevelopment Agency was dissolved along the rest of redevelopment agen-
              cies in California in 2012. Nevertheless, prior to its dissolution, the agency produced
              340 affordable units during the 2007-2014 reporting period.
           •	 Density Bonuses and FAR limits. The City has continued the policy of establishing spe-
              cial use districts (SUDs) and height exceptions intended to support the development
              of affordable housing by allowing density bonuses for higher percentages of affordable
              or special needs housing. Almost all new Area Plans adopted during the 2007-2014
              reporting period also include these policies, as well as additional affordable housing
              impact fees. Floor area ratio (FAR) limitations have been removed in the downtown
              areas to encourage housing development. The following SUDs were adopted during
              the 2007-2014 reporting period:

    	    Van Ness & Market Downtown Residential SUD
    	    Third Street and Le Conte Avenue Affordable Housing SUD
    	    Presidio-Sutter SUD
 •	 The Board of Supervisors is currently considering legislation to exempt on-site
    inclusionary units from existing density limits in certain districts, essentially giving
    developers who include affordable units within their projects a density bonus. In
    February 2014, the Department released an RFP for consultant support to develop
    a more proactive program to implement government Code Section 65915. For
    example, the proactive approach may follow the model of other municipalities which
    indicate which exemptions will be not be deemed as potentially having an adverse
    impact on health and safety. The Planning Department intends to draft a proposal for
    a proactive program before December 31, 2014.
 •	 Family Housing. The construction of new family housing, especially affordable family
    housing, was a major goal of the 2009 Housing Element. Some 1,340 units of desig-
    nated affordable family housing, consisting of three or more bedrooms, were produced
    from 2007 to 2013. This represents roughly 30% of all affordable housing constructed
    in the city or 7% of total housing production during that time. In addition, 267 single-
    family homes were completed during the reporting period, representing 1.8% of all
    new construction.
Objective 5
ENSURE THAT ALL RESIDENTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO
AVAILABLE UNITS.
 •	 Preventing Discrimination. The Fair Housing Unit of San Francisco’s Human Rights
    Commission (HRC) investigates and mediates complaints of discrimination in hous-
    ing based on race, religion, sexual orientation, and numerous other characteristics and
    qualities discrimination against families with children. Protection from such discrimi-
    nation stems from several local ordinances, including five sections of the Municipal
    Police Code that prohibit specific kinds of housing discrimination. HRC staff also
    provides counseling on fair housing and general housing rights, offers referrals to other
    agencies, conducts research on fair housing practices, and hosts training and educa-
    tional sessions.
 •	 Fair Housing. The product of a multi-agency effort coordinated by the Mayor’s Office
    of Housing, the City regularly updates and releases an Analysis of Impediments to
    Fair Housing report, the latest of which covers 2013-2018. The report discusses the
    challenges of affordability, accessible housing, and alleged discrimination in the city’s
    housing market. The paper also offers recommendations on increasing community ac-
    ceptance of affordable housing and the promotion of fair housing practices in public
    housing. These action items are incorporated into the City’s 2010-2015 Consolidated
    Plan and its associated Action Plan.
 •	 Economic Integration. The City revised and expanded its inclusionary afford-
    able housing policy in 2002 and again in 2006, as discussed in greater detail
    under Objective 4 above. The policy requires the provision of affordable units
    in development projects with five or more units and discourages the provision
                                                                                              A.15

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
              of off-site units to meet this requirement; moreover if the required affordable
              units are built off site, they must be located within one mile. Over time, this will
              lead to greater economic integration of units within housing developments.
              The HOPE-SF program, launched in 2006, will rebuild existing public housing proj-
              ects as mixed-income developments, at increased density and with additional public
              amenities. The pilot project for HOPE SF, Hunter’s View in the Bayview District,
              broke ground in 2010 and welcomed its first residents in January 2013.
           •	 Affordability Targets. Since adoption of the 1990 Residence Element, the Mayor’s
              Office of Housing (MOH) and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA)
              have targeted their affordable housing programs to serve low and very low-income
              households to the maximum extent feasible. For most rental housing units, house-
              hold income may not exceed 60% of area median income (AMI). Most owner-
              ship units can range from 80% to 120% AMI, but must average 100% AMI.
              Changes to the City’s inclusionary program in 2006 require any off-site BMR units to
              be either rental units, or ownership units affordable to 80% AMI. These agencies have
              also dedicated increasing resources to assisting households at income levels below the
              maximum income levels for each program. For example, notices of funding availability
              for family rental housing currently require that units targeted toward households with
              extremely low incomes (i.e., at or below 20% of area median income) be included in
              the development.
           •	 Rent Control and Tenants’ Rights. The San Francisco Human Rights Commission admin-
              isters numerous programs to investigate and mediate conflicts around alleged housing
              discrimination. The City’s Rent Stabilization Board Commission - comprised of ten-
              ant, landlord, and neutral representatives - oversees the Rent Stabilization Board, the
              City agency charged with monitoring and enforcing the city’s rent control ordinance.
              The Rent Board offers counseling and referral services to tenants faced with property
              management problems or the threat of eviction. The City’s Rent Control ordinance
              requires property owners to compensate tenants that are evicted due to a major capital
              improvement project or an owner move-in. The number of total evictions represented
              by Ellis Act and owner move-in evictions rose to 1,728 from 2007-2013; this is a
              substantial increase from 531 reported for 1999 – 2006.
         Objective 6
         REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS.
           •	 10-Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness. Recognizing the need for an in-
              tegrated service system, the City adopted the Continuum of Care Plan in
              1995 in an effort to better coordinate housing, health, and human ser-
              vices for homeless individuals and families. This plan was updated in 2001.
              In 2002, San Francisco passed Proposition N, the Care Not Cash initiative, the pri-
              mary goal of which as to reduce homelessness and improve the health and welfare
              of homeless indigent adults receiving cash assistance through permanent housing
              opportunities and enhanced services. Under Care Not Cash, funding that would
              have otherwise been used for cash aid to homeless individuals is instead used to
              expand permanent housing and services. The program emphasizes placement in

                                                                                 DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
                                      permanent supportive housing, where individuals have access to on-site case man-
                                      agers and a menu of supportive services that support housing stability. Under this
                                      plan, the City proposed a total of 3,000 units in supportive housing by 2014. As
                                      of 2009, almost 2,200 units of supportive, SRO housing are available through the
                                      City’s master lease program. An April 2007 commitment to double the production
                                      of family supportive housing was made in response to the concern that the City’s
                                      supportive housing programs over the last few years served primarily single people.
                                      Under the program, the number of cash payments made dropped from 2,334 in 2004
                                      to 371 in 2014. The number of individuals who have moved into housing, as of April
                                      2014, is 4,351.
                                   •	 Master Lease Program. The City created a Master Lease Program in 1999 that provides
                                      housing with supportive services for persons leaving homeless shelters. This program
                                      was expanded significantly from 2003 to 2007 to focus on providing supportive hous-
                                      ing. To date, more than 95% of all individuals placed in this program maintain housing
                                      stability from year to year.
                                  3. FACILITATE PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING
                                  Objective 7

                                   •	 Permanent Affordability. Long-term or permanent affordability remains a priority for
                                      the programs of the Mayor’s Office of Housing (MOH). For almost all programs, af-
                                      fordability terms of 50 to 75 years are now standard. The term of affordability is greater
                                      than the anticipated life of the developments funded by public funds. Where project
                                      sponsors have sought additional money from the City to extend the useful life of the
                                      building, MOH requires an extension of the term of affordability. In addition, the lead
                                      role played by non-profit entities in sponsoring affordable housing has meant that, in
                                      practice, housing developments will remain affordable even after the expiration of the
                                      50 to 75 year term, since such assets must continue to be used for purposes consistent
                                      with the corporate purpose of the organization.

           •	 Affordable Housing Trust Fund. In 2012, San Francisco voters approved Proposition C,         2008–2009           $(7,155,039)
              the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which should provide up to $50 million annually           2009–2010          $(10,246,292)

              $50 million annually in funds for affordable housing. The funding comes from money           2011–2012             $1,536,683
              that had already been allocated towards affordable housing, as well as a portion of the      2012–2013             $9,130,671
              hotel tax and the city’s reformed business tax. The Housing Trust Fund will receive $20          Total           $28,386,587
              million in its first year and increasing amounts thereafter, up to $50 million annually
              by year 12.
           •	 Regional Grants. San Francisco was successful in advocating for language in the 2007-
              2014 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process to direct more transporta-
              tion money to jurisdictions that agree to take on greater housing growth. Recently, the         Year             Amount

Objective 9
PRESERVE UNITS SUBSIDIZED BY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL
SOURCES.
  •	 HOPE-SF Program. Until the mid-2000s, the Federal HOPE VI program provided
      funds for rehabilitating public housing projects throughout the country. As the amount
      of funds available through the HOPE VI program began to dwindle, the City began
      exploring other funding options, and launched the HOPE-SF initiative in 2006.
      HOPE-SF calls for using City funds to rebuild 2,500 units of public housing in several
      distressed sites across the city. These developments would be rebuilt at higher density
      and as mixed-income communities with neighborhood services. An important part of
      the HOPE-SF program is the one-to-one replacement of subsidized housing units and
      the programs established to ensure right of return for existing residents.
  •	 Acquisition of At-Risk Affordable Housing. The acquisition of affordable housing units
      at-risk of converting to market rate due to expiring HUD mortgages or other subsidies
      has been an important part of the City’s efforts to increase the stock of affordable hous-
      ing. Concerted efforts by MOH and SFRA have resulted in securing financing for most
      of these properties to come under non-profit ownership to ensure permanent afford-
      ability. From 2007 to 2013, a total of 969 affordable units were preserved through these
      efforts. Assisted housing developments include multifamily rental housing complexes
      that receive government assistance from federal, State, and/or local programs (or any
      combination of rental assistance, mortgage insurance, interest reductions, and/or direct
      loan programs) which are eligible to change to market-rate housing due to termination
      of a rent subsidy contract (e.g., Housing Choice Vouchers, Section 8) mortgage prepay-
      ment (e.g., FHA), or other state or local programs with expiring use restrictions. While
      most traditionally at-risk conversions have been averted, a new need has emerged to
      preserve affordability and community stability of rental housing stock restricted by the
      City’s rent stabilization ordinance. Because many such sites are too small for traditional
      local financing models (less than 20 units) MOH is currently working on a “small site”
      program that could allow the acquisition and rehabilitation of smaller sites, requiring a
      creative model addressing the specifics of these properties.
5. REMOVE CONSTRAINTS TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND
REHABILITATION OF HOUSING
The 2009 Housing Element continued several 2004 Housing Element and 1990 Residence
Element objectives that encompass citywide and regional concerns and priorities related to
the production and allocation of housing, including improving access to housing opportuni-
ties, adjusting affordability standards, preventing discrimination, minimizing or mitigating
displacement, increasing production of family-sized units, creating mixed-income neighbor-
hoods, reducing homelessness and the risk of homelessness, revitalizing neighborhoods to
improve quality of life, increasing density near transit, providing neighborhoods with adequate
transit and amenities, increasing available funding for transit-oriented development, expanding
regional transit systems to discourage commuting by car, and promoting increased affordable
housing production across the region.
                                                                                                 A.19

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Objective 10
         ENSURE A STREAMLINED, YET THOROUGH, AND TRANSPARENT
         DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
           •	 Program EIRs. The Market & Octavia Area Plan was developed with a program EIR
              designed to include sufficient detail to avoid the need for additional project EIRs, and
              thus streamline the housing production process. The Market/Octavia program EIR
              was completed in the summer of 2008, and the first Community Plan Exemption
              (CPE) for a project was issued for a 25-unit mixed use building. Subsequent area plans,
              including the Eastern Neighborhoods and Transit Center District Plans, also approved
              programmatic EIRs, and to date over 40 projects have received CPEs from the depart-
              ment.
           •	 Entitlement Process Improvements. In December of 2013, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee
              issued Executive Directive 13-01, directing City departments with legal authority over
              the permitting or mapping of new or existing housing to implement process improve-
              ments to facilitate the production of affordable housing units and preserve existing
              rental stock. In response, a number of City departments formed a Housing working
              group, releasing a memo recommending a number of process improvements to meet
              the mayor’s directive. Included among them are priority and concurrent review process-
              ing for residential projects that include higher levels of affordable units, inter-agency
              MOUs relating to the review and approval process for affordable housing projects, and
              expediting the hiring of City staff who review housing permits.
           •	 The Planning Department and DBI have also been working to implement an online
              Permit & Project Tracking System (PPTS), which will allow the public to file certain
              types of applications and permits and track the status of planning applications and
              building permits online. The Planning Department launched PPTS in the fall of 2014,
              DBI is expected to follow in 2015.
           •	 Consolidated Plan. The Mayor’s Office of Community Development (MOCD) Con-
              solidated Plan identifies the specific housing needs of San Francisco’s low-income
              residents, based on demographic and other information. The 2010 Consolidated Plan,
              which covers the 2010-2014 period, contains the following priorities which are used
              to allocate affordable housing funds: 1) create housing opportunities for the home-
              less; 2) create affordable rental housing opportunities for individuals and families
              with incomes up to 60% of the area median income (AMI), and; 3) create home-
              ownership opportunities for individuals and families with incomes up to 120% AMI.
              The Mayor’s Office of Housing (MOH) continues to collaborate with the Department
              of Public Health and Human Services to develop supportive housing opportunities that
              directly and effectively address the needs of homeless persons. Additionally, MOH con-
              tinues to develop high quality affordable rental housing opportunities for households
              at or below 50% AMI, along with administering new homeownership opportunities
              (most arising from San Francisco’s inclusionary housing policy) for households gener-
              ally ranging from 80% to 120% AMI.

6. MAINTAIN THE UNIQUE AND DIVERSE CHARACTER OF
SAN FRANCISCO’S NEIGHBORHOODS
Objective 11
SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE DIVERSE AND DISTINCT CHARACTER OF
SAN FRANCISCO’S NEIGHBORHOODS.
 •	 Residential Design Guidelines. In 1989, the Planning Department proposed a set of
    design guidelines to help ensure that new residential development respects the unique
    character of many of San Francisco’s neighborhoods. These guidelines were refined and
    adopted as part of the 1990 Residence Element update, and were updated again in 2003
    as part of the 2004 Housing Element program.
 •	 New Area Plans. Through the Better Neighborhoods and other area plan programs, the
    Planning Department continues to explore ways to develop and enhance the quality
    and livability of existing residential neighborhoods. The Eastern Neighborhoods new
    area plans initiated during the 1999-2006 reporting period and recently adopted in
    2008, identify core elements that help create vibrant neighborhoods, such as walk-
    ability, availability of services, transit access, housing choices, and unique character.
    These new area plans incorporate these ideas into the development of community goals
    and neighborhood improvements.
 •	 Housing Development in Residential Neighborhoods. Almost 3,100 units of housing were
    developed in San Francisco’s existing residential neighborhoods from 2007-2013, rep-
    resenting 17% of all housing production in the city during that time period. This figure
    includes all new units constructed in the city’s traditionally residential RH and RM
    districts (Residential House and Residential Mixed). The City has been able to locate
    this substantial amount of new housing in existing residential areas without significant
    adverse impacts to prevailing neighborhood character. The Better Neighborhoods and
    Eastern Neighborhoods programs provide for an increase in the number of housing
    units built in these districts near transit and other services.
 •	 Historic Resources. Several districts and buildings were designated landmarks during
    the 2007-2014 reporting period, including the Duboce Park Landmark District, the
    Market Street Masonry Landmark District, Twin Peaks Tavern, Marcus Books and
    the Doelger homes Sales Office. Historic Context Statements were completed for all
    the Better Neighborhoods and Eastern Neighborhoods plan areas as well Japantown
    and the Transbay District. As new plan areas are established, an evaluation of historic
    resources will be performed where appropriate. The Planning Department will also be
    revising the historic context statement for the City, which provides a framework for the
    evaluation of the significance of potential historic resources. This work is also expected
    to be completed in 2014.
                                                                                               A.21

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         7. BALANCE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND COMMUNITY
         INFRASTRUCTURE
         Objective 12
         BALANCE HOUSING GROWTH WITH ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT
         SERVES THE CITY’S GROWING POPULATION.
           •	 IPIC. A major feature of the various Area Plans adopted during the 2007-2014 report-
               ing period are the inclusion of impact fees, levied on any new development taking place
               within the plan area. These fees are used to partially fund the various infrastructure
               improvements necessary to support new residents. A multi-agency group, the Inter-
               agency Plan Implementation Committee (IPIC) was formed to manage the collection
               of the fee and prioritize capital projects in coordination with Community Advisory
               Committees in each neighborhood. In each of the past two years (FY13 and FY14),
               IPIC collected roughly $6 million in impact fees. Fee collections are projected to grow
               dramatically over next reporting period, with a total of $70 million expected from
               FY2013-2017.
           •	 Parking Requirements. Neighborhood planning policies seek to reduce parking re-
               quirements below one space per unit in areas near transit in order to increase density,
               discourage automobile use, and create more walkable neighborhoods.
         8. PRIORITIZE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
         Objective 13
         PRIORITIZE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN PLANNING FOR AND CON-
         STRUCTING NEW HOUSING.
         Green Building - Quality of Life Improvements. The City has made a substantial effort to in-
         corporate green building principles and green design into development projects during the
         last several years. In 2006, the Planning Department and other permitting agencies began to
         expedite permits for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified gold
         buildings. Moreover, in 2008 the City adopted a Green Building Ordinance that requires all
         new residential and commercial construction, as well as renovations to certain buildings, to
         meet green building standards.

   Residential Pipeline Dashboard on the expected unit type and income level of any proposed
   projects or area plans under review, the cumulative ratio of affordable and inclusionary
   housing to market rate housing, including how such units would address the City’s fair share
   of the Regional Housing Needs. The Department will work to include information about
   new jobs created in the city by wage. The Department will also summarize available sales
   price data for new housing as a part of the Quarterly Residential Pipeline Dashboard to help
   the Planning Commission, planning staff and the public understand trends in housing prices
   of new construction.

         13. When considering legalization of secondary units within a community planning processes,
         Planning should develop design controls that illustrates how secondary units can be developed to
         be sensitive to the surrounding neighborhood, to ensure neighborhood character is maintained.

         completion of the environmental review for all residential projects located in areas exceeding 75
         Ldn. The analysis shall include at least one 24-hour noise measurement (with maximum noise
         level readings taken at least every 15 minutes). The analysis shall demonstrate with reasonable
         certainty that Title 24 standards, where applicable, can be met. If there are particular circum-
         stances about the proposed project site that appear to warrant heightened concern about noise
         levels in the vicinity, the Department may require the completion of a detailed noise assessment

18. To minimize effects on development in noisy areas, for new residential uses located in areas
exceeding 75 Ldn, the Planning Department shall, through its building permit review process, in
conjunction with noise analysis, require that open space required under the Planning Code for
such uses be protected, to the maximum feasible extent, from existing ambient noise levels that
could prove annoying or disruptive to users of the open space. Implementation of this measure
could involve, among other things, site design that uses the building itself to shield on-site open
space from the greatest noise sources, construction of noise barriers between noise sources and
open space, and appropriate use of both common and private open space in multi-family dwell-
ings, and implementation would also be undertaken consistent with other principles of urban
design.

Strategies for Further Review
  •• MOH should explore programs that promote donation of land for affordable housing
     development to the City, including community land trust programs. One possibility
     may be the review of programs that could allow the donation of real estate as a charitable
     contribution, similar to the Conservation Tax Incentive promoted by the Trust for Public
     Land for open space purposes, where taxpayers can deduct up to 50% of adjusted gross
     income (AGI) for donations or bargain sales of qualified conservation easements.
  •• Planning should continue to explore area-specific strategies to maximize opportunities for
     affordable housing, such as identifying affordable housing site opportunities, or developing
     additional inclusionary measures that are tailored to particular neighborhoods, within
     community planning processes,
  •• Planning should explore methods for promoting increased mixed uses, including the
     consideration of requiring conditional use authorization for single-use development projects
     in mixed use zoning districts, (such as Neighborhood Commercial zoning districts).
  •• Planning and MOH should explore incentives for student housing. Student housing
     is already exempt from the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, but additional
     modifications may assist in increasing the feasibility and supply of student housing.
Conserve and Improve Existing Stock
Objective 2:
Retain existing housing units, and promote safety and
maintenance standards, without jeopardizing affordability.
                                                                                                    C.5

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         19. The City should develop an effective enforcement program for short term rentals. The
         enforcement program should serve the existing law’s goal in protecting the housing supply from
         conversion to commercial hotels. The Planning Department should conduct a study on the
         impact of short term rentals on the broader housing supply in the city, focusing especially on
         neighborhoods with greater levels of short term rentals. Based on this study and evaluation of the
         enforcement program, the City shall revisit the law as understanding of these impacts expand.

         20. Planning shall continue to implement the recently adopted Planning Code Section 317,
         which codi­fies review criteria for allowing housing demolition, conversion and mergers, amend it
         when necessary, and shall continue to apply Section 311 of the Plan­ning Code to deny residential
         demolition permits until approval of a new construction permit is ob­tained. Planning shall also
         continue to require that all publicly subsidized housing units be replaced one for one.

         Strategies For Further Review
           •• DBI should consider additional programs that support voluntary home maintenance and
              seismic retrofitting, including expedited plan review and fee rebates.
           •• MOH and DBI should explore methods to, and seek funding for, programs that can increase
              maintenance and safety standards while not unduly increasing rents or displacing low-income
              households, such as a City-funded loan program aimed at meeting the needs of lower-income
              owners, similar to Chicago’s H.O.M.E.'s Upkeep and Repair Services Program.
           •• The BIC should evaluate the current uses of the Code Enforcement Rehabilitation Fund
              (CERF) and determine whether the program could be improved or expanded.
           •• As a part of the CAPPS Program, DBI should evaluate the need for revisions to the San
              Francisco Building Code; the need for the retrofit of designated shelters or the determination
              of alternate seismically safe locations; and the need for mitigation programs for critical non-
              ductile concrete buildings.
           •• DBI should evaluate alternative uses of the Seismic Safety Loan Program, and consider
              making it available for use in rehabilitating properties for conversion to limited-equity
              housing cooperatives.

         Strategies For Further Review
           •• The City should evaluate the role of rent-controlled units in meeting affordable housing
              needs, in order to develop policies that effectively continue their protection, and possibly
              implement requirements for their replacement. As part of this work, the City should consider
              pursuit of state legislative efforts that eliminate housing displacement pressures.
           •• The Rent Board should explore requiring proof of full-time residency for rent controlled
              units, to ensure they are fully occupied and not used as a second home, pied-à-terre or
              executive housing.
           •• The City should continue to monitor the effectiveness of current condominium conversion
              restrictions intended to moderate conversion and maintain supply of affordable rental
              housing in the City.
           •• MOH, SFRA HHS and DPH should explore how to expand the creation of permanently
              affordable units for single person households, particularly outside of well-served locations
              such as the Tenderloin and SOMA.
           •• MOH, SFRA and DBI should work cooperatively with affordable housing groups to identify
              and develop tools that would facilitate rehabilitation of at-risk rental units on an ongoing
              basis.
         Equal Housing Opportunities

Strategies For Further Review
  •• The Tax Assessors Office should evaluate the primary inhibitors to downsizing, and examine
     the incentives offered by Prop 60, which allows senior owners to move into “equal” or
     “lesser” value units while retaining their previously established Prop. 13 taxable values.
  •• Planning staff should review the Planning Code’s incentives for senior housing development.
  •• MOH, OCII and other housing entities should explore methods of collaborating with special
     needs advocacy groups to increase outreach to historically socio-economically disadvantaged
     populations.
  •• Supportive housing providers should explore ways to increase design and program elements
     in supportive housing which increase safety and inclusion, and provide trainings for housing
     staff to increase understanding of residents and reduce bias.
  •• DAAS should explore the potential for partnerships with HSA, MOH and nonprofit
     developers interested in developing adult residential care facilities to increase supportive
     housing options for the elderly, particularly people with dementia.
  •• DBI should study ways to encourage inclusion of “Universal Design” elements into new
     projects, especially small-scale, cost-effective measures such as installation of appliances
     and countertops at accessible heights, flat light switches, and levers and grab bars; resulting
     programs should balance the benefits of physical accessibility with the benefits of housing
     affordability.
  •• DAAS should work with MOH and OCII to explore ways to implement the GreenHouse
     model, a small-scale living environment of 6 to 10 seniors with nursing care needs that can
     be integrated into existing neighborhoods as infill development.
  •• DAAS, HSA, and/or MOH should actively work towards the development of sites for
     residential care facilities that are close to existing services – one promising option is to
     develop affordable residential care settings directly on the Laguna Honda Hospital campus.
     They should also work towards acquisition of housing that could be rehabilitated towards the
     Green House model in the Bayview district, which is particularly underserved.
  •• During community planning processes, Planning should explore partnerships with agencies
     such as RPD, OEWD, MOH and DCYF for cross-discipline efforts that may improve
     conditions in disadvantaged neighborhoods and increase access to housing, jobs, and public
     services.
  •• Planning should examine incentives such as density bonuses, or other zoning related
     mechanisms that encourage long-term (i.e. deed-restricted) permanently affordable rental
     housing.

  •• Planning, in cooperation with other agencies, should explore the use of Tax Increment
      Financing outside redevelopment areas to further the development of affordable housing and
      supportive infrastructure.
  •• MOH and Planning should continue to consider, within the context of a community
      planning process, zoning categories which require a higher proportion of affordable housing
      where increased density or other benefits are granted. Options include Affordable Housing
      Only Zones (SLI); Affordable Housing Priority Zones (UMU) or Special Use Districts on
      opportunity sites.
  •• DBI should review Building Code requirements to examine ways to promote “affordable by
      design” housing, including pre-built housing, affordable by design, construction types that
      allow housing at the ground floor of podiums, and other low cost construction types.
Objective 8:
Build Public and Private Sector Capacity to Support, Facilitate,
Provide And Maintain Affordable Housing.

71. The City shall continue to implement the Housing Trust Fund. The San Francisco Housing
Trust Fund was a ballet-initiative measure that was passed in November of 2012. The Housing
Trust Fund begins in year one with a general fund revenue transfer of $20 million and increases to
$50 million over time. The Housing Trust Fund will capture revenue from former Redevelopment
Agency Tax Increment funds (an example of what is being referred to as “boomerang” funds in
post-redevelopment California), a small portion of the Hotel Tax which has been appropriated
yearly for affordable housing, plus an additional $13 million in new General Fund revenue from
an increase in business license fees. The consensus business tax reform measure, Proposition E,
which also passed on the November ballot, will generate $28.5 million in the first year–$13
million of which will go to fund affordable and workforce housing. It is estimated that $1.5
billion will be invested in affordable housing. In addition to the Housing Trust fund, City Agen-
cies and other institutions will continue to work on additional funding sources for affordable
housing in accordance with the Proposition K Affordable Housing Goals ballot-initiative measure
passed in November of 2014.
Upon implementation or passage of policies, legisltion, executive orders, rules, regulations, and
procedures impacting the creation, preservation, improvement, or removal or residential housing,
the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors and all other elected officials, and all City Agencies shall

  •• Planning, OEWD and MOH should explore the option of allowing expired entitlements
     to continue if the site is sold to an affordable housing developer, if project sponsors agree to
     increased affordability requirements.
  •• OEWD and MOH should explore partnerships between developers and employers, such
     as master lease programs that ensures that a given number of units will be rented by the
     employer or their a sub lessee (the employee); or purchase guarantees to accompany the
     construction of for-sale housing, where an employer agrees to purchase a given number of
     units in a development if those units are not otherwise purchased, in exchange for price
     discounts for employees.
  •• MOH and Planning should explore expansion of the land donation alternative included in
     the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans as a way to fulfill Inclusionary Zoning requirements,
     and should work with the Tax Assessors office to explore tax incentives that could facilitate
     the donation of land from private property owners to the City or non-profits for the
     development of affordable housing.

D. Estimating Potential
   Development Capacity
   Introduction
   The Planning Department faces many policy questions relating to the future development,
   its location and type, within San Francisco. To inform this discussion, the Department relies
   on a number of data sources compiled into key databases to analyze existing and future land
   use trends and potential. The “build out” database is a collection of parcel-based data which
   quantifies existing land use conditions and, given zoning and height information, estimates
   for each parcel the potential for additional development. The database is set up with a series of
   scripts (see Attachment D-1) enabling testing of possible rezoning scenarios with relative ease.
   The result is a cumulative estimate of vacant and underdeveloped sites’ potential development
   at less than the theoretical maximum capacity allowed under current zoning. This estimate
   is necessarily conservative as it takes into account neighborhood character wherein existing
   residential structures typically fall below building densities and heights allowed by zoning.
   Terms
   The terms used in the tables and Housing Element Part I: Data and Needs Analysis are ex-
   plained below:
     •	 Housing Potential Sites: These are sites suitable for residential development based
         on criteria and site analyses of each district in the city. They consist of vacant or “un-
         developed” parcels and “soft sites,” which are determined appropriate for residential
         development based chiefly on database analysis including screening based on existing
         uses and preliminary surveys.
     •	 Vacant or Near Vacant and Undeveloped Lands: A parcel is considered “vacant” or
         “near vacant” and undeveloped if development is 5% or less of the potential devel-
         opment. This criterion thus includes unimproved or undeveloped lots used for open
         storage, surface parking, or other open air uses. Large lots with very small structures,
         for example a one-level grocery store with a relatively large parking lot, also fit under
         this description. These sites theoretically could be readily developed for residential use.
     •	 Underdeveloped Sites or “Soft Sites”: A second category of housing potential sites
         includes parcels which exceed 5% but not 30% of potential development square foot-
                                                                                                     D.1

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
                 age but were considered reasonable candidates for redevelopment. These include sites
                 with building uses that significantly underutilize the site such as. These sites may have
                 structures that could be reused or rebuilt for residential use.
         General Approach to Estimating
         Potential Capacity
         The build out database uses zoning information to estimate the potential development for each
         of more than 150,000 parcels in San Francisco. Given the number of parcels in the city, it is
         not feasible to calculate capacity for parcels individually. Accordingly, a batch treatment, and
         thus larger datasets of information, is needed.
         Potential development is counted in residential units and in commercial gross square feet. A
         parcel may have residential, commercial or residential and commercial development capacity
         depending on the specific combination of zoning and height district. Attachment D-2 sum-
         marizes permitted land uses and general development standards for the city’s zoning districts.
         These development standards include density and open space requirements relevant to esti-
         mating potential capacity of each parcel. Setbacks, where appropriate [largely in residential
         districts, but mainly in the RH-1(detached) district], are built in the “buildable envelope” of
         the parcel.
         Once the development potential for residential and commercial space is calculated, informa-
         tion on existing housing units and commercial square footage can be used to calculate the net
         potential for each parcel. For example, for a parking lot or a one-storey building in an 80-foot
         height zoning district, most of the potential capacity remains unused or underdeveloped; for
         two-storey homes in most residential neighborhoods, however, the potential capacity would
         be considered built out.
         The degree to which a parcel is considered built out is measured as its development “softness”
         and expressed as a percentage of how much of the parcel’s potential development capacity is
         utilized, aggregating residential and non-residential uses. The softness categories in use are 5%
         and 30%; the categories are mutually exclusive, and a parcel’s softness is counted in the cat-
         egory it falls immediately beneath. For example, a parcel that is developed to 20% of its zoned
         capacity will fall in the 30% softness bracket. The total remaining potential is measured in the
         field Netsqft, while remaining housing potential is recorded in Netunits. Netsqft
         is total potential square feet minus total existing square feet. Netunits, similarly, is total
         potential units minus total existing units. Rather than being mutually exclusive measures, or
         Netunits being contained in Netsqft, they measure different things.1
         1	 Netsqft doesn’t distinguish between what uses exist and could exist in a building, but is strictly a measure of how large the building is relative to the
             estimated potential given the zoning and height combination. Netunits in turn only compares existing and potential residential units. If the existing unit
             count happens to be small relative to non-residential uses in a building , the space for the additional, or net units could end up consuming more space
             than the net remaining buildable space. In order for the net residential units to be developed, there would, apart from an expansion of the building, also
             need to be a conversion of existing commercial uses to residential. This principle, if uncommon in practice, is illustrated in Figure D-1 .
 D.2

                                                  DRAFT PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION HOUSING ELEMENT 2014
For the purpose of determining remaining development potential capacity, the Planning De-
partment does not consider any parcel developed to more than 30% of its capacity as a “soft
site,” or a candidate for additional square footage or intensification. However, as net units
are tallied separately as the difference between potential and existing units, a parcel is only
considered soft if the actual building size is small enough to warrant a softness classification.
In other words, a building could conceivably have a potential for more residential units per
existing density controls, but if it is already built to capacity in terms of square footage, it is
not considered “soft” as an increase in residential units would need to come at the expense of
existing uses in the building (whether as a split of existing units, or conversion of commercial
space) and not through building expansion.
SPECIFIC APPROACH BY ZONING DISTRICT TYPE
Different development assumptions were applied to parcels based on general zoning designa-
tions. In addition to development standards specific to zoning, these assumptions are based on
existing development patterns including commercial and residential mix.
  •	 Downtown: In all C-2, C-3 and C-M districts, it is assumed that the primary use will
      be commercial and this is thus assigned 90% of the square footage with the remaining
      10% going to residential use. This is a conservative estimate as recent developments
      in these districts have far higher residential shares. For example, a 140,640 sq ft of-
      fice building was converted into a 100% residential building with 104 units. Another
      example is a low-rise tourist hotel was demolished and redeveloped into a 43-storey,
      495-unit rental building with just the ground floor for commercial/retail uses.
  •	 Industrial and South of Market districts: It is assumed in these districts that a certain
      proportion of the lots will be developed as residential and the remaining will be de-
      voted to commercial use. This is also a conservative assumption as industrial buildings
      have been converted to 100% residential use as is the case in live/work or loft-style
      developments.
  •	 PDR Districts: Envelope is determined as FAR times lot area. FAR varies by height
      district. No residential uses assigned to preserve remaining viable industrial uses in San
      Francisco.
  •	 Downtown Residential Districts: For these districts, bulk controls play a significant
      role in determining the amount of developable space, so floor plates was varied for
      different portions of the building depending on the height district. Residential to com-
      mercial uses was assigned in ratios 6:1.
  •	 Eastern Neighborhoods Residential Districts: For Mixed-Use-Residential and Down-
      town Residential-South Beach, residential to commercial uses were assigned in a 3:1
      ratio and 6:1 ratio, respectively. Buildable area is stories times 80% of lot area.
  •	 Multi-Use: This covers all Residential-Mixed (RM) districts. It assumes one primary
      use – residential – with no secondary use. Residential density limits determine the
      number of units, constrained by the height limit and rear yard requirements.
                                                                                                    D.3

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
           •	 Residential: This assumes housing as the sole use in all residential (RH) districts. This
              scenario also assumes one unit for each RH-1 lot, two units for RH-2, and three units
              for RH-3. For larger lots, the conditional use density limits apply.
           •	 Residential-Transit Oriented: As no residential density is specified, an average unit
              size of 1,000 sq ft plus 20% circulation/building inefficiency was used. The buildable
              envelope was calculated using 55% lot cover for each floor. No commercial uses as-
              sumed.
           •	 Mixed: All neighborhood commercial districts and the Chinatown Mixed Use districts
              are assumed to have commercial as the primary use, built-out based on the FAR, with
              residential as a secondary use, built-out to residential density limits. Residential devel-
              opment, however, is trimmed down based on the height limits.
           •	 Neighborhood Commercial Mixed, No Density Limits: A new, more flexible class of
              neighborhood commercial districts has been introduced not nominally constraining
              residential density, except for a requirement that 40% of units be two-bedrooms or
              larger. Height limit, rather than FAR was used to determine the built-out envelope. For
              these districts we divided evenly capacity between residential and commercial space.
           •	 Eastern Neighborhoods Mixed Districts: A number of new zoning districts in the
              Eastern Neighborhoods emphasize use flexibility and are less prescriptive in terms of
              allowed density for residential uses. For these districts, FAR determines the buildable
              area, and FAR in turn varies depending on building height. In these districts, com-
              mercial uses are given priority, ranging between 50% to 75% of buildable space.
         By taking into account existing development patterns including commercial and residential
         mix, these assumptions are by design on the conservative side. Recent residential developments
         in downtown, for example, have far exceeded the 90% commercial and 10% residential mix.
         Similarly, 100% residential projects have occurred in industrial and South of Market districts.
         Data
         The Department relies on a number of sources to provide the key information that forms
         the basis for the capacity calculations (Table D-1). While each data set is subject to errors in
         substance and time, we are confident that the method is meaningful in the aggregate assuming
         that errors are geographically randomly distributed. We have not found evidence that errors
         exhibit clustering.

Calculating Capacity
Table D-2 summarizes the algorithm for calculating residential and commercial square footage,
respectively, for each district. For practical reasons, districts were grouped in general zoning
district classes; for example, the over 20 distinct, named neighborhood commercial districts
were grouped with general neighborhood commercial districts. Assumptions also include: the
height of one floor or one storey was considered on average 10 feet; square footage of a new
dwelling unit was estimated at a gross 1,200 square feet, including circulation space, building
inefficiencies, parking etc.
The purpose of the build out has been to determine buildable capacity. Given the variety of
land uses allowed in most districts, buildable capacity is categorized at the most basic level:
residential or non-residential/commercial use. Accordingly, commercial space is treated as a
generic category for the purposes of calculating potential non-residential space.2
Limitations
For reasons of data architecture, Special Use Districts (SUDs) overlaid on zoning districts were
generally not included for build out calculation, with the exception of the Van Ness Market
Downtown Residential Special Use District, which could readily be mapped and treated as a
downtown residential district. All occurrences of this Special Use District/C-3 zoning combi-
nation could thus be treated the same way.
2	    For some districts the script accounts for different commercial categories separately to better reflect specific district limitations on certain uses.
                                                                                                                                                             D.5

PART 1: DATA NEEDS & ANALYSIS
         Another shortcoming of the build out script is that it does not at this time estimate the pos-
         sibility of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) option available to parcels larger than ½ acre
         in single ownership. While PUDs allow slightly greater density, they allow less than the density
         allowed by a district one class denser in order to not qualify as a rezoning. Capacity, this way,
         for sites eligible for PUD is estimated on the conservative side.
         Finally, inaccuracies crop up where lots are split into multiple zoning and/or height districts.
         The lot proportions in each district cannot be determined at the database level.3 In most of
         these cases, the more conservative zoning or height district was picked, and capacity calculated
         accordingly. For some larger sites, the height to be used by the script was assigned manually to
         better reflect actual conditions.
         It is important to note that the buildout dataset lacks a time dimension and makes no assump-
         tions or claims about economic or political conditions. Construction on sites may or may
         not happen depending on economic conditions, and would need to go through the normal
         review channels prior to realization. Moreover, this exercise of estimating the city’s remaining
         potential development capacity should not be taken as an identification of soft sites or parcels
         that will turn over and be developed. Market pressures can push development in parcels that
         may have existing land uses that exceed 30% or even 50% of its zoned capacity.

         tential capacity based on underlying zoning standards. These buildings, however, serve a public
         function and may not likely be turning over for additional development. Similarly, freeways
         and other dedicated rights-of-way, even if these parcels are zoned for residential uses, are not
         considered as land suitable for development. Also underutilized parcels that may have residen-
         tial or mixed uses with at least 10 units are not considered soft for this exercise. It is assumed
         for the purposes of estimating land inventory that such sites will not likely be demolished and
         rebuilt. These exemptions, as well as the assumptions and limitations cited in previous sections,
         therefore make this a very conservative estimate of the city’s remaining capacity.

4	  As net units is the nominal difference between existing and proposed units, the net unit estimate will in some cases presuppose that, in order to realize the
    net unit figure, existing non-residential building space will need to be converted into residential use. The figure shows this in the uncommon situation
    where a building has far more non-residential than residential space, and thus can add a relatively large number of units--more than could typically fit in
    the net square feet available between the existing building size and what could be built if fully developed.

Another major issue to balance is the relationship between
housing and infrastructure. The City’s goal is to locate
housing in areas that already have access to infrastructure
and services, many sites large enough for affordable hous-
ing are often found in transitioning areas that require ad-
ditional infrastructure. The City needs to seek equilibrium
for housing opportunities by prioritizing increased infra-
structure or services to these transitioning areas.
The purpose of this Housing Element is not to resolve all of
those tensions, but to provide a framework the City can use
to highlight concerns that should be balanced by decision
makers, to achieve the City’s stated housing goals.

areas.
In order to increase the supply and affordability of housing,
the City has engaged in significant planning for housing
through Area Plans (portions of the General Plan which
focus on a particular part of the city), Redevelopment
Plans (community revitalization plans authorized and
organized under the provisions of the former California
Community Redevelopment Law), and major develop-
ment projects created in partnership with private sponsors.
Recently adopted community plans include Balboa Park,
Glen Park, Market and Octavia, Japantown, Rincon Hill
and the Central Waterfront neighborhoods; the Eastern
Neighborhoods program including the Mission, South of
Market, Showplace Square and Potrero Hill; Candlestick,
and Hunters Point Shipyard; and former Redevelopment
Areas including Visitacion Valley/Schlage Lock and the
Transit Center District Plan. Other adopted major projects
in the city include Treasure Island and Parkmerced.
Plans and projects underway include Central SoMa, 4th
and King Railyard site, and smaller community planning
efforts. Other major projects in development with the city
include Treasure Island, Parkmerced and the Transbay
Transit Center. These ongoing community planning ef-
forts should continue. These projects could result in a
community accepted housing vision for the neighborhood,
related zoning changes and neighborhood specific design
guidelines that will encourage housing development in
appropriate locations.
Together, these planning efforts could provide capacity
for significantly more than the 29,000 units allocated for
this planning period (2014-2022). However these plans
will require significant investment in infrastructure and
supporting services in order to support this growth. Each
adopted plan contains related programs for affordable
housing (directing the mix of housing types, tenures and af-
fordability needs), infrastructure and community services,
they also contain design guidelines and community review
procedures. The City should prioritize public investment

related to environmental health and justice issues in San
Francisco. For example, SFDPH environmental health
inspectors frequently observe that families live in buildings
that cause a variety of health outcomes such as asthma and
lead poisoning. Understanding the impacts of past uses on
the soil, the proximity to currently operating heavy indus-
trial uses, and the surrounding air quality are critical when
developing housing.
In 2007 the San Francisco Department of Public Health
completed the Healthy Development Measure Tool
(HDMT), a system to evaluate health impacts of new de-
velopment. The HDMT proposes a checklist for evaluating
a range of project types from smaller housing developments
to neighborhood wide community plans. The HDMT cov-
ers six topics: environmental stewardship, sustainable and
safe transportation, public infrastructure (access to goods
and services), social cohesion, adequate and healthy hous-
ing, and a healthy economy, with over 100 benchmarks
in total. The level of analysis the tool provides can be very
useful in developing housing policy and programs for
a large area, as it can aide in identifying gaps in services
and amenities to be addressed at a policy level. Because of   POLICY 1.9

           reduce pressure on the existing housing stock, and should
           consider incentives for student housing development.
           POLICY 1.10
           Support new housing projects, especially affordable
           housing, where households can easily rely on public
           transportation, walking and bicycling for the majority
           of daily trips.
           San Francisco enjoys an extensive network of transit lines,
           including a number of major transit lines that provide
           nearby residents with the opportunity to move about the
           city without need of a car. Because of proximity to transit
           and bicycle networks, neighborhood serving businesses
           and job centers, some 29% of the city’s households do not
           own cars and 33% of San Franciscans take public transit
           to work, with higher rates for households in transit-rich
           areas. Infill housing in transit-rich areas can provide lower
           income households, affordable unsubsidized housing op-
           portunities. Housing with easy access to transit facilitates
           the City’s efforts to implement the City’s Transit First
           policy. Additionally housing near transit can provide site-
           efficient and cost effective housing.
           In reviewing reliance on public transportation, it is impor-
           tant to distinguish areas that are “transit-rich,” and located

           by transit. For the purposes of this Housing Element, “ma-
           jor transit lines” are defined as those that have significant
           ridership and comprehensive service – meaning almost
           24-hour service with minimal headways. This network of
           major transit lines includes BART’s heavy rail lines, MUNI
           Metro’s light rail system including the F, J, K, L, M and N
           lines, and Muni’s major arterial, high-ridership, frequent
           service local network lines. These lines are defined and
           prioritized in Muni’s Transit Effectiveness Project (TEP)
           as the “Rapid Network.” The Department should support
           housing projects along these major transit lines provided
           they are consistent with current zoning and design guide-
           lines.

           HOPE SF.
           The San Francisco Housing Authority is the largest land-
           lord in San Francisco, with over 6,200 units, and is one
           of the most important sources of permanently affordable
           housing for low-income households. The devolution of re-
           sponsibility for public housing from a federal to local level
           requires increased local responsibility for public housing
           developments. The City should continue to pursue innova-
           tive local financing techniques, energy efficiency measures,
           and creative property management and customer service.
           Innovative programs such as HOPE SF, which distinguish
           San Francisco as a leader in public housing redevelopment
           should be continued with City investment and support.

                 Mercy Housing California’s mission is to create vibrant,

                 and developing affordable housing in places like the Ten-

                 after the 1906 earthquake, the Arlington is now home to
                 low-income residents.
                 The Arlington, recently rehabilitated, has 153 apartments
                 that house formerly homeless individuals, most of whom
                 are single adults, and provides tailored on-site resident

POLICY 10.4
Support state legislation and programs that promote
environmentally favorable projects.
Senate Bill 375 legislates the reduction of greenhouse gases
through regional and local planning efforts, to achieve
statewide sustainable development goals. SB 375 provides
some regulatory relief for “sustainable projects” to reduce
project costs, processing time and legal risks, including
reducing some CEQA provisions. It also hints at linking
future State infrastructure funding, specifically transporta-
tion funds, to achievement of smart growth goals, includ-
ing lower vehicle miles traveled. Allocation of affordable
housing resources, particularly for new production, should
be consistent with smart growth principles.
SB375, and future regional and state efforts, should be ac-
companied by the kind of funding that will enable growth
to truly be “smart”. Linking funding directly to efficient
land use, rather than to population or regions, would
encourage smart land use patterns. The implementa-
tion of SB375 should be monitored, and addressed with
amendments if necessary, to ensure it successfully provides
the tools necessary to meet its smart growth goals in San
Francisco.

POLICY 11.9
Foster development that strengthens local culture
sense of place and history.
In addition to the factors discussed above, including
physical design, land use, scale, and landmark elements,
neighborhood character is also defined by long-standing
heritage, community assets, institutional and social char-
acteristics. Maintaining the linkages that such elements
bring, by connecting residents to their past, can contribute
to the distinctiveness of community character and unique
sense of place; as well as foster community pride and par-
ticipation.
Elements of community heritage can include the public
realm, including open space and streets; and the built envi-
ronment, institutions, markets, businesses that serve local
needs, and special sites. Other, non-physical aspects can
include ethnicity, language, and local traditions. Develop-
ment of new housing should consider all of these factors,
and how they can aide in connecting to them. Housing
types that relate to the community served, particularly the
income, household and tenure type of the community, can
help to address negative changes in socioeconomic condi-
tions, and reduce displacement. Constructing housing that
includes community components that build upon this sense
of place, such as public plazas, libraries, community facili-
ties, public art, and open spaces, can build a stronger sense
of community heritage. And the development of neighbor-
hood-specific design guidelines, as discussed above, should
review local neighborhood characteristics that contribute
to and define its character beyond the physical.

the Citywide Survey Program. The focus of the program
is on neighborhoods that are undergoing long-range
planning efforts or are the focus of intense development
activity, but the Citywide Survey Program will continue
survey efforts in neighborhoods outside of Area Plan study
areas as resources become available. While that Citywide
Survey is underway, the City should make use of existing
survey information, including privately developed prop-
erty reviews, and ensure it is made available to DBI and
any other relevant contractors who may be charged with
doing evaluations of damaged buildings.
Post-disaster assessment should include an analysis of the
extent of the damage to historic areas and resources. In a
typical assessment scenario, assessors will attach a green tag
if a building is structurally sound, a yellow tag where repairs
are needed, and a red tag if the structure is uninhabitable.
This system should ensure sufficient protection for historic
resources post-disaster, in that all tagged buildings receive
further detailed evaluation considering survey information
before any steps towards demolition are taken. The system
could also include separate placards identifying the build-
ing as a historic resource. Without such identification, the
buildings are at risk.

materials, equipment and vehicle inventory records.
It is important that the tasks that are authorized are
relevant and necessary, and that their completion is well-

disaster reimbursement claims to the State and Federal
government, and ensuring support funding is received.

INTRODUCTION
                                             FINAL DRAFT Recreation & Open Space Element 1
W        ith its dramatic physical setting comprised of hilltops and
         mountains, surrounded by the bay and ocean, with nature
woven through the landscape, San Francisco has an intrinsic connection
with its environment. The opportunity the City provides to move
outside and connect with nature has drawn countless thousands here
over time, and that draw continues today.
As our City grows, we must not lose sight of these very qualities. If
San Francisco is to continue to offer its residents, visitors, and workers
a vibrant, civic, livable environment connected with the wonders of
the natural world, we need a framework that ensures a world-class
open space system. The goal of the City’s Recreation and Open Space
Element is to continue the City’s legacy of fine parks and recreational
opportunities, and guide the City’s future decisions so they improve that
open space system for the benefit of everyone.

10 San Francisco General Plan
   Sustainability Plan for Public Parks
   Using the 2011 SFRPD Departmental Climate Action
   Plan as a baseline, the Recreation and Park Department’s
   Sustainability Plan sets forth guidelines for sustainable
   park practices. These practices offset municipal green-
   house gas emissions through landscape management
   and operations standards within the SFRPD parks and
   open spaces system to better manage natural resources,
   including soils, vegetation, and water. The Sustainability
   Plan expands the function of SFRPD parks beyond
   from providing recreational opportunities to mitigation
   of and adaptation to the effects of global climate change
   through environmental stewardship, resource conserva-
   tion, and ecological responsibility.
   San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department
   Project Standards and Design Guidelines
   The Project Standards and Design Guidelines were
   created to ensure a well maintained and actively used
   park system that supports the long-term health of
   people, plants, and animals. Recognizing that manage-
   ment practices have impacts beyond park boundaries,
   SFRPD developed the Standards and Guidelines to
   adapt to and preserve local systems through sustainable
   design of open spaces and facilities, and maintenance
   procedures. These practices include the use of proven
   sustainable materials and technologies.

Green Connections
Green Connections are special streets and paths that
connect people to parks, open spaces, and the waterfront,
while enhancing the ecology of the street environment. By
increasing greening in the right-of-way with street trees,
sidewalk gardens, and other landscaped areas, these streets
will become sustainable corridors that enhance mobility,
green neighborhood streets, and improve pedestrian and
bicycle access to community amenities and recreational
opportunities.
Living Alleys
The City’s network of alleyways– small-scale, quieter                              Living Street on Rincon Hill
streets that primarily serve vehicles needing access to
adjacent properties—can provide vibrant open spaces,
especially in dense neighborhoods. Some alleys, such as
Belden Place in the financial district, are currently closed
to traffic and provide an intimate atmosphere where
patrons of adjacent restaurants can enjoy outside dining
amidst a bustling urban environment. Other alleys,
such as Maiden Lane, are closed during certain times
of the day, serving adjacent businesses during the day,
but allowing deliveries during the evening hours. Still
other alleys, such as Linden Alley, are open to traffic, but
carefully designed to ensure that drivers proceed slowly
and with caution. These alleys are designed with seating,
landscaping, and pedestrian-scale lighting to create useable
and attractive open spaces. All three alley types should be
considered and encouraged.
                                                                                Parkway on Sunset Boulevard
In some residential neighborhoods in the City, such as
Visitacion Valley, Mission Terrace, Crocker Amazon
and Bayview Hunters Point, there are narrow, unpaved
alleyways that originally provided service vehicle access
before paved roads were built. These abandoned and
overgrown spaces can provide much-needed spaces
that supplement the traditional open space, potentially
providing walking and biking paths, or seating,
landscaping, and lighting appropriate to the area. Using
the City’s Better Streets Plan, the design for the different
types of alleys can be implemented. The City should study
different neighborhood needs and determine a priority
plan for creating living alleys in areas most in need of
these improvements.

    Voluntary Contributions. Many cities provide the
      option to voluntarily contribute a small amount of
      money specifically earmarked for open space. Such a
      contribution option would be added to residents’ utility
      bills to fund improvements to open space.
    Tax Revenue Options. In some cities, decision makers
      have pursued the option of an additional tax contribution
      earmarked for open space, usually via an additional
      property tax on residential and/or commercial owners.
      The creation of a new tax requires a two-thirds majority
      vote by the electorate and provides a consistent source of
      funding. The money can be used for acquisition, mainte-

      (or CFD), or special tax districts, will be used to help
      fund the on-going maintenance of the new open space
      facilities. The South Beach area also has a CFD that helps
      fund the maintenance of some small public plazas.
   RPD and other public agencies responsible for recreation
   and open space in the City should continue analyzing how
   such funding options could be applied in San Francisco for
   recreation and open space maintenance, operations, renova-
   tion and acquisitions.
