Flooding is a recognized hazard in some areas of Hercules. Storm water flooding of Refugio Valley
occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and runoff, coincident with high tides affecting Refugio
Creek. A backwater effect is created that prevents effective flood water discharge to San Pablo Bay.
Extensive flooding of Refugio Creek occurred during severe storms of January 1983, with the creek
overflowing its banks. A large area west of I-80 along is within the 100-year floodplain of Refugio
Creek. Flood improvements to and around Refugio Creek have reduced the areas within the City
that are within the 100-year floodplain (see the Figure S-3: Floodprone Areas Map in the Safety
Element). See the Flood Zones Map within the Safety Element. Runoff in urban areas increases with
the amount of impermeable surfaces created. Drainage facilities help control this runoff. Flooding is
addressed in more detail within the Safety Element.

Safety Element Amendment to the Hercules General Plan (tied to the Housing Element Update)                  3
Adopted by City Council 4-14-2015
To the extent that a county's safety element is sufficiently detailed and contains appropriate policies
and programs for adoption by a city, a city may adopt that portion of the county's safety element
that pertains to the city's planning area in satisfaction of the requirement imposed by this
subdivision.
At least 45 days prior to adoption or amendment of the safety element, each county and city shall
submit to the Division of Mines and Geology of the Department of Conservation one copy of a
draft of the safety element or amendment and any technical studies used for developing the safety
element. The division may review drafts submitted to it to determine whether they incorporate
known seismic and other geologic hazard information, and report its findings to the planning agency
within 30 days of receipt of the draft of the safety element or amendment pursuant to this
subdivision. The legislative body shall consider the division’s findings prior to final adoption of the
safety element or amendment unless the division’s findings are not available within the above
prescribed time limits or unless the division has indicated to the city or county that the division will
not review the safety element. If the division’s findings are not available within those prescribed time
limits, the legislative body may take the division’s findings into consideration at the time it considers
future amendments to the safety element. Each county and city shall provide the division with a
copy of its adopted safety element or amendments. Te division may review adopted safety elements
or amendments and report its findings. All findings made by the division shall be advisory to the

D. FIRE HAZARDS
The major fire hazard areas within Hercules are the open space areas directly adjacent to homes.
The open spaces include brush and grass covered hills and forested areas. The blue gum Eucalyptus
trees are particularly flammable. As the City grows and develops with more open spaces, the

potential for wildland fires will increase. The City works with the local Hercules-Rodeo Fire District
to assist with annual maintenance to reduce local fire hazards.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) maps areas of significant
fire hazards in the state. These areas are identified based on weather, topography, fuels, and other
factors. Fire hazards are greatest in areas with steep slopes, volatile vegetation, and windy conditions.
Figure S-2 (Fire Hazard Areas) shows fire hazard severity zones in the vicinity of Hercules. Land
adjacent to the City limits and some land located within the City’s Sphere of Influence are designated
with a high fire hazard severity zone in the State Responsibility Area (SRA). No land within the
incorporated areas of the City has been identified within Local or State Responsibility Areas for fire
hazards.
Limited active uses are located within these designated areas. Most of the area is preserved as open
space used for cattle grazing. A small portion of the area contains limited industrial uses associated
with a carbon factory.

…
F. FLOOD HAZARDS
Potential causes of flooding in the City include:
    - High tides and storm waves
    - Creek overflows
    - Standing water from excess rainfall
1. High Tides and Storm Waves
The City’s northwest land area is adjacent to San Pablo Bay. Potential flood hazards associated with
high tides and storm waves are concentrated at the confluence of the Bay and two creeks, Pinole Creek
and Refugio Creek.
Pinole Creek, between San Pablo Avenue and the Bay is a tidal waterway which has been that was
improved channelized and realigned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1965. The Pinole Creek
Watershed Vision Plan was prepared in 2014 to document the vision for restoration of the creek to a
more natural state. A portion of the Vision Plan was implemented in 2010, with the Pinole Creek
Habitat Restoration demonstration project, located between the Pinole Creek mouth and Interstate-
80. The City of Hercules also plans to restore the Chelsea Wetlands, adjacent to Pinole Creek
comprised of five acres of degraded seasonal wetlands, into functioning tidal wetlands. These
improvement projects are intended to both restore wetland aquatic and transitional habitat while
preserving and expanding flood conveyance and water storage capacity.
A large portion of Refugio Creek nearest San Pablo Bay has not been improved, thus remaining
susceptible to flooding. High tides and storm-driven waves occurring together could overtop
embankments and flood low-lying coastal areas. To address this issue, restoration of Refugio Creek
from its confluence with San Pablo Bay to approximately 1,500 feet upstream is anticipated to begin
in 2015. As part of the work associated with construction of the Bayfront Bridge/Intermodal Transit
Center, Refugio Creek is being realigned and the creek channel into San Pablo Bay will be dredged to
improve flow during heavy rain events and high tides.
2. Creek Overflows
When the surface runoff exceeds the capacity of the creek channel to carry the flow, creek overflows
result. Pinole and Rodeo Creeks drain relatively small portions of the City while the drainage basin of
Refugio Creek covers most of the City and extends well beyond the City boundary to the east. Pinole
and Rodeo Creeks are adjacent to the northern and southern City boundaries and drain the
neighboring communities of Pinole and Rodeo.

Adopted by City Council 4-14-2015

Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which are prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), identify potential flood zones (Figure S-3). Flood hazards related to storm events
generally are described in terms of a 100-year or 500-year flood. A 100-year flood is defined as a major
flood event that has a one percent or greater chance of occurring during any one year. Flood hazard
planning practices address such storms, as well as 500-year events. These floods are considered severe;
however, such flood events can be reasonably predicted and therefore reasonably mitigated. No areas
with the City or Sphere of Influence have been identified within 500-year flood hazard areas. However,
certain areas of the city (generally adjacent to creeks) have been identified to be within the 100-year
flood zones. These areas have a one-percent chance of inundation at varying depths.
The lower channel of Refugio Creek is inadequate with has had a history of overflowing. The upper
channel is on a slumping of slide slopes. Improvements to the lower channel in recent years have
reduced the potential for flooding both upstream and downstream. Approximately 2,500 linear feet
of Refugio Creek adjacent the Bayside subdivision was realigned and restored in 2004. As part of the
restoration, the creek was relocated to a new 180-foot wide channel to convey flood flows. Areas of
100-year flooding can be seen in Figure S-3. For specific elevations of flooding, please see the Flood
Insurance Rate map (Community Panel Number 0604340008B and 0604340009B) on file with the

1  Introduction and Overview 
What is a Housing Element? 
Every jurisdiction in California, including Hercules, must have a General Plan. The General
Plan serves as the ‘constitution’ for development in the city. It is a long-range planning
document that describes goals, policies and programs to guide development decision
making. Once the General Plan is adopted, all development-related decisions must be
consistent with the plan. If a development proposal is not consistent with the plan, it must
be revised or the plan itself must be amended. The majority of the current General Plan in
Hercules was adopted in 1998, although portions (including the Housing Element and the
Growth Management Element for Proposition J) were adopted at a later date.
Every community’s General Plan must, by law, contain seven ‘elements’ that address
defined sets of issues. The State-mandated elements of the General Plan include Land Use,
Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise and Safety. There are also a number
of “optional” elements, including Growth Management and Economic Development. These
elements might have different names in each jurisdiction, and may be organized differently,
but each of the seven areas must be addressed in the General Plan, and the entire plan
document must be internally consistent. The ‘elements’ in the Hercules General Plan are
Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Open Space, Safety, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Economic
Development, and Growth Management.
The Housing Element focuses on the community’s housing needs and strategies for meeting
those needs. The Housing Element:
       Documents housing-related conditions and trends;
       Provides an assessment of housing needs;
       Identifies resources, opportunities, and constraints; and
       Establishes policies, programs, and quantified objectives to address housing needs.
State law establishes requirements for all portions of the General Plan. However, for the
Housing Element, the State requirements tend to be more specific and extensive than for
other elements. This Housing Element for the City of Hercules covers the planning period of
January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023.
Frequency of Review and Update 
While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their General Plan on a regular
basis to ensure that they remain up to date (approximately every ten years), current State
law requires that Housing Elements be reviewed and updated at least every eight years.
Pursuant to State Law, the new update is for 2015 - 2023 planning period, due within 120
days from January 31, 2015. The process of updating Housing Elements is to be initiated by
the State through the “regional housing needs” process, as described below and in Chapter
                                                                           April 2015                      1

3. For local jurisdictions that are represented by the Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG), including the City of Hercules, the State approved the Regional Housing Need
Allocation Plan in August 2013, initiating the update of Housing Elements throughout the
region. This Housing Element complies with the State law requirement that Bay Area
jurisdictions adopt a Housing Element for the period January 31, 2015 through January 31,
2023.
Housing Element Contents 
State law is quite specific in terms of what the Housing Element must contain:
       “An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
        relevant to meeting these needs.”
       “A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to
        the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.”
       “A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions...to implement the
        policies and achieve the goals and objectives.”
Most importantly, the Housing Element must:
       Identify adequate sites with appropriate zoning densities and infrastructure to meet
        the community’s need for housing (including its need for low and very low income
        households, mobile homes, farm-worker housing, and homeless shelters); and
       “Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
        constraints” to housing development.
It is also important to note that State law requires a community’s General Plan to be
internally consistent. This means that the Housing Element, although subject to special
requirements and a different schedule of updates, must function as an integral part of the
overall General Plan, with consistency between it and the other General Plan elements. This
Housing Element neither proposes nor will result in changes to other elements of the
General Plan. It is consistent with the Hercules General Plan. As the Housing Element is
updated in the future, the City will ensure continued internal consistency among all General
Plan elements. Vice versa, when other elements are updated, the City will review the
Housing Element for consistency. Pursuant to State law (AB 162), the Safety and
Conservation Elements of the General Plan must include analysis and policies regarding
flood hazard and management information upon update of the City’s Housing Element.
This AB 162 update to the Safety and Conservation Elements is being conducted concurrent
with the 2015 Housing Element update.
The Eight­Year Action Plan 
In establishing housing programs, the Housing Element sets forth an ‘Eight-Year Action
Plan’ that details the actions that will be taken to implement the Housing Element’s goals
and policies. For each Housing Element program, the Action Plan must identify the agency
responsible for implementation, the timeframe for implementation, and the number of units

that will be constructed, rehabilitated, or conserved, or the number of households that will
be assisted, as a result of the program.
The primary areas of housing need that must be addressed in the Action Plan include:
       Ensuring adequate sites
       Providing assistance to support affordable housing
       Conserving and improving the existing affordable housing stock
       Addressing and removing governmental constraints
       Promoting equal housing opportunities
“Regional Fair Share” Housing Requirement 
One unique aspect of State Housing Element law is the idea of ‘regional fair share.’ As
explained in more detail in Chapter 4, every Housing Element must demonstrate that the
local jurisdiction has made adequate provision to support the development of housing at
various income levels (very low, low, moderate, and above moderate) to meet its ‘fair share’
of the existing and projected regional housing need. The ‘fair share’ requirement for
Hercules and all other jurisdictions in the Bay Area is determined through a State-mandated
process that is overseen by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) through the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process. The RHNA for this Housing Element
update covers the period from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022 and is used as the
basis for the slightly different Housing Element planning period from January 31, 2015
through January 31, 2023.
Review by State HCD 
State law requires that every updated Housing Element be submitted to California’s
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to ensure compliance with
the State’s minimum requirements. This ‘certification’ process is unique among the General
Plan elements.
Housing Elements are submitted twice to HCD for review and comment: once during
development of the Housing Element (in draft form), and again after adoption of the
Housing Element by the local jurisdiction. The first review period requires 60 days and must
take place prior to adoption. The second review may take up to 90 days and takes place after
adoption. After review of the draft Housing Element, HCD will issue a letter documenting
the department’s comments on the Element. The jurisdiction must address the comments to
the satisfaction of HCD in order to achieve a substantial compliance status (referred by
many as a “Certified” Housing Element).
The Housing Element Update Process 
The Housing Element process is a strategic opportunity to develop solutions to local
housing needs while contributing to community livability and sustainability. The Housing
Element process in Hercules provided opportunities for groups and individuals to review
                                                                            April 2015                      3

and discuss current housing conditions and needs and consider potential housing strategies.
Meetings held as part of the update process include:
Planning Commission Meetings: The City conducted a study session
with the Planning Commission on November 17, 2014 to discuss the
Housing Element.
All public meetings were advertised through the following:
       Events posted to City’s web site calendar and set to appear on
        web site home page.
       Announcements physically posted at City Hall, Community Center, and Post Office.
       E-mail announcements (“E-Notices”) sent to service subscribers (available to all
        members of the public).
       Hearings advertised in the West Contra Costa Times (local daily newspaper).
       Invitations sent the City’s Housing Element outreach list (see below), which includes
        community stakeholders, developers, and service agencies serving low and
        moderate income persons and persons with special needs.
The Planning Commission expressed concerns regarding the lack of funding to produce
affordable housing and provide ongoing maintenance of the affordable units to ensure the
quality of housing and neighborhood conditions are preserved. No comments from the
public were received.
On January 20, 2015, the City conducted an additional meeting with the Planning
Commission to review the Draft Housing Element. Community stakeholders, developers,
service agencies serving low and moderate income persons and persons with special needs,
and the community at large were invited to attend the meeting. Notices of the meeting were
published in West Contra Costa Times newspaper and on the City website. Special
invitations were sent to community groups, developers, and service providers. Groups
invited to the community workshop include:
       UCP of the Golden Gate                                              Contra Costa Crisis Center

2  Housing Needs Analysis 
Overview of the City of Hercules 
The City of Hercules has a unique history which has transformed the City from a small
company town to a bustling and thriving community. In the late 1800s the Industrial
Revolution changed the face of business throughout the country. The California Powder
Works company was a part of this revolution and played a key role in the formation of the
city now known as Hercules. The California Powder Works factory made black powder, an
explosive substance used mostly in guns. The Company opened in Hercules in 1879 and
incorporated the town on December 14, 1900. The first City Council consisted of plant
managers who passed ordinances primarily to ensure the success of their products.
California Powder Works sold its dynamite under the name Hercules Powder, in honor of
the Greek mythological hero, making Hercules a natural choice for the name of the new
City. The dangers of producing explosives, the growing Bay Area population, and changing
market trends forced plant managers to transition the plant to fertilizer, and dynamite
manufacturing was discontinued in 1964. When the plant switched to fertilizer production,
it was renamed Hercules, Incorporated and sold tracts of land near the plant to residential
developers. In 1976 Hercules, Inc. was sold to Valley Nitrogen Producers, which ended up
closing the plant a year later.
Another big influence in the development of the City of Hercules was the Pacific Refinery
Company. The refinery opened in 1966 and provided quality jobs to residents as well as
valuable revenue to the City. Pacific Refinery provided so much revenue that the City did
not truly feel the effects of Proposition 13 until after the refinery closed in 1995.
The first housing subdivision in Hercules was built in 1975, and beginning in 1980 and
continuing into the 1990s, the City added substantial new housing, shopping centers, civic
centers, making it one of the fastest growing suburbs in California during the 1980s. During
the 1990s the City’s neighborhoods felt disconnected, and there was an increasing need for
city services coupled with budget constraints. In 2000, the City involved over 300
participants (citizens and stakeholders) in a charrette process to establish a coherent vision
for the City. This process resulted in the Central Hercules Plan which lays out how four
under-developed neighborhoods could be transformed into thriving, distinct
neighborhoods. The City continued to add new subdivisions in the early 2000s as well as
new live/work and transit-oriented developments.
Hercules continues to pursue transit-oriented development using smart growth principles
and ensuring that development conforms to the Central Hercules Plan.

Sources of Information 
The primary source of information used in the compilation of demographic, housing, and
socioeconomic information used in the supporting technical analysis herein includes data
collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. This baseline population, housing, and
socioeconomic data for cities and counties is collected every ten years as part of the national
Census. The most recent Census data was collected in the year 2010. For some topics,
decennial census figures are supplemented by more recent data sets from the American
Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an ongoing statistical survey by the U.S. Census
Bureau and it regularly gathers information previously contained only in the long form of
the decennial census.
The 2010 Census data and more recent ACS data is also supplemented with population and
housing estimates by the State Department of Finance (DOF) and Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), employment data by the State Employment Development
Department (EDD), as well as current housing market data by other sources, such as the
California Association of Realtors (CAR), Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), and
Dataquick, among others.
Some of these estimates (such as the American Community Survey data and California
Department of Finance data) are shown solely as percentages, as the raw numbers carry a
significant margin of error, especially for smaller geographies such as cities and Census-
designated places. Nonetheless, the percentages give a general indication of population and
employment trends.
Demographic Characteristics 
Population Trends
The City of Hercules’s population increased approximately 24 percent between 2000 and
2010 (according to U.S. Census estimates), with an additional 4,572 individuals added to the
population for a total population of 24,060 in 2010 (see Table 1). Since 2010, the California
Department of Finance estimates that the City’s population has increased by about 500
individuals or two percent. Historical population estimates by the California Department of
Finance show that most of the growth occurred in the middle part of the decade, with the
largest growth being registered in the 2004 to 2005 period.
Contra Costa County grew at a substantially slower rate than Hercules during the 2000 to
2010 period, increasing its population by about 11 percent, for a total population of nearly
1,049,025 by 2010. Since 2010, the California Department of Finance estimates that the
County’s population has increased by about 38,000 individuals or close to four percent. The
largest population increases for the County were recorded in the first two years, 2001 and
2002. The fastest growing areas were dispersed throughout the County, in the communities
of Brentwood (a 121 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2010), San Ramon (a
61 percent increase), and Oakley (a 38 percent increase). The population decreases between
2009 and 2010 for Hercules and the County are most likely due to different methods of
population estimate used by the State Department of Finance and the Bureau of Census.

Comparing the population of Hercules to neighboring cities allows us to gauge whether
growth in Hercules has been comparable. From 2000 to 2010, Hercules experienced a
population increase of approximately 24 percent. This growth is significantly higher than
the neighboring cities in Contra Costa County, as shown in Figure 1. Martinez, Pinole, and
San Pablo all experienced population decreases in the last decade. California Department of
Finance estimates show population growth between 2010 and 2014 was consistent among
most neighboring cities (between two and three percent) with the exception of San Pablo
which saw a population growth of just one percent.

Population Projections
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects that Hercules will grow to a
population of 39,500 people by the year 2040 (Table 2). This represents a 64 percent increase
over a 30-year period, or an average annual growth of approximately two percent. During
this same period, the population in Contra Costa County is projected to increase 28 percent,
representing an average annual growth of less than one percent. ABAG projects that the
highest levels of population growth in Hercules would occur between 2010 and 2015 period.

Age
Age distribution is a key indicator of housing needs, as housing needs and preferences
change and individuals and households age. Housing needs for young families may focus
more on cost and the ability to become first-time homebuyers. For seniors, cost and access to
services are important, as seniors may be on fixed incomes and have mobility limitations.
The 2010 Census (see Table 3) indicated that approximately 11 percent of Hercules’s
population is 65 years of age or older, up from 7 percent of the population in 1990. The
largest percentage increase was in the 60 to 64 age range, with a 142 percent increase. There
were also large increases (over 80 percent in each group) in the 55 to 59 and 75 and over age
groups. The largest decrease was in the ten to 14 age group, which had a 7 percent decrease.
The least amount of change was in the five to nine (1 percent) and 35 to 44 (a 3 percent
decrease) age groups.
These figures indicate a maturing population, increasingly comprised of older adults with
older children, and seniors. This age composition is likely to shift in light of current
development activity that is diversifying the housing stock and creating new housing
opportunities for families with children and young single adults as well as seniors.

Race and Ethnicity
Hercules became increasingly diverse during the 1990s and has remained that way. As
shown in Table 4, the City’s population in 2000 was approximately 46 percent Asian/Pacific
Islander and 32 percent White, with African–Americans representing 20 percent of the
population. In 2010, the percentage of Asians/Pacific Islanders had dropped slightly to 45
percent, the proportion of African-Americans also decreased to 18 percent, and the
percentage of Whites dropped dramatically to 17 percent. The biggest changes were the 92
percent drop in Other residents and the 65 percent decrease in the American
Indian/Alaskan Native population. Hercules’ Hispanic or Latino population actually
                                                                                April 2015                            11

   increased substantially (by 67 percent) during this time period. Different racial and ethnic
   groups often have different household characteristics and cultural backgrounds that may
   affect their housing needs and preferences.

Notes:
1. ‘Two or more races’ was not introduced until the 2000 Census. Because individuals could report more than one race, the numbers by
     race/ethnic group in 2000 add to more than the total population, and percentages add to more than 100.
2. In the 2000 Census ‘Hispanic or Latino (of any race)’ replaced the previous designation of ‘Persons of Hispanic Origin.’
   Table 5 below compares the racial and ethnic composition of Hercules to neighboring
   communities based on 2010 Census data. Hercules is clearly a diverse city with Asians
   making up the largest segment of the population with 45 percent, followed by Blacks and
   non-Hispanic Whites. This differs from the cities of El Cerrito and Martinez, which have
   much larger White populations. San Pablo is also diverse; however, Hispanics make up their
   largest ethnic group.

Household Characteristics 
Household Types
Household characteristics and types can impact the type of housing needed. For instance,
single-person households often occupy smaller apartment units or condominiums, such as
studio and one-bedroom units. Married couples often prefer larger single-family homes,
particularly if they have children. This underscores the need to provide a diversity of
housing opportunities to provide households of different ages and types the opportunity to
live in Hercules.
The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all of the people who occupy a housing unit.
A household is different than a housing unit, as a housing unit is a house, an apartment, a
mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied (or if vacant, intended for
occupancy) as separate living quarters. A household consists of all the people who occupy a
housing unit. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other
group living situations are not considered households.
The number of households in Hercules increased 26 percent between 2000 and 2010, adding
1,692 additional households for a total of 8,115 households in 2010. As shown in Table 6, 78
percent of households in 2010 were families and 22 percent were non-family households
(such as unrelated persons living together or singles). Of the family households, just under
half had children under 18 years of age at home (about 34 percent of all households in the
City). Most of the City’s non-family households were people living alone.

Household Size
The comparable levels of growth in the number of households (25 percent growth) and the
overall population growth (22 percent growth) during the 2000–2010 period indicates a
stable household size over the seven-year period, as reflected in the data presented in Table
7. The average household size in Hercules decreased slightly during the ten-year period
from 3.03 in 2000 to 2.96 in 2010. The average family size also decreased slightly, from 3.46
in 2000 to 3.38 in 2010. By comparison, the average household size in Contra Costa County
increased from 2.72 in 2000 to 2.77 in 2010. According to ABAG’s 2013 projections, the
                                                                            April 2015                      13

average household sizes in the City and County are expected to remain relatively steady

Employment Trends 
Labor and employment characteristics have a direct impact upon current and future
housing needs within Hercules. Different industries and occupations within a particular
industry often translate into different wage levels. These differences in wages directly
impact a household’s ability to afford certain types of housing, the ability to rent or own
housing, and the ability to adequately maintain housing.
According to the California Employment Development Department, in October 2014 the
City of Hercules had unemployment rates of 4.0 percent. The unemployment rate in the City
was lower than the Contra Costa region (5.7 percent) and the State (7.0 percent),
demonstrating that Hercules is located in a strong employment market.
According to estimates from the ABAG’s projections (Projections 2013), population growth in
Hercules is expected to keep pace with job growth from 2010 to 2040, with a 64.7 percent
increase in jobs. The number of employed residents is projected to increase from 11,740 in
2010 to a projected 19,330 in 2040, an increase of approximately 65 percent. From 2010 to
2040, the ratio of jobs to employed residents in Hercules is expected to remain consistently
around 0.3 job to 1.00 employed resident. In other words, although job growth will create
new opportunities for more people to live and work in the community, the City will most
likely remain a ‘bedroom community’ in which most people live here but work elsewhere.

Table 9 tabulates occupations held by Hercules residents according to the 2008-2012 ACS
data and provides corresponding wage scales in Contra Costa County as of the first quarter
of 2014. Among the employed residents, the greatest proportion were working in the
management and professional industry, commanding a mean salary of $130,658. About 28
percent of employed Hercules residents were working in sales and office occupations,
earning a mean wage of $44,688. While a majority of the residents were earning moderate
wages, about 16 percent of employed residents were working in service occupations that
usually offer lower wages. Service occupations can include personal services, such as the
hospitality industry or food service, such as restaurant workers. These occupations earn less
than $30,000 and can limit the housing choices available to the workers.

Jobs/Housing Balance
There are different ways to examine the balance between jobs and housing in a community.
One way is to define it as the ratio resulting from the absolute numbers of jobs divided by
the absolute numbers of housing in the City. However, since many households consist of
two working adults, a jobs/housing ratio of 1.0 does not necessarily connote a ‘balance’
between housing and jobs. Another way to view jobs/housing balance is to compare total
employment (i.e., the number of jobs in Hercules) with the number of employed residents
(whether their jobs are in Hercules or elsewhere). This helps to account for the numerous
households with two wage-earners.
Table 10 provides data on current (2010), and projected (2015–2040) ratios for jobs and
employed residents in Hercules. As shown, the ‘balance’ between jobs and housing as well
as between jobs and employed residents is significantly skewed, reflecting the City’s
traditional status as a bedroom community that has had few jobs in comparison to the
number of residents. Although the City projects to increase the number of total jobs over the
next 30 years, the jobs-to-housing and jobs-to-employed residents ratios are expected to
remain similar due to proportional increases in the number of housing units and residents.
There are many benefits from a jobs/housing or jobs/employed residents balance, including
improved air quality (associated with reduced vehicle miles traveled by commuters), less
congested freeways, reduced fuel consumption, reduced expenditures on major
transportation projects, a labor supply more closely matched to local employment needs,
                                                                                  April 2015                               15

and savings in travel time for both businesses and individuals. However, even a 1.0 ratio
between jobs and employed residents does not guarantee a reduction in commute trips. The
analysis presented here does not address the issue of mismatches between housing costs,
housing supply and demand, types of jobs available, and skill levels of the community’s
workforce. Communities can continue to exchange workers regardless of a one-to-one
correlation of employed residents to total jobs. Although Hercules is expanding its jobs base,
the majority of residents will continue to commute elsewhere to work, while many of the
people who work in Hercules are likely to live in other communities, due to housing costs
and availability or other lifestyle choices. The issue of housing costs in comparison to
household incomes is discussed in this Housing Element. Also, through incorporation of
transit services in areas of new development and creation of a strong pedestrian-orientation
on new streets, the City hopes to encourage those workers who do commute elsewhere to
work to use public transit facilities.

Housing Characteristics 
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all residential dwelling units
located within the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth,
type, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, costs and affordability are important in
determining the housing needs for the community. This section details Hercules’s housing
stock characteristics in an attempt to identify how well the current housing stock meets the
needs of current and future residents of the City.
Housing Unit Types
The American Community Survey reported an estimated 8,378 housing units in Hercules as
of 2012, an increase of 28 percent (1,832 units) over the estimate for the year 2000. During the
early and mid-2000s, housing construction in Hercules continued to emphasize single-
family home developments, particularly detached single-family homes over attached single-
family homes (such as townhomes). There was also an increase in the number of larger
multi-family developments (five or more units), accounting for 26 percent of the units added
to the City’s housing stock over the ten-year period. The most significant development

activity in Hercules during the 2000–2010 period was in 2004–2005. Development since 2005
has been limited.

The distribution of unit type in Hercules varies slightly from that in Contra Costa County.
The majority of housing units in both Hercules and the County are single-family detached.
However, in the County, 16 percent of units are in large multi-family complexes while only
13 percent of units in Hercules are in large multi-family complexes. In Hercules, 17 percent
of units are attached single-family units while in the County, they account for only eight
percent of the units. Both the City and County have small proportions of units in small
multi-family complexes and very few mobile homes (Hercules has no mobile homes).

Tenure
‘Tenure” refers to whether a housing unit is rented or owned. According to the 2008-2012
ACS 5-Year Estimates, approximately 76 percent of all housing unit in Hercules were
owner-occupied and 24 percent were renter-occupied units. This is a decrease in the
percentage of owner-occupied units in comparison to 2000, when 84 percent of occupied
units were owner-occupied and 16 percent were rented.
Vacancy
In general, a higher vacancy rate is considered necessary by housing experts to assure
adequate choice in the marketplace and to temper the rise in home prices. According to
                                                                                   April 2015                                       17

ABAG, a five-percent rental vacancy rate is considered necessary to permit ordinary rental
mobility. In a housing market with a lower vacancy rate, tenants will have difficulty
locating appropriate units, and strong market pressure will inflate rents. A two-percent
vacancy rate for owned housing is considered normal. Vacancy rates increased between
2000 and 2012. In 2000, the total vacancy rate was estimated at 1.9 percent, with the vacancy
rate for owner-occupied units at 1.1 percent and the vacancy rate for renter-occupied units
at 1.4 percent. However, vacancy rates in the City appear to have increased by 2012.
According to the Census (Table 13), overall vacancy in Hercules was measured at 3.8
percent. The homeowner vacancy rate was 4.4 percent while the rental vacancy rate was 2.0
percent.

Age and Condition of the Housing Stock
Generally, housing older than 30 years of age will require minor repairs and modernization
improvement. Housing units over 50 years of age are more likely to require major
rehabilitation such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs. Error! Reference
source not found. Table 14 depicts the statistics on the age of the housing units in Hercules.
Although Hercules’s is a relatively old city (incorporated in 1900), its housing stock is
relatively new, with the majority of homes having been built in the past 30 years. As shown
inError! Reference source not found. Table 14, the estimated breakdown of housing units
by age and occupancy status, less than two percent (1.7 percent) of all housing units in the
City were built more than 45 years ago. Most of the City’s housing stock was built within
the last 30 years or so.
Substandard housing conditions have not been a major issue for the City, although there
have been scattered cases that the City has addressed on an as-needed basis in response to
neighborhood complaints. Nonetheless, the City recognizes that its older subdivision areas
are beginning to show their age and will require reinvestment in the coming years. The
County of Contra Costa has several neighborhood improvement programs available to
Hercules residents such as the Neighborhood Preservation program which provides loans
to low and moderate-income persons to improve their homes by correcting health and
safety problems and improving livability. The County also has several housing programs
aimed at improving residential energy efficiency. However, funding is limited and income-
qualified residents are eligible on a first-come-first-serve basis.

In an effort to address the age and condition of the housing stock in Hercules, the Building
Division utilizes software that enables the City to receive, log, and track code enforcement
cases thoroughly.
The Building Department also assisted the former Affordable Housing program by
contributing staff time and services to the City’s Community Pride and Neighborhood
Cleanup Program, which alleviated blight by making volunteers and tools available to
residents to eliminate waste from their properties as well as improve the properties’ outside
appearance. From its inception in November 2008 through 2010, the Cleanup Program
assisted 527 homes in six neighborhood zones to collect and remove over 79 tons of waste.
The Building Department also monitors each neighborhood zone and communicates with
residents regarding any building code issues they may have. The housing stock in the City
of Hercules was generally constructed starting in the 1980s. It is relatively new and there are
no concentrations or deteriorated or dilapidated housing units. There is however a landslide
on HOA-owned land that has forced the evacuation/demolition of several homes on Carson
Street, and which may threaten several other homes in the future.
The Building Division has also performed community outreach on a regular basis and at
community events (such as the Cultural Festival, the Community Update, and the Farmer’s
Market). Through this outreach, the City has provided free educational and demonstration
materials about building construction, code enforcement, and rental inspections.
Household Income 
Household income is the most important, although not the only factor, affecting housing
opportunity because it determines a household's ability to purchase or rent housing and
balance housing costs with other necessities. Income levels can vary considerably among
households, affecting preferences for tenure, location, and housing type. While higher-
income households have more discretionary income to spend on housing, low and
moderate income households have a more limited choice in the housing they can afford.

According to the 2008-2012 ACS data, the median household income in Hercules was
$92,140, approximately 18 percent higher than the median income for Contra Costa County.
During 2008-2012, it is estimated that close to 60 percent of the households in Hercules were
earning over $75,000 with the largest proportion of households (25 percent) earning between
$100,000 and $149,999 annually. However, nearly 23 percent were earning less than $50,000
annually. The 2008-2012 estimates show that the median household income in the City
increased to $92,140 from a median of $75,196 in 2000. This could indicate that as the cost of
housing in the East Bay area continued to rise since 2000, households with higher incomes
were moving into a community which historically had more lower income households (and
therefore, lower cost housing). The City of Hercules continues to provide low income
housing options through affordable housing development such as the Victoria Green
apartments and Samara Terrace. Figure 2 shows that Hercules had a higher median
household income than neighboring jurisdictions and the County as a whole. While El
Cerrito, Martinez and Pinole had median incomes similar to that of the County, San Pablo’s
median income was significantly lower than the neighboring jurisdictions.

For purposes of determining eligibility for housing assistance, the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) has established the following income groups
based on the Area Median Income (AMI) of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA):
        Extremely Low Income: 0-30% AMI
        Very Low Income: 31-50% AMI
        Low Income: 51-80% AMI
        Moderate Income: 81-120% AMI
        Above Moderate Income: >120% AMI
Collectively, households with extremely low, very low, and low incomes are referred to as
lower income households.
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data provides special Census
tabulations (developed for HUD) and calculates household income adjusted for family size
and tenure. Table 16 presents household income by tenure based on the 2007-2011 CHAS
data. According to the CHAS data, 24 percent of the City’s households could be classified as
having lower incomes and 76 percent had moderate or above moderate incomes between
2007 and 2011. Lower income households were disproportionately renters. Over half of
renter households were classified as having lower incomes compared with only 17 percent
of owner households.

Housing Market  
Housing affordability is a major consideration in providing suitable housing. The cost of
housing itself is not a problem, unless households in the area cannot find adequately sized
units at an affordable price. Affordability is defined as paying 30 percent or less of gross
monthly household income on housing costs, based on both State and federal standards.
An adequate supply of affordable housing, including rental and owned housing, is essential
to satisfying the housing needs of all economic segments of Hercules’s existing and
projected population. When housing affordability erodes, many residents are affected.
Those on fixed incomes are not able to keep up with rising rents; local employees move
farther away from their jobs in search of affordable housing in other communities; and
many households postpone home improvements and new investments, and/or devote an
increasing proportion of their monthly budget to meeting housing costs.
A lack of affordable housing also impacts local services and the local economy as public
agencies and employers experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified
employees due to the lack of affordable housing in the local area.
Rental Housing
At the writing of this report, there were no apartment units listed for rent on craigslist.com
or various other rental websites. This is likely due to the fact that a majority of rental units in
the City are homes, condominiums, and townhomes. Smaller and therefore more affordable
apartments are difficult to find in the City because there are so few of them. The City has
two apartment complexes that are not age-restricted: the Willow Glen Apartments and
Victoria Green. The Willow Glen Apartments complex is a development consisting of 84
two-bed, two-bath units (with rents of $1,150 as of November 2014). The Victoria Green
complex has 132 units, including one-bedroom/one-bath (with rents ranging from $613 to
$964), two-bedroom/one-bath (with rents ranging from $831 to $1344), and three-
bedroom/two-bath units (with rents ranging from $850 to $1,700). As of the writing of this
report, both developments indicated there were no vacancies and waitlists for units were
closed.

According to MyApartmentMap.com the average price of a studio apartment in Hercules is
$975. A one-bedroom apartment has an average list price of $1,225. On average, a two-
bedroom rental will cost you $1,737 and a three-bedroom apartment is $2,200. These
averages were generated using 30 applicable apartment listings that were posted on
MyApartmentMap.com throughout the months of October and November 2014 in Hercules.
The City also has three housing developments that are age-restricted for seniors, two
affordable projects and one market-rate project.                                 The 60-unit affordable housing
development for seniors (The Arbors) was completed in 1999, and is located adjacent to the
Civic Center. Managed by Hercules Senior Housing Associates, a subsidiary of Bridge
Housing Corporation, the development provides housing at affordable rent levels for low-
and very-low-income seniors. Samara Terrace provides 51 units of affordable housing for
seniors. Sycamore Hills by the Bay provides 97 market rate rental units for seniors.

For-Sale Housing
As in the rest of the Bay Area and California in general, home prices in Hercules were at
historic highs in 2005 and 2006 and have rapidly decreased as a result of the collapse of the
lending market. Between 2012 and 2013, home prices in Hercules increased by 22 percent,
although still below the regional price appreciation of 33 percent. Between 2013 and 2014,
however, prices were leveling off. Table 18 compares the changes in median home sale
prices from 2013 to 2014 in Hercules and neighboring jurisdictions as well as Contra Costa
                                                                           April 2015                        23

Foreclosures
With “creative” financing (e.g., zero down, interest only, adjustable loans) and predatory
lending practices (e.g., aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization) many
households nationwide purchased homes that were beyond their financial means during the
peak of the real estate market (2005 to 2006). Under the assumptions that refinancing to
lower interest rates would always be an option and home prices would continue to rise at
double-digit rates, many households were unprepared for the hikes in interest rates,
expiration of short-term fixed rates, and decline in prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced
with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the
worth of the homes, foreclosure was the only option available to many households.
In the third quarter of 2014 there were 571 Notices of Default (NOD) filed in Contra Costa
County. A NOD is the first step in the foreclosure process. NOD decreased by 20 percent
compared with 2013. These levels are significantly less that the foreclosures seen during the
last quarter of 2009 (3,501). According to DataQuick, lending institutions initiated formal
foreclosure proceedings on the lowest number of California homes in more than eight years,
the result of a recovering real estate market and the dwindling pool of toxic home loans
made in 2006 and 2007.
A valuable resource for Hercules residents is the Contra Costa Home Equity Preservation
Alliance (HEPA), a regional collaborative offering families facing foreclosure and related
eviction issues a single point of contact and coordinated case management. HEPA services
include foreclosure seminars and workshops, foreclosure and default counseling, and legal
advice and representation.

Housing Affordability 
Housing affordability can be estimated by comparing the affordable housing cost of owning
or renting a home in the City with the maximum affordable housing cost for households at
different income levels. Together, this information can show who can afford what size and
type of housing and which households are more likely to experience overpayment and
overcrowding. Table 19 shows the affordable housing cost guidelines are based on the
median income calculated by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) income limits.

Note: Affordability levels should be adjusted for households size.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal
housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine
the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of their
respective income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less by
comparison than those at the upper end. The maximum affordable home and rental prices
for residents of Contra Costa County are shown in Table 20.
Table 20 shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each month
without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can be compared to current
housing asking prices (Table 18) and market rental rates (Table 17) to determine what types
of housing opportunities a household can afford.

Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income households earn up to 30 percent of the AMI, potentially between
$19,650 and $30,300 a year in 2014, up to a household size of five. Based on the calculations
in Table 20, a four-person, extremely low income households can afford monthly rent of
$465 or a home priced at $62,373. Home prices in Table 18 and rental prices in Table 17 show
that no extremely low income households would be able to afford housing in Hercules.
Very Low Income Households
Households in the very low income group earn between 30 and 50 percent of the AMI and
can earn up to $50,500 (up to a household size of five) as of 2014. A very low income four-
person household can potentially afford to spend up to $1,169 per month on housing costs.
Once utilities, taxes, and insurance are accounted for, this household can spend $933 on rent
or purchase a home priced at $149,416. Based on these numbers, rental and for-sale housing
are out of reach for very low income households.
Low Income Households
Low income households earn between 50 and 80 percent of the AMI, earning up to $73,050
(up to a household size of five). A four-person low income household can potentially afford
a monthly rent of $1,454 and a home purchase of $246,466. Low income households can
afford smaller rental housing in Hercules but will be unable to afford to purchase a home,
except perhaps for older condominium units. Ideally, a four-person household needs a two-
or three-bedroom housing unit, which according to rents presented in Table 17, is just out of
their price range. Apartment or condominium units for rent may be a more affordable
option for low income households’ however, apartments in Hercules are limited in supply
and at the time this data was compiled, there were no apartment units available for rent.
The lack of adequately sized affordable apartments may limit housing choice for low
income households.
Moderate Income Households
Moderate income households earn 80 to 120 percent of AMI, potentially up to $121,200
annually for up to a household size of five. They can afford a monthly rent of up to $2,762
which allows them to comfortably secure rental housing in Hercules. An affordable home
price for a moderate income four-person household (according to Table 20) is $541,108. The
current economy is ideal for moderate income households to enter the housing market in
Hercules.
Housing Problems  
Overcrowding
In response to a mismatch between household income and housing costs in a community,
some households may not be able to buy or rent housing that provides a reasonable level of
privacy and space. Residents may accept smaller-sized housing or double up with other
                                                                            April 2015                      27

families to afford the housing costs. The federal government generally defines
overcrowding as a situation where a household has more members than habitable rooms in
a unit. An overcrowded household is defined as one with more than one person per room,
excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. Severely overcrowded households
are households with more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding contributes to
increases in traffic within a neighborhood, accelerates deterioration of homes and
infrastructure, can overburden utilities and services such as sewers, and results in a
shortage of onsite parking.
Table 21 provides data on overcrowding from the 2008-2012 ACS. Between 2008 and 2012,
overcrowding occurred in just more than one percent of all occupied housing units in
Hercules. Severe overcrowding (more than 1.5 persons per room) was rare, occurring in
only 0.1 percent of all units. The prevalence of overcrowding in Hercules was significantly
lower compared with the County. While 1.2 percent of all units in the City were
overcrowded, 4.2 percent of units in the County experienced overcrowding.

Overpayment (Cost Burden)
State and federal standards specify that households spending more than 30 percent of gross
annual income on housing are overpaying for housing, also referred to as experiencing
housing cost burden. Federal and state agencies use overpayment indicators to determine
the extent and level of funding and support that should be allocated to a community.
Housing cost burdens occur when housing costs increase faster than household income.
When a household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs, it has less
disposable income for other necessities such as health care. In the event of unexpected
circumstances such as loss of employment and health problems, lower income households
with a burdensome housing cost are more likely to become homeless. Homeowners with a
housing cost burden have the option of selling the homes and become renters. Renters, on
the other hand, are vulnerable and subject to constant changes in the housing market.
Table 22 demonstrates the extent of cost burden (overpaying for housing costs) by income.
Overall, close to half (48.3 percent) of all Hercules households experienced some level of
cost burden. In general, renters experienced cost burden (53 percent) more than
homeowners (47.1 percent), and households with lower incomes (extremely, very low, and
low incomes) experienced cost burden at a higher proportion than upper income
households.

Special Needs Populations 
In addition to the general housing needs of the population, cities and counties must plan for
the special housing needs of certain groups who have more difficulty in finding decent,
affordable housing due to their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related
to one's income earning potential, family characteristics, the presence of physical or mental
disabilities, or age-related health issues. As a result, certain groups typically earn lower
incomes and have higher rates of overpayment for housing, or they live in overcrowded
residences. State law [65583(a)(6)] requires that several populations with special housing
needs be addressed: people who are homeless; seniors; people with disabilities; large
families; female-headed households; and farm worker households. For these groups, the
Housing Element should take into account any local factors that create an extraordinary
need for housing, and should quantify those needs as best possible. Table 23 summarizes
the special needs populations in Hercules and Table 24 provides an inventory of residential
care facilities serving the special needs populations.

 Seniors
 Senior households can be defined in part by the age distribution and demographic
 projections of the population. As shown in Table 3, 10.5 percent (2,530 persons) of
 Hercules’s population in 2010 was 65 years of age or older. This represents a noticeable
 increase in the senior population since 2000, when seven percent of the population was 65 or
 over.
  Many senior-headed households have special needs due to their relatively low incomes,
 disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs. Specifically, many people aged 65 years
 and older live alone and may have difficulty maintaining their homes, are usually retired
 and living on a limited income, and are more likely to have high health care costs and rely
 on public transportation, especially those with disabilities. The limited income of many

elderly persons often makes it difficult for them to find affordable housing and the elderly
usually spend a higher percentage of their income for food, housing, medical care, and
personal care than non-elderly families. Other senior housing needs include providing
options for active seniors, such as housing with space for arts and hobbies and easy access to
recreational programs.
The California Community Care Licensing Division reports that there are five residential
care facilities for the elderly in Hercules as well as five adult residential care facilities.
Together these facilities provide 58 beds for residents.
The City actively supported the development of new housing for lower income seniors,
providing assistance for development of The Arbors, a 60-unit development adjacent to the
Civic Center that was developed by Bridge Housing Corporation for low and very low
income seniors. The Samara Terrace Senior Apartments project was built in partnership
with Eden Housing and KB Homes and provides 51 units of low income senior housing.
Sycamore by the Bay provides 97 senior rental units as well. The Hercules Senior Center also
serves as an excellent resource for seniors. The Senior Center has many different services
available aimed at assisting seniors to continue to remain independent and safe in their own
homes. Available programs include various social and recreation activities, special events,
travel programs, legal assistance, food distributions, medical, and social services.
Persons with Disabilities (including Developmental Disabilities)
The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) identifies persons as having a
disability as those who exhibit difficulty with specific functions and may, in the absence of
accommodation, have a disability. According to the ACS, disability exists where this
interaction results in limitations of activities and restrictions to full participation at school, at
work, at home, or in the community. For example, disability may exist where a person is
limited in his or her ability to work due to job discrimination against persons with specific
health conditions.
Both mentally and physically disabled residents face housing access and safety challenges.
Disabled people, in most cases, are of limited incomes and often receive Social Security
income only. As such, the majority of their monthly income is often devoted to housing
costs. In addition, disabled persons may face difficulty finding accessible housing (housing
that is made accessible to people with disabilities through the positioning of appliances and
fixtures, the heights of installations and cabinets, layout of unit to facilitate wheelchair
movement, etc.) because of the limited number of such units. A small segment of Hercules
residents have disabilities that prevent them from working, restrict their mobility, or make it
difficult to care for themselves. As reflected in Table 25, seven percent of the population
reported a disability from 2008 to 2012. Senior residents had the highest incidence of
disability (33 percent).
                                                                             April 2015                      31

Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind in regard to housing for people with
disabilities is that there is a wide range of different disabilities, and different people with the
same ‘disability’ may have very different levels of functioning which affect their housing
needs and choices. People with disabilities include parents who are raising families,
teenagers who are members of large families, seniors living with their spouses or children,
and young people who desire to live on their own.
Local housing policies should promote barrier-free design in all housing so that people with
disabilities have a similar range of housing choice as people without disabilities. The City
has implemented, and continues to implement, public access improvements in compliance
with the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and encourages new
developments to provide units that are accessible to people with disabilities. In accordance
with State laws, all new multi-family developments must provide barrier-free access to all
units in buildings with elevators, or at a minimum to all ground floor units in buildings
without elevators. Accessibility modifications are also encouraged in all developments that
serve seniors.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities 
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. The Census does not record developmental
disabilities. The California State Council on Developmental Disabilities estimates that
nationwide 1.8 percent of the population meet the federal definition of a developmental
disability. This could potentially equate to 433 persons in the City of Hercules with
developmental disabilities, based on the 2010 Census population.
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a "developmental disability"
means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can
be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This
term also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or
to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but
does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in

supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their
families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and
two community-based facilities. The Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB) is one of 21
regional centers in California that provides point of entry to services for people with
developmental disabilities, including residents in Hercules. The center is a private, non-
profit community agency that contracts with local service providers to offer a wide range of
services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. According to
RCEB, an estimated 153 clients served by the Regional Center are residents of Hercules.
The State of California Community Care Licensing Division indicates that there are a range
of facilities that serve the City’s special needs groups (Table 26).

Adult residential facilities offer 24 hour non-medical care for adults, ages 18 to 59 years old,
who are unable to provide for their daily needs due to physical or mental disabilities.
Group homes, small residential facilities that serve children or adults with chronic
disabilities, also provide 24 hour care by trained professionals.
Large Households
Large households, defined in State Housing Element law as households with five or more
persons, have special housing needs. Large households tend to have difficulty purchasing
housing because large housing units are rarely affordable and rental units with three or
more bedrooms are not common.
Data from the 2010 Census indicated that 1,247 households in Hercules (15 percent of all
households) had five or more people. Most of the large households were owner-households
                                                                                 April 2015                               33

(78 percent). For those large families who are renters, the supply of rental housing with
adequate space to accommodate them is limited.
Single Parent and Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of the greater
need for day care, health care, and other services. In particular, female-headed households
with children tend to have lower incomes and a greater need for affordable housing and
accessible daycare and other supportive services. The relatively low incomes earned by
female-headed households, combined with the increased need for supportive services,
severely limit the housing options available to them. Based on Census data, families with
females as heads of households increased substantially from four percent (199 households)
in 1990 to 29 percent in 2010 (Table 23). Female-headed households have increased as a
proportion of the population as a result of a higher percentage of women in the workforce, a
higher divorce rate, and an increase in the number of women choosing to raise a family
without a spouse present. According to the 2010 Census, there were 2,384 female-headed
households in Hercules (representing 29 percent of all households). Of these, 606 had their
own under-18 children living with them (eight percent of all family households).
 The 2008-2012 ACS data estimated that female-headed households had median incomes
significantly below the median income for the City. While the median income between 2008
and 2012 was $78,187, female headed households earned a median income of $46,689.
Hercules responds to the needs of female-headed households through its program of
providing daycare facilities at all elementary schools in the City.
Farm Workers
There is no demand for farm worker housing in Hercules since there are no working farms
in the City and Hercules is located in an urbanized portion of West Contra Costa County.
The 2008-2012 ACS reported only 10 residents working in farming, fishing, and forestry
occupations.
Homeless Families and Individuals
Demand for emergency and transitional shelter in Hercules is difficult to determine, given
the episodic nature of homelessness. Generally, episodes of homelessness among families
or individuals can occur as a single event or periodically. Each year, Contra Costa County’s
Continuum of Care conducts a Point in Time (PIT) Count to provide an estimate of the
number of homeless individuals and families and their housing needs. PIT counts are
required by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and
are important for demonstrating issues of homelessness in the community and across the
country. In 2013, the PIT Count identified 18 unsheltered homeless individuals in the City of
Hercules.
Homeless families and individuals have perhaps the most immediate housing need of any
group. They also have one of the most difficult sets of housing needs to meet, due to both
the diversity and complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness, and to community
opposition to the siting of facilities that serve homeless clients. Homelessness in Hercules, as

in other communities, results from a combination of factors, including loss of employment,
inability to find a job due to lack of skills, and high housing costs in comparison to incomes.
For some, homelessness may also be the result of chronic health problems, physical
disabilities, mental health disabilities, or substance abuse
In response to the identified needs related to homelessness, the Contra Costa County
Continuum of Care Plan identifies strategic priorities and action steps to be taken in the
areas of: Employment, Assets and Income; Outreach and Health Services; Support Services;
Housing and Prevention; and Administration, Coordination and Funding. While no
homeless facilities are located in the City, homeless and transitional housing service
requests are referred to the Greater Richmond Interfaith Program (GRIP) and will be
allowed in the P/RD zoning district as required by State law.
Assisted Housing and At­Risk Status  
The Housing Authority of Contra Costa County (HACC) Housing Choice Voucher Program
(HCV, formerly known as Section 8) serves Hercules and provides rent subsidies for very
low-income households. The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides rental subsidies to
very low-income families that spend more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing
costs. Approximately 240 Hercules households receive voucher assistance as of 2014.
In November of 2008, HACC opened the HCV waiting list for the first time since 2001. The
list closed five days later after receiving 38,000 applications. The overwhelming majority of
applications were electronic submissions. The list was reduced to 6,000 families by using a
lottery. As of 2014 the HCV waitlist is closed. HACCC also administers several special
programs including Family Self‐Sufficiency, ShelterPlusCare, the Disaster Housing
Assistance Program, and Project Coming Home.
Housing that receives governmental assistance is often a significant source of affordable
housing in most communities. Because of its significance, this section identifies publicly
assisted rental housing in Hercules, evaluates the potential risk of such housing to convert
to market rate during a ten-year planning period (2015 to 2025) pursuant to State law, and
analyzes the options and associated costs to preserving the at-risk units, if any. This
inventory includes all affordable rental housing units deed-restricted for low income uses.
The City of Hercules has three affordable rental housing developments with a total of 244
units made affordable with subsidy contracts and deed restrictions (Table 27). The earliest
an affordable housing development will lose its affordability covenant in Hercules is 2053.
There are currently no units that are at risk of losing their affordability and converting to
market-rate housing within the next ten years.

3  Housing Constraints  
Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are posed by market,
governmental, infrastructure, and environmental factors, among others. These constraints
may increase the cost of housing, or may render residential construction economically
infeasible for developers. Housing production constraints can also significantly impact
households with low and moderate incomes and special needs.
Market Constraints 
Land Costs
The price of housing has risen since the late seventies at a much faster rate than household
income, driven by the imbalance between housing demand in the region, and housing
supply. In addition to land costs, contributing factors include materials, labor, financing,
fees and associated development requirements, sales commissions, and profits.
Land costs have represented an increasing proportion of the overall costs of a new home
over the past twenty years, especially in the Bay Area. It is generally the case that high land
costs represent the overriding factor affecting the affordability of residential development in
California cities. Land prices also vary depending on zoning (number of units allowed) and
availability of improvements. Few properties in Hercules are listed for sale. A recent 8,000-
square-foot R-2 property in Victoria Crescent was listed for sale at approximately an
equivalent price of $43,600 per acre. In August 2014, a 17-acre PC-R property for 144 homes
was sold for $8 million.
The cost to clear an acre of land for redevelopment significantly increases the cost of
development, as do the local, state, and federal policies relating to relocation and
replacement of low income housing. Depending on the existing improvements that must be
removed to redevelop a site, the total cost to acquire a parcel, relocate occupants, and
possibly mitigate hazardous materials can be quite expensive. This can pose a problem for
development if Hercules rents or sales prices cannot support the high cost of development.

Construction Costs
Construction costs are the largest component of total cost of a single-family detached unit,
accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the finished sale price. According to the International
Code Council Building Valuation data, construction costs average to about $143 per square
foot as of August 2014. According to the Home Builders Association of Northern
California1, construction costs for multi-family attached units typically cost 25 to 30 percent
more (on a per square foot basis) than a comparable two-story detached single-family home.
Density bonuses for seniors and affordable housing can help offset this per-unit cost
premium for multi-family developments. A reduction in amenities and quality of building
materials could result in lower costs and sale prices; however, high quality design and
sufficient tenant amenities are necessary to maintain minimum health and safety standards.
Availability of Financing
Development Financing
Financing is available from a variety of sources including financing institutions, insurance
companies, and pension plans (such as CalPERS). The decline in the U.S. economy
beginning in 2008 and the national credit crisis, however, limited the amount of financing
available to potential developers, and difficulties with financing will likely continue, despite
low interest rates.
With the high costs of housing development, packaging financing for affordable housing is
increasingly challenging. Typically, multiple sources are required to finance an affordable
housing project. Typical sources of funding for affordable housing include:
        A first mortgage from a lending institution
        Low Income Housing Tax Credits and/or tax exempt mortgage bonds
        Community Development Block Grant funds
        HOME Investment Partnership funds
        California Housing Finance Agency
Depending on the type of financing used (tax credits, bonds, federal funds, etc.), other
requirements, such as the inclusion of certain accessibility accommodations and the use of
prevailing wage versus Davis-Bacon2 wage, can affect development costs significantly.
Mortgage Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of the
applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases, improvements, and
1   Letter from Home Builders Association of Northern California dated April 13, 2009.
2   The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 is a federal law which established the requirement for paying prevailing wages
    on public works projects. All federal government construction contracts and most contracts for federally
    assisted construction over $2,000, must include provisions for paying workers on-site no less than the locally
    prevailing wages and benefits paid on similar projects.
                                                                               April 2015                      37

refinancing, whether financed at market rate or with federal government assistance.
Mortgage assistance from local governments is not covered by HMDA.
Home Purchase and Improvements: Table 28 summarizes the disposition of loan
applications submitted to lending institutions in 2013 in the City of Hercules. These include
applications for home purchase loans, refinance loans, and home improvement loans. Loan
applications that were approved, originated3, approved but not accepted by the applicant,
or denied are included. The “other” category of applications includes those that were
withdrawn by the applicants or determined to be incomplete by the lending institutions.
In 2013, a total of 382 Hercules households applied for conventional loans to purchase
homes. The overall loan origination rate was 66 percent, and 15.2 percent of the applications
were denied. Government-backed loan programs, which include FHA/VA loans, received
149 applications for home purchase in Hercules. To be eligible for such loans, applicants
must meet certain employment, income, and credit criteria and FHA has a lending limit of
$625,500 for a single unit in Contra Costa County. Many homes came within the FHA/VA
cap, and Hercules households were able to take advantage of these programs. FHA/VA
loans had a 56.4 percent origination rate.
Home improvement loans accounted for only 2.3 percent of all applications in 2013. Home
improvement loans had the highest denial rate, with more than one third (36.5 percent) of
the loan applications being denied. Home improvement loans are usually second loans; the
debt-to-income ratio may be too high for some homeowners to qualify for additional
financing.
Refinancing: A lot of households in California purchased homes between 2000 and 2007
utilizing creative financing mechanisms such as zero down, interest-only, adjustable-rate,
and balloon-payment mortgages. Many of these households began to face the expiration of
the favorable loan terms and sought refinancing options by 2008. While the overall number
of refinancing has decreased in recent years, in 2013, refinancing applications still
represented the majority of (three fourths) of the total home loan applications that were
submitted for Hercules housing units. Specifically, 1,705 applications for refinancing were
filed in that year. For those application, more than half (57.6 percent) resulted in loans, and
an additional 6.2 percent of the applications were approved but not accepted by the
applicants. The denial rate was 17.9 percent. The remaining 11.5 percent of applications
were either withdrawn or closed because of incompleteness.
3   An originated loan is one that is approved by the lender and accepted by the applicant.

  Governmental Constraints  
  Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in
  particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement
  requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, among other issues may
  constrain the maintenance, development, and improvement of housing.
  Hercules’s land use controls, design guidelines, codes and enforcement, required site
  improvements, fees and permit processing procedures have been developed, in part, to
  correct development problems that have become evident over time.
  Land Use Controls
  The City of Hercules regulates the use of land within the City limits through the General
  Plan, the Regulating Code for the Central Hercules Plan (within the old redevelopment area
  plan), the Waterfront District Master Plan, and the Zoning Ordinance. Hercules’s Land Use
  Element of the General Plan was adopted in 1998 and along with the Zoning Ordinance,
  provides a wide range of housing types and densities, ranging from one unit per acre to 75
  units per acre. Table 29 lists the residential land use categories included in the Land Use
  Element of the City’s General Plan.
                                                                                       April 2015                               39

Planned Development Districts
The Hercules Zoning Ordinance provides for a Planned Commercial Residential (PC-R)
District to accommodate both residential and commercial uses in a well-planned, mixed-use
development, as well as to provide an opportunity for an integrated mixture of residential
and commercial employment-generating uses within the same structure or site. The PC-R
district allows for lower cost live-work opportunities for start-up commercial enterprises
and other smaller scale point-of-sale enterprises that are compatible with the residential and
commercial uses within the building or site. It also provides for upper floor residential over
ground floor commercial uses and encourages mixed-use development that could minimize
vehicle use. Applications for expanding and new development in the PC-R zone must be
reviewed by the Community Development Director.
‘Measure J’ Growth Management Program
Measure J Sales Tax Expenditure Plan, the voter-approved growth management measure in
Contra Costa County, encourages a stronger link between local/sub-regional land use
decision-making and local/sub-regional transportation improvements. The measure
requires that each jurisdiction adopt, or maintain in place, a development mitigation
program to ensure that new growth is paying its share of the costs associated with that
growth. Furthermore, each jurisdiction must comply with either a new countywide,
mutually agreed upon, voter-approved urban limit line (ULL), or the local jurisdiction’s
voters must approve the jurisdiction’s own ULL.
While implementation of such growth management measures could create a potential
constraint on housing development, Measure J places a strong emphasis on the creation of
housing opportunities for all income levels and on the responsibilities of local jurisdictions
to meet regional fair-share housing requirements.
One of the criteria considered by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (which
monitors Measure J compliance and coordinates transportation project funding under
Measure J) is compliance of a local jurisdiction’s Housing Element with State requirements.
Jurisdictions that do not have a Housing Element in compliance with State requirements
risk losing their funding for transportation improvements under the Measure J program.
Measure J does not, therefore, present a constraint to housing development. Rather, it acts as

a stimulus to local jurisdictions to meet their fair-share housing requirements for all income
levels, in accordance with State laws. Furthermore, the City of Hercules has adequate sites
within the ULL to accommodate its share of regional housing needs.
Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density and scale of residential development primarily
through the Zoning Ordinance. In general, the City’s zoning regulations are designed to
balance the goal of providing housing opportunities for all income groups, while protecting
the health and safety of residents and preserving the character of existing neighborhoods.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance allows residential uses in the following districts:
        Residential Single-Family Estate (RS-E): The RS-E district provides sites for homes
         on larger lots to be developed with custom built and individually designed homes
         with a gross density of one or two units per acre and a minimum parcel size of one-
         half acre.
        Residential Single Family Low Density (RS-L): The purpose of the RS-L district is
         to provide areas for single family housing on smaller lots that will generally be
         developed as part of a larger planned subdivision.
        Residential Multi-Family Low Density (RM-L): The RM-L district provides sites for
         low density multi-family housing such as townhouses, condominiums and
         apartments as well as single family housing that incorporated good design and
         amenities.
        Residential Multi-Family Medium Density (RM-M): The RM-M district provides
         for townhouses and condominiums, similar to the RM-L district, but at a medium
         density, as well as for apartments.
        Residential Multi-Family High Density (RM-H): The RM-H district is intended for
         high density multi-family housing, typically located near public transit centers,
         adequate streets, shopping centers or other high activity areas.
        Mobile Home Park District (P-M-H): The purpose of the P-M-H district reserves
         appropriately located areas for mobile home parks and provides for reasonable
         densities consistent with sound standards of public health and safety.
        Industrial Residential Mixed-Use District (I-R): The I-R district provides for
         integrated mixture of residential space and workspaces in the same structure. The
         residential space, generally located above the workspace such as a loft, is to provide
         a living area for persons employed in the work space.
        Planned Commercial Residential Mixed-Use District (PC-R): The PC-R district
         accommodates both residential and commercial uses in a well planned, mixed use
         development.
        New Town Center District (NTC): The NTC district accommodates transit-oriented
         development in relatively dense pattern of buildings in the center of town with a mix
         of residential, commercial, office, and public and quasi-public uses.
                                                                              April 2015                      41

       Historic Town Center District (HTC): The HTC district is intended to provide a
        wide range of office and administrative uses along with supporting retail
        commercial uses while retaining the historic character of the area. It also allows for
        multi-family residential uses up to 17 units per acre with no more than 40 units to be
        developed within the district.
Development standards specific to each zone district are designed to protect and promote
the health, safety and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the
General Plan. These standards serve to preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods. Specific residential development standards associated with the key districts
with residential potential are summarized Table 30. The City’s development standards were
established to implement the types of uses and intensities envisioned. These standards do
not constrain housing development in the City.

Prior to the economic downturn, the City had approved several high-density residential and
mixed-use development projects and had several pending applications in various specific
plan areas. These projects achieved densities ranging from 33 to 45 units per acre,
representing 83 percent to 113 percent of the maximum density allowed in these areas.
These projects demonstrated that the City’s development standards are reasonable and
facilitate the development of projects at their allowable densities.

Parking Requirements
Parking requirements for residential uses in Hercules are summarized in Table 31. Apart
from the standard for units with one bedroom or none, these requirements are lower than
the parking standards for density bonus eligible projects as established by State law and
therefore, do not constrain the production of housing. (The City is amending its Zoning
Ordinance to comply with the State Density Bonus law parking requirements. Adoption of
the Zoning Ordinance amendments is anticipated to occur in January 2015.) Furthermore,
parking standards can be reduced, on a case-by-case basis, e.g., if the project is located
within a transit-oriented or mixed-use development.

Specific/Area Plans
The City of Hercules has adopted several specific and area plans. In 2000 the City adopted
the Waterfront District Master Plan (WDMP) for the area that was previously the Hercules
Powder Company. The Central Hercules Plan was adopted in 2001, the New Town Center
District was adopted in 2009, and the Initial Planned Development Plan and zoning
regulations & development standards for Sycamore Crossing were adopted in 2010.
The City has taken significant steps towards ensuring that its development standards
support the development of a variety of housing types, including affordable housing,
through the development of a ‘Regulating Code’ for the Central Hercules Plan area, where
the majority of new development is taking place in the City. The Regulating Code was
further refined through the Waterfront District Master Plan, which applies to the largest
development area in Hercules, and through the Initial Planned Development Plan process
(subsequently the zoning regulations and development standards) for Sycamore Crossing.
The Central Hercules Plan Regulating Code and the Waterfront District Master plan
establish development standards based on traditional urban design conventions and
supersede the City’s Zoning Ordinance in the Central Plan and Waterfront areas. The
Regulating Code and District Plan establish a wider range of approved and conditional uses
(for example, all residential uses—single-family and multi-family—are considered
approved/permitted uses in all districts) and development standards are established based

upon Street Type rather than use type. The Regulating Code and District Plan essentially
regulate the location, form, and bulk of buildings in relation to streets and public spaces.

Hercules Plan Area.

Table 33 summarizes a sampling of the similarly form-based regulations of the Waterfront
District Master Plan that pertain to five specific zones within the Waterfront district. Both
the Regulating Code and the Waterfront District Master Plan also provide for streamlined
development review processes, with greater emphasis on administrative review and
approval authority for those developments that meet the requirements set forth in the Code
and the Master Plan, with appeal procedures for review by the Town Architect, Planning
Commission, and City Council.

New Town Center District
The New Town Center (NTC) district was adopted in 2009 to foster a transit-oriented town
center consisting of a dense pattern of building in the center of town and a mix of
residential, commercial, office and public and quasi-public uses. The NTC intends to create
an interconnected network of pedestrian-oriented streets, blocks, and publicly accessible
open spaces to encourage development that promotes walking, biking and transit use. All
new and expanded development in the NTC zone is subject to design review, planned
development plans, and must be approved by the Community Development Director
and/or the Planning Commission. Development in the NTC is held to a higher standard
regarding transit accessibility, pedestrian access, landscaping, recreation, and overall
unified development. The NTC consists of approximately 35 acres within central Hercules
and allows between 30 to 75 dwelling units per acre, with a midrange of 60 dwelling units
per acre. The 35 acres consist of seven parcels located at a visible, regionally prominent,
heavily traveled crossroads along the I-80 and SR 4 interchange. Table 34 shows the
development standards for the New Town Center District. Additional standards such as lot
sizes, coverage, and parking are to be determined as approved Planned Development Plans.

New Pacific Properties Specific Plan Area
The New Pacific Properties Specific Plan Area was adopted in 2000 and is intended to
promote redevelopment of the former Pacific Refinery site into a new, predominately
residential neighborhood and guide residential and commercial development within this
community. The goal was to create a high quality environment, establish a strong tax base,
and instill new vitality into a blighted area. This Specific Plan identifies nine separate zones
that correspond to the various planning areas within the New Pacific Properties Specific
Plan area as detailed in Table 35. All residential planning areas are zones for single-family
detached development, except for P8 which is zoned for multi-family attached
development. Table 35 also shows the main development standards for designations within
the New Pacific Properties Specific Plan Zones.

Overlay Zones
(H) Historic Overlay District
The purpose of the (H) Historical Overlay District is to identify the areas and buildings of
the City that possess a unique historical character and to preserve, enhance, promote, and
expand the cultural and historical identities, characters, and environments of these areas
and buildings. The Historic Overlay District includes land designated (HTC) Historic Town
Center by the General Plan, lands presently zoned Historical Overlay District, and
additional lands that may be zones for the overlay district. New areas added to the H
District must be approved by the City Council. Alterations to buildings within the H District
are subject to review by the Historical Architectural Review Board (which is the Planning
Commission as well).
(F) Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay District
The purpose of the (F) Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay District is to promote health,
safety, and welfare and to minimize public and private loss as a result of flood hazards. The
Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay District is established by definition as the area of land
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the 100-year
flood plain as defined by Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Development in the F District
must meet general development standards as well as additional ones designated for
individual properties. For example, portions of the Refugio Creek basin west of San Pablo
Avenue are not suitable for development until flood control improvements are made to
eliminate flood hazards.
Refugio Creek Overlay District
The purposes of the Refugio Creek Overlay District are to establish a 50-foot setback
between development and the “top of bank” of the creek corridors of Refugio Creek and its
tributaries as transition areas between the flood prone riparian habitats and development.
The Overlay is also intended to preserve the wooded tree-lined character of the partially
constructed hiking/biking trail along Refugio Creek and protect wetland and riparian
communities from degradation due to development. The Overlay implements habitat
protection and flood mitigation measures associated with the General Plan Land Use
Element. All development in the Refugio Creek Overlay District is subject to additional
development regulations to ensure that the purposes of the Overlay are met.
Density Bonus
State law requires the provision of certain incentives for residential development projects
that set aside a certain portion of the units to be affordable to lower and moderate income
households. Under current State law, jurisdictions are required to provide density bonuses
and development incentives on a sliding scale, where the amount of density bonus and
number of incentives vary according to the amount of affordable housing units provided.
State law also establishes a limit on the maximum number of required parking spaces per
unit for projects that qualify for a density bonus. The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in
                                                                            April 2015                      49

Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
In 2006, the City of Hercules adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance that requires new
residential developments to include a minimum percentage of dwelling units that are
affordable to very low, low, and moderate income households. In residential developments,
ten percent of the dwelling units must be affordable, or a fee may be paid in lieu of
providing some or all of the required units. The specific unit and income mix in each
development was negotiated with the developer based upon the City’s housing needs and
the specific characteristics of each development (e.g., property size, location, etc.). The
inclusionary housing ordinance established rental and sales restrictions on inclusionary
units that are enforced by a recorded agreement between the City and the developer and
also between the City and buyers of the affordable units. The City requires deed restrictions
of 30 years for for-sale units, 20 years for rental units. With this process of negotiation, the
City is able to respond quickly to economic conditions and market trends, and offer
flexibility. This flexibility allows the City to work with the developers to ensure project
feasibility. Given the large number of housing units approved in recent years, the City’s
inclusionary housing ordinance has not constrained housing development.
Prior to adoption of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance the City commissioned an in-lieu
fee report that included criteria for developing the in-lieu fee schedule and calculating
prices. The criteria stipulates that fees should be sufficient to assist very low to moderate
income households obtain housing, have some current relativity to the housing market and
should not encourage developers to pay the fee rather than deliver units. Calculations for
new construction fees and affordable housing prices have market effects and flexibility built
into them in order to encourage construction of new units as well as new affordable units.
With the current economic conditions and the elimination of redevelopment agencies, the
City Council has suspended the Inclusionary Housing ordinance indefinitely. The City
continues to work with project applicants to achieve affordable housing through
negotiations/development agreements on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, the

         Inclusionary Housing Ordinance has only been suspended. Once the economy improves,
         the City will evaluate the feasibility and appropriateness of reinstating the ordinance.
         Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
         Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
         available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
         development of a variety of housing types for all economic segments of the population. This
         includes single-family homes, multi-family housing, second units, mobile homes, homeless
         shelters, and transitional housing, among others. Error! Reference source not found. Table
         37 below summarizes that various housing types permitted within the City’s zoning
         districts, including uses that were incorporated into the Zoning Ordinance by amendment
         in 2015.

Single-Family
Single-family dwellings are permitted with an administrative use permit in the RS-E and
RS-L zones.
Condominiums and Townhomes
Condominiums and townhomes are permitted with a CUP in the RM-L, RM-M, and RM-H
zones. They are permitted with an administrative use permit in the PC-R and NTC zone.
Multiple-Family
Multi-family dwellings are provided for in the RM-L, RM-M, and RM-H zones with a CUP
and in the PC-R and NTC zones with an administrative use permit.
Mobile Home Parks and Mobile/Manufactured Homes
Manufactured housing and mobile homes can be an affordable housing option for low and
moderate income households. According to the Census and ACS, there are no mobile homes
in Hercules. Hercules provides for mobile home parks within its P-M-H zone via a
Conditional Use Permit process.
Pursuant to State law, a mobile home built after June 15, 1976, certified under the National
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Act of 1974, and built on a permanent
foundation may be located in any residential zone where a conventional single-family
detached dwelling is permitted subject to the same restrictions on density and to the same
property development regulations, provided that the mobile home has received approval of
the Planning Director or Planning Commission and received a Certificate of Compatibility.
The City complies with State law by treating mobile/manufactured homes meeting these
requirements as regular single-family homes.
Second Dwelling Units
A “second residential unit” is defined as:
       A dwelling unit in addition to an existing residential unit, that provides complete
        independent living facilities for one or more persons;
       Includes permanent provisions for sleeping, living, eating, cooking and sanitation;
       Does not exceed 30 percent of the existing living area or 800 square feet, whichever is
        less.
In Hercules, second units are permitted in single-family zones, the RS-E and RS-L zones.
Group Homes/Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities licensed or supervised by a federal, state, or local health/welfare
agency provide 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons who are handicapped and in
need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of
daily living or for the protection of the individual in a family-like environment.

Pursuant to the State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (a.k.a. Lanterman
Act), small residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons shall be treated as a regular
residential use and permitted where residential uses are permitted. The Hercules Zoning
Ordinance was amended in February 2015 to be consistent with the Lanterman Act and
other applicable housing laws. The amendment deleted “group housing” (both small and
large facilities) as a Residential Use type and replaced it with “supportive housing”,
“transitional housing”, and “residential care facility” for six or fewer residents and for seven
or more residents. The new Residential Use types are permitted either by right with an
Administrative Use Permit or by approval of a Conditional Use Permit, and subject to other
similarly required processes (such as design review), depending on the use and zone (also
see discussion of Transitional/Supportive Housing below).
Live-Work Units
A live-work unit is an integrated housing unit and working space, occupied and utilized by
a single household in a structure, either single-family or multi-family, that has been
designed or structurally modified to accommodate joint residential occupancy and work
activity. Live-work units are permitted with an administrative use permit in the Industrial
Residential Mixed Use (I-R) and PC-R zones. Development regulations for live-work units
are different for each zone in which they are permitted. In the I-R zone, a live-work unit
must provide a minimum of 600 square feet of living area, including bathroom, kitchen, and
sleeping area. Residential space within a live-work unit cannot exceed 1,500 square feet
(unless specified in the Master Development Plan), and not more than 50 percent of the floor
area of each live-work unit can be devoted to living area. The PC-R zone only specifies that
a live-work unit have a minimum of 600 square feet of living area, including bathroom,
kitchen, and sleeping area.
Mixed-Use
Mixed-use projects combine both nonresidential and residential uses on the same site.
Mixed-use development can help reduce the effects of housing cost burden by increasing
density and offering opportunities for reduced vehicular trips by walking, bicycling, or
taking public transportation. In Hercules, the IR zone is intended to provide residential
space located above workspaces to combine living and work spaces for residents. However,
the IR zones only permits live-work units and caretaker and manager housing as residential
uses. The PC-R district is also intended to accommodate residential and commercial uses
and integrate them within the same structure or site. The PC-R zone provides for upper
floor residential with ground floor commercial. Residential uses including caretaker,
manager, employee housing, daycare, live-work units, multi-family dwellings, townhouses,
condominiums, and planned unit development are all permitted with an administrative use
permit.
Emergency Shelters
State law requires that local jurisdictions strengthen provisions for addressing the housing
needs of the homeless, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency
shelters are allowed as a permitted use without discretionary approval. The statute permits
the City to apply limited conditions to the approval of ministerial permits for emergency
                                                                           April 2015                      53

shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-
round shelter and accommodate the City’s share of regional unsheltered homeless
population. Section 50801(e) of the California Health and Safety Code defines emergency
shelters as housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to
occupancy of six months or fewer by a homeless person.
Pursuant to State law, the City amended its Zoning Ordinance in February 2015, permitting
homeless shelters by right without a discretionary approval process within the Planned
Office– Research & Development Zone. Properties in this zone are located in the western
portion of the City, along transportation corridors (Freeway 80, John Muir Parkway, and
San Pablo Avenue), providing easy access to social and supportive services. WestCAT
provides fixed route bus service to this area (Routes 11 and 15, and LYNX that connects
between Hercules and San Francisco). Specifically two vacant sites are located immediately
adjacent to bus stops for the two routes and are approximately 3/4 –mile from the future
Intermodal Transit Center, which will offer Capital Corridor train service as well as local
bus and potentially ferry service to San Francisco. The Planned Office–Research &
Development zone transitions into the adjacent Planned Commercial–Residential, as well as
the New Pacific Properties Specific Plan Area. The commercial and residential uses in these
adjacent areas provide an appropriate environment for shelter use in the Planned Office–
Research & Development zone.
There are a total of 23 parcels, totaling 128 acres, in the Planned Office–Research &
Development Zone with industrial and government uses that have the potential to be
successfully repurposed as homeless shelters and housing. Two of the parcels are vacant
and makeup nearly eight acres of land, which is more than adequate for accommodating the
City’s estimated homeless population of 13 persons based on the 2013 Point-in-Time
Homeless Count in Contra Costa County.
The City established objective performance standards for regulating emergency shelter use.
Pursuant to State law, the City established standards to address the following :
       Maximum number of beds – 30 beds/persons in a facility;
       Proximity to other shelters – not less than 300 feet from property line to property
        line;
       Length of stay – not more than 180 consecutive days in any 365-day period;
       Waiting area – shall be provided with a minimum of 10 square feet per bed, either
        within the structure or outside with consideration for shade and rain; and
       Provision of on-site management and security – required at all hours during which
        the shelter is in operation, with an Operations/Management Plan approved by the
        Community Development Director.
Transitional/Supportive Housing
State law requires that local jurisdictions address the provision of transitional and
supportive housing. Specifically Government Code Section 65582 provides the following
definitions:
54                                   April 2015

                         C I T Y   O F   H E R C U L E S ,   H O U S I N G   E L E M E N T ,   2015­2023    
    “Supportive housing” means housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
    target population, and that is linked to an onsite or offsite service that assists the supportive
    housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and
    maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
    “Target population” means persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities,
    including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health condition,
    or individuals eligible for services provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental
    Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and
    Institutions Code) and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated minors,
    families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system,
    individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.
    “Transitional housing” means buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
    operated under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and
    recirculating of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined
    future point in time that shall be no less than six months from the beginning of the
    assistance.
The Zoning Ordinance was amended in February 2015 to comply with State law
requirements.       Transitional housing is defined pursuant to Government Code Section
65582(h) and is permitted in all zones where housing is permitted subject to the same
development standards as the same type of housing in that zone. Similarly, supportive
housing dwelling units are defined pursuant to Government Code Section 65582(f) and (g)
and are permitted in all zones where housing is permitted subject to the same development
standards as the same type of housing in that zone.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are
distinct from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain
a kitchen and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or
bathroom, many SROs today have one or the other. The Hercules Zoning Ordinance does
not currently contain specific provisions for SRO units. However, the City is amending the
Zoning Ordinance in 2015, prior to adoption of the Housing Element, to facilitate the
provision of SROs. Under the amendment, SROs will be permitted conditionally in the
Historic Town Center zone. Individual SRO units shall not exceed 300 square feet nor be
occupied by more than two persons. Full or partial kitchens and bathrooms shall be
provided in every SRO project.
Employee Housing
Some employers choose to provide housing for their employees. State law requires that
employee housing that accommodates six or fewer employees be regulated with the same
zoning requirements as those that regulate family dwellings of the same type in the same
zone. The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in February 2015 to define housing that
provides accommodations for six or fewer employees as a single-family structure and is
subject only to the zoning requirements that are required of a dwelling of the same type in
the same zone.
                                                                             April 2015                      55

Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e.,
modification or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling. An analysis was conducted of the zoning ordinance, permitting
procedures, development standards and building codes to identify potential constraints for
housing for persons with disabilities. The City’s policies and regulations regarding housing
for persons with disabilities are described below.
Zoning and Land Use
Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka Lanterman Act), small
licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must be treated as regular
residential uses and permitted by right in all residential districts.
The City amended the Zoning Ordinance in February 2015 to replace “group housing” as a
land use classification with eight new classifications: Residential Care Facility (6 or fewer
residents, or 7 or more residents); Supportive Housing (Apartment Type, Residential Care
Facility Small Type, or Residential Care Facility Large Type); and Transitional Housing
(Apartment Type, Residential Care Facility Small Type, or Residential Care Facility Large
Type). Each new land use classification is defined in terms of what services it can provide
and how many residents are permitted. The definition and provisions conform to the
Lanterman Act, as well as to Government Code 65582(f)(g)(h). Uses are permitted,
conditionally permitted, or prohibited according to similar uses in the same zones. The
amendment addressed the provision of transitional housing, supportive housing, and
single-room occupancy housing that also offer appropriate housing options for persons with
disabilities.
Definition of Family
Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing to qualify as a
“family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a restrictive
definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates between related and
unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the development and siting of
group homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing families that are similarly
sized or situated.4 The Hercules Zoning Ordinance does not define family and therefore
does not restrict any households from being considered a family.
4   California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980, and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.)
    have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons
    related by blood, marriage or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated
    persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that
    distinguishes between blood-related and non-blood-related individuals does not serve any legitimate or

Building Codes
The City actively enforces the 2013 California Building Standards Code provisions that
regulate the access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities.
No unique restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of housing for
persons with disabilities. Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that ten percent of the
total dwelling units in multi-family buildings without elevators and consisting of three or
more rental units or four condominium units comply with the following building standards
for persons with disabilities:
       The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless
        exempted by site impracticality tests.
       At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
        served by an accessible route.
       All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an
        accessible route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to
        this chapter may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms,
        living rooms, bedrooms, or hallways.
       Common use areas shall be accessible.
       If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces are required.
Reasonable Accommodation
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations
may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling. For example, it may be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with
disabilities to waive a setback requirement or other standard of the Zoning Ordinance to
ensure that homes are accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular
modification is reasonable depends on the circumstances.
The City amended the Zoning Ordinance in February 2015 to establish a reasonable
accommodation procedure to address reasonable accommodation requests. The Reasonable
Accommodation Ordinance specifies eligibility, type, and extent of standards that the City
will grant reasonable accommodation, criteria for determining reasonableness, ministerial
review and approval procedure with the Planning Director as decision-maker, and other
provisions that will provide consistency in the granting of reasonable accommodation. The
procedure applies to the primary residence of persons who are protected under the federal
Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and/or California Fair Employment and Housing
Act.
Permits and Fees
As there is no established procedure in place, no specific permits or fees are required for
reasonable accommodation requests.
                                                                           April 2015                      57

Conclusion
The City of Hercules amended the Zoning Ordinance in February 2015 to address the
provision of residential care facilities, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-
room occupancy housing, as well as reasonable accommodation procedures. Table 37
shows the land use regulations for the new Residential Use types. This table also identifies
the process by which these uses are permitted. Permit requirements are consistent with
those applied to other similar uses in the same zone. The City has no unique policies or
conditions that may constrain the development or improvement of housing for persons with
disabilities.
Development Review
The following discussions summarize the types of approval/permits required for various
residential developments and the processing time required. The City is committed to
actively collaborating with potential developers to encourage the development of housing
for all Hercules residents. Types of assistance provided to developers could potentially
include:
       Fee reduction/waivers
       Extensions on permits
Development Applications
A development application is required for any of the following: administrative permits,
conditional use permits, variances, planned development plans, and zoning designation
changes. The planning approval process for each of these items varies.
Use Permits
The City of Hercules offers three types of use permits: Administrative Use Permits,
Conditional Use Permits, and Temporary Use Permits. These use permits are designed to
provide the City with a zoning compliance review and recording procedure for proposed
land uses. They ensure that initiation or re-establishment of legally permitted uses complies
with all standards and requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. A Use Permit is revocable
and can be granted for a limited amount of time.
Administrative Use Permit (AUP)
An AUP is issued by the Community Development Director for uses that are generally
permitted within a district and usually are of low impact to the community and
environment. Conditions of approval, mandatory review periods, and expiration periods
can be required at the discretion of the Community Development Director. When granting
conditional approval, the Director has the authority to impose requirements and conditions
with respect to location, siting, construction, maintenance, operation, duration, and overall
development as deemed reasonable and necessary for the protection of adjacent properties
and public interest. If an AUP is denied by the Director, it can be appealed to the Planning
Commission, which has the authority to approve it as a Conditional Use Permit. If the

                        C I T Y   O F   H E R C U L E S ,   H O U S I N G   E L E M E N T ,   2015­2023    
Director feels that an AUP application would be more fitting as a CUP, the Planning
Director can refer it to the Planning Commission as well.
In Hercules, Administrative Use Permits with design review are required for new
construction of single-family residential development in the low density residential zones,
as well as for live-work units in mixed-use zones. Both the AUP and design review are
conducted concurrently.
Conditional Use Permit (CUP)
A CUP is designed to provide the necessary flexibility to the City in achieving the purposes
of the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance and provide for special considerations for some
development. In the City of Hercules, the CUP application and approval process runs
concurrently with the design review process in order to ensure maximum efficiency and
timeliness of project review and approval. Both processes take approximately 45–60 days to
complete.
CUPs are issued by the Planning Commission and will usually include conditions of
approval, mandatory review periods, and expiration periods at the discretion of the
Planning Commission. The findings required for the approval of a CUP are as follows:
       The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan;
       The proposed location conforms with the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and the
        purposes of the district in which the site is located, and will comply with the
        applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance;
       The location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be
        compatible in design, scale, coverage and density with existing and anticipated
        adjacent uses;
       There is adequate access, traffic, public utility, and public service capacity for the
        proposed use and surrounding existing and anticipated uses; and
       There are no potential, significant adverse environmental impacts that could not be
        feasibly mitigated and monitored.
These findings are reasonable and do not constrain housing development in Hercules.
Any decision on a CUP made by the Planning Commission can be appealed to the City
Council by the applicant or any person affected by the determination or decision. An appeal
requires a written appeal to the Community Development Director and payment of the
applicable appeal fee within ten working days of the mailing or posting of the notice of
decision. The appeal will then be heard by the City Council at the next available hearing.
CUPs are required for all multi-family, condominium and townhouse developments as well
as group housing; however, multi-family units are permitted by right in many of the City’s
specific plan areas. Waterfront District Master Plan includes areas where multi-family
housing is permitted by right. Within the New Town Center project area, multi-family
dwellings only require an administrative use permit. These sites are already zoned for high
density residential development at 40 units per acre. Based on market conditions and
development trends, it is not anticipated higher density would be required. If increased
densities are desired, it would be processed with a General Plan/Specific Plan Amendment
and zone change, not through a CUP. Nonetheless, these identified sites are generally
                                                                            April 2015                      59

located in areas away from the City’s lower density residential neighborhoods and
therefore, compatibility issues should be minimal.
Temporary Use Permit
Temporary Use Permits are issued by the Community Development Director for uses or
activities with a proposed duration of no more than 30 days in any calendar year. They can
be issued by the Planning Commission for conditional uses with duration of 31 days or
longer in one calendar year. Conditions or approval and expiration periods can be required
at the discretion of the Community Development Director.
Use Permit Procedure
Applications for any of the above Use Permits must include, among other things, a site plan
drawn to scale depicting existing and proposed uses and structures, existing and proposed
locations of streets, utilities, drainage facilities, driveways, pedestrian walkways, off-street
parking and loading facilities as well as existing and proposed landscaped areas. After
determining that an application is complete, the Community Development Director reviews
the applications and must take action in less than 60 days if the application is exempt from
CEQA, per the Permit Streamlining Act. By taking action, the Director approves, approves
with conditions, or denies an application. If the Director considers an application a better
candidate for a conditional use permit or temporary use permit, it must be forwarded to the
Planning Commission, with the recommendation within 30 days. The Director and Planning
Commission can grant an application for a Use Permit if the following findings are made:
       The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan.
       The proposed location of the use conforms to the purposes of the zoning ordinance
        and the purposes of the district in which the site is located and will comply with the
        applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
       The location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be
        compatible in design, scale, coverage and density with existing and anticipated
        adjacent uses.
       There is adequate access, traffic, public utility and public service capacity for the
        proposed use and surrounding existing and anticipated uses.
       There is not potential, significant adverse environmental impacts that could not be
        feasibly mitigated and monitored.
The City Council has the authority to review any action of the Community Development
Director or Planning Commission in granting or denying a Use Permit. The City Council
must abide by the same findings listed above in reviewing a Use Permit application. These
findings must be supported by facts and relate to development and performance standards
only and therefore do not constrain housing development in the City.
Zoning Amendments
The zoning amendment process ensures that zoning amendments conform to the General
Plan and are internally consistent with the Zoning Ordinance. An amendment or change to
60                                    April 2015

                       C I T Y   O F   H E R C U L E S ,   H O U S I N G   E L E M E N T ,   2015­2023    
the Zoning Map is initiated by the property owner of the proposed change who must file an
application with the Community Development Director. An amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance or Zoning Map can also be initiated by the Community Development Director,
by resolution of the Planning Commission, or by action of the City Council in the form of a
request to the Commission that it consider the proposed change. The City Council grants
amendments to the Zoning Ordinance that fall within the following categories:
       Change in Zoning Map boundaries of any zoning district.
       Change in Zoning Ordinance text of a zoning district regulation.
       Change in off-street parking or loading facilities requirements, general provision,
        exception, or other regulatory provision within the text of the Zoning Ordinance.
In order to grant the amendment, the City Council must find the following:
       The proposed amendment is consistent with the General Plan.
       The proposed amendment would not be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare
        and public interest of the City.
       The proposed amendment is internally consistent and does not conflict with the
        purposes, regulations and required findings of the Zoning Ordinance.
Planned Development Plan (PDP)
All proposals for subdivision or development within zoning districts requiring planned
development plans must submit a planned development plan application concurrently with
other applications. Parcels over five acres in size or in the Central Hercules Regulating Plan
areas are required to go through the Planned Development Plan process. Essentially all
development since 2007 have fallen into this category and gone through the PDP process.
There are three potential stages in the review process: 1) conceptual; 2) initial; and 3) final.
The final stage includes a design review as discussed below.
Conceptual Planned Development Plan: The Conceptual PDP is an optional procedure
intended to provide an opportunity for discussion and informal review of a proposed
subdivision or development that requires a PDP. The process provides a forum to discuss
the overall direction for the proposed project, enabling the landowner or developer to
address the comments on the project prior to making a formal application. Conceptual PDPs
are generally recommended for projects that are large, complex, or may be subject to
controversy. A Conceptual PDP must include a complete site plan as well as a
determination of use of density bonus, number of dwelling units, and potential housing
types. During the conceptual stage, the developer meets informally with City staff, the
Planning Commission, and City Council. After these informal reviews are completed, the
developer submits an Initial PDP as well as any other subdivision or development
applications.
Initial Planned Development Plan: The Initial PDP focuses on the review of the project’s
subdivision plan and/or site development plan. It is evaluated and approved in conjunction
with other basic subdivision and development applications. The Initial PDP is intended to
establish a comprehensive set of documents and conditions of approval which will regulate
the subdivision or development process. The Initial PDP is subject to environmental review
                                                                           April 2015                      61

and requires that the City Council make findings according to findings discussed below. No
improvements to the land shall commence or be approved until the City Council has
approved the Initial PDP. All Initial PDPs have to be prepared and endorsed by a licensed
civil engineer or licensed land surveyor.
Final Planned Development Plan: The Final PDP is intended to establish a set of documents
and conditions of approval for the detailed design of buildings and other improvements on
the site which will then regulate the development process. The final stage is subject to
environmental review as necessary and requires the City Council to make findings as
discussed below. The final stage also requires final design review approval.
Planned Development Permit Approval: A PDP application along with the Community
Development Director’s report must be forwarded to the Planning Commission for review.
The Planning Commission then forwards its recommendation to the City Council for final
action. If the PDP includes a subdivision, the proceedings for the review of the tentative
subdivision map may be undertaken concurrently with the proceedings with respect to the
PDP. The City Council grants PDP permits or modifies approved PDPs with or without
conditions based on the following findings:
       The proposed use and densities are consistent with the General Plan.
       The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to carry
        anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in such amounts
        as to overload the street network outside the planned development.
       Any exceptions from standard ordinance requirements are warranted by the design
        and amenities incorporated in the Final PDP and approved through the minor
        exception process.
       The area surrounding the project site can be planned and zoned in coordination and
        substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
       Existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the development densities
        proposed.
The required findings must be supported by facts and relate to performance and
development standards and therefore do not constrain housing development.
Design Review
The Design Review process is intended to improve the general standards of orderly
development of the individual buildings and structures in the City. The process establishes
standards and practices that will promote and enhance good design, site relationships, and
other aesthetic considerations in the City, as well as preserves and enhances property values
and the visual character of the community. In the City of Hercules, some AUP and all CUP
applications run concurrently with the design review process in order to ensure maximum
efficiency and timeliness. Both processes take approximately 45–60 days to complete. Design
review approval by the Planning Commission is required for the erection, construction, or
exterior alteration of any public or private building, fence, structure or sign. Additions to
single-family homes, accessory structures to single-family home or fences may have their
designs approved by the Planning Director alone.

                       C I T Y   O F   H E R C U L E S ,   H O U S I N G   E L E M E N T ,   2015­2023    
The Regulating Code for the Central Hercules Plan establishes specific architectural
guidelines for development in the City. A primary goal of the City’s Architectural
Guidelines is achieving authenticity of design elements and encouraging construction that is
straightforward and functional. The Architectural Guidelines specify general requirements,
permitted finish materials, and allowable configurations for the following building
elements:
       Building walls
       Columns, arches, piers, railings, and balustrades
       Windows, skylights, and doors
       Roofs and gutters
       Garden walls, fences, and hedges
       Signs
The Hercules Waterfront District Master Plan also has its own set of Architectural
Regulations, which provide direction for the design of buildings, appurtenances, and site
elements within the Master Plan area. Under these Guidelines, single-family detached
housing is required to follow one of three design styles: Italianate, Victorian, and Craftsman.
Multi-story, mixed-use buildings must follow one of the following architectural styles:
waterfront warehouse; Gold Rush; Victorian; Tudor/English Arts & Crafts; Spanish Revival;
or Bay Area Eclectic. Additional specifications vary depending on the chosen style and
location within the Waterfront District. These styles were selected due to their historic and
successful use in many of the best Bay Area neighborhoods. The Guidelines also prefer the
use of authentic, natural building materials, which include wood, brick, smooth plaster,
stone, tile, slate, and naturally weathering metals. It is specifically intended for houses
within this planning area to not be conventional “tract houses” to which a few “special
details” are applied. Specific landscaping regulations for residential developments in the
Master Plan area can also be found in the Waterfront District Master Plan.
Design guidelines provide clear guidance to developers/architects during the project design
phase and enhance the level of certainty in project review and approval.
A Design Review application must be filed with the Planning Director and can be filed in
conjunction with applications for tentative subdivision maps, environmental impact
documents, Zoning Ordinance permits and approvals, and other permits. The application
must include a site plan, building design plans, landscaping and irrigation, environmental
information, and any other data that the Planning Commission may require to make a
finding. Chapter 42 of the Zoning Ordinance outlines the required elements of design
review, which include: site planning; building design; landscaping and irrigation; and
environmental form (e.g., measures to address flooding, access, geologic/seismic hazards,
and noise).
If a Design Review application can be approved by the Community Development Director,
as discussed above, the Director can approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
application within ten working days after determining the application is complete. Any
action by the Planning Director can be appealed to the Planning Commission with 14 days.
In some cases, the Director will decide that an application for an addition to a single-family
                                                                           April 2015                      63

home or accessory structure is of such a size, importance, or unique nature to be a
significant design issue and present the application to the Planning Commission.
Design Review applications that require Planning Commission review are first reviewed by
the Community Development Director. After deeming an application complete, the Director
has ten working days to provide written comments on the proposed plan to the applicant,
which the applicant can address in a revised plan. When the Planning Commission receives
the complete revised plans, the Director schedules a review of the application by the
Planning Commission at the next available Planning Commission meeting. Prior to the
Planning Commission meeting or hearing, the Director will provide written comments to
the Commission regarding the application. The Planning Commission then approves,
approves with conditions, or denies the Design Review application based on the following
findings:
        The approval of the design review plan is in compliance with all provisions of the
         Design Review chapter of the Zoning Ordinance, other pertinent provision of the
         Zoning Ordinance and applicable zoning and land use regulations, including the
         Hercules General Plan.
        The approval of the Design Review plan must be in the best interest of the public
         health, safety and general welfare.
        General site considerations, including site layout, open space and topography,
         orientation and location of buildings, vehicular access, circulation and parking,
         setbacks, height walls, fences, public safety and similar elements have been
         designed to provide a desirable environment for the development.
        General architectural considerations, including the character, scale and quality of
         the design, the architectural relationship with the site and other buildings, building
         materials, colors, screening of exterior appurtenances, exterior lighting and signing
         and similar elements have been incorporated in order to insure the compatibility of
         the development with its design concept and the character of adjacent buildings.
        General landscape considerations, including the location, type, size, color, texture
         and coverage of plant materials at the time of planting and after a five-year growth
         period, provision for irrigation, maintenance and protection of landscaped areas
         and similar elements have been considered to insure visual relief, to complement
         buildings and structures and to provide an attractive environment for the
         enjoyment of the public.
Decisions of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council. The City has
also established guidelines for site development in the Zoning Ordinance and General Plan,
including: tree removal, drainage, outdoor space, circulation, architectural design, and
landscaping. These guidelines are basic and reasonable principles that most architects
would regularly incorporate into their plans and are not considered a constraint. As such,
the City’s design review process does not usually result in design changes that substantially
increase the cost of housing development. Design review is also performed concurrently
with the review of other applications and therefore does not unduly lengthen the time of
project review and approval. Overall, Hercules remains as one of the more affordable
communities in the East Bay area. Its development review process, including design review,
does not result in significant increase in housing costs.

Staff’s authority to approve design review permits (i.e., administrative permits) is limited to
additions to existing residential units and similar or smaller projects. The design review for
future phases of the Waterfront would require Planning Commission approval, but not City
Council unless appealed to the Council. Grounds for appeal are simply filing an application
and paying the requisite appeal fee. Other housing development outside the Waterfront
would require Planning Commission and City Council approval of a Planned Development
Plan, which includes design review.
Processing Times
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is
commonly cited by the development community as a prime contributor to the high cost of
housing. Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the
time which elapses from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably.
Factors that can affect the length of development review on a proposed project include:
rezoning or general plan amendment requirements; public hearing required for
Commission/Council review; or a required Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact
Report (EIR).
As shown in Table 38, the approval process for single- and multi-family development
generally takes approximately two to three months to complete. The City provides
information about the different permits and applications required for development on its
website as well as at the public counters. The permit process in Hercules is designed to
expedite all city land use permits. Typical processing times range from several weeks for
minor subdivisions and developments that are permitted by right within the zoning district,
to several months for major subdivisions and developments that require conditional use
permits.
Given the level of development anticipated in the City, there is nothing to indicate that the
City’s land use controls or development standards are constraints on residential
development for all income groups. Furthermore, the City’s efforts to provide greater
flexibility and streamlined development review through the Regulating Code help promote
a greater variety of housing types and support the goals of affordability.

On/Off Site Improvement Requirements
On- and off-site improvement requirements are established on a case-by-case basis for new
housing development. For large developments, specific improvements may be required,
consistent with the City’s General Plan policies and development standards to ensure that
public health and safety are protected. Off-site improvements are required when a nexus
exists between the development and its impacts on facilities. The Regulating Code for the
Central Hercules Plan and the Waterfront District Master Plan establish improvement
requirements based upon traditional urban design conventions, which generally support
narrower street widths and more compact, pedestrian-oriented forms of development that
are more efficient and less costly. The Waterfront District Master Plan also calls for the
formation of a Maintenance Improvement District that will maintain specified
improvements, which include but are not limited to street trees, alley pavement and
utilities, and street lighting.
The Waterfront District Master Plan specifies the minimum street widths required for the
undeveloped portion of the Waterfront District. Required minimum street widths vary,
depending on the street and anticipated use, but range from 20 feet to 60 feet. Street rights-
of-way and improvements are to be dedicated by projects as necessary to provide adequate
internal circulation and external access. New residential areas are expected to be designed
to: 1) avoid conflict with major streets or thoroughfares; 2) have access to transit facilities;
and 3) encourage safe and convenient alternatives to the private automobile.
The Regulating Code for Central Hercules serves as a general guide for on- and off-site
improvements for the majority of the remaining vacant but developable properties within
the City. It establishes street right-of-way requirements for various types of streets as
follows:
        One-Way Edge Drive – 30 feet
66                                       April 2015

       Two-Way Edge Drive – 40 feet
       Neighborhood Lane – 50 feet
       Neighborhood Street – 60 feet
       Town Center Street/Main Street – 60 feet
       Two-Way Avenue – varies
       Four-Way Avenue – 110 feet
Streetlights are to be located at intervals no greater than 50 feet. Street furniture such as
benches and trash receptacles are to be placed at intervals no greater than 200 feet. Overall,
these standards are consistent with those for most urban communities. The Regulating Code
does not establish a required ratio of non-residential to residential. The amount of
commercial and residential space in a mixed use project will be determined on a project-by-
project basis depending on site design and market economics.
As stated before, the City has also established guidelines for site development, including:
tree removal, drainage, outdoor space, circulation, architectural design and landscaping.
These guidelines are basic and reasonable principles that most architects would regularly
incorporate into their plans and are not considered a constraint.
Fees and Exactions
In addition to improvements and dedication of public land, developers are subject to a
variety of fees and exactions to process permits and provide necessary services and facilities
as allowed by State law. In general, these development fees can be a constraint to the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing because the additional costs borne
by developers contribute to overall increased housing unit costs. However, the fees are
necessary to maintain adequate planning services and other public services and facilities in
the City to serve the new development. The City’s permit processing fee schedule for
residential development is displayed in Table 39.
New housing is typically charged for an administrative use permit or conditional use
permit, if it is for multi-family units, as well as impact fees shown in Table 41. If the
development is a subdivision, there are additional fees for processing the tentative and final
maps. In addition, the developer may have to pay the cost of preparing environmental
reports, traffic studies, and soils reports.
The City’s Development Impact Fee program not only ensures that new development
adequately contributes to the provision of necessary public services and facilities in the City,
but also promotes transit-oriented development. Table 41 shows the schedule of fees
established for residential development. In addition, residential developments in Hercules
must pay the fees shown in Table 42.

City of Hercules, Master Fee Schedule, Effective July 1, 2013
 The City’s permit and processing fees are comparable to, and often lower than, those of
 nearby cities such as El Cerrito and Martinez (Table 40). These cities are very similar in size
 and character to Hercules. Another neighboring jurisdiction – Richmond – charges variable
 fees based on time spent on the project. Minimum are required and the costs can increase
 significantly depending on the complexity of the project. The City’s fees are reasonable and
 not considered a constraint to housing development.

    Notes:
    1. Per Section 66005.1 of the Mitigation Fee Act, certain projects may qualify for lower impact fees for Traffic
         Facilities based on the project's consistency with Section 66005.1 of the Mitigation Fee Act. Qualifying
         factors for housing developments include, but are not limited to:
         -     Common ownership and financing consisting of residential use or mixed use where not less than 50%
               of the floor space is for residential use;
         -     Location within one-half mile of a transit station and direct access between the housing development
               and the transit station along a barrier-free walkable pathway not exceeding one-half mile in length;
         -     Convenience retail uses, including a store that sells food, located within one-half mile of the housing
               development; and
         -     Provision of either the minimum number of parking spaces required by the local ordinance, or no
               more than one onsite parking space for zero to two bedroom units, and two onsite parking spaces for
               three or more bedroom units, whichever is less.
         Reduced Traffic Facilities impact fees are negotiated and approved through a Development Agreement by
         the Office of the City Manager.
    2. Per the Bayfront Implementing Development Agreement, the Public Benefit Fee applies only to the
         Bayfront Waterfront Project.

            Source: City of Hercules, 2012.
School impact fee, sewer connection fee, and West County Sub-Regional Transportation
Mitigation fee are charged by outside agencies beyond the City’s control. These fees are
similar for all jurisdictions served by the same agencies and therefore do not specifically
impact housing development in Hercules.
Based on the various fees detailed in Table 41 and Table 42, a single-family unit may cost up
to $17,924 in impact fees and a multi-family unit may cost up to $13,142 in impact fees
(excluding school impact fees, which vary depending on the size of the dwelling unit).
Combined with processing fees, a typical single-family unit may cost $35,058 and a typical
multi-family unit may cost $24,789 as shown in Table 43. Typically, all fees combined
comprise about seven percent of the total development costs. This fee level is consistent
with fees associated with residential development in the Bay Area. Based on the number of
constructed, approved, and entitled projects in the City, development and impact fees do
not constrain housing development in Hercules.
Impact fees provide the City with a necessary source of income to fund basic services.
Nonetheless, the City is sensitive to the impact that development fees have on housing
affordability, and has included a policy in the Housing Element to consider fee waivers or
deferrals on a case-by-case basis. Whether a housing development is affordable or market
rate, the impacts are quite similar.
As part of Bayfront Development Agreement, City Council substantially reduced impact
fees City-wide in November 2011. Bayside-specific Public Benefit Fee was proposed by and
agreed to by Hercules Bayfront, the private developer/landowner for the Waterfront.
Therefore, the City’s development fees do not serve to constrain housing development in
the community.

Building Codes and Enforcement Procedures
The City of Hercules requires all construction to meet the requirements of the California
Code of Regulations Title 24. The only City-adopted amendment to the codes is an
amendment to the California Plumbing Code that requires seismic gas shut-off valves on all
residential construction that either (a) includes gas piping and is valued at $5,000 or more,
or (b) does not include gas piping but is valued at $15,000 or more. In addition, the City has
developed Historical Guidelines applicable to all historical structures within the City and
designed to provide maintenance criteria and methods of construction for preserving the
structures for future generations.5
As well as responding to citizen complaints, the Building Division takes a proactive
approach to code enforcement, investigating potential violations that may present a threat
5   In accordance with the California Historical Code State law, the renovation of historic structures may
    include the use of materials and construction methods as of date of original construction, unless a health or
    safety hazard would result.

to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. In an effort to address the age
and condition of the housing stock in Hercules, the Building Division uses software that
enables the City to receive, log, and thoroughly track code enforcement cases thoroughly.
The Building Division has inspected the work for affordable housing programs, including
seismic bracing, seismic gas shut-off valves, and residential rehabilitation loans. The
Building Division has also performed community outreach at community events
throughout the year by providing free educational and demonstration materials about
building construction, code enforcement, and rental inspections.
The Building Division does in-house reviews of smaller scale projects, with a turn-around
time of approximately one week. Larger projects are sent to an outside plan check service
with a turn-around time of approximately two to three weeks. The Building Division,
through a third party contract with Contra Costa County Building Division, responds to all
requests for inspections within 24 hours of receiving the request. As such, Hercules’s
building codes and enforcement procedures do not appear to create an undue constraint on
housing development or improvement, but instead ensure a safe built environment for its
citizens and future homeowners.
Community Concerns  
Potential opposition to affordable housing exists in many communities throughout the Bay
Area. Specific project concerns can relate to potential environmental impacts, quality of
design, and the quality of long-term management of the project. The extensive community
involvement that took place in developing the Central Hercules Plan and subsequent
planning efforts have contributed significantly to building community support for
affordable housing as an integral part of the City’s development. This is reflected in the
diverse housing types that are promoted through the Central Hercules Plan, the Waterfront
District Master Plan, and in the City’s former Affordable Housing Program. The Housing
Element also includes programs to address these issues and further build support for the
integration of new affordable housing opportunities in the community.
Environmental and Historical Preservation Constraints 
A community’s environmental setting affects the feasibility and cost of developing housing.
Environmental issues range from the availability of water to the suitability of land for
development due to potential exposure to seismic, flooding, wildfire, and other hazards. If
not properly recognized and accommodated in residential design, these environmental
features could potentially endanger lives and property. The potential significance of a site or
setting as it relates to a historic person, event, or period of time can also limit development
and redevelopment opportunities. This section summarizes these potential constraints in
Hercules.
Geological and Seismic Hazards
Potential geological hazards in the City include: landslides, soil creep, Valley Alluvium,
existing fills, ground water, seepage and ponding and erosion. In order to mitigate these
hazards, the City has adopted a Grading Ordinance to establish standards for grading
                                                                             April 2015                      73

operations, requiring the issuance of grading permits, providing for the approval of grading
plans and inspection of grading construction. The Grading Ordinance also provides for
testing where there are potential geological hazards.
Based on history, all of the San Francisco Bay Area is considered seismically active. Because
of this, Hercules is in one of the most seismically active regions in the country. The City is
located in the vicinity of the San Andreas Fault (21 miles away), the Hayward Fault (2.5
miles away), the Concord-Green Valley Fault (11 miles away), and the Calaveras Fault (40
miles away). The City of Hercules employs the use of Special Study Areas to avoid
construction near active faults and other hazardous areas.
Fire Hazards
The major fire hazard areas within Hercules are the open space areas, which generally
include brush, grass covered hills, and forested areas. Fire protection services to the City of
Hercules are provided by the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District on a 24-hour basis.
Because fire hazards are not as prevalent among developed areas, most residential areas of
the City are not at risk.
Flood Hazards
Potential causes for flooding in the City include high tides and storm wave, creek overflows,
and standing water from excess rainfall. The Refugio Creek area is susceptible to flooding;
however, the City of Hercules has adopted a Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay District as
well as a Refugio Creek Overlay District to ensure that land use standards in flood hazard
areas are adequate.
Hazardous Waste
The City of Hercules has been dealing with the issues of hazardous waste management,
solid waste management, and emergency responses for several years. Hazardous waste
generated within the City limits is currently limited to a number of small quantity
generators and household hazardous waste. The Hercules Powder Plant was remediated to
residential standards in 1996, and residential neighborhoods are now developed on the site.
The Pacific Oil Refinery has been demolished and remediated, and an 800-unit residential
neighborhood has been constructed on it. The Hilltown location, previously occupied by
PG&E, is completing its soil remediation to residential standard.
Historic Preservation
Historic preservation is an established part of city planning in Hercules. Over the past
decade, the community has initiated preservation initiatives to protect the many historic
houses that remain as reminders of the past. Because Hercules’s heritage remains a primary
goal of the community, the City has adopted a Historic Overlay District as well as Historic
Preservation Design Guidelines.
Much of the City’s future residential development will occur within urbanized areas and
within specific plan areas. The potential environmental impacts have been considered by the
City.

Opportunities for Energy Conservation 
Energy Efficiency Incentives
Energy costs have increased substantially in recent years due to increased fuel costs. Energy
costs have become a significant portion of housing costs, especially for lower income
households. The PG&E offers a range of incentives to encourage energy conservation:
       Rebates ranging from $30 to $75 for energy-efficient appliances such as washer,
        refrigerator, air conditioner, and water heater.
       Rebates ranging from $0.10 to $0.50 per square foot for general energy conservation
        improvements, including attic insulation, wall insulation, and cool roof.
       Rebates ranging from $50 to $300 per unit for whole house fan, natural gas furnace,
        and pool pump.
PG&E also offers the Energy Savings Assistance Program to income-qualified households to
help manage their energy use and save on their monthly energy bills. Specifically, income-
qualified households may receive assistance in:
       Improvements to the house, apartment, or mobile home including compact
        fluorescent lights, caulking, showerheads, or minor home repairs.
       Replacement of old refrigerator, furnace, and/or water heater.
       Energy savings tips.
City Policies
As discussed earlier, the City promotes smart growth and energy conservation through
mixed-use developments. To promote transit-oriented development, the City offers reduced
Traffic Facilities Impact Fee for projects that are located within one-half mile from a transit

4  Housing Resources 
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in Hercules. This analysis includes an evaluation of the availability
of land resources for future housing development, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the
region’s projected housing needs, the financial resources available to support housing
activities, and the administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City’s
housing programs and policies.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) 
Every city and county in the State of California has a legal obligation to respond to its “fair
share” of the projected future housing need in the region. For Hercules and other Bay Area
jurisdictions, the regional housing need is determined by the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), based upon an overall regional housing need number established by
the State. In accordance with State law, ABAG has determined the fair share of the regional
housing need that must be planned for by each jurisdiction for the 2015 to 2023 Housing
Element. That need is divided into four income categories of housing affordability (in
accordance with State law). ABAG’s allocations are based on an analysis of:
       The vacancy rate in each city and the existing need for housing it implies;
       The projected growth in the number of households;
       The local and regional distribution of income; and
       The need for housing generated by local job growth.
The RHNA for 2015-2023 Housing Element covers a slightly different planning period (from
January 1, 2014 through October 22, 2022) than the Housing Element.

Hercules’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation
Table 44 summarizes the housing need determinations for all of the jurisdictions in Contra
Costa County. For the 2015 Housing Element Update, the City of Hercules is allocated a
RHNA of 682 units as follows:
         220 units affordable to extremely low/very low income households (32.3% of the
          total)6
         118 units affordable to low income households (17.3% of the total)
         100 units affordable to moderate income households (14.7% of the total)
         244 units affordable to above moderate income households (35.8% of the total)
6    The City has a RHNA allocation of 220 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units).
     Pursuant to new State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing
     needs based on Census income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely
     low. Assuming 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low, the City’s RHNA of 220very low
     income units may be split into 110 extremely low income units and 110 very low income units. However, for
     the purposes of identifying adequate sites for RHNA, State law does not mandate the separate accounting
     for the extremely low income category.
                                                                                    April 2015                              77

                     C I T Y   O F   H E R C U L E S ,   H O U S I N G   E L E M E N T ,   2015­2023                        
The total RHNA housing need for Hercules represents approximately 3.3 percent of the total
countywide housing need. The City’s low and very low income housing need represents
approximately four percent of the total countywide need in these categories, while the City’s
moderate and above moderate income need represents approximately 2.8 percent of the
total countywide need in these categories.
Because local jurisdictions are rarely if ever involved in the actual construction of housing
units, the fair share numbers establish goals that should be used to guide planning and
development decision making. Specifically, the numbers establish a gauge to determine
whether the City is allocating adequate sites for the development of housing (particularly
housing at higher densities to achieve the housing goals for lower income households).
Beyond this basic evaluation of sites (which must be serviced by necessary infrastructure
facilities), the City must review its land use and development policies, regulations, and
procedures to determine if any of them are creating unreasonable constraints on housing
development to meet its fair share need. Furthermore, the City must demonstrate that it is
actively supporting and facilitating the development of housing affordable to lower income
households.
Progress toward RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2014, as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing
Element planning period of 2014-2022, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA any new
units built or under construction since January 1, 2014. Table 45 summarizes the units that
can be credited toward the RHNA. Subtracting the units approved or under construction,
the City has a remaining RHNA of 438 lower and moderate income units.

Inventory of Available Sites
As shown in Table 45, the City of Hercules has already met about 35 percent of its total
RHNA goal with units constructed or in the pipeline. Table 46 presents an inventory of
available vacant properties within the City, most of which are located within the various
specific plan areas (such as Central Hercules Plan and the Waterfront District Master Plan).

The properties were all previously approved for high-density or mixed use residential
development or with pending projects. However, due to the economic downturn, approval
for these projects has already expired and therefore the sites remain available for future
development.
Except for sites that have project approval or other regulatory restrictions, in estimating the
capacity on these vacant sites, a density factor at 75 percent of the allowable density for the
zone was used. This density factor is conservative compared to the previously approved
projects on these sites, ranging in approved densities of 33 to 45 units per acre (except for
Refugio Senior Housing, which is in a zone that allows 12 units per acre).
Typically CUPs are required for multi-family, condominium, and townhouse developments;
however, multi-family units are permitted by right in many of the City’s specific plan areas.
The Waterfront District Master Plan includes areas where multi-family housing is permitted
by right. All new development also requires a design review permit.
All of the sites are currently served by services and utilities, or may be served through City-
facilitated infrastructure enhancement activities. Figure 3 shows the location of the
approved projects and available sites in relation to each other.

Hercules Bayfront (Waterfront Now Initiative)
The Hercules Bayfront project is being developed by Anderson Pacific. It will be a mixed-
use development with integrated transit built on the principles of New Urbanism. The
project will include residential, retail, office, open space, and a new town center on a total of
104 acres of land. This includes 40 acres of undeveloped land, 10.9 acres of open space, and
53 acres of waterfront, tidal, and submerged property within the Waterfront Master Plan
Area. Hercules Bayfront will be a pedestrian- and transit-oriented neighborhood where
train and bus and potentially water ferry service will be available to the residents and
surrounding community in a single Intermodal Transit Center. In July 2008, the City
Council voted unanimously to adopt a resolution certifying the Waterfront Master Plan
Initiative as a City Ordinance. The project is divided into three distinct areas: the Bowl, the
Bayfront Boulevard Mixed-Use Area, and the Village. The Bowl will include approximately
336 residential units, 10,000 square feet of flex space, and 75,000 square feet of office space.
The Bayfront Boulevard Mixed-Use area will be a pedestrian-oriented “main street” with
approximately 305 residential units, 35,000 square feet of office space, and 77,000 square feet
of retail space. This area will also include the new Intermodal Transit Center. The Village is
planned as the future location of high density housing with approximately 751 units that
will support the transit station and commercial uses. The district also permits flex space
with allowed uses that can evolve and respond to changing community needs. Due to the
economic downturn, no development plans have been submitted and the sites remain
available for development.

Hilltown
The Hilltown project is planned for a 44-acre parcel with varying elevations and vantage
points of the Hercules. In 2005, Santa Clara Valley Housing Group (SCVHG) acquired an
option on the property and purchased the property from PG&E. Due to the economic
downturn, no development plans have been submitted and the sites remain available for
development. However, current soil remediation activities are occurring on site to meet
residential standards.
Senior Housing
In 2009, the City approved development of 28 senior condominium units within a three
story, 67,000 square foot structure located on 1.3 acres of land. The approvals lapsed in 2010
but there continues to be interest in developing site.
New Town Center
The Hercules New Town Center (NTC) district will establish a new downtown for the
community and the region. HNTC will include the relocated and expanded Hercules Transit
Center at its core, combining a regional bus station and location for a potential future BART
extension. Surrounding the mass transit station will be pedestrian-oriented mixed-use
development including retail, entertainment, office and urban-density residential uses (a
total of 1,306 units). The HNTC is divided into three sub-districts to be developed in phases.
Phase one is known as Market Town, which is situated on 6.62 acres and was approved in
2009 to include 55,000 square feet of retail, 256 housing units and 80,000 square feet of
offices and two parking structures providing 800 spaces. However, development proposals
have looked at the site to contain commercial uses only and therefore these units were not
tabulated with the available sites inventory. The second phase, known as Cinema Town,
would be the largest phase and is envisioned to be a retail and entertainment destination for
the region. It would be developed on 17 acres and would contain up to 300,000 square feet
of retail, 100,000 square feet of office, and over 600 residential units along with required
parking. However, a wetland area with red-legged frogs was found in the area and will
most likely necessitate modifying the plan, the off-ramp relocation, and hence the project
site. Therefore, these potential units were not included in the inventory of vacant sites. The
third and final stage of HNTC, known as Transit Town, would be predominantly residential
on 11 acres, with approximately 450 residential units, 20,000 square feet of local retail, and
10,000 square feet of live-work space. Due to the economic downturn, no development plans
have been submitted and the sites remain available for development.

Ability to Meet RHNA
The State has established a default density of 30 units per acre as being feasible to facilitate
the development of housing for lower income households in metropolitan areas (that
include most jurisdictions in Contra Costa County). However, the City of Hercules has a
population of less than 25,000, not qualifying as a metropolitan jurisdiction. The density
threshold used for the City under State law is 20 units per acre. As shown in Table 46, all
except one of the available sites could be developed at densities that well exceed 20 units per
acre. From a density standpoint, the City has met its RHNA requirements of providing sites
at adequate density and development standards to facilitate the development housing
affordable to lower and moderate income households. The available sites offer opportunities
for approximately 2,732 new units at densities exceeding 20 units per acre.
Financial Resources 
Hercules has the potential to access to a number of funding programs to implement its
affordable housing activities. The key sources of funds are described below.
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
CDBG is the largest federal housing-related program for affordable housing. It is a “pass-
through” program that allows local governments to use federal funds to alleviate poverty
and blight. CDBG funds are used for a variety of housing efforts including activities aimed
at reducing costs for private development (helping fund site acquisition, improvement, and
other soft costs); housing acquisition and rehabilitation through short- and long-term loans,
grants, or loan guarantees; direct payment of rent or mortgage and housing counseling
services; and fair housing activities. CDBG funds are best used in combination with other
subsidy sources or to provide pre-development funding to initiate housing development.
The City does not receive CDBG funds directly but has the potential to receive funding
through the Contra Costa Urban County Program as part of the County cooperation
                                                                               April 2015                      85

agreement via regional competitive grants. CDBG funds are used to help support
implementation of the Contra Costa Homeless Continuum of Care Plan, providing
programs and services for homeless individuals and families, people at-risk of
homelessness, and other special needs groups.
HOME Investment Partnership Act
HOME, like CDBG, is a formula-based block grant program. HOME funds must be spent
only on housing and are intended to provide incentives for the acquisition, construction,
and rehabilitation of affordable rental and home ownership. HOME requires local
governments to provide matching funds, though the matching ratio depends on the specific
uses to which HOME funds are to be put. The federal-to-local matching ratio for tenant
assistance is currently four-to-one, while the match for rental construction is two-to-one.
HOME funds in West Contra Costa are channeled through the Contra Costa County HOME
Investment Partnership program. The City may utilize HOME funds in the future to
support its affordable housing programs through a regional competitive grant application
process.
Section 8 Assistance
Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers provide rent subsidies for very low income households,
especially those with disabilities, with a severe housing cost burden, and/or at imminent
risk of becoming homeless. Although this long-standing federal assistance program is not
expected to increase in size or scope, it remains an important program for helping to fill the
gap between household income and housing costs. Section 8 assistance in Hercules is
administered by the Contra Costa County Housing Authority. Currently, approximately 240
households in Hercules receive Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers.
Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
The LIHTC program is a large federal and state housing subsidy program that provides
substantial financing for the development of affordable housing. It provides tax credits to
the private sector for the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of very affordable
rental housing. These tax credits are crucial to the success of affordable housing developers,
who sell credits directly to corporations and private investors or receive the equity from one
of a number of investment entities now making tax credits available. To be eligible for a tax
credit, 20 percent of the units in a housing development must rent to very low income
households earning less than 50 percent of area median income, or 40 percent of the units
must rent for incomes under 60 percent of the area median. California law also requires that
developments retain these levels of affordability for at least 55 years. Both federal and state
tax credit programs are administered by the State Treasurer’s Office through the California
Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC), which allocates the available credits to projects
statewide. TCAC administers two LIHTC programs: the nine percent (for projects with no
federal subsidy) and the four percent credit programs (for projects with federal subsidies
and more than 50 percent of financing through tax-exempt bonds).

As a local jurisdiction, the City is not eligible to apply for LIHTC. However, the City will
work with housing developers, and as appropriate, support their applications for LIHTC for
affordable housing projects in the City.
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
CHFA offers a variety of programs to fund new construction and resale of single-family
housing for first-time homebuyers. The 501(c)(3) Preservation Mortgage Program, for
example, allows the mortgage to be used as acquisition financing for projects that employ
tax-exempt bonds and tax credits. CHFA also provides permanent financing for new
apartments and subsidizes certain projects through its Housing Assistance Trust, a flexible
source of state funds that can offer deferred loans to cover negative cash flows in projects
where at least half of the units are for low income households.
Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu Fee
The City encourages on-site development of inclusionary housing units. There have been no
in-lieu fees collected to date. Furthermore, the City has suspended the Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance indefinitely due to the depressed housing market and the dissolution of
redevelopment. No inclusionary housing in-lieu fee is anticipated.
Affordable Housing Developers 
The Bay Area is fortunate to have a large number of successful non-profit housing
developers as well as for-profit developers who have produced literally thousands of high-
quality, well-managed affordable housing developments for low and moderate income
households over the past 30 years. While some groups specialize in a particular need area or
housing type, many affordable housing developers have produced a range of housing types
for a range of special need groups. Collectively, they have produced multi-family
developments, single-family developments, rental and ownership opportunities, sweat-
equity developments, mixed-income and mixed-use developments, and housing that is
specifically designed to meet the needs of seniors, people with disabilities, farm workers,
female-headed households, people with substance abuse problems, and people who are
homeless or at-risk of being homeless.
The key to the success of these developers lies in three areas: first, in their ability to draw
upon a diversity of funding sources and mechanisms to make their developments work
financially; second, in their commitment to working collaboratively and constructively with
the local community, including local officials as well as neighborhood residents; and third,
in their long-term commitment to ensuring excellence in design, construction, and
management of their developments, creating assets that are valued by the people who live
in the developments as well as their neighbors and others in the community.
The non-profit Housing Association of Northern California (NPH) serves as a local
networking agency, advocacy group, and resource organization for affordable housing
developers in the Bay Area and elsewhere in California. Some of the affordable housing
developers that have been active in Hercules and other Contra Costa County communities
in recent years include BRIDGE Housing Corporation, Eden Housing, Resources for
                                                                            April 2015                      87

5  Housing Plan 
The housing goals, policies, implementing programs and quantified objectives for the City
of Hercules for the 2015 to 2023 planning period are presented below, in response to the
housing needs, resources and constraints identified in the preceding chapters and building
upon the achievements and experiences from the City’s previous Housing Element. Policies
and programs are organized under six goal areas.
1.       Assist in the Development of Affordable Housing 
Providing affordable housing is essential for a healthy community. In addition to a diverse
mix of housing types, it is necessary to make available housing for residents of all income
levels. Seeking funding from varied sources increases the opportunities for development of
affordable housing units. The City of Hercules actively works with both non-profit and for-
profit developers in the production of affordable for-sale and rental housing. Recognizing
that homeownership plays a significant role in establishing strong neighborhoods and a
sense of community pride, the City supports programs that make purchasing a home a
realistic option for lower and moderate income households.
Goal 1: Assist in the provision of housing that meets the needs of all
socioeconomic segments of the community.
Policy 1.1      Facilitate homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income
                households.
Policy 1.2      Seek all available resources, including tax-increment revenue, in-lieu fees,
                and State and Federal monies for the creation of housing opportunities
                affordable to low and very low income households when projects are
                presented.
Policy 1.3      Actively support and work with non-profit housing development
                corporations and other housing providers to promote the development of
                housing that is affordable to moderate, low and very low income households.
Policy 1.4      Strive to ensure that units receiving City assistance preserve their
                affordability for a period of at least 30 years and no less than 15 years.
Policy 1.5      Encourage development of new special needs housing for seniors, single-
                parent families, large families, the disabled, including those with
                developmental disabilities, and extremely low income households.
Policy 1.6      Use density bonuses and other incentives to facilitate the development of
                new housing for extremely low, very low and low income households in
                conformity with State law.
                                                                            April 2015                      89

Implementing Programs
Program 1a: Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers 
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program extends rental subsidies to extremely low
and very low income households, including families, seniors and the disabled. The program
offers a voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market rent (FMR) as
established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and what a
tenant can afford to pay (i.e., 30 percent of household income). The Contra Costa County
Housing Authority administers the program in Hercules. Given the continued need for
rental assistance, the City supports and encourages the provision of additional subsidies
through the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
Objectives and Time Frame: 
       Maintain current levels of funding support for residents receiving Section 8
        assistance. 
       Assist the County in advertising this program through City website, public
        counters, and bulletin boards in order to meet the HUD requirements of 70
        percent new Section 8 vouchers be utilized by extremely low income households. 
Responsibility:             Contra Costa County Housing Authority
Funding Sources:            HUD Section 8 funds
Program 1b: Affordable Housing Development Incentives and Outreach 
The City will provide incentives for the development of affordable housing units at levels in
excess of those required under the City’s Inclusionary Housing Program by incentives such
as: ‘fast-track’ processing, waiving or deferring fees (depending on the City’s financial
position), and allowing relaxed development standards. The City will also work to create
and maintain relationships with affordable housing developers and ensure that they are
aware of available incentives. The City of Hercules aims to work with affordable housing
developers by supporting them through the provision of financial and regulatory incentives
to develop new affordable housing in conformity with State law.
The City of Hercules recognizes the special needs of households with disabled persons,
including those with developmental disabilities, seniors, large households, single-parent
households, and extremely low income households, and challenges they face in securing
housing. The City will work with service providers and developers to encourage the
development of a wider variety of housing types to serve the special needs populations.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
       Maintain a list of interested and qualified affordable housing developers.
        Actively and annually publicize to affordable housing developers the affordable
        housing development opportunities in Hercules, available incentives, and
        financing options as they are available by the City or other government entities.

      Utilize State and Federal assistance programs, such as HOME, LIHTC, and CHFA
       funds, on an ongoing basis to the fullest extent possible to develop affordable lower
       income housing for seniors, families, and persons with disabilities, including persons
       with developmental disabilities. Support funding applications by developers if the
       proposed projects are consistent with the goals and policies of the City’s General
       Plan. Annually, the City will pursue funding opportunities.
      Work with developers in the Central Hercules Plan area and other areas of new
       development on an ongoing basis to ensure that the City’s housing goals of
       providing a wider mix of housing types and affordability levels are achieved. The
       City will provide incentives, including density bonus, expedited processing, and
       flexible development standards to encourage a variety of housing in the
       community, including projects that set aside units for households with
       extremely low incomes. With limited funding available, the City anticipates only
       a goal of eight affordable units.
Responsibility:        Planning Department
Funding Sources:       State and Federal funds as available
Program 1c: Density Bonus Program 
 Under State law, jurisdictions are required to provide density bonuses and development
incentives on a sliding scale, where the amount of density bonus (up to 35 percent) and
number of incentives vary according to the amount of affordable housing units provided.
Table 36 in the Density Bonus section of this Housing Element provides the state required
density bonus provisions.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
      Continue to monitor the effectiveness of the Density Bonus program and provide
       technical assistance to developers in the use of the City’s program.
Responsibility:        Planning Department
Funding Sources:       Departmental Budget
Program 1d: Extremely Low Income Households 
The City recognizes its obligation to facilitate a range of housing for all income groups,
including extremely low income households. This is an income group that has traditionally
been the hardest to serve given the deep financial subsidies required.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
      In 2016, explore incentives to encourage developers to include units affordable to
       extremely low income households, including but not limited to additional density or
       floor area ratio increases, flexible development standards (such as parking, height
       limit), and priority processing. The objective is to create three affordable units for
       extremely low income households over the planning period.
                                                                           April 2015                      91

2. Conserve and Improve Housing Supply 
Conserving and improving the housing stock is an important goal for the City of Hercules.
The City supports neighborhood preservation and improvement through housing
rehabilitation and improvement programs, and code enforcement.
Goal 2: Conserve and improve the condition of the existing housing 
stock, especially affordable housing. 
Policy 2.1      Promote the continued maintenance and enhancement of residential units.
Policy 2.2      Restore and maintain residential structures of architectural or historic
                significance.
Policy 2.3      Work to preserve affordable units in publicly assisted housing development
                that are at risk of converting to market-rate housing.
Policy 2.4      Work with property owners and nonprofit housing providers to preserve
                existing housing for low and moderate income households.
Policy 2.5      Enforce adopted code requirements that set forth the acceptable health and
                safety standards for the occupancy of housing units.
Implementing Programs
Program 2a: Code Enforcement 
The Code Enforcement Program was adopted to help keep the City of Hercules a healthy,
safe, clean and attractive place in which to live. City staff works with residents to take an
active role in improving and maintaining the quality of life of their neighborhoods, as well
as maintaining property values. The Code Enforcement Program is designed to address
neighborhood problems including: discarded furniture, appliances, litter and debris,
overgrown weeds, graffiti, zoning violations and building code violations as funding is
available. The City also has developed the Gas Shut-Off Valve Program to meet the safety
and code compliance standards under the California Public Utilities Commission.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
       Continue to implement the code enforcement program to ensure that Hercules’s
        neighborhoods are maintained and improved.
       Continue installation of Gas Breaker Automatic Gas Shut-Off Valves to improve
        residential safety.

3. Provide Adequate Housing Sites 
A major element in meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community is the
provision of adequate sites to facilitate the development of all types, sizes, and prices of
housing. Persons and households of different ages, types, incomes, and lifestyles have a
                                                                             April 2015                      93

variety of housing needs and preferences that evolve over time and in response to changing
life circumstances. Providing an adequate supply and diversity of housing accommodates
changing housing needs of residents. The Hercules General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and
various design/concept plans establish where and what types of housing may locate. To
provide adequate housing and maximize use of limited land resources, new development
should be constructed at appropriate densities that maximize the intended use of the land.
Goal 3.0       Provide  suitable  sites  for  housing  development  which 
               can  accommodate  a  range  of  housing  by  type,  size, 
               location, price and tenure. 
Policy 3.1     Implement land use policies that allow for a range of residential densities and
               products, including low-density single-family uses, moderate-density town
               homes and higher density apartments, condominiums and units in mixed-
               use developments.
Policy 3.2     Encourage transit-oriented developments that take advantage of the City’s
               convenient access to regional transit through reduced traffic mitigation fees
               and master planning (such as the Hercules Bayfront plans) that offers flexible
               development standards for transit-oriented developments.
Policy 3.3     Encourage development of residential uses in strategic proximity to
               employment, recreational facilities, schools, neighborhood commercial areas
               and transportation routes by planned mixed-use and transit-oriented
               developments.
Policy 3.4     Encourage compatible residential development in areas with recyclable or
               underutilized land.
Policy 3.5     Allow flexibility within the City’s standards and regulations to encourage a
               variety of housing types.
Implementing Programs  
Program 3a: Provision of Adequate Sites 
Through the City’s General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and various concept/design plans, the
City offers opportunities for a diverse range of housing options. The City intends to create
and maintain an inventory of vacant and underutilized residential and mixed-use sites that
can accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) of 682 units.
With new units constructed and/or entitled, the City of Hercules will meet a portion of its
RHNA. For the 2015-2023 Housing Element period, the City has a remaining RHNA of 438
units: 220 extremely low/very low income units, 118 low income units, and 100 moderate
income units. The City will ensure that adequate sites remain available to accommodate this
remaining RHNA.

Objectives and Time Frame:  
       Continue to pursue/implement the projects on available sites as outlined in Table 46.
        Monitor the City’s progress in meeting the RHNA and work with developers to
        achieve an income distribution that would meet the City’s remaining RHNA units.
       Update the City’s sites inventory every two years to monitor the consumption of
        residential and mixed use properties and continued ability to fulfill the RHNA.
       Encourage sustainable development patterns by continuing to offer reductions in
        Traffic Facilities Impact Fee for projects that are located within one-half mile from a
        transit station and for mixed use projects where 50 percent or more of the building
        space is used for residential purposes. Offer Traffic Facility Fee reductions to four
        mixed use projects, subject to funding availability.

Funding Sources:         Departmental Budget
4. Remove Government Constraints 
Pursuant to State law, the City is obligated to address, and where legally possible, remove
governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. Removing constraints on housing development can help address housing needs in
the City by expediting construction and lowering development costs.
Goal 4.0        Mitigate  any  potential  governmental  constraints  to 
                housing production and affordability. 
Policy 4.1      Periodically review and adjust as appropriate residential development
                standards, regulations, ordinances, departmental processing procedures, and
                residential fees that are determined to be a constraint on the development of
                housing, particularly housing for lower and moderate income households
                and for persons with special needs.
Implementing Programs
Program 4a: Development Standards and Procedures 
The City will review its development standards, fees, and review/approval processes
periodically to ensure its standards and procedures respond to market trends and
conditions, and do not unduly constrain housing development.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
       Annually review the development standards, fees, and procedures and make
        adjustments as appropriate and legally feasible to encourage the development of a
        variety of housing in the community.
Responsibility:          Planning Department

5. Provide Equal Housing Opportunity  
To meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the Housing Plan includes a
program to promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex,
family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, age, or physical disability.
Goal 5.0       Continue  to  promote  equal  housing  opportunity  in  the 
               City’s  housing  market  regardless  of  age,  race,  color, 
               national  origin,  ancestry,  sex,  disability,  marital  status, 
               familial status, source of income, sexual orientation, and 
               any other arbitrary factors. 
Policy 5.1     Provide fair housing services to Hercules residents, and ensure that residents
               are aware of their rights and responsibilities regarding fair housing.
Policy 5.2     Provide equal access to housing for special needs residents such as the
               homeless, elderly, and disabled.
Policy 5.3     Promote the provisions of disabled-accessible units and housing for mentally
               and physically disabled.
Policy 5.4     Establish a means to facilitate resolutions of problems and conflicts that may
               occur in tenant-landlord relations.
Implementing Programs
Program 5a: Fair Housing 
The City actively furthers fair housing in the community. Specifically, the City continues to
support the County in its activities to promote fair housing. The City refers complaints
regarding fair housing and housing discrimination issues to the Contra Costa County and
maintains this service using CDBG funds.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
          Continue to support the County and refer any complaints and inquiries to the
           County for resolution and services.
          Advertise fair housing services of the County at public counters, through the
           City website, and at various community locations, including the City Library,
           Community Centers, and Senior Center.

Program 5b Reasonable Accommodation 
The Fair Housing Act requires that cities and counties provide reasonable accommodation
to rules, policies, practices, and procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to
afford equal access to housing to individuals with disabilities. While fair housing laws
intend that all people have equal access to housing, the law also recognizes that people with
disabilities may need extra tools to achieve equal access. Reasonable accommodation
provides a means of requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of
land use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions
or requirements, because it is necessary to achieve equal access to housing. Cities and
counties are required to consider requests for accommodation related to housing for people
with disabilities and to provide accommodation when it is determined to be “reasonable”
based on fair housing laws and the case law interpreting the statutes. The City amended the
Zoning Ordinance in February 2015 to establish a standard procedure for reasonable
accommodation.
Objectives and Timeframe: 
           Advertise the program through City website and provide brochure at public
            counters.
           Provide technical assistance regarding the application requirements and
            procedures to persons/entities seeking reasonable accommodation.
           Within one year of the Housing Element adoption, revise the Reasonable
            Accommodation Ordinance to remove the primary residence requirement,
            thereby allowing the application of reasonable accommodation to all dwellings,
            including second homes.

Program 5c Cooperation with Contra Costa Health Services Homeless Program 
The mission of the Contra Costa County Homeless Program is to ensure an integrated
system of care, from prevention through intervention, for homeless individuals and families
within the community. Contra Costa Health Services strives to accomplish this through the
development of policies and practices, community involvement, advocacy, and the
coordination of services that strengthen partnerships and maximize resources. To develop
greater understanding of local needs and to serve residents more effectively, the Homeless
Program conducts a biennial Point-in-Time count, with the assistance of volunteers
throughout the county.

6. Promote Energy Efficiency and Conservation 
Energy conservation can be achieved through environmentally sensitive site planning
techniques and implementing building codes that require use of construction materials that
maximize energy efficiency. Conserving energy has the dial benefit of reducing housing
costs and improving environmental quality.
Goal 6.0       Promote energy efficiency and conservation throughout 
               Hercules. 
Policy 6.1     Promote the use of Green Building techniques in residential development.
Policy 6.2     Ensure all new residential development complies with energy efficiency
               performance standards of the California Building Standards Code.
Policy 6.3     Utilize site planning techniques to allow passive energy efficiencies through
               solar access, landscaping and building orientation.
Policy 6.4     Seek opportunities to educate the public about energy conservation.
Policy 6.5     Encourage energy conservation measures and solar systems in existing
               homes where feasible and cost-effective.

Notes:
    1.    Town Centrale has been approved for 147 rental units. A portion of these units may indeed be
          affordable to lower income households at market rents.
    2.    The City does not have funding to provide rehabilitation assistance directly. However, City residents
          have access to rehabilitation programs offered by the County. The County has indicated an annual
          objective of 25 households countywide. Based on this limited level of funding, the City anticipates only
          four households to be assisted through the County’s program.
    3.    The City does not have any housing projects that are at risk of converting to market rate. The City will
          monitor the status of the three LIHTC projects (totally 244 units).
                                                                                April 2015                           99

                    X. GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Purpose and Intent
   The City of Hercules strives to sustain a desirable life-style by, in part, providing well
   designed and maintained local streets and public facilities and the services that they
   support. City economic development planning has shown that maintaining this life-style
   will require both developing the non-residential sector of the community and continuing to
   provide high quality public facilities and services. In fact, additional non-residential
   revenue will provide the revenue to maintain these facilities. This Element integrates
   performance standards for these facilities into the development review process so that new
   development helps to maintain and improve the quality of life in Hercules.
   This element is also intended to comply with the requirements of the Measure J Growth
   Management Program (GMP). By adopting and implementing this Element, the City
   intends to establish a comprehensive, long-range program that will match the demands for
   multi-modal transportation facilities and services generated by new development with
   plans, capital improvement programs, and development mitigation programs. The Urban
   Limit Line is intended to promote compact urban development patterns that promote
   efficient use of existing and future infrastructure and restrict the extension of infrastructure
   into areas where urban development is not planned.
B. Background
   Measure J: The Measure J GMP, adopted by voters of Contra Costa County in November
   2004, is a 25-year extension of the previous Measure C Contra Costa Transportation
   Improvement and Growth Management Program approved by voters in 1988. Both
   programs include a ½ percent transportation and retail transactions and use tax intended to
   address existing major regional transportation problems; Measure J extended the
   countywide sales tax through the year 2034. The Growth Management component is
   intended to assure that future residential, business, and commercial growth pays for the
   facilities required to meet the demands resulting from that growth. Measure J requires that
   tax revenues be dedicated to transportation projects in Contra Costa County and to the
   implementation of a Growth Management Program by all the cities and the County.
   Specifically, Measure J provides funding for three categories of transportation projects:
   1. Transportation projects identified in Measure J;
   2. Paratransit programs; and
   3. Transportation projects funded by Local Street Maintenance and Improvement or
       “Return-to-Source” funds.
   Return-to-Source funds are revenues derived from the additional sales tax that are
   distributed to participating general purpose governments in Contra Costa County. The
   system of distribution is based on a formula which includes the jurisdiction’s population
   and the miles of streets and highways within the jurisdiction. To qualify for its share of the
                                                1

   Measure J Return-to-Source funds, as well as Transportation for Livable Community Funds
   from the Transportation Authority, the City of Hercules is required to:
   1. Adopt a Growth Management Element as part of the General Plan;
   2. Adopt a development mitigation program (adopted by Resolution 09-136 on September
       8, 2009, and Resolution 11-132 on November 8, 2011);
   3. Provide diverse housing options for people who live and work in Hercules (refer to
       Chapter 5 of the City of Hercules Housing Element Update 2009–2014, adopted by
       Resolution 13-075 on July 9, 2013);
   4. Participate in cooperative multi-jurisdictional planning (Hercules continues to be an
       active participant on the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee);
   5. Maintain the adopted Urban Limit Line (ULL) (adopted by Resolution 09-007 on
       January 13, 2009);
   6. Implement a five-year Capital Improvement Program (the 5-year CIP is updated
       annually); and
   7. Adopt a Transportation Systems Management Ordinance or Resolution (adopted by
       Ordinance 334 on December 9, 1997).
   This element satisfies the requirement for the City of Hercules and is consistent with the
   standards established by Measure J and the Contra Costa County General Plan.
   Economic Development: This Element expands upon the fundamental goals in this
   General Plan for new development. The Introduction of the General Plan calls for the City
   to develop as a balanced community, with a mixture of residential, commercial, office,
   industrial, and public uses. The City’s Economic Development Strategy Plan (adopted in
   June 1990) points out that the quality of life in Hercules is dependent on the adequate
   provision of economic opportunities and City services.
   At present, achieving this vision of a balanced community means promoting the
   development of non-residential areas. The City now provides a variety of housing
   opportunities and residentially-oriented series, but employment and shopping opportunities
   are severely limited. Therefore, the intent of this Element is not to limit new development,
   but to manage new development in order to maintain, and enhance, the quality of life in
   Hercules.
C. Authority
   California law authorizes cities and counties to adopt general plan elements in addition to
   the seven required elements. Section 65303 of the California Government Code states,
     “The General Plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects
     which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development
     of the county or city.”
                                               2

    As discussed above, this Element is included in the General Plan to establish city goals and
    policies to accommodate new development consistent with traffic service standards and the
    performance standards for public facilities.
    This Element also is consistent with the requirements of Contra Costa’s Transportation
    Sales Tax Expenditure Plan (Measure J), approved by Contra Costa County voters in 2004,
    and as amended by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority.
D.  Relation to Other Plan Elements
    As one of the adopted Elements of the City’s General Plan, this Element will help achieve
    the fundamental City goals of providing a desirable quality of life. In addition, the policies
    in this Element help to define the goals in other Elements by providing quantified standards
    for public facilities. New development will be evaluated for conformance with these
    standards, as well as the goals and policies in the other Elements.
E.  Organization
    The structure of this Element is based on the model element published by the Contra Costa
    Transportation Authority. Section II provides the goals, objectives, and policies for the
    traffic standards. Section III presents the goals, objectives, and policies for the six other
    types of public facilities.
II. TRAFFIC SERVICE STANDARDS AND PROGRAMS
A.  Introduction
    Unlike the preceding Measure C that it replaced, Measure J does not require a qualifying
    Growth Management Element to include traffic level-of-services (LOS) standards for local
    streets (those streets not designated as “regional routes”). However, local jurisdictions can
    elect to maintain performance standards and LOS standards for non-regional routes and
    policies and programs to achieve and maintain those standards. This section presents those
    standards for the City of Hercules, as implemented under Measure C and continued by the
    City under Measure J. These standards will allow the City to evaluate the traffic impacts of
    new development (through project traffic studies) and to verify adequate traffic operations
    (through annual review of key City intersections).
    Traffic service standards apply to signalized intersections because current traffic
    engineering analysis methods do not provide an estimate of overall LOS for unsignalized
    intersections.
B.  Definitions
    Measure C established two separate programs for managing traffic operations: one for
    “Routes of Regional Significance” and the other for “Basic Routes.” Routes of Regional
    Significance are designated by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) in
    consultation with affected cities, the County, and the regional transportation planning
    committees. In general, these routes connect two or more regions of the county, or connect
    the county to other counties. As with Measure C, Measure J assigns planning responsibility
                                                3

   for Routes of Regional Significance to regional transportation planning committees,
   including the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee (WCCTAC) in West
   County. WCCTAC includes the five West County cities (Hercules, Pinole, San Pablo, El
   Cerrito, and Richmond), plus Contra Costa County, and is responsible for developing an
   Action Plan (including traffic service standards and impact mitigation measures) for these
   routes. Each West County city and the county must participate in WCCTAC and
   implement the Action Plan in order to remain in compliance with Measure J. CCTA has
   designated three Routes of Regional Significance in Hercules: I-80, SR 4, and San Pablo
   Avenue.
   Streets not designated as Routes of Regional Significance are considered “Basic Routes,”
   for which each individual agency has responsibility for traffic operations on these streets in
   its jurisdiction.
   In recognition that different streets serve different functions, LOS standards for Basic
   Routes vary for different land use types. Two of these types are found in Hercules, and are
   defined as follows:
   •    Suburban – Areas designated in the General Plan for low- and medium-density single-
        family homes, low-density multi-family residences, low-density neighborhood and
        community-oriented commercial/industrial uses, and other accompanying uses. This
        land use type encompasses most of the residential areas in Hercules (except where
        residential development adjoins commercial or industrial development).
   •    Urban – Areas designated in the General Plan primarily for multi-family housing, with
        smaller areas designated for high-density single family homes; low to moderate density
        commercial/industrial uses, and many other accompanying uses. This land use type
        encompasses the commercial and industrial areas of Hercules.
   In addition, segments of Willow Avenue and Sycamore Avenue function more like streets
   in a “Major Commercial Center,” because these street segments serve as the only
   connection between the east and west sides of the City, and the I-80 on- and off-ramps.
C. Goals
   The following goals are adopted for traffic operations in the City of Hercules:
   1. The City shall maintain traffic operations on streets that are designated as “Basic
        Routes” at the standard described below. These goals replace the Level-of-Service
        policy in the Circulation Element (page 11, policy 2a).
   2. The City shall participate in the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee
        regarding traffic operations on Routes of Regional Significance and objectives for
        multi-modal transit service, and shall help meet the goals and multi-modal service
        standards for these routes by implementing the Action Plans for those routes, as
        adopted by the City and Contra Costa Transportation Authority.
                                              4

   3. New development shall be required to pay its fair share of the cost of improving
       existing City streets so that compliance with the designated LOS is maintained.
   4. New development shall be required to pay its fair share of the cost of improving
       regional routes so that compliance with the service standard specified in the Action
       Plan (when adopted) is maintained.
   Additional goals regarding the City circulation system are contained in the Circulation and
   Scenic Highway Element.
D. Traffic Service Standards for Basic Routes (Local Streets)
     1. Traffic operations on City Basic Routes shall meet the following standards.
             LOS High-D to Low-E (maximum v/c ratio is 0.94)
             − Sycamore Avenue (from Willow Avenue to San Pablo Avenue)
             − Willow Avenue (from I-80 ramps to Sycamore)
             LOS High-D – (maximum v/c ratio is 0.89)
             − Sycamore Avenue (SR-4 – Willow)
             − Refugio Valley Road (Sycamore – Redwood/Falcon)
             − Alfred Nobel Drive
             − Linus Pauling Drive
             − James Watson Drive
             − John Muir Parkway
             LOS “Low” D – (maximum v/c ratio is 0.84)
             − All other Basic Routes (except Routes of Regional Significance)
     Compliance with these standards shall be determined through preparation of a traffic
     study for each proposed project that would generate 100 or more peak hour trips
     (morning or evening). This study would estimate the existing LOS and project the future
     LOS (seven years after scheduled project occupancy) at all signalized intersections that
     would be affected by the proposed project. (Arterial streets are shown on the Circulation
     Plan in the Circulation Element.) The calculation of the future LOS will take into account
     all existing, approved, and proposed projects (for which entitlement applications are
     complete when the traffic study is begun) and all existing and programmed street and
     highway improvements.
     At the intersection of Willow Avenue and Sycamore Avenue, a LOS range is established
     to require careful consideration of the benefits of a project that would cause the LOS to
     each Low-E. Projects that would not cause an exceedence of LOS High-D would be
     reviewed through the normal process. Projects that could result in Low-E would require
     approval by the City Council. The City Council could approve such projects if it finds
     that the project provides substantial benefit to the City or the community through either
     the creation of substantial jobs, creation of a substantial long-term revenue potential to
     support City services, or the provision of a substantial amount of affordable housing.
                                               5

     Projects for which this finding could not be made would not be approved through this
     process.
     2. Objectives and Standards for Regional Routes in Hercules will be included in the
         Action Plan for those routes, and will be incorporated into this Element upon
         completion and adoption.
     3. At intersections on Basic Routes where physical or environmental conditions make
         further improvements to the intersection infeasible or inappropriate, the City may
         make a “Finding of Special Circumstances.” Approval of a finding for a particular
         intersection will include alternative mitigation; projects that will generate traffic that
         will impact such an intersection shall be required to implement or participate in the
         alternative mitigation.
E. Implementing Policies and Programs
   1. The LOS standards in this Element will be used to evaluate the traffic impacts of new
       developments, and no application shall be approved which may cause a violation of
       these standards unless either:
       a. Improvements that will mitigate the projected LOS impact are programmed in the
           City’s Capital Improvement Program; or,
       b. A Finding of Special Circumstances has been made for the intersection; or,
       c. Improvements will be made by a project sponsor as part of a project.
   2. The City shall develop and implement a mitigation program to insure that new
       development pays its fair share of the cost of maintaining adequate operations on the
       Basic Routes and the Routes of Regional Significance. The revenue provided from
       Measure J will not be used to replace developer funding that has or would have been
       committed to any transportation project.
   3. As mentioned above, a traffic study shall be performed for any proposed project that
       may generate 100 or more vehicle trips during the morning or afternoon peak hour.
       This traffic study shall be prepared in compliance with the technical guidelines issued
       by the Contra Cost Transportation Authority, and shall be funded by the project sponsor
       under the direction of City staff.
   4. Mitigation measures and conditions of project approval may include payment of fees to
       fund improvements on Basic Routes or Routes of Regional Significance. Fees for
       improvements to Basic Routes shall be deposited in a separate City Traffic Mitigation
       Fund. Fees for improvements to a regional route shall be handled in accordance with
       the Action Plan for the affect regional route.
   5. Improvements to Basic Routes shall be programmed through the City’s Capital
       Improvement Program.
                                               6

     6. Improvements to a Route of Regional Significance which are sponsored by the City of
         Hercules shall also be programmed through the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
     7. Improvements to a Route of Regional Significance that are not sponsored by the City of
         Hercules shall be programmed by the sponsoring agency, and may be acknowledged in
         the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
     8. The City shall require new development to incorporate transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
         access where feasible and appropriate, consistent with the Land Use Element, the
         Circulation Element, and the Countywide Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan.
     9. The City shall continue to participate actively (at both the staff and the policy level) in
         the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee and the Contra Costa
         Transportation Authority. Participation in these agencies shall include, but may not be
         limited to, full implementation of adopted Action Plans for Routes of Regional
         Significance in order to promote acceptable traffic movement on these routes. In the
         event that problems/issues cannot be resolved through discussion among the affected
         parties, the City will participate in CCTA’s conflict resolution process.
     10. The City shall report annually regarding compliance with the Measure J Growth
         Management Program, or as may be requested by the Contra Costa Transportation
         Authority.
     11. The City shall adopt and implement a Transportation Demand Management Program,
         including the required policies adopted by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority.
         Such a program may be jointly implemented in Western Contra Costa County by the
         five cities and the County through the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory
         Committee.
     12. The City shall assist the Contra Costa Transportation Authority in maintaining its travel
         demand modeling system by providing information on proposed transportation
         improvements, including those adopted as part of the City’s Capital Improvement
         Program, planned and approved development within the City, and long-range plans
         relative to the Association of Bay Area Governments projections for households and
         jobs within the City of Hercules.
III. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR CAPITAL FACILITIES
A.   Introduction
     The Introduction to the City’s General Plan calls for development of a balanced
     community. This section of the GME states specific performance standards to define and
     achieve that “balance” with regard to capital facilities, which are the physical basis for
     public services provided by the City, the Rodeo–Hercules Fire Protection District, and the
     East Bay Municipal Utility District (water). These performance standards take into account
     fiscal constraints and the City’s development review process, with the intent of more fully
     integrating facility planning into the City’s development review process and ensuring that
                                                 7

   new development does not exceed the capacity of capital facilities for the cited services
   without providing funding for improvements to accommodate the new demand.
   Improvements or expansions to these facilities will be programmed through the City’s
   Capital Improvement Program and budget, or the budgets of the service-providing
   agencies, as appropriate.
   The City has determined performance standards, maintained through capital projects, for
   the following services:
   1.  Fire
   2.  Police
   3.  Parks
   4.  Sanitary Facilities (sewer)
   5.  Water
   6.  Flood Control
   This element also includes a performance standard for stormwater drainage facilities to
   respond to federal requirements to control pollution in stormwater run-off.
B. Goals
   The Introduction to this General Plan states a primary objective of all the General Plan
   Elements is to “provide a functional and compatible arrangement of residential,
   commercial, industrial, public uses, and open spaces.” The performance standards in this
   Element are intended to help achieve this goal and the following goals:
   1. Provide adequate service capacity in public facilities to support the provision of public
       services to existing and new development.
   2. Develop facilities that meet specific identified needs, while placing strong emphasis on
       facilities that can adapt to the needs of changing activities and programs.
   3. Coordinate City projects with plans of other agencies that could contribute to the
       success of projects in Hercules and surrounding areas.
C. Existing Facilities
   1. Fire District Service: The Rodeo/Hercules Fire Protection District provides fire,
       emergency medical, and related services in the City. The District provides primary
       response in the City from the station at 1680 Refugio Valley Road. This 3-bay station
       provides garage space for up to six fire engines/trucks. It also provides living and
       sleeping areas for three-person fire crews operating 24-hours-per-day. Facilities are
       provided for both male and female fire fighters. Back-up response is provided from the
       Rodeo station, which includes two equipment bays and living/sleeping
       accommodations for three-person crews.
       The Hercules station was opened in 1991 and also serves are the headquarters for the
       District. It was designed and built by the City on City-owned land, and paid for with
                                                 8

   City and developer funds. The station is owned by the City and is leased to the District
   for $1.00/year.
2. Police: Police service is provided by the Hercules Police Department. The Department
   operates out of the Hercules City Hall. Existing facilities include investigative and
   administrative offices, evidence storage, detention area, and related facilities. Police
   dispatch is provided jointly with the City of Pinole through the Pinole Police
   Department.
3. Parks: The City maintains one community and ten neighborhood parks, and plans to
   develop a second community park. The community parks include Refugio Valley Park,
   and the planned Waterfront Park. Refugio Valley Park encompasses Refugio Lake and
   surrounding facilities (near the intersection of Refugio Valley Road and Pheasant
   Drive), the Linear Park along Refugio Creek (on the north side of Refugio Valley
   Road), and the Community and Swim Center (near the intersection of Refugio Valley
   Road and Redwood Road). These facilities encompass a total of 66.26 acres. The
   planned Waterfront Park is located along San Pablo Bay near the intersection of
   Railroad Avenue and Santa Fe. At present, it encompasses 7.14 acres, most of which is
   owned by the State of California and is leased to the East Bay Regional Parks District.
   The Land Use Element and Waterfront District Master Plan call for expansion of this
   park along the Bay front, including Hercules Point.
   The ten neighborhood parks dispersed throughout the city encompass about 38 acres.
   The City also maintains systems of trails and open space areas, distributed throughout
   the City. These open space areas encompass a total of approximately 950 acres. The
   open space areas and the City parks together account for approximately ½ of the total
   land area within the existing City limits. In addition, the homeowners’ association for
   the Refugio Valley Ranch development also owns about 320 acres of permanent open
   space.
4. Sanitary Facilities (Sewer): Sewer treatment capacity is provided at the Pinole/Hercules
   Plant, which the City jointly owns with the City of Pinole. In 1983, the City established
   an assessment district to fund an expansion of the Pinole/Hercules Plant. Through that
   assessment district, properties in Hercules are allocated approximately 2.0 million
   gallons per day (mgd) of treatment capacity. The City of Pinole also owns about 2.0
   mgd of capacity, and operates the plant through a contract with the City of Hercules.
   The plant provides secondary treatment, as required by State regulations. Treated
   effluent is pumped through a force-main and gravity flow system to the site of the
   Rodeo Sanitary District Treatment Plant, where it is combined with effluent from the
   Rodeo Treatment Plant, and then discharged through a deep-water outfall into San
   Pablo Bay.
5. Stormwater Drainage: The City maintains stormwater drainage facilities in the
   incorporated area. Stormwater is collected and conveyed to existing creek channels or
   San Pablo Bay. In 2005, the City adopted Ordinance 404 to implement federal National
   Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) requirements.
                                          9

   6. Water: The East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) provides water services in
      the City of Hercules. EBMUD’s Maloney pressure zone provides services to properties
      up to an elevation of 200 feet above sea level. Water mains are extended, and new
      connections provided, when properties are developed. Water service above the 200-feet
      elevation cannot be provided from the Maloney pressure zone. In these areas, water
      service is generally provided by constructing water reservoirs to serve specific areas.
      Sufficient storage capacity is provided to accommodate both normal use and emergency
      water requirements.
   7. Flood Control: Existing City ordinance requires new development to provide on-site
      flood protection (see Hercules Municipal Code Title 10, Chapter 7, “Flood Damage
      Prevention”). Flood Hazard areas are defined in this ordinance according to
      designations on the federal Flood Insurance Rate Map, which is generally based on the
      100-year flood.
D. Proposed New Facilities Improvements
   1. Park: A new community park (about 10 acres) is planned at Hercules Point as part of
      development of the Waterfront District. Additional neighborhood parks may be located
      in new developments, if needed, to serve new residences at those properties.
   2. Franklin Canyon includes about 483 acres of open space that the Muir Heritage Land
      Trust will open to the public. On-site trails will connect to the regional trail system.
   3. Sanitary Facilities (Sewer): The City of Hercules shares with the City of Pinole a
      wastewater treatment facility located at 11 Tennant Avenue in Pinole. The dry weather
      permitted flows are currently 3.52 mgd (million gallons per day) with a current wet
      weather flow capacity of approximately 10.3 mgd. The two cities are currently under
      design to increase the capacity of the plant. The new dry weather flow capacity will be
      4.06 mgd, and the wet weather flows capacity will be approximately 20mgd. In
      addition, the City of Hercules will be rehabilitating approximately one mile of 24-inch
      gravity line.
   4. Stormwater Drainage: Existing stormwater facilities will be upgraded to meet NPDES
      requirements. At the Sphere of Influence properties, facilities will be incorporated into
      construction plans, and will be installed as part of property development.
   5. Water: Facilities to provide adequate water service to undeveloped properties in the
      City and the Sphere of Influence (including mains, service pipes, and reservoirs) will be
      installed as part of property development. Water service infrastructure will be designed
      to conform with EBMUD requirements and will be funded by project sponsors.
   6. Flood Control: Flooding hazards in the area west of San Pablo Avenue will be resolved
      by installing flood control improvements along Refugio Creek and Chelsea Wetlands
      adjacent to Pinole Creek. These improvements will be installed prior to or as part of
      development of the affected or neighboring properties. On-site retention will be
      incorporated into development plans, as needed, to avoid causing down-stream flooding
                                              10

       during a 100-year storm. The Chelsea wetland restoration is scheduled to begin in
       spring of 2014.
E. Performance Standards for Capital Facilities
   The following standards for the City of Hercules are intended to reflect the ability of the
   City or the responsible agency to provide and maintain capital facilities, consistent with
   other uses of scarce revenues. Changes in the City’s fiscal situation may require adjusting
   or reducing these standards in order to maintain a balance between funding for these capital
   facilities and funding for other facilities and services. The City would consider such
   revision through an amendment to this Element.
   1. Fire District Services: Fire Station(s) shall be located in the City so that five minutes
       emergency response time may be achieved by first response units for 90% of all
       emergency calls. Fire stations shall be sized to accommodate a minimum of two (2)
       engines/trucks and three-person, 24-hour crews.
   2. Police: Office and supporting facilities shall be provided in a central headquarters
       facility. Communication equipment (including repeater stations) shall be provided to
       allow communication between dispatch and police units throughout the service area.
   3. Parks:
       •    Neighborhood Parks: A minimum of 1.75 acres of neighborhood parks shall be
                                   provided for each 1,000 residents.
       •    Community Parks:       A minimum of 3.25 acres of community park space shall be
                                   provided for each 1,000 residents.
       •    Open Space:            A minimum of 34 acres of open space (public and private
                                   combined) shall be provided for each 1,000 residents.
   4. Sanitary Facilities (Sewer): Capability to transmit and treat waste water from all
       residential and non-residential developments to standards set by the Regional Water
       Quality Control Board.
   5. Stormwater Drainage: Meet federal NPDES requirements for stormwater run-off.
   6. Water: Capability to provide potable water supply to all residential and non-residential
       developments.
   7. Flood Control: All new structures shall be located outside the Flood Zones A & B as
       designated by the Flood Insurance Rate Map (prepared by the Federal Emergency
       Management Agency (FEMA); or, insure that the finished floor elevation is at least 1
       foot above the flood elevation as determined by FEMA. Development of any property
       shall not significantly increase the flooding potential at downstream areas, or otherwise
       significantly impact or aggravate a flooding problem at downstream properties.
                                               11

F. Implementing Policies and Programs
   1. The City shall review all development plans for conformance with the performance
      standards in this Element. The City will approve a development application only after
      making findings that one or more of the following conditions are met:
      a. Assuming participation in adopted mitigation programs, performance standards will
          be maintained following the project occupancy; or
      b. Because of the characteristic of the development project, project-specific mitigation
          measures are needed in order to insure maintenance of standards, and such
          measures will be required of the project sponsor; or
      c. Capital projects in the Capital Improvements Program (or planned by service-
          providing special districts) will result in maintenance of a performance standards.
   2. The City will establish and implement a development mitigation program to insure that
      new growth is paying its share of the cost associated with the maintenance of these
      standards. The revenue provided from Measure J will not be used to replace developer
      funding that has or would have been committed to any transportation project.
   3. The City shall require all new development to contribute to or participate in the
      improvement of the above-mentioned facilities and systems in proportion to the
      demand generated by project occupants and users.
   4. Fees collected pursuant to these policies shall be deposited in special funds, and shall
      be used to support construction of improvements to the above-mentioned
      facilities/improvements, as programmed through the City’s Capital Improvement
      Program and budget.
   5. The City will:
      a. Demonstrate reasonable progress in implementation of the adopted Housing
          Element and subsequent Housing Plan.
      b. Consider impacts of land use and development policies on the transportation
          system.
      c. Document how policies that support bicycle and pedestrian access in new
          development have been incorporated into the City’s planning and regulatory
          documents.
   6. The City will abide by and use the “Principles of Agreement” described in Attachment
      A of Measure J, as amended by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, for the
      maintenance of and any future amendments to its adopted Urban Limit Line (ULL).
