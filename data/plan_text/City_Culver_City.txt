City of Culver City Housing Element
Preface to Housing Element
The Housing Element is one of nine elements comprising the City of Culver City’s (the
“city”) General Plan (seven of which are mandatory per state law). The General Plan is a
comprehensive, long-term guide for the physical development of the city. The intent of
the General Plan is to communicate the city’s strategic thinking and philosophy for the
future to residential and business communities and to provide for the physical, social,
and economic needs of residents. In essence it is the city’s vision; the Municipal Code
enacts that vision with specific legislative language.
The Housing Element specifically addresses the city’s vision as it relates to housing. It is the
primary planning guide to identify and prioritize the housing needs of the city and outline
the goals, policies, and programs to address those needs while balancing community
character, objectives and resources. It is a planning tool that demonstrates how the city
intends to address its housing needs during the next eight years. More specifically, this
document is required to provide a Land Inventory Analysis that establishes the city’s
ability to accommodate its fair share of the region’s new housing construction. Various
tables in Appendix B list specific parcels that could accommodate new housing
construction with a variety of types and densities. While the land inventory indicates
potential development opportunities, there is no obligation on the part of owners to build
or redevelop these properties to the maximum potential indicated in this inventory of
sites. In the case where the city is the property owner, the city shall determine if
residential development is appropriate and consistent with applicable city plans and
regulations.
References to State Law. Throughout this document are references to state laws related
to housing. These references often cite particular bills – “AB” refers to Assembly Bills while
“SB” refers to Senate Bills – or the relevant section of a state code. Most state laws
relating to housing elements are found in Section 65580 et seq. of the California
Government Code, although some applicable laws are found elsewhere, such as in the
Health & Safety Code. A brief explanation of cited state laws can be found in the
Glossary. Legislative histories and the actual text of these laws may be downloaded at:
http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html.
Elimination of Redevelopment Agencies. Historically affordable housing construction,
retention, rehabilitation, and maintenance were significantly funded by Redevelopment
Agency (RDA) Set-Aside funds created by RDA resources. In essence, implementation of
the city’s Housing Plan has been one of the various functions of the RDA.
Assembly Bill (AB) 26 and AB 27 were passed by the California State Legislature on June
15, 2011, and signed by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. on June 28, 2011. AB 26
immediately suspended all new redevelopment activity and dissolved all redevelopment
agencies effective October 1, 2011.
On December 29 2011, the California Supreme Court issued a final opinion on litigation
challenging AB 26 and AB 27, upholding AB 26, invalidating AB 27, and concluding that
AB 26 could be enforced independently from AB 27. The Court's opinion set in motion
                                                vi                                January 2014

short timeframes for agencies and legislative bodies to take necessary actions to comply
with the unwinding of the redevelopment agencies pursuant to AB 26. The Court ruled
that on February 1, 2012, all of the State’s 400 Redevelopment Agencies were to be
dissolved.
Pursuant to AB 26, jurisdictions were required to identify a “Successor Agency" to the
Redevelopment Agency prior to January 13, 2012. On January 9, 2012, the Culver City
City Council adopted a resolution designating the City of Culver City as the Successor
Agency to the Culver City Redevelopment Agency. The Successor Agency is responsible
for maintaining payments on enforceable obligations pursuant to an obligation schedule.
Enforceable Obligations are defined as:
a) Bonds, including debt service, reserves, or other required payments;
b) Loans borrowed by the agency for a lawful purpose including loans from the Low
     and Moderate Income Housing Fund;
c) Payments required by the federal government;
d) Pre-existing obligations to the state or obligations imposed by state law;
e) Legally enforceable payments to agencies' employees, including pension
     obligations and other obligations conferred through a collective bargaining
     agreement;
f) Judgments and settlements entered into by a court or arbitration, retaining appeal
     rights;
g) Legally binding contracts that do not violate the debt limit or public policy; and,
h) Contracts necessary for administration of the agency, such as for office space,
     equipment and supplies, to the extent permitted.
Also on January 9, 2012, the Culver City City Council adopted a resolution activating the
Culver City Housing Authority and designating the Culver City Housing Authority to
receive the transfer of all housing assets, rights, powers, duties, obligation, liabilities and
functions previously performed by the Culver City Redevelopment Agency.
With the Court ruling on AB 26, several Housing Programs that relied on RDA Set-Aside
funds were de-funded effective February 1, 2012. Nevertheless the city has decided to
maintain all Housing Programs from the previous Housing Element. The de-funded
programs will be reactivated if and when future State/Federal funding sources become
available that the city is eligible to acquire. Chapter V and Appendix A of this document
reviews current and past programs.

City of Culver City Housing Element                                           I. Introduction
I.      INTRODUCTION
Incorporated in 1917, Culver City is centrally located between Venice Beach/Marina Del
Rey and downtown Los Angeles.
Culver City is a community of approximately 40,000 residents and measures approxi-
mately five square miles in area. Currently, Culver City’s top five employers are Sony
Pictures Entertainment, G & K Management Co., Culver City Unified School District,
Brotman Medical Center, and the City of Culver City (city government) according to the
city’s 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
Today Culver City is a destination filled with outdoor cafes, unique shops and galleries
opening onto pedestrian-friendly boulevards, nationally recognized historic buildings,
media facilities, creative office uses, transit-oriented development, and the Hayden
Tract, which serves as a creative industries hub. Throughout its history Culver City has
maintained a small town atmosphere for its residents, has preserved single- and two-
family neighborhoods, and nurtured medium-density multiple-family apartments and
condominiums.
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
The purpose of the Housing Element is to identify the city’s housing needs and outline
goals, policies, and programs to address them. The Housing Element is an eight-year
plan, extending from October 1, 2013 through October 1, 2021. The primary issues
addressed in the Housing Element include: 1) preservation and improvement of the
existing housing stock, 2) housing availability for special needs populations, 3) planning
for a sufficient supply of new housing to meet the city’s fair share of regional need, and
4) fair housing.
B.      Overview
State law requires the preparation of a Housing Element as part of a jurisdiction's General
Plan (Government Code §65302(c)). It is the primary planning guide for local jurisdictions
to identify and prioritize the housing needs of the city and determine ways to best meet
these needs while balancing community objectives and resources. The 2013 Housing
Element consists of five chapters: 1) Introduction, 2) Housing Needs Assessment,
3) Resources and Opportunities, 4) Constraints, 5) Housing Plan, and six Appendices. The
evaluation of the 2008 Housing Element is found in Appendix A, while Appendix B
contains background details regarding the city’s inventory of sites for housing
development. Appendix C identifies affordable housing units that are at risk of
conversion to market rate during the next ten years, along with a discussion of potential
resources and methods that could be used to preserve their affordability. A summary of
the public participation program is found in Appendix D, Appendix E contains a list of
Acronyms, while Appendix G contains a Glossary of commonly used terms in this Housing
Element.
                                              I-1                                 January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                            I. Introduction
A key component of the Needs Assessment is the quantification of new housing units
needed to accommodate growth in the region. This process, known as the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), is carried out by the Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) and allocates to each jurisdiction a share of new housing need
based on demographic trends, employment, and other community characteristics. The
RHNA identifies the level of new housing need that cities must plan for, but is not a
construction mandate or “quota”. The RHNA process is described further in Chapter II.
Guidelines adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Develop-
ment must also be considered in the preparation of the Housing Element (§65585).
Periodic review of the Housing Element is required to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of
its goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the attainment of the state housing
goals, (2) its effectiveness in attaining the city's housing goals and objectives and (3) the
progress of its implementation (§65588).
C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Culver City,
and this update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested
parties numerous opportunities for review and comment. Public notices of all Housing
Element meetings and public hearings were published in the local newspaper in
advance of each meeting, as well as posting the notices on the city’s website. The draft
Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall, posted on the city’s website,
as well as at the Culver City Julian Dixon Public Library. The document was also made
available to housing organizations, housing advocates, and non-profit organizations
representing the interests of lower-income persons and special needs groups.
As part of the public review process, a joint City Council/Planning Commission Study
Sessions/Public Workshop, Planning Commission Public Hearing, and City Council Public
Hearing on the Housing Element were held. An extensive effort was made to inform
interested parties, including representatives of lower-income and special needs persons,
of all opportunities for involvement in the Housing Element update process. All of the
public meetings served as venues for review and discussion. Appendix D provides a
summary of public notification efforts and the comments and issues raised during the
preparation and public review of the 2013-2021 Housing Element.
After receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the state Housing and
Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was prepared
and made available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
D.      State Housing Element Requirements
The preparation of the Housing Element is guided by California Government Code,
Article 10.6. The law governing the contents of Housing Elements is among the most
detailed of all elements of the General Plan. According to §65583 of the Government
Code:
                                               I-2                                 January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                           I. Introduction
        The Housing Element shall consist of an identification and analysis of
        existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
        quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for
        the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.               The
        Housing Element shall identify adequate sites for housing, including rental
        housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, and emergency shelters,
        and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs
        of all economic segments of the community.
E.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
This Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with other General Plan
elements. The policies and programs in this Element reflect the policy direction contained
in the rest of the General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the
future, the General Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed to ensure
internal consistency is maintained.
The Land Use Element guides the type and intensity of housing units that can be
constructed in the various land use districts. Areas in the Land Use Element that are
designated for commercial and industrial uses create employment opportunities, which
in turn, create demand for housing. The Circulation Element establishes the location and
scale of streets, highways and other transportation routes that provide access to
residential neighborhoods and to the employment areas.
Because of the requirement for consistency between the various General Plan elements,
any proposed amendment or update to a General Plan Element will be evaluated
against the other General Plan Elements to ensure that no conflicts occur.
SB 1087 of 2005 (Government Code §65589.7) requires cities to provide a copy of their
Housing Elements to local water and sewer providers, and also requires that these
agencies provide priority hookups for developments with lower-income housing. The
Housing Element will be provided to these agencies immediately upon adoption.

II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines the city’s general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, employment, household composition and size, household income, and special
needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of units and type, tenure, age
and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally, the city’s projected housing growth needs
based on the 2013 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the U.S. Census American
Communities Survey that was provided to the city by the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) and other sources such as the Westside Regional Center (WRC) which
serves the developmentally disabled population. The data from SCAG is certified by the
California State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for use in the
Housing Element and provides a community profile and Housing Needs Assessment for Culver
City. Culver City’s profile has not changed significantly since the prior 2008-2014 Housing
Element was adopted and certified by HCD.
U.S. Census American Communities Survey. Several of the data sets in this chapter rely on the
American Community Survey rather than the 2010 Census. The majority of data produced from
the Decennial Census results from a “short form” questionnaire mailed to all known residential
addresses. The short form asks for limited information. A majority of the data needed to provide
a profile of the city’s characteristics is found in the U.S. Census American Communities Survey
which is carried out at periodic intervals throughout a 10-year period in between the Decennial
Census. The data is extrapolated from a “long form” questionnaire which is mailed out to a
random cross section of the population, providing a more accurate picture of the city’s
population, housing, income, economic, and employment characteristics. This detailed
information cannot always be found in the Decennial Census data sets.
A.      Population Characteristics
       1.      Growth Trends
The City of Culver City grew very slowly during the 1980s and 1990s. Most of the city’s limited
growth in the last 30 years has occurred since 2000, with a population increase of over 5% from
2000 to 2007, to a current population of 38,883 (2010 Census). See Table II-1 below. Table II-2
below shows that according to SCAG data, the estimated population for the city in 2008 was
38,900. The data sets demonstrate a slow growth rate for the city. This is similar to the trend for
other Westside cities, but contrasts with Los Angeles County, which grew by 18.5% between
1980 and 1990, 8.1% between 1990 and 2000, and an additional 8.2% since 2000. As an
essentially built-out city, there have been few opportunities for growth during the last 30 years,
except through redevelopment and urban infill.

Table II-2 shows population, household, and employment projections for Culver City for the
years 2020 and 2035; the base year for the projections is 2008. The slow population growth rate
as noted in Table II-1 is expected to continue as noted in Table II-2 with a rate of 2.8%. With a
slow expected population growth rate, households are not expected to increase by a
significant amount. However there is an expected increase of 5,000 new jobs during the same
projection period. Appendix B – Land Inventory – indicates the city has sufficient land capacity
to build new housing that may be needed in the future to accommodate new residents as a
result of increased employment opportunities.

B.      Household Characteristics
Household characteristics are an indicator of the type and size of housing needed in a city. The
Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing unit, which may include
single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons that
share a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as dormitories, retirement or convalescent
homes, group homes, or other similar living situations are included in population totals, but are
not considered households.
According to the 2005-2009 American Community Survey, Culver City had a total of 16,958
housing units and 16,278 households.
                                                                        II-2                                                            January 2014

       1.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S.
Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person
per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding when there are more
than 1.5 residents per room. Overcrowded households are usually a reflection of the lack of
affordable housing (see Section D4, below for a detailed definition of “affordable” housing).
Table II-3 summarizes overcrowding for Culver City as reported in the 2005-2009 American
Community Survey.

Based on U.S. Census standards, Culver City residents live in relatively less crowded housing
conditions than the rest of Los Angeles County. According to 2005-2009 American Community
Survey, in Culver City, 3.2% or 521 units of all occupied units were considered overcrowded
based on U.S. Census criteria, including 1.6% of owner-occupied units and 5.5% of renter-
occupied units. Overcrowding in both owner-occupied and renter-occupied units in the city is
less than one-half of the county level.
       2.      Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community – with the
exception of senior citizens or others who own a home with little or no mortgage, the ability of
residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. Housing needs and
assistance programs are based on income categories established in state and federal law. The
five categories used in Housing Elements are as follows:

The Extremely-Low, Very-Low and Low categories taken together are referred to as “Lower-
Income.”
According to SCAG’s profile of Culver City and the 2010 Census, the median household income
in Culver City was $67,736, (about 26% higher than for Los Angeles County). As shown on Table
II-4 below, approximately 29.8% of Culver City households fell within the Lower-Income
categories, while just 15.61% were Moderate and 54.54 % were Above-Moderate. About 9.98%
are estimated to fall within the Extremely-Low category (<30% of AMI).

       3.      Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of gross
household income. Table II-5 displays estimates for overpayment by households during the 2005
– 2009 American Community Survey period by percent of income. Approximately 2,931 renter
households (or 43.7% of renter households) and approximately 3,992 owner households (or
41.6% of owner households) were overpaying for housing. Overall 42.5% of all households, both
renters and owners were found to be overpaying for housing.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits that help
to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to defer
maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For lower-income
renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in overcrowding and
related problems.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and size of
housing residents can afford.
       1.      Current Employment
Current employment has a significant influence on housing needs during this planning period.
Table II-6 shows that the city had a workforce of 19,772 persons, as reported by 2005-2009
American Community Survey.
According to the figures in Table II-6 approximately 54.25% of the city’s working residents were
employed in management and professional occupations. About 22.65% were in service related
employment and technical, skilled and unskilled occupations constituted 23.10%.

As of 2005 the five largest employment sectors within Los Angeles County were manufacturing
(484,776 employees), retail trade (410,193 employees), health care & social assistance (424,173
employees), professional, scientific and technical services (359,249 employees), and
accommodation & food services (323,460 employees) 1. At 54.25 %, Culver City employed
residents have a higher representation of professionals than the rest of the County.
        2.       Jobs in Culver City and Projected Job Growth
While Culver City residents are more likely to be employed in management and professional
occupations, jobs in the city are more evenly distributed as shown in Table II-7 below.
Management and professional jobs constitute the majority of the 45,340 jobs in the city (16,715
jobs or 36.9%). Technical, manufacturing, skilled, and unskilled employment is represented by
15,065 jobs or 33.2% while service sector jobs constitute 13,560 jobs or 29.9% of the total 45,340
jobs. These numbers are reflected in the significant number of jobs in such places as City Hall,
Sony, and Symantec (professional); warehousing and studio related skilled and unskilled jobs in
the Hayden Tract (technical/skilled/unskilled); and the numerous restaurants and retail stores
along the Washington and Sepulveda Boulevard commercial corridors and the Westfield Mall
(service). Taken together, skilled, unskilled, technical, and service sector jobs form the majority
of jobs in Culver City. With higher rents and mortgages in the west side of Los Angeles County,
it may be difficult for people employed in these sectors to find affordable housing in or near the
city.

As stated in the beginning of this Chapter, Table II-2 shows projections for Culver City from a
base year of 2008 to 2035 (27 years) for population, households and employment. Table II-2
shows an expected increase of 5,000 new jobs during the projection period. The 2013 RHNA
numbers of 185 units and the land inventory analysis in Appendix B of this document indicate
there is adequate land capacity to construct a sufficient number of dwellings that may be
needed to accommodate new residents attracted by employment.
                                                                  Table II-7

       3.      Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs-to-housing helps to ensure that the demand for housing is
reasonably related to supply. When the number of jobs significantly exceeds the housing supply,
the rental and for-sale housing markets may become overheated, requiring households to pay
a larger percentage of their income for housing. In addition, a tight housing market can result in
overcrowding and longer commute times as workers seek more affordable housing in outlying
areas.
According to Table II-8 below, the current jobs to housing ratio is 2.67 potentially indicating a
need for more housing in the Westside area of Los Angeles County and Culver City. However,
these statistics do not reflect the fact that many people who work in Culver City live in nearby
Westside locations and commute relatively short distances to Culver City jobs. This regional
aspect of employment patterns in Los Angeles County makes it difficult to translate the Culver
City jobs/housing ratio into an unambiguous Culver City housing needs assessment.

helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the number and type of
housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, housing costs,
affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to conversion to market-rate. A
housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile home, or group of rooms, occupied as
separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
       1.      Housing Type and Growth Trends
The 2008-2014 Housing Element reported that the housing stock in Culver City was comprised
predominantly of single-family detached homes, which made up about 39% of all units, and
larger multi-family complexes (5+ units), which comprised about 36% of the total. About 11% of
units were reported as single-family attached (i.e., condo or duplex apartment) units, while
mobile homes comprised the remaining 1%. Homes on residential two family (R2) zoned lots can
either be two detached dwelling units on one parcel or two attached units (also known as a
duplex) on one parcel. Duplexes would be captured under single-family attached and possibly
multi-family 2-4 units. This proportional breakdown in housing type has remained relatively the
same over the years, reflecting Culver City’s slow growth rate and home construction. Table II-9
shows the California Department of Finance estimates for 2013. Single family detached and
multi-family units of 5 or more units comprise the majority of housing types at 39.6% and 38.3%,
respectively. Percentages for the housing types did not drastically change over the last five
years.

       2.      Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior to 1978
before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed, may have interior or
exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built before 1970 are
the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in deteriorated condition.
Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six and to pregnant women when
it peels off walls, windows and doors.
Table II-10 reports the age distribution of the housing stock in Culver City compared to Los
Angeles County as a whole as reported in the 2000 Census.

This table shows that 68% of the owner-occupied housing units and 66% of rented units in Culver
City were constructed prior to 1970. These findings indicate the possibility of a need for some
maintenance and rehabilitation, including remediation of lead-based paint, for approximately
two-thirds of the city’s housing stock. There has been no significant loss of housing in the last 10
years and housing as reported in the 2000 census (Table II-10) is approximately 10 years older.
Table II-11 identifies the number of Culver City owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing
units lacking complete kitchen or plumbing facilities and telephones. This table shows that less
than 1% of rental and owner occupied units lacked complete plumbing facilities. Almost no
owner-occupied housing units and approximately 2% of renter occupied units lacked complete
kitchens. A lack of complete kitchen or plumbing facilities is an indicator that housing units may

telephones. Based on this data, Culver City’s housing stock is in relatively good condition with
basic facilities present.

A targeted field survey of selected neighborhoods was conducted in September 2007. The
surveyed neighborhoods were chosen based on the knowledge of experienced planning,
housing and code enforcement staff, with the intent of identifying areas where units in need of
repair are concentrated (see Figure II-1).
The survey found that 38% of the 202 units surveyed were considered to be in sound condition
although minor cosmetic work may be needed. About 32% of the units showed signs of minor
structural problems, while 30% were in need of major rehabilitation. Since the survey focused on
those areas known to have the highest incidence of problems, these statistics are not
representative of the entire city. Rehabilitation needs are considered to be far less prevalent in
other areas of the city.
A separate survey of residential multi-family dwelling (RMD) areas was also conducted (also
shown in Figure II-1). Within the RMD Zone study area, 414 properties and 631 dwelling units were
surveyed. This evaluation found that 87% of the units surveyed were considered to be in sound
condition although minor cosmetic work may be needed. About 12% of the units showed signs
of minor structural problems and 1% of the units were in need of major rehabilitation.
Based on the field surveys and staff knowledge of other areas not surveyed, it is estimated that
there may be approximately 140 housing units in need of minor to moderate repair and
approximately 67 units in need of major rehabilitation.
There are other dwelling units in the survey areas that were not noted (or counted) because
they showed no signs of debilitation. Within the RMD Zone survey, units that were not in need of
repair and located on properties that were fully developed based on Zoning Code density
maximums were not counted. Since the time the field survey was conducted, the housing stock
                                                             II-11                                        January 2014

and conditions for Culver City has not changed significantly. A significant number of building
permits were issued for tenant improvements to residential units despite the down turn of the
economy that started around 2007/2008. Residents decided to improve their existing homes
instead of selling and purchasing new homes.
       3.      Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates are shown in Table II-12. The table shows that the vacancy rate in the
city is relatively low at about 4%. The vacancy rates in the 4% range indicate near full
occupancy, and contribute to upward pressures on rents and mortgages.

        4.      Housing Cost
a.       Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., County) median income (“AMI”):
       •     Extremely-Low (30% or less of AMI),
       •     Very-Low (31-50% of AMI),
       •     Low (51-80% of AMI),
       •     Moderate (81-120% of AMI), and
       •     Above Moderate (over 120% of AMI).
Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and
housing expenses. According to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) and the California Department of Housing and Community Development2,
housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a
household’s gross income. In some areas, these income limits may be increased to adjust
for high housing costs 3.
Table II-13 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Los Angeles County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards,
the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $640, while
the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,068. The maximum
affordable rent for low-income households is $1,708, while the maximum for moderate-
income households is $1,944.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table II-13 have been
estimated based on typical conditions.
   HCD memo of 4/18/07 (http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/rep/state/inc2k7.pdf)
2
   HCD publishes annual household income limits for each county in California. The published income limits
3
   for extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households are used to determine eligibility for some
   assistance programs and are adjusted upward in high housing cost areas like Southern California.
   Therefore, the income limits published by HCD for Los Angeles County are higher than the calculated
   income categories that would result from the applicable percentages of AMI. The determination of
   affordable rent and affordable purchase price for assisted units may vary depending upon the
   requirements of various funding sources. In addition, affordable housing costs may be restricted to the
   extent needed to allow units to be counted toward the Redevelopment Agency's housing production
   obligations.

Culver City (May 2013) and City-Data.com. According to the SCAG Profile, Culver City’s
Medium Home Sales Price for 2012 was $448,250 (Source: U.S. Census, Cal. Dept. DOF,
MDA Data Quick, and SCAG).According to data for Culver City from City-Data.com, the
mean price in 2009 for various types of housing was:
        •       Detached houses: $642,325
        •       Townhouses or other attached units: $510,763
        •       In 2-unit structures: $919,812 (This likely reflects the sale price of both units
                together)
        •       In 3-to-4-unit structures: $524,218
        •       In 5-or-more-unit structures: $266,486
Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-13 lower-income
residents were not able to purchase units of any type while moderate-income residents
could only purchase condominium units within structures of 5 or more units. This data
illustrates that public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales prices to a level that
is affordable to low- and moderate-income buyers. At a median price of $448,250 for
condominiums, there is a “gap” of over $150,000 between the market price and the
maximum price a moderate-income household can afford to pay for a home. For low-
income households, this gap is over $190,000.
c.        Rental Housing
According to City-Data.com in 2009 median rents in Culver City were:
     •    Median contract rent was $1,223
     •    Median rent asked for vacant for-rent units was $1,680
     •    Median gross rent in Culver City was $1,287
                                                                       II-15                                 January 2014

When market rents are compared to the amounts low-income households can afford to
pay (Table II-13), it is clear that very-low- and extremely-low-income households have a
difficult time finding housing without overpaying. The gap between market rent and
affordable rent at the very-low-income level is about $219 per month, while the gap at
the extremely-low-income level is over $600 per month.
E.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Culver City
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. In addition to these groups, the needs of extremely-
low-income persons and households are discussed in this section.
       1.      Persons with Disabilities and Developmental Disabilities
According to American Community Survey, for the period between 2005-2007, 10.41% of
the male population was disabled and 16.17% of the female population was disabled
(Table II-14). Table II-15 reports on the estimate for developmentally disabled persons in
Culver City which is approximately 323 persons with children up to the age of 14 and
adults between the ages of 23 and 54 making up the majority of the developmentally
disabled population (140 and 100 respectively). The estimate for this population is based
on data by zip code as gathered by the Westside Regional Center. Because zip codes
include both Culver City and Los Angeles, estimates were determined by taking
percentages of the total population in some of the zip codes. Housing opportunities for
the handicapped and the developmentally disabled can be maximized through housing
assistance programs and universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps,
lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units.
Persons with disabilities may require exceptions to zoning or building standards in order to
allow them full accessibility to housing. The City Council adopted a reasonable
accommodations procedure in July of 2013, which provides a process for relief of zoning
code standards. In addition to physical accessibility, disabled persons often have lower
incomes than the population at large. Numerous measures contained in the Housing
Plan that are intended to encourage housing that is affordable to lower-income
households will indirectly benefit persons with disabilities. Examples include Measures 1.A
(Section 8 Rental Assistance), 1.B (City Rental Assistance), 1.I (Neighborhood
Preservation), 1.M (Temporary Emergency Rental & Relocation Assistance), 1.N
(Acquisition/Rehab), 1.P (Affordable Housing Development Assistance), 2.C (Second
Units), 2.F/G/H (Comprehensive Housing Strategy), 2.K (SROs), 2.L (Transitional/Supportive
Housing), and 5.A (Housing Program Promotion).

       2.      Elderly
In 2010, there were 5,806 persons or 15% of the total population in Culver City were 65 or
older with the majority of those elderly being female (Table II-16). The 2005-2009
American Community Survey found that 10% and 26% of all renter and ownership
households respectively were 65 and older (Table II-17). According to the 2007-2011
American Community Survey, approximately 358 persons or 6% of persons ages 65 and
older were below the poverty level. Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed
incomes and many have some type of disability. Elderly homeowners may be physically
unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group
can be addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared
living arrangements, congregate housing and housing assistance programs. The
following specific measures in the Housing Plan (Chapter V) help to address the needs of
seniors: 1.A (Section 8 Rental Assistance), 1.B (City Rental Assistance), 1.C (Shared
Housing for Seniors), 1.I (Neighborhood Preservation), 1.M (Temporary Emergency Rental
& Relocation Assistance), 1.N (Acquisition/Rehab), 1.P (Affordable Housing Development
Assistance), 2.C (Second Units), 2.F/G/H (Comprehensive Housing Strategy), 2.K (SROs),
2.L (Transitional/Supportive Housing), and 5.A (Housing Program Promotion).

       3.      Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. According to Table II-18, among both owners and
renters, more than 65% of all households have only one or two members. About 6% of
renter households had five or more members, while about 5% of owner households were
large households. Table II-19 shows the number of persons per households by household
type. For all households less than 6% are large households; 10% of Family Households
have 5 or more people and less than 1% of Non-Family households have 5 or more
persons.
While this distribution suggests that the need for large units with four or more bedrooms is
expected to be less than for smaller units, several of the measures contained in the
Housing Plan (Chapter V) will help to address the needs of large households, including
the following: 1.A (Section 8 Rental Assistance), 1.B (City Rental Assistance), 1.I
(Neighborhood Preservation), 1.M (Temporary Emergency Rental & Relocation
Assistance), 1.N (Acquisition/Rehab), 1.P (Affordable Housing Development Assistance),
2.F/G/H ( Comprehensive Housing Strategy), 2.L (Transitional/ Supportive Housing), and
5.A (Housing Program Promotion).

       4.        Female-Headed Households
Of the total 16,278 households in the city, 8.7% of ownership units and 10.35% of renter
units were headed by a female (Table II-20). Female-headed households often have
special challenges such as balancing work, child care and other family responsibilities,
and their incomes may be significantly lower than traditional families. The following
specific measures in the Housing Plan (Chapter V) help to address the needs of these
households: 1.A (Section 8 Rental Assistance), 1.B (City Rental Assistance), 1.I
(Neighborhood Preservation), 1.M (Temporary Emergency Rental & Relocation
Assistance), 1.N (Acquisition/Rehab), 1.P (Affordable Housing Development Assistance),
2.C     (Second             Units),         2.F/G/H           (   Comprehensive             Housing        Strategy),       2.L
(Transitional/Supportive Housing), and 5.A (Housing Program Promotion).

       5.        Farm Workers
Farm workers are considered a special needs group due to their transient nature and low
incomes. Migrant workers, and their places of residence, are generally located in close
proximity to agricultural areas. Although agriculture produces a total annual value of
approximately $278 million per year in Los Angeles County, no agricultural activities are
found in Culver City or in the surrounding communities 4. Further the city does not have
any agriculturally zoned areas. In addition, the 2010 Census did not identify any migrant
worker households in the city. Based on the above, farm workers are not considered to
be a special needs group in Culver City.
       6.        Homeless Persons
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines the term
“homeless” as the state of a person who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time
residence, or a person who has a primary night time residency that is:
      •      A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
             temporary living accommodations;
      •      An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
             be institutionalized; or
      •      A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
             sleeping accommodation for human beings.5

City of Culver City Housing Element                                 II. Housing Needs Assessment
Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common are:
      •     Substance abuse and alcohol
      •     Domestic violence
      •     Mental illness
Shelter and service needs of the homeless population are significantly different
depending on the population subgroup. Los Angeles County’s Continuum of Care
approach to homelessness is a coordinated and systematic local approach to meet the
needs of homeless individuals and families within these subgroups, including:
      •     Chronic Homeless Persons;
      •     Episodic Homeless Persons; and
      •     Persons at Risk of Becoming Homeless
The Continuum of Care approach to end homelessness involves a comprehensive system
that includes 1) outreach, intake and assessment, 2) emergency shelter, 2) transitional
housing, and 3) permanent housing.
The County’s focus is to provide funding for access to mainstream resources such as
income supports, health care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment
programs, child care, and job training placement 6. These resources serve the existing
homeless population, and also work toward the prevention of homelessness.
Senate Bill 2 of 2007 (Government Code §ec. 65583) strengthened the planning
requirements for local governments in the area of emergency and transitional housing.
Cities must estimate the number of persons in need of emergency shelter and determine
whether adequate capacity currently exists to serve the need. If there is insufficient
capacity, cities are required to identify zones where emergency shelters may be
established “by right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit).
Homeless Count
Homeless Counts are mandated every two years by HUD for all communities that receive
federal funds for homeless programs. Led by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority
(LAHSA), the biennial Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count (the “Count”) is the nation’s
largest count of homeless individuals and families. The Count is a point-in-time
enumeration that seeks to document the number of people without a permanent,
habitable place to live. According to LAHSA, 5,000 volunteers helped with the 2013
Count, which cover approximately 4,000 square miles and took place from January 29th
to January 31st, 2013.
On June 28, 2013, LAHSA released the preliminary results of the biennial 2013 Count. The
Count revealed a 16 percent increase since the last Count conducted in 2011 in the
number of homeless men, women, and children in the County of Los Angeles. The count

City of Culver City Housing Element                              II. Housing Needs Assessment
revealed that there were 58,423 homeless people in 2013, compared to 50,212 in 2011.
Homelessness among veterans dropped from 8,131 in 2011 to 6,291 in 2013 with a
marked decrease in the numbers of homeless female veterans.                     Total family
homelessness saw a reduction from 9,218 family members in 2011 to 6,678 family
members in 2013.
Additional results from the Count included:
     •   Single adults increased by 29 percent, going from 35,838 in 2011 to 46,303 in 2013.
     •   Unaccompanied youth 18 and under grew by 123 percent, rising from 366 in 2011
         to 817 in 2013.
Culver City Homeless Count
Looking specifically at Culver City, LAHSA coordinates with communities throughout Los
Angeles County to conduct local Counts of their specific jurisdiction. Communities have
the option to conduct their own Count with local volunteers instead of LAHSA
conducting the Count on behalf of the community. In 2011 and 2013 the City of Culver
City conducted its own Count. The Counts were conducted on January 26, 2011, and
January 30, 2013, from the hours of 8pm to 2am. The Culver City results are detailed
below with a slight increase in the individual person homeless census and decreases in
homeless persons living in cars, vans, RV’s, tents and encampments from 2011 to 2013
(see Table II-21). A Potential reason for this drop in the homeless population is the
extensive outreach conducted by the city's homeless outreach team and its efforts to
secure emergency hotel vouchers, rental assistance and supportive services for persons
living in cars, vans, tents, RV's and encampments.

The 2010 Census for Culver City counted non-household populations in group quarter
settings and homeless persons. The group quarter population constituted 1% of the total
population and no homeless persons were identified. The local Culver City count is a
more accurate picture of the homeless situation in Culver City. The relatively small local
count and the Census count of a zero homeless population indicate that the city is
slightly impacted by homelessness.

Emergency Shelter Facilities
There is one full-time emergency shelter within Culver City, Upward Bound House,
located at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Beethoven Street. This facility
was approved for conversion from a motel to an 18-room emergency shelter in 2008. A
maximum of 60 persons can be accommodated at the facility. Housing referral programs
are also offered by the Culver City Senior Center (4095 Overland Avenue).The Upward
Bound House only focuses on families and not on single men or women, and thus, does
not meet the need of the entire Culver City homeless population. Therefore, in order to
minimize constraints to the provision of additional shelter facilities and as called for in SB-2
(see above), amendments to the Zoning Code were passed that allow Emergency
Shelter by-right in a portion of the city. Several other measures contained in the Housing
Plan (Chapter V) also address the needs of homeless persons and families, including 1.A
(Section 8 Rental Assistance), 1.B (City Rental Assistance), 1.E (Homeless Service
Referrals), 1.F (Emergency Shelters), 1.G (Emergency Food Vouchers), 1.M (Temporary
Emergency Rental & Relocation Assistance), 1.N (Acquisition/Rehab), 1.P (Affordable
Housing Development Assistance), 2.C (Second Units), 2.F/G/H ( Comprehensive Housing
Strategy), and 5.A (Housing Program Promotion).
        7.      Extremely-Low-Income Households
State law requires an analysis of the existing and projected housing needs of extremely-
low-income (ELI) households. ELI means a household whose income is 30% or less of the
area median income (AMI), adjusted for household size. The 2013 AMI for Los Angeles
County was $64,800 (see Table II-13, page II-15). For ELI households, this results in an
income of $25,600 or less for a four-person household 7. ELI households have a variety of
housing problems and needs.
   HCD publishes annual household income limits for each county in California. The published income limits
7
   for extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households are used to determine eligibility for some
   assistance programs and are adjusted upward in high housing cost areas like Southern California.
   Therefore, the income limits published by HCD for Los Angeles County are higher than the calculated
   income categories that would result from the applicable percentages of AMI.
                                                          II-23                                 January 2014
City of Culver City Housing Element                               II. Housing Needs Assessment
The relatively high cost of housing on the Westside often results in overpayment and/or
overcrowding when ELI households “double up” with more than one family sharing living
space. Such conditions may lead to overtaxing of utilities and infrastructure, stress and
adverse health effects. Several programs in the Housing Plan (Chapter V) designed to
address housing affordability will help to alleviate the problems of ELI households. These
programs include rental assistance, acquisition/rehab of substandard housing, and new
construction of affordable units. Further, the noted amendments to the zoning code that
facilitate the establishment of emergency shelters and transitional housing will indirectly
assist ELI households.
Though RHNA does not specifically call out ELI households as a category, meeting the
housing need of these persons is an issue for all municipalities. Culver City will address the
needs of this population through the provision of rental assistance from the federal
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), as described in Chapter III. In
addition, the zoning code allows the development of SRO housing as part of mixed use
developments. SROs help to meet the needs of extremely-low- and very-low-income
individuals.
F.      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
Overview of Assisted Units and Units At Risk
As part of the Housing Element, cities are required to identify units with affordability
covenants that could expire during the coming 10-year period (2008-2018). Appendix C
provides a listing of affordable units that either participate in a federal, state or local
assistance program, or are income-restricted through some other control measure such
as density bonus. Also included is a list of units that are at-risk of conversion to market
rate, along with an analysis of potential resources and techniques the city could use to
extend the covenants of affordable units. This information is used in establishing
quantified objectives for units that can be conserved during this planning period.
As noted in Appendix C, Table C-1, a total of 519 assisted housing units were identified in
Culver City. Of this number, 125 were secured through the use of the Mortgage
Assistance Program (MAP) for first-time home buyers.
Assisted affordable units that are at-risk of conversion during 2008-2018 are listed in Table
C-2 in Appendix C. As shown in the table, there are a total of 157 units that are at risk
during this period: 23 very-low-income units, 19 low-income units, 10 low/moderate-
income units and 105 moderate-income units.
Preservation Analysis
California Housing Element Law requires Housing Elements to include a study of all low-
and moderate-income housing units that may be lost from the affordable inventory
through the expiration of affordability restrictions during the next ten-year period. For this
Housing Element, the at-risk analysis covers the period from July 1, 2008 through June 30,
2018.
                                              II-24                                January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                 II. Housing Needs Assessment
There are three types of situations that can result in the conversion of publicly-assisted
affordable units:
      1.    Prepayment of HUD mortgages - Section 202, and Section 811. Section 202
            assistance provides a direct loan to non-profit organizations for project
            development and rent subsidy for low-income elderly tenants. Section 811
            provides assistance for the development of units for physically handicapped,
            developmentally disabled, and chronically mentally ill residents. There are no
            Section 202 or 811 units at risk over the next ten years.
      2.    Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Covenant Expiration. The premise of the
            Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside Fund was to increase, improve and
            preserve the community’s supply of affordable housing for families of very-low,
            low and moderate incomes (Health and Safety Code §33334.2(a)). Eligible
            activities included acquisition, rehabilitation, rental assistance and assistance
            to first-time home buyers. In exchange for the use of Housing Set-Aside Funds,
            income and affordability restrictions were placed on the property in the form
            of covenants. These covenants are for 45 years for ownership projects and 55
            years for rental projects. Covenants are still in effect regardless of the
            elimination of the Redevelopment Agency. The Culver City Housing Authority
            has oversight over existing covenants. During the last cycle, ownership project
            restrictions were for 10 years and rental project restrictions were for 15 years. In
            Culver City, over the next 10 years, affordability covenants on 157 units have
            the potential to expire. Of these, 36 units for two group homes serving the
            homeless and persons with developmental and physical disabilities, 17 units for
            low and moderate income households, and 101 are owner occupied homes.
      3.    Other: Expiration of affordability restrictions from the use of density bonuses
            and equity sharing. Equity sharing allows households who utilized the MAP to
            purchase a home, to “buy out” of the covenant restriction prior to the
            expiration date. Under the MAP, the original owner must resell the property to
            another qualified (up to and including moderate-income) household. Through
            equity sharing, the covenant is removed if the original owner agrees to share a
            percentage of equity with the Redevelopment Agency. These funds are in turn
            deposited back into the Housing Set-Aside Fund. Density bonus units expire in
            either 10 or 30 years, depending on the level of incentives. As noted above,
            homes purchased through the MAP will expire prior to 2018. No density bonus
            properties in Culver City are at-risk for expiration over the next 10 years.
At Risk Status
As noted above, the most prevalent type of “at-risk” conversion in Culver City is the
expiration of covenants that were enacted by Housing Set-Aside Funds income and
affordability use restrictions (prior to the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency). For
example, as part of an extensive revitalization program in a severely blighted area, the
Culver City Redevelopment Agency rehabilitated and placed affordability and income
restrictions on over 26 units. Over the next 10 years, income and affordability restrictions
on 20 of these units will expire. Additionally, through the MAP, which provided second
trust deeds for up-to-moderate-income first-time homebuyers, 29 covenants will expire
over the next 10 years. There is also the additional risk of property owners deciding to
“equity share” out of their covenant prior to the expiration date. As noted in Table C-2,
                                                II-25                               January 2014

96 covenants from the MAP will be in effect after 2018, but the property owners have the
right to “equity share” out of the covenant prior to the expiration date.
Cost Analysis
From 2008 to 2010, a combination of rehabilitation, new construction and tenant-based
rental assistance were utilized to address either the preservation or replacement of at risk
units. All these programs have been suspended with the elimination of the former
Redevelopment Agency. Implementation of these programs (noted below) will be
resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes available and the city is
eligible for such funding sources.
        Rehabilitation: The primary factors used to analyze the cost of preserving
        affordable housing units through rehabilitation include materials, and labor. The
        per-unit rehabilitation cost of $48,000 is estimated based on information obtained
        by a cost estimator who was secured by the Redevelopment Agency (prior to its
        elimination) to give a cost analysis of several prototypical Housing Set-Aside Fund
        projects.
        New Construction/Replacement: New construction implies construction of a new
        property with the same number of units and similar amenities as the one removed
        from the affordable housing stock. The cost of constructing new housing units can
        vary greatly depending on factors such as location, density, unit sizes, construction
        materials, and on- and-off-site improvements. Based on data compiled from a
        cost estimator retained by the Redevelopment Agency (prior to its elimination),
        average per-unit construction cost (including land acquisition cost) in Culver City
        is approximately $450,000 per unit.
        Tenant-Based Rental Assistance: This type of assistance largely depends on the
        income of the household, the housing costs of the unit, and the number of years
        the assistance is provided. A very-low-income four-person household in Los
        Angeles earns up to $68,300 annually and can afford up to $875 monthly for rent.
        The difference between $875 and the median rent for a two-bedroom unit
        ($1,700) is $675 and would require a rental subsidy of $825 per month, or $9,900
        per year.
Funding/Financial Resources:
Efforts by the city to retain affordable housing units were drawn upon by two types of
preservation resources: Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside Funds and Section 8
Rental Assistance Housing Set-Aside Funds were available from 2008-2010, but were
subsequently eliminated with the enactment of AB 26. The Section 8 Rental Assistance
Program which is federally funded through HUD was not affected by AB 26 and is
currently implanted by the Culver City Housing Authority.
      •     Section 8 Rental Assistance: The Culver City Housing Authority administers the
            Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP). The HCVP is a tenant-
            based rental subsidy. Culver City is allotted 384 vouchers annually.
      •     Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside Fund: As required by state law
            prior to AB 26, the Culver City Redevelopment Agency set aside 20% of the
            gross tax increment revenues received from the Redevelopment Area into a
                                              II-26                               January 2014

            low- and moderate-income housing fund for affordable housing activities.
            These funds were available from the period of 2008-2010 but are currently de-
            funded due to the State legislative action eliminating the city’s
            Redevelopment Agency.
Between 2008 and 2010, the Redevelopment Agency received approximately $21 million
which was deposited into the Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Funds. During this
period, funding was used for the following programs listed below:
      •     Land Acquisition
      •     New Construction
      •     Rental Assistance
      •     Single-Family Housing Set-Aside Fund Loans and Grants
      •     Multi-Family Housing Set-Aside Fund Grants
      •     Single- and Multi-Family Housing Set-Aside Fund (paint-up/fix-up)
      •     Senior Roommate Matching
      •     Installation of safety and security devices for the elderly and disabled
Currently, these resources are de-funded as a result of AB 26. These resources will be
resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes available and the city is
eligible for such funding sources.
G.      Growth Needs
       1.      Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within
each jurisdiction for the 8-year period from October 2013 to October 2021. Communities
then determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the
Housing Elements of their General Plans.
Under state law, regional councils of governments are required to develop housing
needs plans for use by local governments in their Housing Element updates. The regional
housing needs analysis is derived from the statewide growth forecast, which is then
allocated to regions, cities and counties based on a variety of factors such as local
growth trends, future development potential, job growth, and physical constraints (e.g.,
floodplains, steep slopes, biological habitat). The current RHNA was adopted by SCAG in
April of 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the forecasted
growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving
out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for employment, and so
forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new households is then
adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing choice and
mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost due to
demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these factors –
household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the construction
need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four income
categories on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to avoid an
over-concentration of lower-income households in any community. It should be noted
that the extremely-low-income category, which was added to state Housing Element
                                               II-27                               January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                                                           II. Housing Needs Assessment
law by Assembly Bill 2634 of 2006, was not included in the RHNA adopted by SCAG. Cities
are required to estimate the level of need in this category either through an analysis of
Census data or by assuming it is one-half of the very-low-income need. This needs
assessment utilizes the latter approach.
        2.           2013-2021 Culver City Growth Needs
SCAG determined the RHNA growth needs for each city within the SCAG region, plus the
unincorporated areas. The total housing growth need for the City of Culver City during
the 2013-2021 planning period is 185 units. This total is distributed by income category as
shown in Table II-23.

A.      Land Resources
       1.      Regional Growth Needs –2013 – 2021 (5th Cycle)
In accordance with Government Code §65584, projected housing needs for each city
and county in the Southern California region are prepared by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) under a process known as the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA). SCAG’s Regional Council adopted the final RHNA on
October 4, 2012 for the 5th housing element cycle (four previous cycles ranging from 5 to
8 years per cycle have transpired since state housing law began to require periodic
updates of housing elements). The current RHNA covers the 8-year planning period from
October, 2013 to October, 2021.
The RHNA process began with an update of the population, employment and household
forecasts for both the region as a whole and for each County. These forecasts were
largely derived from California Department of Finance (DOF) population and employ-
ment forecasts; input from local jurisdictions on projected population, household, and
employment numbers; and modification of these forecasts using regional demographic
data and modeling efforts (performed by SCAG). SCAG then disaggregated the
regional and County forecasts to each jurisdiction and estimated the number of dwelling
units needed to achieve a regional target vacancy rates (1.5% owner-occupied and
4.5% rental) and to account for projected housing demolitions. The total housing needed
in each jurisdiction was then distributed by income category (very low, low, moderate
and upper income) based on the city’s income distribution as reported in the 2010
Census.
All units built after January 1, 2006 and before October, 2013 were credited towards
accomplishing the RHNA goals for the previous (4th) Housing Element cycle. Units
approved but not yet built as of October, 2013 are credited towards fulfilling RHNA goals
in this current 5th Housing Element cycle. Table III-1 shows the growth need based on
RHNA for the 5th cycle. (A detailed breakdown of these units by income category is
provided in Appendix B).

         2.            Inventory of Sites for Housing Development
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and
potential redevelopment opportunities has been prepared and is described in
Appendix B. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table III-2 below, which
indicates the number of dwelling units approved as well as potential units that could be
built based on the analysis of parcels shown in Appendix B. The table shows that the
city’s land inventory, including projects approved and the potential development of
vacant and underutilized parcels, exceeds the net remaining RHNA for all income levels.
The combination of the large surplus of potential lower- and above-moderate- income
units and the 20 surplus unit count for the moderate income level indicates that the
RHNA requirements are satisfied. It is noteworthy that a significant portion of new
affordable units during this planning period are planned to be produced through the
Comprehensive Housing Strategy. Since the city is a partner in these projects, they have
a higher likelihood of successful implementation*.

program administered by Los Angeles County. The city expects to receive approximately
$199,936 in funding for fiscal year 2013-2014 through the CDBG Program. The city uses
CDBG funds for programs serving senior citizens, the disabled, and to fund infrastructure
improvements.
The city does not currently participate in other HUD programs such as Home Investment
Partnership Act (HOME), Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) or Housing Opportunities for
Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), although the city is investigating opportunities to apply for
HOME funds.
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP)
assists very-low-income senior citizens, families and the disabled with the cost of rental
housing. Generally, a tenant pays 30% of his or her adjusted income towards the rent
and the Section 8 program pays the balance directly to the landlord. The Culver City
Housing Division selects program participants from a waiting list of qualified households,
giving preference to Culver City residents, Veterans, the elderly and the disabled. In
2013-14, the Division is allotted 384 voucher spaces by HUD. The waiting list for assistance
in 2013 consisted of approximately 331 households from Culver City and the surrounding
area.
Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS) - This program provides one-on-one counseling and
job development services to Section 8 HCVP participants. The program links participants
to community resources and supportive services, such as childcare and alcohol and
drug treatment, budgeting, and education. The program assists at least 25 participants
and is funded by a HUD FSS Coordinator Grant. To date, a total of 61 Section 8 Program
participants have graduated from the FSS program and achieve self-sufficiency.
       2.      Local Resources
Former Culver City Redevelopment Agency (Redevelopment Agency) - State law
(Health and Safety Code §33000 et seq.) allowed cities to establish redevelopment
agencies for the purpose of eliminating blight.
In 1986, state legislation was adopted requiring redevelopment agencies to set aside
20% of their tax increment revenue for activities related to affordable housing. Agencies
were required to direct these funds toward assisting housing for low- and moderate-
                                             III-5                               January 2014

income households. The 20% tax increment was generally referred to as “set-aside funds”
or the “Low/Moderate Income Housing Fund” (LMIHF). Agencies spent set-aside monies
for land or building acquisition, site improvements, construction or rehabilitation of
buildings, subsidies, and financing tools.
From 2008 through 2010, the use of its Housing Set-Aside fund, the former Redevelopment
Agency provided various programs that assist low- and moderate-income
persons/families. These programs are detailed below. Currently all programs except for
the Landlord-Tenant Mediation Board are defunded due to State legislative action
eliminating the city’s Redevelopment Agency. These financial resources will be
resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes available to offset the
loss of Set-Aside funds and the city is eligible for such funding sources.
      •     Rental Assistance Program (RAP) - This program assists up to and including
            moderate-income, similar to the federally funded Section 8 HCVP Program.
            When it was funded through Redevelopment Agency Set-Aside Funds, the
            program assisted up to 100 households.
      •     Neighborhood Preservation Program (NPP) - This program offers grants,
            rebates, emergency grants, and deferred loans to assist in the rehabilitation
            and maintenance of housing. Qualified low-income up to and including
            moderate-income homeowners and owners of multi-family housing with a
            percentage of low-income tenants can take advantage of these resources.
            The program funds a wide range of rehabilitation needs as well as remodeling
            and additions to accommodate increasing family size. Special improvements
            for the disabled or elderly, such as ramps and grab bars can also receive
            funding (when such funding becomes available).
      •     Home Secure Program – This program assists elderly and disabled persons with
            living in a safe home environment through the free installation of safety and
            security devices, fire detectors and carbon monoxide monitors.
      •     Alternative Living for the Aging – Working with a non-profit organization, the
            Culver City Housing Authority (Housing Division) assists with matching senior
            citizens who wish to share their homes with live-in students, middle aged
            individuals, or other elderly.
      •     Acquisition and Rehabilitation – This program eliminates blight and nuisance
            through the acquisition and/or rehabilitation and installation of professional
            management of multifamily housing units in an effort to enhance and enrich
            neighborhoods and create affordable housing units.
      •     Housing Rights Center – The Housing Division contracts with the Housing Rights
            Center to handle housing discrimination complaints and questions regarding
            tenant-landlord rights.
      •     Landlord-Tenant Mediation Board - The city encourages tenants and owners of
            rental property to solve rent increase problems without expensive litigation by
            requesting mediation services.

City of Culver City Housing Element                             III. Resources and Opportunities
The former Redevelopment Agency and City Council approved the Comprehensive
Housing Strategy (CHS) in its entirety and authorized implementation of years 1 and 2 of a
7-1/2 year program and instructed staff to return to the Redevelopment Agency with
further discussion of the other projects identified in the CHS. The CHS allocated Housing
Set-Aside Funds to meet the requirements of RHNA and Redevelopment Law. The
implementation of the CHS commenced in early 2010 with Year 1 – 2 projects. The
strategy is based upon the concept of providing smaller low-density, scattered-site,
mixed-income housing developments. With RHNA providing a target number for assisted
and non-assisted units, staff identified sites for affordable for-sale and rental housing.
Prototypical affordable projects were identified and in some cases preliminary site plans
were prepared. These prototypical projects were then priced using standard
construction cost estimating techniques. The projected cost for meeting the total
required housing production program was calculated and a funding strategy was
developed to accommodate housing demand utilizing a combination of
Redevelopment Agency Set-Aside Housing Funds and/or lending from private institutions,
and also county, state and federal funding sources. An implementation program was
then developed for each program year. The strategy also relies on state density bonus
law to meet RHNA targets using the same low-density, scattered-site, mixed-income
housing approach.
The Housing Division surveyed the city to identify blighted or underutilized sites for
affordable housing development. From this investigation, over 80 potential project sites
were identified. These sites were organized into four tiers for new construction, which
included: 1) Redevelopment Agency-owned sites suitable for residential and mixed-used
development; 2) small-lot development; 3) medium-lot development; and 4) TOD sites.
Included with the four tiers were also sites designated for preservation or rehabilitation
projects.
In order to achieve RHNA goals, the CHS identified the following approximate targets: 17
units of very-low-income housing, 10 units of low-income housing and 11 units of
moderate-income housing annually.
With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency, funding for affordable housing
developments has been eliminated. However, the CHS remains a viable strategy to
achieve affordable housing objectives, and the sites identified in the CHS and listed in
Appendix B – Land Inventory – are still potential future affordable housing sites. As with
other housing programs, the CHS will be fully implemented once funding to offset the loss
of Set-Aside funds becomes available. CHS sites can also currently be developed
through a density bonus process providing there is development interest. Although the
city cannot provide funding, it can assist in the processing of entitlements.
The CHS accomplishes the following three broad objectives:
      •     Assess the key housing needs and funding requirements facing Culver City
            today and over the 8-year RHNA planning period.
      •     Identify three priority affordable housing sites that can be developed over the
            first year of the planning period, which will address affordable housing needs,
            eliminate blight and nuisance, protect stable single-family residential
            neighborhoods and maintain Culver City’s “small-town feel”.
                                               III-7                                January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                            III. Resources and Opportunities
       •    Provide realistic housing initiatives that best address the city’s unmet housing
            needs consistent with the goals and objectives of the Housing Element over
            this planning period with small- and medium-sized developments, building
            preservation and rehabilitation.
C.       Energy Conservation Opportunities
State law (Government Code §65583(a)(7)) requires a Housing Element to provide an
analysis of opportunities for energy conservation in residential development. Not only do
such energy conservation measures reduce consumption of non-renewable or limited
resources, but they can also substantially lower housing maintenance costs. Despite the
mild climate of Southern California, old fixtures and appliances and older housing
construction may wastefully consume water, gas, and electrical resources.
In Culver City, where 50% of the housing stock was constructed before 1950 and more
than two-thirds was built before the adoption of state energy conservation standards in
1975, a substantial number of units are likely to be using energy and water inefficiently.
The city’s best strategy for effective energy conservation is to promote and encourage
energy efficient retrofitting of existing homes. Common and effective measures include
weather-stripping and caulking of doors and windows and installation of insulation in
ceilings and walls.
All new residential construction in the city is required to be constructed in an energy
efficient manner through compliance with state energy conservation standards. Also,
pursuant to the city’s Solar Photovoltaic Ordinance, all new construction projects,
commercial or multi-family, of 3 or more units or 10,000 new square feet or greater, are
required to install 1 kilowatt (kw) of solar photovoltaic power for each 10,000 square feet
of new construction, not including parking garage areas. Additionally, new additions of
over 10,000 square feet or major renovations of over 10,000 square feet are required to
install 1 kilowatt of solar photovoltaic power for each 10,000 square feet of major
renovation or additional area. The solar photovoltaic requirement does not apply to new
construction, major remodels, or additions of less than 10,000 square feet. One kilowatt of
solar photovoltaic power is estimated to add less than 1/2 of 1% to the cost of
construction. This ordinance not only helps to conserve energy, but also reduces
greenhouse gas emissions.
The city’s Green Building Ordinance also helps to reduce energy costs by requiring new
developments to incorporate Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
equivalent measures such as energy efficient glazing, additional building insulation,
improved hvac efficiency, planting or retention of on-site trees providing shade, and use
of re-cycled materials during construction. There is no requirement that projects obtain
LEED certification.
The city has also adopted a Water Conservation Ordinance designed to limit water
consumption and effectively reduce monthly water costs.

local and statewide energy conservation goals.

IV. CONSTRAINTS
A.       Governmental Constraints
        1.          Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.       General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of each city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements of general law cities must be internally consistent and the
city’s zoning must be consistent with the General Plan. Because Culver City is a charter
city, that law does not apply. However, it is good planning practice and provides a
strong legal foundation to support land use regulations if a charter city’s zoning
requirements follow the directions and vision of its General Plan. Thus, the land use plan
provides suitable locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing
Element.
The City of Culver City General Plan Land Use Element provides for six residential land use
designations, as shown in Table IV-1.
                                                                 Table IV-1

In addition to the residential land use categories, housing is also permitted in several
commercial land use designations, including the Neighborhood Serving Corridor,
General Corridor, and Downtown designations. Residential development can be either
exclusively residential in residential zones or mixed with commercial uses in commercial
zones. Further, in commercial zones the only type of housing allowed is mixed-use
                                                                        IV-1                                                    January 2014

housing (with commercial retail uses). In commercial zones the base density is 35
dwelling units per acre. The industrial land use designations do not allow housing.
The Culver City General Plan is not considered a constraint to the goals and policies of
the Housing Element. Except for approximately 6.4% of all parcels in the city (about 875
parcels out of 13,615 parcels) that are non-conforming to their General Plan
designations, the city’s zoning is consistent with the General Plan and adequate sites with
appropriate densities have been identified that could accommodate the 2013 -2021
RHNA.
b.        Zoning Designations and Development Standards
The city regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan
and are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents. The Municipal Code also helps to preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods, and sets forth residential development standards for each zone
district.
The six zones that allow for exclusive residential use are as follows:
          R-1  Single-Family Residential
          R-2  Two-Family Residential
          R-3  Three-Family Residential
          RLD  Low Density Multiple-Family Residential
          RMD  Medium Density Multiple-Family Residential
          RHD  High Density Multiple Family Residential
In addition to these zones, residential uses are permitted within either mixed-use or
live/work projects in the following four commercial zoning districts:
          CN   Commercial Neighborhood
          CG   Commercial General
          CC   Commercial Community
          CD   Commercial Downtown
As noted in Chapter III, the interim terminus of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
Expo light rail line is located near the intersection of Venice and National Boulevards in
the eastern portion of Culver City. The city is actively involved in the planning process for
the TOD mixed-use development directly adjacent to the Expo light rail transit station
(see Figure IV-1). Affordable housing has the potential to be developed in one or more of
the various properties located within the TOD District. One property, the Exceptional
Children’s Foundation site, has been identified as one of the affordable housing
opportunity sites found in the Comprehensive Housing Strategy (CHS). The city recognizes
that the CHS is a long-range planning tool that is contingent upon the state of the
economy, market forces and availability of land.
A summary of the types of residential use permitted within each zoning district is provided
in Table IV-2.

Additionally, subsequent to adoption of zoning code text amendments in July of 2013,
Emergency Shelters are allowed by right in the city east of Ballona Creek which includes
portions of both Industrial and East Washington Overlay zones.
Low-income housing can be accommodated in all zones permitting residential use in
Culver City. These may include second residential units in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts,
multi-family apartments in the RLD, RMD and RHD zones, as well as high-density
commercial/residential mixed-use developments within the Commercial districts. For
details regarding how affordability is determined please refer to Appendix B.
Development Standards – Residential Districts
A summary of the development standards for the six major zones permitting residential
development is provided in Table IV-3. Allowable densities range from 8.7 units/acre in
the R-1 zone up to 29.0 units/acre in the RMD and RHD zones. These development
standards continue to be viewed as necessary to protect the public health, safety and
welfare and maintain the quality of life, and are not considered constraints on the
development of housing for all income levels.
Minimum lot area per parcel is generally 5,000 square feet or the average of residential
lots within a 500-foot radius of the proposed subdivision, whichever is greater. Density

The Planned Development (PD) District is applied to areas of existing large scale,
multiple-family residential and commercial complexes and to sites suitable for similar
large-scale development. Within the PD District, there is no maximum density - only
minimum site area (one acre) and height limit (56 feet) apply. A Comprehensive Plan
establishes all other standards within the PD District.

Development Standards - Mixed-Use
Residential/commercial mixed-use projects are allowed in four of the city’s six
commercial zoning districts at densities ranging from 35 to 65 units/acre. The normal
maximum density of 35 units/acre may be increased to 50 units/acre outside of the TOD
district when community benefits are provided. Within the TOD district, a density up to 65
units/acre may be approved with community benefits. City Council Resolution No. 2008-
R015 established the Community Benefit Incentive Program. As part of the program, a
menu of potential benefits was created that include streetscape improvements, pocket
parks and public open spaces, metered public parking in excess of code required
parking, and other benefits as determined by the City Council. Depending on the type
of mixed-use project and its location, some or all of these benefits could be required as
part of the approval to increase the project density above the base density of 35
units/acre.
Specific development standards are shown in Table IV-4. These development standards
allow building heights ranging from 35 to 56 feet depending on location. The 35-foot
height limit only applies to parcels that are adjacent to lower-density R-1 or R-2 areas.
The 56-foot height limit is allowed on parcels in the CD and CG zones where they will not

c.      Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional/supportive
living arrangements, and single room occupancy units. The city’s provisions for these
housing types are discussed below.
      •      Residential Care Facilities and Housing for Persons with Disabilities – Residential
             care facility refers to any family home, group home, or rehabilitation facility
             that provides non-medical care to persons in need of personal services,
             protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, or training essential for daily
             living.
            State requirements. Health and Safety Code §§1267.8, 1566.3, 1568.08 require
            local governments to treat licensed group homes and residential care facilities
            with six or fewer residents no differently than other by-right single-family housing
            uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the operator’s
            family, or persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow these licensed
            residential care facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may not
            require licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons to obtain
            conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family
            dwellings.
            The Culver City Municipal Code provides the following definition:
                 Residential Care Facility. Facilities providing 24-hour residential, assisted
                 living, social and personal care for children, the elderly, and people with
                 limited ability for self-care. Varying levels of care and supervision are
                 provided. Residential care facilities may include basic services and
                 community space. Includes: board and care homes; children’s homes;
                 transitional houses; orphanages; rehabilitation centers; convalescent
                 homes, nursing homes and similar facilities. Excludes facilities for persons
                 requiring surgical or other primary medical treatment.
            In July of 2013 the Council adopted zoning code amendments that: removed
            transitional housing from the above definition; created a new definition for
            transitional housing; established transitional housing as a residential use subject
            to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
            same zone; and allowed transitional housing in all zones where residential uses
            are allowed.
            The Code identifies residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons as
            permitted uses within any residential or commercial zoning district with no
            allowable discretionary review authority on the part of the city. Large care
            facilities (7 or more persons) are conditionally permitted in the RLD, RMD, RHD,
            CN, CG and CC zones.
      •      The city’s building code incorporates the California Building Code 2007
             Edition. Accessibility provisions contained in the Code include Title 24 of the
                                                 IV-7                                 January 2014

             California Code of Regulations, which applies to new and remodel
             construction permits within the city.
            Definition of “family”. The Municipal Code does not currently contain a
            definition of “family.” Measure 2.M is included in the Housing Plan to provide a
            definition consistent with state law. Further a definition of “family” consistent
            with state law is included in the Glossary section of this current Housing
            Element.
            Reasonable accommodation procedures. The Municipal Code did not
            contain a description of reasonable accommodation procedures for persons
            with disabilities. In July of 2013, the City Council adopted amendments to the
            Zoning Code that provide for reasonable accommodation procedures
            consistent with state law.
            Maximum concentration requirements.             There are no concentration or
            separation requirements for residential care facilities or group homes in the
            Zoning Code.
            Site planning requirements. There are no special site planning requirements
            (other than parking, height, and setbacks) for residential care facilities in the
            Zoning Code.
            Parking requirements. One parking space per three beds is required for
            residential care facilities.
            There are currently four group homes in Culver City that address the supportive
            service and housing needs of persons challenged by developmental
            disabilities. These homes include the Barman, Braddock/Jasmine, Fairbanks
            and Caroline Homes. These homes serve a total of 24 persons. All of these
            homes exist due to assistance from the former Redevelopment Agency
            Housing Set-Aside Fund to either purchase, lease or rehabilitate the
            property. In 2010, former Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside funds in
            the amount of $465,910 were utilized to rehabilitate the Fairbank Group Home
            to address health and safety issues and install accessible bathrooms and
            ramps. With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency, these group
            homes are supported by the Culver City Housing Authority.
      •      Farm Worker Housing – The city’s Zoning Ordinance does not         identify farm
             worker housing separately as a permitted use. No agricultural      activities are
             found within Culver City or in the surrounding communities. In     addition, the
             2010 Census did not identify any migrant or permanent              farm worker
             households in the city.
      •      Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing – Senate Bill 2 of 2007
             strengthened the planning requirements for local governments in the area of
             emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Cities must estimate
             the number of persons in need of emergency shelter and determine whether
             adequate capacity currently exists to serve the need. If there is insufficient
             capacity, cities are required to identify at least one zone where emergency
             shelters may be established “by right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit)
                                                 IV-8                             January 2014

             provide a facility.
            Section 17.700.010 of the Culver City Municipal Code includes the following
            definition:
                 Emergency Shelter. Facilities for the emergency or temporary shelter and
                 feeding of indigents or disaster victims, operated by a public or non-profit
                 agency. These accommodations may include temporary lodging, meals,
                 laundry facilities, bathing, counseling, and other basic support services.
            In 2008 the city approved a conditional use permit application for a 60-bed
            full-time emergency shelter, Upward Bound House. This facility does not serve
            single homeless men. Emergency shelters are identified by the Zoning Code as
            a conditionally permitted use within the CN, CG and CC commercial zoning
            districts. In July of 2013 the City Council adopted zoning code amendments
            that included allowing emergency shelters by-right in the area of the city east
            of Ballona Creek.
            SB 2 also provides that transitional and supportive housing shall be considered
            a residential use that is subject only to those procedures and requirements that
            apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone. In July
            of 2013 zoning code amendments were adopted by the City Council that
            contain definitions for transitional and supportive housing and provide
            regulations for these uses that are no more restrictive than other residential
            developments of the same type in the same zone.
      •      Single Room Occupancy – The zoning code did not address Single Room
             Occupancy (SRO) dwellings as a separate land use. In July of 2013 zoning
             code amendments were adopted by the City Council that include explicit
             reference, development standards and permit procedures to encourage and
             facilitate SRO housing.
d.      Off-Street Parking Requirements
The city’s parking requirements for residential zones vary by residential type and housing
product (Table IV-5). Two off-street parking spaces are required per unit for single-family,
duplex or triplex dwellings. Parking requirements for multi-family dwellings and the
residential component of mixed-use development are based on the number of
bedrooms, and include standards for guest parking. Mobile homes are required to have
one space per site, plus one guest parking space for each two mobile home sites. There
is no direct provision in the Code for the reduction in parking standards as an incentive
for the provision of affordable housing, although the city’s Density Bonus Ordinance
includes provisions for incentives according to the provisions of Government Code
§65915.

   Source: Culver City Zoning Code
The graduated parking requirement based on unit size in multi-family projects, and the
reduced standard for senior housing units helps to encourage development of smaller,
more affordable units. These parking standards are reasonable and do not act as a
constraint to affordable developments.
Moreover, in the Westside portion of Los Angeles County there is high housing density
coupled with traffic congestion. Culver City, which is surrounded by the City of Los
Angeles, is committed to mitigating impacts of surrounding developments to the extent
possible. A shortage of parking, in both residential and commercial projects, often leads
to spill-over parking in surrounding residential neighborhoods. Both prospective residents
and existing neighbors of new developments want to be assured that adequate parking
will be available. Developers have also indicated a preference for more than one
parking space per unit because they view it as an amenity and selling point, especially
when spill-over parking creates problems.
Nevertheless, Measure 2.O in the Housing Plan includes a commitment to reduce
required parking for studio and one-bedroom units upon the developer’s request, when
a required percentage of those units are reserved for very-low- (including extremely-low-
) and lower-income households.
e.         Accessory Units
The creation of a second unit on a single-family lot is permitted within the R-1, R-2 and R-3
Zones with approval of an Administrative Use Permit. The units may not exceed 600
                                                               IV-10                                                  January 2014

square feet, and must be developed on a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet. The
Code does not place occupancy restrictions on second units.
f.      Density Bonus
Under state law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a density increase up
to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the Municipal
Code and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of equivalent financial
value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to
low- or moderate-income households. Chapter 17.580 of the Culver City Zoning Code
reflects current state law regarding density bonus and other affordable housing
incentives. The city has utilized the Density Bonus Program in the past to support the
development of lower-income senior, handicapped, and family dwelling units.
g.      Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on
site, thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the
installation of mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also
declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and
zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile
home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code. In the Zoning Code,
the definition of single family detached dwelling Includes factory built modular homes
and mobile homes/manufactured housing on permanent foundations. Housing of this
type would thus be subject to development standards consistent with single-family
detached dwellings.
h.      Condominium Conversions
Condominium conversions of existing developments of five or more rental dwelling units
may be permitted subject to approval of a Site Plan Review and Tentative Map by the
Planning Commission. Compliance with basic Property Development Standards for the
zoning district is required. Developments of less than five rental units are prohibited from
converting to condominiums.
i.      Building Codes and Enforcement
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such charges to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed.
The city’s Building Code currently incorporates the California Building Codes 2010 Edition.
The city’s Building Code also incorporates the California Building, Plumbing, Mechanical
and Electrical Codes. These are considered the minimum necessary to protect the
public's health, safety and welfare.

City of Culver City Housing Element                                           IV. Constraints
As noted in Chapter III, a new Solar Photovoltaic Ordinance has been adopted by the
city. All new construction projects, commercial or multi-family, of 3 or more units or 10,000
new square feet or greater, are required to install 1 kilowatt (kw) of solar photovoltaic
power for each 10,000 square feet of new construction, not including parking garage
areas. Additionally, new additions of over 10,000 new square feet or major renovations of
over 10,000 square feet are required to install 1 kilowatt of solar photovoltaic power for
each 10,000 square feet of major renovation or additional area. The solar photovoltaic
requirement does not apply to projects of less than 10,000 square feet, regardless of
whether the project comprises new construction, major remodels, or additions. One
kilowatt of solar photovoltaic power is estimated to add less than 1/2 of 1% to the cost of
construction.
These codes and regulations are reasonable and necessary to ensure health and safety,
as well as encourage energy conservation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. No
additional regulations have been imposed by the city that would unnecessarily add to
housing costs.
Code Enforcement staff attempts to assist property owners in carrying out needed
maintenance and repairs by providing information and referrals to city assistance
programs, particularly for low-income or disabled persons and the elderly.
       2.      Development Processing Procedures
a.      Residential Permit Processing
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the city has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits
while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
Early consultation with city staff is encouraged to identify issues as soon as possible and
reduce processing time. Applicants may be required to complete a Preliminary Project
Review (PPR) Request prior to submitting a project application. A PPR Request form
summarizing the project, along with plans indicating a proposed site plan, parking, and
pedestrian and vehicular access, are circulated among city departments for review,
followed by a meeting of the Project Review Committee (PRC) (comprised of
representatives of the reviewing department) with the applicant. This consultation allows
the applicant to determine the feasibility of the project and make adjustments during
the preliminary planning stages to minimize costs. The PPR/PRC meeting is held within two
to three weeks after the PPR request submittal.
After the PPR/PRC meeting, the applicant assembles an application and more detailed
plans, including elevations, architectural design, and additional information that may
have been noted in the PPR/PRC meeting (such as technical studies or a tentative map)
and submits a formal discretionary application with the Planning Division. Concurrent
processing of required discretionary entitlements (e.g., subdivision and site plan review
requests) is also provided as a means of expediting the review process. Similar to the PPR
process with a PRC meeting, a discretionary application is also circulated to various city
departments (Public Works, Building Safety, Fire Prevention, Planning) for comment and
                                             IV-12                               January 2014
City of Culver City Housing Element                                                IV. Constraints
review. At the application PRC meeting, staff will provide more detailed comments on
the more complete plans, draft conditions of approval, and any required corrections to
the plans that must be completed prior to distributing them to the Planning Commission
for a public hearing. After a sufficient public noticing period, a public hearing is held.
Once a decision is made by the Planning Commission, the discretionary application is
then ready for building permit plan check (unless the discretionary entitlement
procedures require that first the City Council make a final decision after Planning
Commission recommendations have been made). Generally, the application PRC
meeting is held within two to three weeks after submittal of the discretionary application.
If deemed complete at the application PRC meeting, staff usually is able to schedule the
Public Hearing within 9 to 11 weeks after the PRC meeting.
Single- and two-family developments (with no subdivision) require only building permits
(i.e., “by-right”) while multi-family and mixed-use developments are processed the same
way as described above.
The Building permit plan check review period for the processing of residential building
permits is generally ten days for the first round of reviews by various city departments and
five days for resubmittal, depending on the city’s workload. Building codes are applied
to new construction, and are monitored and inspected under the building permit
process. Where no permits have been obtained, inspections are made in response to
request and complaints. As indicated previously, the city’s Building Code incorporates
the California Building Codes 2010 Edition. The city’s Building, Mechanical, Plumbing and
Electrical codes include minor revisions and amendments to the Uniform Codes that
exceed state standards. These amendments are related to fire alarms, smoke detectors,
sprinkler systems, and other basic safety measures. All new structures are required to
provide fire sprinklers. Although this requirement adds incrementally to the cost of
construction, it is considered a vital public safety issue that justifies the additional cost.
These procedures help to ensure that the development review process meets all legal
requirements without causing a significant unwarranted constraint to housing
development.
b.       Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all development projects under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Most projects in Culver City are either Categorically
Exempt or require only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative
Declaration. Developments that have the potential of creating significant impacts that
cannot be mitigated require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report. Most
residential projects require a Negative Declaration and take two to three weeks to
prepare, excluding the required public review period. Those requiring a Mitigated
Negative Declaration typically take three weeks to process, again excluding required
public review periods. The preparation and public review period for negative
declarations and mitigated negative declarations is included within the 9 to 11 weeks it
takes to get a complete application to the Planning Commission for a public hearing.
Categorically Exempt developments such as accessory residential units require a minimal
                                               IV-13                                  January 2014

amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental review does not pose a
significant constraint to housing development.
       3.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the city and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and
infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system,
based on the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will
be derived. Table IV-6 shows typical development fees associated with development of
a 120-unit affordable apartment/condominium project within Culver City, including
entitlement costs. For the project described above the school fees ($289,300) and the
sewer facility charge ($162,720) are not part of the entitlement costs and payment
would be required either prior to Building Permit issuance or prior to Certificate of
Occupancy. Subtracting these costs, the minimum entitlement and plan check fees for
this type of project would be approximately $95,523, or $796 per unit.
Because many of the fees are “deposit to cost” or are based on building valuation, the
precise cost of development fees cannot be tabulated. However, the cost per unit and
per square foot is useful as a “general rule of thumb” for estimating minimum
development fees. The city periodically evaluates the actual cost of processing
development permits when revising its fee schedule. The last fee schedule update was
adopted in July, 2013.
In order to facilitate development of covenanted low and moderate-income units, the
city specifically exempts such projects from In-lieu Parkland Fees and Art in Public Places
Fees. Single family dwellings are exempted from this fee, and for a duplex or second unit
the park fee is only 50% of the fee for that second unit. These exemptions serve as
incentives in addition to the Density Bonus Program.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13
has been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to
development impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The city
requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their
projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the
Subdivision Map Act. Measure 2.P in the Housing Plan states that the city will offset the
Surcharge for New Construction discretionary application fee for Redevelopment
Agency-assisted projects with housing Set-Aside funds.           With the elimination of
Redevelopment Agencies by the State this measure cannot be fulfilled at this time.
However, the measure will become operational if and when grant monies for affordable

* Does not include non-city fees
** In order to facilitate development of covenanted low and moderate-income units, the city specifically exempts such projects from paying In-lieu Parkland
Fees and Art in Public Places fees - thus the two fees are not shown in the table
*** This fee was enacted as means of recovering the cost of staff time associated with projects - larger projects tend to take up more time so the fee is based
on number of units rather than a flat rate.
**** The Building & Safety Division assesses a Condominium Tax of $1,000 per unit.
The city’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements including streets, bridges, and other public works projects to facilitate,
among other things, the continued build-out of the city’s General Plan. The CIP also
helps to ensure that construction of public improvements is coordinated with private
development.
City road standards vary by roadway designation as provided in Table IV-7. The city’s
road standards are typical for cities in Los Angeles County and they do not act as a
constraint to housing development. Since the city is fully developed, it is unlikely that any
new streets or roadway widening will be required through the subdivision process. With
new development projects (housing, commercial, or mixed-use), the city’s Public Works
Department will usually require public right-of-way improvements for public rights-of-way
adjacent to proposed development projects. These improvements can vary depending
on the specifics of each development and may include relocation of utilities, new street
trees and tree grates, repaving or repair of adjacent alleys, repaving of adjacent
sidewalks and streets, restriping of traffic lanes, and installation of traffic signals.
                                                                      Table IV-7

Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.

City of Culver City Housing Element                                             IV. Constraints
B.      Non-Governmental Constraints
       1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The city’s land use plans have been
designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to protect public safety by
avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies constrain residential
development to some extent, they are necessary to support other public policies.
       2.      Infrastructure Constraints
As in most cities of similar age, Culver City faces challenges of aging infrastructure and
related maintenance issues. However, the city’s physical infrastructure is generally of
adequate size and capacity to accommodate the projected build-out of the General
Plan.
      Wastewater – The city is served by the Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant
            operated by the City of Los Angeles. The treatment plant has a design
            capacity of 450 million gallons per day, is currently functioning at
            approximately 291.2 million gallons a day which is about 64.70% of its capacity
            (source: City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Sanitation e-mail communication on
            June 20, 2013). It is unlikely, but expansion of the Hyperion treatment plant
            may be required if changes in Los Angeles or Culver City land uses cause
            increased wastewater flows. Costs for wastewater system expansions are
            passed on to Culver City by the City of Los Angeles in accordance with the
            Amalgamated Sewer Agreement. Culver City collects sewer facility charges
            from new developments to offset these costs. In addition, new development
            has the potential to impact the local sewer collection system and require
            capacity upgrades. Developers are required to fund these improvements
            when required.
      •     Water – Water for city residents is supplied by Golden State Water Company
            and the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (for the portion
            of the city west of McLaughlin Avenue). The system depends primarily on
            imported water from Metropolitan Water District (MWD). Water system
            expansions to individual projects are the responsibility of the developer with
            fees paid to cover major capital expenditures.
      •     Dry Utilities – Gas, electricity, and telephone services are provided by Southern
            California Gas Company, Southern California Edison, AT&T, and Verizon
            Communications, respectively. All systems are adequate and are upgraded
            as demand increases. Supplies of natural resources, such as gas, currently
            appear adequate.
                                                IV-17                              January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                            IV. Constraints
      •      Storm Water Drainage – Storm water runoff is primarily handled by a flood
             control system maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of Public
             Works. Surface drainage utilizes streets and gutters until the runoff reaches
             catch basins. The storm drain system is currently operating within capacity,
             and is sized to accommodate planned growth within the city. The city is
             required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to
             address water quality runoff for construction activities and post-construction
             runoff from all types of development, including residential projects. Best
             management practices (BMPs) are implemented through the city’s NPDES
             regional storm-water discharge permit. Individual projects are required to
             comply with all applicable NPDES requirements.
      •      Schools and Parks – The city collects school fees on behalf of the Culver City
             Unified School District to pay for buildings and facilities. Public Parks are
             developed and maintained by the city’s Parks, Recreation and Community
             Services Department. Municipal Code Title 15, §§15.06.300-15.060.330
             (Residential Development Park Dedication and In Lieu Parkland Fee) requires
             that all new residential developments of two or more dwelling units or
             additions of one or more units on existing residential developments either
             dedicate land or pay a fee for the development and/or maintenance of
             public parks. Title 15 states a goal of providing 3 acres of parkland for every
             1,000 residents or, if no land is available, to pay a fee that quantifies the 3
             acres per 1,000 resident objective. Residential developments containing units
             which are covenanted for affordability or for senior citizens are exempted
             from this fee.
      •      Road Improvements and Parking – Roadways in Culver City are subject to high
             levels of traffic, which would be further impacted by new development. To the
             extent possible, the city addresses this issue by requiring developers to
             mitigate negative traffic impacts through various methods, such as improve-
             ments to the roadway network and traffic control systems and
             implementation of the Travel Demand Management strategies.
            One of the primary infrastructure issues associated with the current level of
            development is the limited capacity of on-street parking. The city is addressing
            this constraint incrementally by ensuring that all new developments, both
            residential and commercial, provide adequate off-street parking.
            The city has a Capital Improvement Program to schedule public improvements
            including roadway network, traffic control systems and other public works
            projects to allow for, among other things, the continued build-out of the city’s
            General Plan. This helps to ensure the progression of improvements is
            coordinated with anticipated development.
       3.       Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and have been steadily increasing since
                                               IV-18                              January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                                 IV. Constraints
2000. The recent downturn in the housing market is expected to have a moderating
effect on land values, however.
Per-unit land cost is directly affected by density – higher density allows the cost to be
spread across more units, reducing the total unit price. Recent new mixed-use
developments have been approved in the range of 29 to 65 units per acre, and
exclusive residential RMD developments have been approved at 13 to 24 units per acre.
This facilitates lower per-unit land costs compared to lower-density development.
       4.      Construction Costs
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The city has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Culver City are not substantially
different from other cities in the West Los Angeles area.
       5.      Cost and Availability of Financing
Culver City is similar to most other communities with regard to private sector home
financing programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry will affect the availability
and cost of real estate loans, although the long-term effects are unpredictable. The
credit “crunch” resulted from “sub-prime” lenders, who, during the past several years,
made it possible for low-income families, or others who could not qualify for standard
mortgages, to become home owners even though they might not have had the credit
history and income to support repayment of the loans. The problem typically occurred
with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) after the initial fixed interest rate period expires
(often three years) and the interest rate converts to market rate. Because ARMs often
offer “teaser” initial interest rates well below market for the first few years, monthly
payments may increase by several hundred dollars when the loan converts to market
rate. When property values were increasing, as was the case from 2000 to 2006,
homeowners had the option of refinancing to a new loan when the initial rate expired.
However, in the current market with declining values, homeowners may owe more than
the resale value of their home, making refinancing impossible. As a result of these
conditions, there has been a significant rise in foreclosure rates, and changes in
mortgage underwriting standards are likely to have greater impacts on low-income
families than other segments of the community.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). City staff is not aware of any significant incidence of
discriminatory lending practices in recent years.
C.      Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the city’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. From 2000-2010,
the Housing Division contracted with the Housing Rights Center (HRC) to provide
                                                 IV-19                                 January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                          IV. Constraints
information and assistance regarding tenant/landlord rights and issues and to address
discrimination claims. This contract was not renewed in 2010 with the dissolution of
Redevelopment. Since FY 2000-2010, 3,062 clients have contacted HRC for housing
information or to file a complaint. Though the contract was not renewed, when the
Housing Division is contacted regarding a fair housing complaint, the client is still referred
to and assisted by the HRC to obtain information pertaining to their rights and how to file
a complaint. In addition, all participants in the Housing Division rental assistance
programs are provided the HUD Fair Housing information booklet during their initial
briefing session and annually during the annual recertification process. The Housing
Authority also posts fair housing posters and outreach material in the Housing Division
lobby. In addition, the city has established a Landlord-Tenant Mediation Board to offer
voluntary mediation services to the landlord tenant community.

                       existing housing units. Currently, this policy is defunded due to State
                       legislative action eliminating the city’s Redevelopment Agency. This
                       policy will remain as funding from State/Federal sources may
                       become available in the future and the city may be eligible for such
                       funding sources.
        Policy 1.D     Monitor the maintenance of residential properties and enforce the
                       provisions of the city's building code and property maintenance
                       regulations.
        Policy 1.E     Promote assistance programs and enforce applicable health and
                       safety standards to prevent overcrowding in units.
        Policy 1.F     Enforce zoning and building code regulations to prevent the illegal
                       conversion of garages and accessory structures into dwelling units.
        Policy 1.G     Promote energy conservation measures to reduce future operating
                       costs.
Objective 2. Housing Supply. Maintain opportunities for developing a variety of housing
        types while protecting the character and stability of existing Culver City
        neighborhoods.
        Policy 2.A     Provide for a residential lifestyle that is environmentally sound and
                       aesthetically pleasing and that places a high priority on quality
                       development.

        Policy 2.B     Coordinate the plans, programs, and policies of all city departments
                       in order to ensure that residential development is orderly, and that
                       new development is adequately and effectively served by a
                       balanced system of transportation, transit, community facilities, and
                       public services. Residential development must be sensitive to the
                       environmental, recreational, social and economic needs of the
                       community. In addition, as part of this policy, promote access,
                       where feasible, to the future Light Rail Transit facilities at Washington
                       and National Boulevards, for new residential development.
        Policy 2.C     Preserve the character, scale, and quality of established residential
                       neighborhoods.
        Policy 2.D     Allow mixed use residential development in areas that allow mixed
                       use per the Zoning Code. Such developments must be sensitive to
                       adjacent residential uses and reinforce the commercial use of the
                       area.
        Policy 2.E     Investigate the potential for future housing and open space
                       opportunities in the undeveloped areas of the city; study the
                       potential for housing that allows Culver City residents currently living
                       in single-family homes to have the opportunity to purchase smaller
                       units or units that are a part of mixed-use developments as their
                       needs change while they age; and encourage affordable housing
                       for young professionals.
        Policy 2.F     Promote programs that seek to provide housing opportunities to
                       meet the needs of people who work in the city so that they do not
                       have to commute long distances, thereby addressing the regional
                       issue of achieving an adequate jobs/housing balance for the
                       western portion of Los Angeles County, while still supporting an
                       increase in employment opportunities within the city.
Objective 3. Housing Affordability. Provide rental and home ownership housing
        opportunities that are compatible with the range of income levels of Culver City
        residents
        Policy 3.A     Encourage the inclusion of affordable housing units in new housing
                       developments by granting incentives as called for by the Zoning
                       Code and the state density bonus law.
        Policy 3.B     Actively support affordable housing development by private and
                       non-profit housing developers.
        Policy 3.C     Encourage a balanced geographical distribution of lower-income
                       housing in order to eliminate the potential of creating areas of high
                       concentrations of any one type of household.
        Policy 3.D     Conserve existing affordable housing, particularly rental and assisted
                       units.

Objective 4. Housing Access. Improve access to quality housing for all members of the
        community by eliminating discrimination, reducing physical constraints, increasing
        the number of affordable housing units, and supporting access to emergency
        shelters.
        Policy 4.A     Promote efforts aimed at the development of housing available to
                       all income and age levels.
        Policy 4.B     Promote housing opportunities for families of all income levels to help
                       maintain the family-oriented character of the city into the future.
        Policy 4.C     Assist first time home buyers to purchase housing with alternative
                       financing mechanisms.
        Policy 4.D     Promote rental assistance programs to minimize the extent to which
                       lower-income households must pay more than 30% of their income
                       for housing.
        Policy 4.E     Promote fair housing and non-discrimination in housing sales and
                       rentals by supporting organizations that provide information,
                       counseling and mediation on fair housing laws and landlord-tenant
                       disputes.
        Policy 4.F     Prohibit discrimination in the sale or renting of housing to anyone on
                       the basis of their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, age, family
                       status or sexual orientation.
        Policy 4.G     Combat red-lining practices in mortgage lending and insurance
                       underwriting.
        Policy 4.H     Encourage the rehabilitation and construction of barrier-free housing
                       for persons with disability.
        Policy 4.I     Assist homeless persons by referral to services and provision of
                       emergency services.
        Policy 4.J     Enable elderly and/or disabled persons to continue living in their
                       homes by providing information on caregivers and funding for
                       caregivers through such sources as the Los Angeles County In-Home
                       Supportive Services.
        Policy 4.K     Facilitate the ability for caregivers to live in the homes of the people
                       they care for by providing information on funding sources such as
                       the Los Angeles County In-Home Supportive Services.
Quantified Objectives
The city’s eight-year quantified housing objectives are described in Table V-1, below.
These objectives reflect the city’s assessment of what is feasible during the planning
period in light of existing and proposed housing programs, land use policies, financial
resources, and anticipated economic conditions.

          * Quantified objective for new construction is for the period October, 2013 – October, 2021 per the RHNA
          ** Rehabilitation and conservation are Culver City Housing Authority programs that were funded by Redevelopment Agency Housing
          Set Aside funds. These programs are currently unfunded because of State legislated elimination of redevelopment agencies. They
          will remain as objectives and will be reactivated when State and Federal funding sources become available.
B.      Housing Programs
California State housing law requires that the Housing Element set forth an eight-year
schedule of actions for the 2013-2021 planning period that the city intends to undertake
to implement its stated policies and objectives. The following section describes the
measures that the city plans to implement consistent with its identified policies and
objectives described above. Table V-2 identifies the time-frame, responsible agency,
and funding source for implementation of housing programs and their quantitative
objectives.
Several of the Housing Element measures identified below are based on the
Comprehensive Housing Strategy (CHS). On March 17, 2008, the former Redevelopment
Agency reviewed the CHS in its entirety and authorized implementation of years 1 and 2
of a 7-1/2 year program and instructed staff to return to the former Redevelopment
Agency with further discussion of the other projects identified in the CHS. The Culver City
City Council and Culver City Housing Authority have had oversight over the
management and implementation of the CHS since the State legislated elimination of
redevelopment agencies.
Some of the implementation measures described below call for amendments to the
Municipal Code or other policy documents. All such actions will require a public review
process that includes public notice, hearings and exercise of legislative discretion by the
Planning Commission and City Council.
Measure 1. Continue Current Housing Programs. From 2008 to 2012, the Housing Division
        implemented a variety of programs that assist city residents with rental assistance,
        promote building maintenance and rehabilitation, new construction and support
        fair housing practices. Currently all programs except for the Group Home
        Monitoring and Landlord-Tenant Mediation Board are defunded due to State
        legislative action eliminating the city’s Redevelopment Agency. These financial
        resources will be resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes
        available and the city is eligible for such funding sources.
                                                                            V-4                                                      January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                           V. Housing Plan
      A.    Section 8 Program. Help very-low- and extremely-low-income households
            secure decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing through the provision of
            rental subsidies through the Section 8 program and conduct outreach to
            attract new property owners.
      B.    Rental Assistance Program. Assist extremely-low- up to and including
            moderate-income households to pay for housing through the Rental
            Assistance Program (RAP). With the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency,
            new applicants will not be accepted until other funding sources become
            available.
      C.    Shared Housing – Contract with Alternative Living for the Aging (ALA) to
            facilitate roommate matching for up-to-moderate income residents searching
            for alternative independent-living situations. During FY 2008-2009, 7 roommate
            matches were made. In FY 2009-2010, 3 matches were made. The Shared
            Housing program was eliminated in the FY 2010-2011 due to the elimination of
            funding from the Redevelopment Agency. If funding becomes available in the
            future, the Housing Division will examine reestablishing the program.
      D.    Existing Covenanted Buildings. Monitor existing covenanted buildings for
            compliance with affordability restrictions, and with occupancy and
            maintenance covenants in order to upgrade and maintain the character and
            condition of the neighborhoods while preserving affordability to residents.
      E.    Homeless Service Referrals. Assist homeless persons and families through referral
            to temporary shelter facilities and services in the Westside area, providing
            hotel/motel vouchers as needed.
      F.    Emergency Shelters. Support Upward Bound House in providing emergency
            shelter beds to homeless children and their families.
      G.    Emergency Food Vouchers. Refer needy clients for one-time food vouchers on
            an emergency basis to the Culver City Area Interfaith Alliance and the SAVES
            program of St. Augustine Catholic Church.
      H.    Group Homes. Monitor group homes and housing for persons with special
            needs to ensure compliance with the Federal Housing Quality Standards (HQS),
            and city Health and Safety Codes. One of the properties within the TOD district
            that is proposed by the Exceptional Children’s Foundation (ECF) will provide 50
            units of low- and very-low-income housing for persons with developmental
            disabilities. This site is currently owned by ECF. There are currently 5 Group
            Homes in the Housing Division Affordable Housing Inventory which provides a
            total of 29 beds for persons with developmental and physical disabilities.
      I.    The Neighborhood Preservation Program (NPP). Implement the Neighborhood
            Preservation Program (NPP) that provides grants, rebates, emergency grants,
            and deferred loans to qualified low- and moderate-income households, and
            to owners of multi-family housing with qualified low-income tenants. The
            purpose of these NPP grants, rebates, and loans is to rehabilitate and maintain
            sound housing conditions, to make modifications to accommodate persons
            with disabilities, and to install energy-saving features.
                                                  V-5                             January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                              V. Housing Plan
            Since 1992, the NPP has averaged 100 units a year. Through this program, 822
            single family homes have been preserved, and 865 multi-family units have
            been preserved since 1992. In FY 2008-2009, 16 single family homes and 61
            multi-family homes were rehabilitated. In FY 2009-2010 15 single family homes
            and 24 multi-family homes were rehabilitated. In 2010, 7 single family and 9
            multi-family homes were rehabilitated. The NPP program was placed on hold in
            mid-2010 due to the pending elimination of the Redevelopment Agency. In
            2011, the NPP program ceased to function due to lack of funding with the
            removal of Housing Set-Aside Funds. If funding becomes available in the future,
            the program will be reestablished.
      J.    Graffiti Removal. Work with property owners to remove graffiti through the
            Public Works Department and encouraging local monitoring by owners.
            Continue to help community groups to organize volunteer graffiti removal
            activities.
      K.    Fair Housing Counseling. Contract with the Housing Rights Center (HRC) to
            provide information and assistance regarding tenant/landlord rights and issues
            and to address discrimination claims.
            From 2000-2010, the Housing Division contracted with the Housing Rights Center
            (HRC) to provide information and assistance regarding tenant/landlord rights
            and issues and to address discrimination claims. This contract was not renewed
            in 2010 with the pending dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency. Since FY
            2000-2010, 3,062 clients have contacted HRC for housing information or to file a
            complaint.
            Though the contract was not renewed, when the Housing Division is contacted
            regarding a fair housing complaint, the client is still referred to and assisted by
            the HRC to obtain information pertaining to their rights and how to file a
            complaint. In addition, all participants in the Housing Division rental assistance
            programs are provided the HUD Fair Housing information booklet during their
            initial briefing session and annually during the annual recertification process.
            The Housing Division also posts fair housing posters and outreach material in the
            Housing Division lobby.
      L.    Landlord-Tenant Mediation Board. Fund mediations of rent increase issues
            between landlords and tenants through the Landlord Tenant Mediation Board.
      M.    Temporary Emergency Rental and Relocation Assistance Program. Provide
            funds for security deposit for individuals forced to relocate due to change of
            use or code enforcement, or for up-to-moderate income tenants involuntarily
            displaced due to government action such as code enforcement actions or
            change in land use. This program was never activated due to the pending
            elimination of the redevelopment agencies statewide and the subsequent
            elimination of the city’s Redevelopment Agency after the ruling of AB 26.
            Implementation of this measure will be resurrected once funding from
            State/Federal sources becomes available.

      N.    Property Acquisition and Rehabilitation Program. Provide opportunities to
            create affordable housing through the Property Acquisition and Rehabilitation
            program by providing assistance for management and preservation of
            affordable housing to specified problem buildings. This program was never
            activated due to the pending elimination of the redevelopment agencies
            statewide and the subsequent elimination of the city’s Redevelopment
            Agency after the ruling of AB 26. Implementation of this measure will be
            resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes available.
      O.    Home Secure. Contract with Jewish Family Services (or another provider if
            funding becomes available) to provide and install security and safety devices
            and offer education and community resource information. The contract with
            Jewish Family Services to provide and install security and safety devices and
            offer education and community resource information to up-to-moderate
            income elderly and disabled persons was eliminated in FY 2011-2012 due to
            the dissolution of the city’s Redevelopment Agency. In FY 2008-2009, the
            Home Secure assisted 19 elderly and disabled persons. In FY 2009-2010, 17
            persons were assisted. In FY 2010-2011, 18 persons were assisted.
      P.    Affordable Housing Development Assistance. Offer assistance to developers to
            fund affordable housing projects for property acquisition and rehabilitation.
            In 2008, the Redevelopment Agency adopted Years 1-2 of the Comprehensive
            Housing Strategy (CHS) that outlines the allocation of Housing Set-Aside Funds
            to satisfy the requirements of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA),
            State Housing Element law and California Community Redevelopment Law.
            The CHS is based on the concept of providing mixed-income, low-density,
            scattered site affordable housing development.
            In July 2010, the former Redevelopment Agency approved an Affordable
            Housing Agreement with 4043 Irving Place Investors , LLC for the development
            of 12 (3 low income and 9 moderate income) affordable multi-family rental
            units for $6 million. The Culver Villas project located at 4043 Irving Place
            commenced construction in February 2012 and will be completed in
            September 2013. The resident application process for the 12 affordable units
            took place on July 12, 13, and 15, 2013. A total of 1,448 applications were
            received.
            In March 2011, the former Redevelopment Agency approved a DDA with
            Tilden Terrace, LP (Los Angeles Housing Partnership) for the development of a
            mixed-used, mixed-income affordable multi-family rental housing. The Tilden
            Terrace project consisted of 33 affordable units (14 very-low, 6-low, and 13-
            moderate). The project commenced development in March 2012 and
            received its Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on June 27, 2013. The
            project’s Certificate of Occupancy was issued in August of 2013. The resident
            application process for the 33 affordable units took place from March 8, 2013
            to March 21, 2013. A total of 1,254 applications were submitted to the city.
            The last project of Years 1-2 of the CHS is the Globe project which consists of 10
            ownership townhomes. The DDA was approved in January 2012. The State of
                                               V-7                                January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                            V. Housing Plan
            California, Department of Finance has approved the Housing Division to retain
            the Globe land as an asset but has disallowed any financial assistance to the
            project. The developer, Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles, will
            attempt to raise the necessary funding to complete the project.
      Q.    Redevelopment Agency/Successor to the Redevelopment Agency Housing
            Replacement. Use financial resources, if available, from the Successor to the
            Redevelopment Agency, to help replace residential units lost as a result of
            Successor Agency actions. There were no residential units lost due to
            Redevelopment Agency actions. This measure will remain in the event that
            actions by the successor agency to the Redevelopment Agency results in a
            loss of units.
Measure 2. Programs to Facilitate Additional Housing. To support the policies of the
         Housing Element, the Housing and Planning Divisions will implement the following
         programs.
      A.    Density Bonus Program. Provide information on the Density Bonus Ordinance to
            affordable housing applicants.
      B.    West Culver City Residential Rehabilitation Program. Offer rehabilitation grants
            to eligible property owners in West Culver City and provide grants to
            affordable housing developers who wish to acquire and rehabilitate units to
            provide low-income rental housing.
            The West Washington Residential Rehabilitation program is approved in the
            Redevelopment Agency’s 2009-2010 Budget for $300,000. This program was
            not fully implemented due to the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency.
            Implementation of this measure will be resurrected once funding from
            State/Federal sources becomes available.
      C.    Accessory Dwelling Ordinance. Implement the Accessory Dwelling Ordinance,
            which allows the construction of accessory dwelling units subject to an
            Administrative Use Permit.
      D.    Design Guidelines. Develop design guidelines for residential zones to ensure
            that new multiple-family developments will be consistent with the existing low-
            density character of the neighborhood. The city will ensure that the effect of
            the Guidelines will not cause an undue burden on housing supply and
            affordability.
      E.    Nine Units per Lot Restriction. Analyze the impact of the nine units-per-lot
            restriction in the RMD Zone and consider eliminating the restriction.
      F.    Comprehensive Housing Strategy (CHS)/Redevelopment Site Study. As part of
            the CHS, a study of former Redevelopment Agency-owned sites will be
            undertaken to analyze opportunities for housing or mixed-use developments
            with affordable housing components. This will include a review of sites located
            along commercial corridors that are currently used only for parking to
            determine if small-scale parking garages combined with housing would be
            feasible. The city will review implementation programming on a project by
                                             V-8                                   January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                             V. Housing Plan
            project basis. Additionally, where financially feasible, the Housing Authority will
            include extremely-low-income units in the mix of potential projects identified in
            the CHS beyond years 1 and 2.
            Preliminary analysis of former Redevelopment Agency-owned sites was
            conducted from early 2007 to early 2008. This information was incorporated in
            the CHS, which was reviewed by the former Redevelopment Agency. The
            former Redevelopment Agency authorized implementation of years 1 and 2
            and instructed staff to return to the former Redevelopment Agency with further
            discussion of the other projects identified in the CHS. Community Development
            staff from the Building Safety, Housing, Planning and Redevelopment Divisions
            collaborated in evaluating the former Redevelopment Agency-owned sites
            using six criteria:
            •     Financial Feasibility – The project is cost effective and makes sound
                  financial sense.
            •     Implementation – The project is suitable for the area without rezoning,
                  can quickly move through the entitlement process, and has limited
                  construction constraints.
            •     Timing – The project can be accomplished in a reasonable timeframe.
            •     Neighborhood Impact – The project make sense for the neighborhood
                  and is compatible in terms of density, housing type, parking, mix of
                  incomes, and impact on traffic. The project addresses blight and
                  nuisance and improves the appearance of the neighborhood.
            •     Economic Benefit – The project increases the tax base and solves other
                  fiscal needs of the city.
            •     Community Impact – The project site is near transit, creates open space,
                  promotes sustainability goals, removes blight and nuisance, and
                  substantially improves the appearance of the community.
            In addition to these criteria, prototype affordable projects were identified and
            preliminary site plans were prepared. These prototype projects were then
            priced using industry standard construction cost estimating techniques. The
            CHS details the financial feasibility, site analysis and timeframe for each former
            Redevelopment Agency-owned site.
            Under measure 1P above, Years 1-2 of the CHS were adopted by the former
            Redevelopment Agency. The Tilden Terrace and Culver Villas projects will
            complete construction in 2013 and produce 44 affordable units. The Globe
            project is projected to commence construction in 2014. This project will provide
            10 affordable units. With the completion of the Globe project, Years 1-2 of the
            CHS will be completed. Affordable housing development beyond Years 1-2 of
            the CHS will be resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes
            available.
      G.    Comprehensive Housing Strategy and Infill Development Programs. Monitor
            applications for mixed-use developments along commercial corridors and for
                                                V-9                                 January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                           V. Housing Plan
            residential developments in the RMD zone and encourage developers to
            apply for DOBI applications in order to include affordable units within
            development projects. If proposed developments are part of the CHS, work
            with the developer to ensure an affordable housing component. Maintain the
            city’s site inventory of underutilized or vacant residential and commercial lots
            which are appropriate for infill or mixed-use development, to be used as an
            informational tool for the city’s CHS.
      H.    Comprehensive Housing Strategy/Housing Priority List. As part of the CHS,
            acquire sites identified in the city’s housing priority list and build affordable
            housing commensurate with the quantified objectives. The former
            Redevelopment Agency acquired two sites for implementation in years 1 and
            2. To the extent possible, based upon funding, market conditions, economic
            forces and property availability, the city may initiate the process to acquire
            additional sites identified in the CHS.
            Implementation of this measure is de-funded due to State legislative action
            eliminating the city Redevelopment Agency. Implementation of this measure
            will be resurrected once funding from State/Federal sources becomes
            available.
      I.    Washington/Venice Land Use. Washington Place and Venice Blvd. are two
            sites identified for potential development of multi-family affordable housing in
            the CHS. A full analysis of these sites will be conducted to determine project
            feasibility.
      J.    Work Force Housing. The City of Culver City staff collaborated with staff from
            other jurisdictions in the Westside Council of Governments (COG) to complete
            a Workforce Housing Study. The target households for workforce housing are
            those that are above the eligible income levels for traditional affordable
            housing programs (typically 120% of median income) but still cannot afford
            housing. The study provides suggestions on how to create workforce housing
            using various private sector/government ventures and creative financing.
            Money and programs set aside for traditional affordable housing cannot be
            used due to income restrictions on these programs. To bring awareness to the
            local Culver City community regarding the need for Workforce Housing, a
            presentation was made to the Culver City City Council in Spring 2009.
            Additionally, staff will review the CHS to incorporate Workforce Housing into
            proposed projects where feasible. This review will be after years 1 and 2 of the
            CHS. Because funding for Workforce Housing cannot come from
            redevelopment Set-Aside funds and requires private sector collaboration
            and/or creative financing, implementation of workforce housing measures is
            difficult and cannot easily be included in housing programs or strategies that
            normally can be expected to rely on set-aside funds.
      K.    Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing. Implement development of SRO’s,
            which allows the construction of SRO’s within mixed use developments subject
            to specific SRO development standards.
                                                V-10                              January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                                V. Housing Plan
      L.      Zoning for Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing. Implement
              development of Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
              subject to specific development standards for Emergency Shelters and existing
              residential standards for Transitional/Supportive Housing. Amend the Zoning
              Code to state that Supportive Housing, regardless of the number of residents, is
              subject to only those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same
              type in the same zone.
      M.      Definition of “Family”. A definition of “family” consistent with state law is
              included in the Glossary section of the Housing Element. In addition the
              Municipal Code will be amended to include a definition of “family” consistent
              with state law.
      N.      Reasonable        Accommodation          Procedures.       Process      Reasonable
              Accommodations requests subject to approval of an administrative approval
              and compliance with applicable code standards.
      O.      Reduced Parking For Affordable Units. The city will amend its parking
              standards such that, upon a developer’s request and when a required
              percentage of units are reserved for very-low- (including extremely-low-) and
              lower-income households, only one parking space will be required for studio
              and 1-bedroom units.
      P.      Surcharge Fee for New Construction. The city will offset the New Construction
              Surcharge fee for affordable units assisted by the Redevelopment Agency with
              housing set-aside funds. This measure cannot be implemented due to the State
              legislated elimination of Redevelopment Agencies. It will be resurrected when
              funding sources become available.
Measure 3. Housing Division Administrative Activities. To assist affordable housing
         developers and preserve affordable housing opportunities, the city’s Housing
         Division will provide the following administrative services. Implementation of this
         measure is de-funded due to State legislative action eliminating the city
         Redevelopment Agency. Implementation of this measure will be resurrected
         once funding from State/Federal sources becomes available. The Housing Division
         will continue to provide technical assistance to developers and organization that
         produce housing for person with special needs and monitor at-risk affordable
         housing units.
      A.      Financial Support and Technical Assistance. Provide financial support and
              technical assistance to organizations that develop housing for populations with
              special needs.
              To encourage the inclusion of affordable housing units in new housing
              development, the Housing Division will work in partnership with Planning to offer
              density bonuses and financial assistance where appropriate to developers. The
              city will continue to inform developers when they first contact Planning that the
              city may be able to provide some financial assistance to their project in
              exchange for affordability commitments, (assuming there is funding in place to
              replace redevelopment set-aside funds that no longer exist). Additionally,
                                                  V-11                                 January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                                            V. Housing Plan
            Planning will continue to inform developers about the benefits of density bonus
            when projects are submitted for review.
      B.    Financing Negotiations for Affordable Housing Development. Work with local
            banks and lending agencies, on behalf of public and private developers, to
            assist developers with the acquisition of financing for low-income and
            moderate-income rental housing.
      C.    Facilitate Financing Negotiations for Home Purchases. Work with private
            lenders to provide mortgage financing to facilitate home ownership.
            Due to market conditions, the former Redevelopment Agency did not offer the
            Mortgage Assistance Program (MAP). The MAP program was introduced in
            1993 and 124 up-to-moderate-income households were able to achieve
            homeownership through this program. However, Culver City is a high-cost area
            and the second trust deed of $60,000 provided through the MAP program
            became inadequate as home prices escalated. A combination of rental and
            ownership housing is a key to success for any community. Because ownership
            for up-to-moderate households is very difficult in Culver City, the CHS addresses
            this issue through the production of ownership units through the city and the
            Housing Authority. Years 1 and 2 of the CHS proposes to create 18 ownership
            housing units from very-low-income to market rate income households over the
            next planning period. Where appropriate, these households will be assisted
            with a second trust deed to keep their mortgage payments affordable.
      D.    Preserve At-Risk Affordable Housing Units. There are a total of 101 affordable
            units at risk during the next planning period. The first covenants will start to
            expire in 2009. The Housing Division is contacting property owners one year
            before the covenant expiration date to inquire about their interest in
            extending their covenants. In exchange for extending covenants the city will
            offer property owners funding assistance for rehabilitation to address deferred
            maintenance through the Neighborhood Preservation Program (NPP) and
            rental assistance to qualified households through the Rental Assistance
            Program should funding for these programs become available. Coupling funds
            for rehabilitation with funds for rent subsidy enhances the financial feasibility of
            maintaining affordability covenants. In addition, non-profit organizations that
            assist in preserving at-risk units may include the following: Menorah Housing
            Foundation of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, Upward
            Bound, Alternative Living for the Aging, Mercy Housing, and Home Ownership
            Made Easy (H.O.M.E.).
Measure 4. Regulatory Incentives. To foster the development of affordable housing, the
        city will make available the following regulatory incentives.
      A.    Development Incentives. The city will work with developers who wish to process
            a Density or Other Bonus Incentive (DOBI) application which makes available
            appropriate incentives in exchange for dedicating a percentage of dwelling
            units to low-income and/or moderate-income households.
                                                V-12                               January 2014
City of Culver City Housing Element                                             V. Housing Plan
      B.    Streamline Permit Approval Process. While adhering to public review periods,
            the city will give priority processing to applications that provide extremely-low-,
            very-low-, low-, and moderate-income housing in order to reduce
            development costs associated with time delays.
      C.    Consultant Priority Processing Program. The city will make available the “Fee for
            Service” Program that allows applicants the option to utilize planning
            consultants to process project applications.
Measure 5. Distribute Public Information. The preparation and distribution of public
        information material is an effective measure for informing residents and
        developers about housing programs and activities of benefit to themselves and
        the community. Providing this information to the public effectively fosters the
        policies and objectives adopted by the city.
      A.    Promotion of Housing Programs. Market the availability of housing rehabilitation
            and maintenance programs with brochures, flyers, and other public
            information materials. With the dissolution of the city’s Redevelopment
            Agency, funds are no longer available for housing rehabilitation and
            maintenance programs. Additionally, funds are no longer available to design
            and mass produce brochures, flyers and other public information materials.
            Implementation of this measure will be resurrected once funding from
            State/Federal sources becomes available.
      B.    Distribution of Anti-Graffiti Design Information. Provide developers with
            information regarding architectural designs, building materials and
            landscaping that serve to deter graffiti.
      C.    Distribution of Noise Abatement Information. Distribute information about noise
            abatement practices, and materials including landscape elements such as
            walls or berms that may reduce noise impacts to the community.
      D.    Database of Housing Opportunities. As a tool for the city’s Comprehensive
            Housing Strategy, maintain a database of housing development opportunities
            on commercial lots which are appropriate for mixed-use and affordable

the previous housing element, adopted in 2001 and evaluates the degree to which these
programs have been implemented during the previous planning period. This analysis also
includes an assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The
findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in determining the city’s 2008
Housing Implementation Program.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies
any changes that are called for in response to the city’s experience during the past
planning period.

***4122 Lincoln Ave is an example of 2 adjacent lots (each approximately 6,753.13 square feet in area) that were not consolidated into one lot but rather developed
as separate lots with a common driveway and architectural design. Thus 4 units were built. Had the lots been consolidated into one 13,506.26 square foot parcel,
the R-2 maximum cap of 2 units would only have allowed 2 units.

                       Residential Land Inventory – 2013-2021
1.      Methodology and Assumptions
State law requires each city to include in the Housing Element an inventory of vacant
parcels having the potential for residential development, or “underutilized” parcels with
potential for additional development. The purpose of this inventory is to evaluate
whether there is sufficient capacity, based on the General Plan, zoning, development
standards, and infrastructure, to accommodate the city’s fair share of regional growth
needs as identified in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). Sites that are
included in the land inventory are not required to be developed at the density assumed
in these tables; rather, this analysis represents an estimate of the city’s realistic
development potential. Actual development will depend on the intentions of each
property owner, market conditions and other factors. In addition, sites indicated as
having potential for lower- or moderate-income housing are not required to provide
affordable housing. Such designations are only intended to indicate where there is
potential for affordable housing based on the allowable housing type, density and
market trends.
The detailed methodology and assumptions for the residential land inventory discussed in
Chapter III are provided below and summarized in Tables B-1 through B-5.
Affordability Assumptions
In general, there are three alternative ways for determining the affordability level of new
housing units.
        1.      Affordability Covenants. The most definitive method is through required
        affordability covenants (i.e., requirements imposed upon or agreed to by the
        project sponsor) that establish income limits for purchasers or tenants. Such
        covenants are legally enforceable and binding upon the property owner for a
        specified time period.
        2.      Market Prices or Rents. When covenants are not in place, affordability levels
        for newly-built units are based on actual prices or rents. Table II-13 describes
        current affordability levels along with the monthly rental costs or estimated sales
        prices that correspond with each level. Based on rental market data, most
        surveyed apartments fall into the Low income category since the average
        monthly rent for 2-bedroom apartments was found to be approximately $1,680. It
        is assumed that few, if any, new apartments rent for rates below the average of
        existing units unless required by affordability covenants.
        3.      Density. For potential new units in a city’s land inventory, state law
        establishes that affordability assumptions may be based on density. The “default”
        density for most metropolitan jurisdictions, including Culver City, is 30 units per
        acre. This means that if the General Plan and zoning allow development at 30
        units per acre or greater, these sites are considered to be suitable for lower-
                                               B-1                                   January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                     Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
        income housing. State law also allows jurisdictions to establish an alternative to the
        default density if local conditions and experience support a different density
        assumption for affordability.
        In Culver City, the maximum density in the Residential Medium Density (RMD) Zone
        is 29 units per acre, excluding density bonus. One multi-family development,
        Grandview Palms senior apartments, was built in the RMD zone during the (2006-
        2014) planning period. Although the “maximum” density is 29 units per acre, this
        project received a density bonus that resulted in an actual project density of 48.6
        units per acre. Of the 70 units in this development, 9 (13% of all units) were low-
        income units and 14 (20% of units) were moderate-income units guaranteed
        through covenants. Although this project demonstrated that lower-income units
        can be built in the RMD zone, it was an unusually large parcel (1.4 acres)
        compared to most properties in the RMD district. Since all of the underutilized RMD
        parcels (Table B-6) are less than ½ acre in size, it is expected that most
        redevelopment projects in these areas are likely to be condos with above-
        moderate prices.
        Since mixed-use residential units in commercial zones are permitted at densities of
        35 to 65 units/acre, all of these potential sites are assigned to the lower-income
        category.
Realistic Capacity
RMD Parcels. In the RMD Zone the allowable density of 29 units per acre is equivalent to
one unit per 1,500 square feet of lot area with a maximum of 9 units on any one lot or
parcel. Table B-6 lists RMD lots that are “underdeveloped” (i.e., having fewer units than
could be developed under current zoning regulations). These lots have a total potential
for 788 new units (even with the 9-unit cap). Actual development trends (see Table A-3b)
shows that the average yield for all market-rate multi-family projects built between 2000
and 2008 has been 91% of maximum capacity, which demonstrates that development
standards (e.g., height, setbacks, parking), have not significantly reduced actual
development below the allowable density. In practice, development of contiguous
multi-lot projects has been facilitated through the approval of reciprocal easements for
driveways and other common areas, which has encouraged sensitive site planning at or
near the upper end of the allowable density range. This analysis demonstrates that the 9-
unit per lot cap does not represent a significant constraint to multi-family development,
and serves the public interest by allowing the city to preserve the scale and context of
existing neighborhoods.
In order to determine the realistic estimated capacity of underutilized RMD parcels, the
following assumptions were made: first, only parcels having the capacity to at least
double the number of units on the site were included. For example, if a parcel with
zoning capacity for five units was already developed with three units, it was excluded
from the estimate. Second, the total for the remaining “high potential” parcels (i.e., those
with capacity for at least a doubling of units) was reduced by 9% based on the results of
the survey shown in Table A-3b, which showed an average of 91% of total capacity for
RMD development during the past eight years. This methodology resulted in a realistic
capacity of 660 units for underutilized RMD parcels.
                                              B-2                                   January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                    Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
Table A-3c provides a similar summary of units built from 2008 through 2014 which
indicates an average of 85% total capacity. Unlike the data in Table A-3b which has a
majority RMD zones sites, Table A-3c has a majority R-1 and R-2 zoned areas. Table A-3b is
a more realistic estimate of development in RMD zoned areas.
Mixed-Use. In addition to the RMD Zone, multi-family housing is permitted in several
commercial zones at a density of 35 units/acre up to 50 units/acre with community
benefits in non-TOD District areas, and in TOD areas up to 65 units/acre with community
benefits. Such multi-family developments would be part of a mixed-use project with
ground floor commercial uses. Stand-alone residential uses are not allowed in
commercial zones. Since the mixed-use standards allow development at greater than
the default density, all potential residential development in commercial zones is assumed
to be suitable for lower-income housing.
Mixed-use projects require commercial uses (minimum depth 30 feet) only on the ground
floor adjacent to arterial streets and at all corners adjacent to arterial streets. Overall,
commercial floor area must be at least 10% of a project’s total gross floor area or 30% of
the lot size, whichever is greater. These standards would allow a mixed-use project
comprised of 90% residential space.
Culver City’s mixed-use ordinance and development standards were approved in 2005
and amended in 2008. Between 2005 and 2008, five projects were approved in districts
where mixed-use is allowed, and four of those five were mixed residential/commercial
projects. Of those four projects, three were actually built and completed after 2008; from
2005 to the present four mixed use projects have been entitled and completed
producing 98 residential dwellings (see Table B-1and Figure B-1). This track record
illustrates that the mixed-use ordinance and market trends encourage and facilitate
high-density residential development in commercial zones. The average residential
density of all approved mixed-use projects is 51 units/acre. While not all potential mixed-
use sites are likely to be developed with residential uses during the current planning
period, the available capacity of sites represents more than 5 times the city’s remaining
lower-income need. City actions that will encourage and facilitate mixed-use
development during the current planning period include Measure 1.P (Affordable
Housing Development Assistance), 2.A (Density Bonus), 3.A (Financial Support and
Technical Assistance), 3.B (Financing Negotiations for Affordable Housing Development),
4.A (Regulatory Incentives), 4.B (Streamline Permit Approval Process) and 5.D (Database
of Housing Opportunities).
As noted above, new development is not required to be sold or rented at affordable
rates unless otherwise required by covenants. These tables indicate potential
development opportunities that are dependent on property owner intentions and
market conditions.
2.       Affordable Units Built or Approved 2008-2013
Table B-1 summarizes projects built during 2008 and 2013. These housing units cannot be
credited in the new planning period but they demonstrate on-going efforts by the city to
achieve affordable housing and RHNA goals. During this period a total of 14 very low, 9
                                               B-3                                 January 2014

City of Culver City Housing Element                               Appendix B – Residential Land Inventory
low, and 22 moderate income housing units were completed; they were all part of mixed
use projects. In addition, 71 new market-rate units were built.
Table B-2 summarizes projects that have been entitled. Three of the five projects are
mixed-use with ground floor commercial and dwellings units above. The other two are
stand-alone multi-family developments in RMD zones. A total of 159 market rate units are
approved as summarized in Table B-2. Although these projects range in density from 29
to 65 units/acre, they have been assigned to the above-moderate category since they
are all being built as for-sale condo projects without deed restrictions.
The locations of the projects listed in Tables B-1 and B-2 are shown in Figures B-1 and
Figure B-2.
3.       Redevelopment Agency Comprehensive Housing Strategy (CHS)
Concurrently with preparation of the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the Culver City
Redevelopment Agency updated its strategy for use of housing set-aside funds. The
Redevelopment Agency reviewed the CHS in its entirety and authorized implementation
of years 1 and 2 and instructed staff to return to the Redevelopment Agency with further
discussion of the other projects identified in the CHS. After the State terminated
Redevelopment, oversight and implementation of the CHS was transferred to the City of
Culver City City Council and the Culver City Housing Authority. Table B-3 summarizes the
city’s eight priority projects for this Planning Period. Two of these projects are located on
city-owned sites. Because the city is devoting staff (and financial resources that may
become available in the future to replace the State legislated elimination of
redevelopment set-aside funds) to these projects, affordable units have a much higher
likelihood of completion than with privately-initiated developments. Some of these sites
are vacant while others involve demolition and replacement.
One of the sites (Wade) is a substantial rehabilitation project 8. As part of the CHS, the
Redevelopment Agency earmarked $1.9 million from its Housing Set-Aside Fund to
rehabilitate 40 deteriorated units ($47,702 per unit) to address nuisance and blight on
Wade Street. These 40 units contained within four buildings (10 units per building) suffer
from the lack of professional management, years of deferred maintenance, and public
nuisances. The Housing Division also retained a Cost Estimator to estimate the total cost
of rehabilitating the units.
Although two of the RMD-zoned parcels listed in Table B-3 and Figure B-3 (Venice
Boulevard and Washington Place) are subject to the 9-unit cap on any one parcel,
larger projects may be developed with a Comprehensive Plan, Specific Plan, or Density
and Other Bonus Incentives (DOBI) entitlement process. These entitlement options
provide the city with the flexibility of approving projects of a larger size or with a greater
density than would normally be allowed (see Measure 2.H).
    Although state law (AB 438, Government Code Sec. 65583.1.c) allows a portion of a city’s RHNA
8
    allocation to be met through rehabilitation under limited circumstances, no RHNA credit has been
    claimed for this project.

4.      TOD Area
The Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Site with potential for mixed-use development is
shown in Table B-4 and Figure B-4. The site, comprised of several contiguous lots adjacent
to the Metro Expo Line Culver City station, is currently vacant land and is being used as a
temporary surface parking lot for Metro. It is zoned as a Planned Development (PD) with
a General Plan designation of General Corridor. General Corridor is a commercial
designation and permits mixed-use development. The General Plan designation and the
PD zoning which allows mixed use guides the land uses allowed in the TOD site. As
vacant land with these zoning and general plan designations, the TOD site could support
low- and moderate-income housing. It has potential for approximately 200 lower-income
units based on proposed densities ranging from 35 to 65 units per acre.
5.      Vacant or Underutilized Land
Sites with potential for mixed-use development (other than the TOD site) are shown in
Tables B-5 and B-7 and Figures B-5 and B-7. All of these sites currently contain vacant land
or vacant buildings and are currently zoned Commercial General (CG) or Industrial
General (IG). Except for two parcels, the General Plan designation is General Corridor
(GC) which is a commercial designation and permits mixed-use development.
Table B-5 and Figure B-5 summarize vacant parcels suitable for residential development.
All of these vacant sites, except for one site, are zoned Commercial and allow residential
development as part of a mixed-use project (with ground floor commercial/retail) and at
a maximum density of 35 units/acre. These parcels can accommodate a total of 85 new
multi-family dwelling units with ground floor commercial/retail. Since the allowable
density is greater than the default density of 30 units/acre, all of these sites are assigned
to the Lower-income category. A density of 35 units/acre is assumed for purposes of
estimating site capacity, which is consistent with other approved and proposed mixed-
use projects (see Tables B-2 and B-3). Two of the vacant sites, 11012 and 11014
Washington Boulevard, are very small; it is more realistic that these contiguous lots will be
consolidated as part of a small mixed-use project resulting in three dwelling units. Overall,
each of the sites listed in Table B-5 can potentially be consolidated with surrounding sites
in order to increase the feasibility of new affordable housing. The one industrial zoned
site would need zone and general plan amendments or a specific plan entitlement in
order to allow the potential 24 dwelling units. Several developers inquiring about this
vacant site have expressed a desire to construct housing.
Table B-6 and Figure B-6 summarize underdeveloped parcels zoned RMD (Residential
Medium Density). The majority of these properties are less than 8,000 square feet in size
and currently are developed with single-family homes or duplexes, although there are
some larger parcels with multi-unit apartment buildings. The total capacity for additional
development on these parcels is 788 units, which is derived from the development
standard of 1,500 square feet of land area per unit. This translates to 29 du/acre in the
RMD-zoned areas. However, as noted previously under the “Realistic Capacity”
discussion, a more conservative method was used to estimate the redevelopment
potential of these parcels. Only those parcels with potential for at least doubling the
number of units were counted, and the resulting total was then reduced by 9% based on
                                              B-5                                  January 2014

development trends during 2000 – 2008, resulting in an estimated realistic capacity of 660
units. Many such areas previously developed with single-family and 2-family dwellings
have been redeveloped within the last 14 years as 4- to 6-unit townhome style
condominiums. This overturning of land from single- and 2-family to multi-family units in
the RMD zoned areas appears to be a steady “land recycling” process. All of these RMD
sites have been allocated to the Above-Moderate income category.
Table B-7 and Figure B-7 summarize underutilized commercial sites considered to have
high redevelopment potential. All five of these sites contain boarded-up or vacant
buildings (not vacant land). At an allowed density of 35 units/acre, these sites have the
potential for 48 Lower-income units. One site is zoned industrial and would need zone
and general plan amendments or a specific plan entitlement in order to allow a
potential of 27 dwelling units. Within the last couple of years, developers inquiring about
this underutilized site have expressed a desire to construct housing.
In addition to the potential development opportunities described above, a substantial
number of other commercially-zoned sites allow mixed-use development. While these
parcels represent considerable opportunity for high-density mixed-use development, no
detailed estimate of realistic potential was prepared (and no RHNA credit has been
assumed) for these sites since adequate capacity has already been demonstrated to
accommodate the city’s RHNA allocation for this planning period.

  + These units are credited towards achieving the 4th Housing Element Cycle (2008-2013) and are not credited towards meeting the 5th cycle RHNA goals.
  * The previous Redevelopment Agency reviewed the CHS in its entirety and authorized implementation of years 1 and 2 of a 7-1/2 year program and instructed
  staff to return to the Redevelopment Agency with further discussion of the other projects identified in the CHS. After the State legislated elimination of
  redevelopment agencies, oversight and implementation of the CHS was transferred to the City of Culver City City Council and the Culver City Housing
  Authority.
This table demonstrates that there are significantly more potential sites for housing,
including lower-income housing, than needed to accommodate the city’s RHNA
allocation for this planning period.

                   Inventory of At-Risk Affordable Housing Units
1.       Introduction
This appendix identifies all residential projects in the city that are under an affordability
covenant, along with those housing projects that are at risk of losing their affordability
restrictions within the ten-year period 2008 – 2018. This information is used in establishing
quantified objectives for units that can be conserved during this planning period. The
inventory of assisted units includes all units that have been assisted under any federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state, or local program.
2.       Inventory of Assisted Units
Table C-1 provides an inventory of all government assisted rental and ownership
properties in the City of Culver City. Generally, the inventory consists of HUD 202 and 811,
Culver City Redevelopment Agency Housing Set-Aside Fund, and density bonus
properties. Target income affordability levels include very-low-, low- and moderate-
income groups. A total of 519 assisted housing units were identified in Culver City. Of this
number, 125 were secured through the use of the MAP for first-time home buyers.
3.       Units at Risk
Affordable units that are at-risk of conversion during 2008-2018 are listed in Table C-2. As
shown in the table, there are a total of 157 units that are at risk during this period: 23 very-
low-income units, 19 low-income units, 10 low/moderate-income units and 105
moderate-income units. The analysis of preservation options for these units is contained in
Chapter II, Housing Needs Assessment.

                              Public Participation Summary
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Culver City,
and this update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested
parties numerous opportunities to review draft documents and proposed policies, and to
provide recommendations for consideration by decision-makers. Public notices of all
Housing Element meetings and public hearings were published in the local newspaper in
advance of each meeting, as well as posting the notices on the city’s website. Notices
were also sent by direct mail to non-profit housing developers and housing advocates,
and for-profit developers. The draft Housing Element was made available for review at
City Hall, posted on the city’s website, as well as at the Culver City Julian Dixon Public
Library. The document was also made available to housing organizations, housing
advocates, and non-profit organizations representing the interests of lower-income
persons and special needs groups.
As part of the public review process, a Community Public Workshop convened by a joint
City Council/Planning Commission body on September 16, 2013, to which various housing
advocates, providers and developers were invited by public notice and two ads in the
Culver City News. The notice, staff report, and draft housing element were also e-mailed
to residents expressing an interest in all City Council and Planning Commission meetings.
The agenda, staff report and the draft housing element were posted on the city’s web
site prior to the meeting and remains on the city’s website. In addition, Planning
Commission and City Council Public Hearings were held. All of these public meetings
served as venues for review and discussion.

Community Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was prepared
and made available for public review prior to consideration by the Planning Commission
and adoption by the City Council.

Affordable Housing is housing that is reasonably priced when compared to a household’s
        income. The common standard of reasonableness is the allocation of 30% or less
        of a household’s gross income towards housing and utilities.
Assembly Bill 438 of 1998 (Government Code §65583.1.c) allows local governments to
        satisfy up to 25% of their requirement to provide adequate sites with existing
        housing units that are made available or preserved through the provision of
        “committed assistance” to lower-income households during the first two years of
        the planning period.
Assembly Bill 2634 of 2006 (Government Code §65583.a.1) requires the analysis of
        population and projected housing needs for all income levels to include
        extremely-low-income households (30% or less of countywide median income).
Assisted Units are low-income, multi-family rental housing units that are financed, in part,
        by governmental assistance from federal, state or local housing programs and
        funds such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD);
        Community Development Block Grant funds; state and local multi-family revenue
        bonds; Redevelopment Agency programs; local in-lieu fees; or direct local
        government funding. These programs serve to improve the affordability of housing
        and restrict the cost of the assisted units for a specified time period (15-55 years)
        through subsidy contracts or mortgages. These units can become eligible to
        change from restricted low-income housing through the termination of subsidy
        contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
Density Bonus refers to additional housing units above the Zoning Code maximum
        allowed density that the city may grant to a building developer in exchange for
        providing income-restricted units for senior citizens, very-low-income or low-
        income households.
Emergency shelter is a facility providing temporary shelter with minimal supportive
        services for homeless persons that are limited to occupancy of 180 days or less by
        a homeless person, persons, household, or family operated by a public or non-
        profit agency. These accommodations may include temporary lodging, meals,
        laundry facilities, bathing, counseling, and other basic support services.
Existing Housing Need identifies the number of lower-income Culver City residents who
        are paying more for housing costs than they can reasonably afford. Although
        excessive housing costs affect moderate income households, they most acutely
        impact low-income earners since allocation of a substantial proportion of a limited
        income leaves little money available for the purchase of other necessary goods
        and services. If a household is paying more than the 30% that state and federal
        agencies use as the maximum percentage of income that a household should
        devote to housing, government agencies consider it an indication that a need for

         affordable housing or financial assistance exists. Households paying in excess of
         30% of their incomes for housing are described as Overpaying.
Family One or more persons living together in a dwelling unit and functioning as a single
         housekeeping unit, with common access to, and common use of all living,
         kitchen, and eating areas within the dwelling unit. A “single housekeeping unit” is
         evidenced by an intentionally structured non-transient relationship between
         occupants of a dwelling unit who share household activities and responsibilities
         (e.g., meals, chores and expenses).
Future Housing Need indicates the anticipated number of new housing units that are
         needed in Culver City between January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2014 to:
       •      Accommodate the city’s fair share of the expected regional growth in new
              households of all income levels;
       •      Replace housing units lost to demolition or conversion; and,
       •      Achieve a vacancy rate that allows the housing market to operate efficiently.
         It should be noted that future housing need is determined through the Regional
         Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process for this 8-1/2 year period while the
         “Housing Element Planning Period” covers the 8-year period from October 2013
         through October 2021.
A Household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A household may
         consist of one person, unrelated individuals, a family, as defined by state law, or
         any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements.
         There are five Income Groups that the Housing Element examines in an effort to
         determine existing and future housing needs. These groups include Extremely-
         Low-, Very-Low-, Low-, Moderate-, and Above-Moderate-Income households,
         which are defined in reference to the median household income for the entire Los
         Angeles County area. Each year the California Department of Housing and
         Community Development (HCD) publishes Income Limits for each of the five
         categories, adjusted for household size. According to the HCD, the applicable
         income limits for 4-person households in Los Angeles County in 2013 are as follows 9:
                              Income           Percent Of Median   Annual Income Limits
                             Category          Household Income            (2013)
                       Extremely Low       Up to 30%              Up to $25,600
                       Very Low            Above 30% - 50%        $25,601 - $42,700
                       Low                 Above 50% - 80%        $42,701 - $68,300
                       Moderate            Above 80% - 120%       $68,301 - $77,750
                       Above Moderate      Above 120%             Above $77,750
   HCD publishes annual household income limits for each county in California. The published income limits
9
   for extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households are used to determine eligibility for assistance
   programs and are adjusted upward in high housing cost areas like Southern California. Therefore, the
   income limits published by HCD for Los Angeles County are higher than the calculated income categories
   that would result from the applicable percentages of AMI.

Mixed-Use is a form of development that contains a combination of residential and
        nonresidential uses within one building or an integrated group of buildings on one
        development site. The nonresidential uses are typically commercial/retail but
        exclude manufacturing uses.
Overcrowding refers to households living in housing units that lack sufficient space to
        meet the basic needs of daily living. Overcrowding is measured by some agencies
        as the ratio of persons to rooms in a housing unit (excluding bathrooms and
        kitchens). A ratio of persons to rooms exceeding 1.01 persons per room is
        considered by the U.S. Census Bureau to be overcrowded; the U.S. Department of
        Housing and Urban Development recommends an overcrowding standard of not
        more than two persons per living/sleeping area in a housing unit. California’s
        Uniform Housing Code defines overcrowding based on the size of rooms per
        person. The Code states that habitable rooms shall have an area of not less than
        70 square feet and an additional 50 square feet for each occupant beyond two.
Senate Bill 2 of 2007 (Government Code §65583.a) strengthened planning requirements
        for emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. With certain
        exceptions, it requires all jurisdictions to designate at least one zoning district
        where emergency shelters are permitted by-right. In addition, SB 2 requires that
        transitional and supportive housing be treated as a residential use that is subject
        only to the same requirements and procedures as other residential uses of the
        same type in the same zone.
Senate Bill 520 of 2001 (Government Code §65583.c.3) requires Housing Elements to
        analyze potential constraints to housing for persons with disabilities, and include
        programs to remove those constraints or provide reasonable accommodation for
        persons with disabilities.
Senate Bill 1087 of 2005 (Government Code §65589.7) requires cities to provide a copy of
        their Housing Elements to local water and sewer providers, and also requires that
        these agencies provide priority hookups for developments with lower-income
        housing.
Supportive housing means housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
        target population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the
        supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health
        status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
        community." (Health & Safety Code Section 50675.14) Supportive Housing shall be
        considered a residential use of the same type as other residential uses of the same
        type in the same zone.
Target Population means adults with low incomes having one or more disabilities,
        including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health
        conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the Lanterman
        Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 commencing with Section
        4500 of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may, among other populations,
        include families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster

        care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless
        people.
Tenure refers to whether possession of the dwelling unit is through ownership or rental.
Transitional housing and Transitional housing development means temporary housing for
        at least six (6) months for a homeless individual or family transitioning to
        permanent housing. Housing can take several forms including group housing or
        multi-family units, and may include supportive services to allow for necessary life
        skills in support of independent living. Transitional housing shall be considered a
        residential use of the same type as other residential uses of the same type in the
        same zone.
