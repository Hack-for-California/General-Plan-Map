City of South Pasadena
2014 - 2021 HOUSING ELEMENT
6.1 Introduction
6.1.1 Overview
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan Elements mandated by the State of
California. In addition to the Housing Element, the City of South Pasadena General Plan contains
a Land Use & Community Design Element, a Circulation & Accessibility Element, an Economic
Development & Revitalization Element, a Historic Preservation Element, an Open Space &
Resource Conservation Element, and a Safety & Noise Element. Each General Plan Element is
designed to be consistent with the remaining elements.
The California Government Code considers the availability of housing and the attainment of a
suitable living environment for every California family a priority of the highest order. The Housing
Element is the only General Plan Element subject to review and “certification” by the State that all
statutory requirements are have been met. State law is more specific about the content of local
housing elements than the remaining General Plan elements. The State agency responsible for
review and certification of housing elements is the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD). The Housing Element is required to identify and analyze existing and
projected housing needs and contain goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs
for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
The City of South Pasadena General Plan Housing Element provides a framework for meeting the
housing goals of the City and serves as an information document to the current and prospective
residents of the community, businesses, and developers. General Plan housing elements became
mandatory in 1969. The City of South Pasadena adopted its first Housing Element in 1984 and
subsequently adopted General Plan Housing Element Updates on March 7, 2001 for the planning
period covering March 2001 through March 2006 and on January 18, 2012 for the planning period
of June 2006 to June 2014. This General Plan Housing Element Update covers the planning
period from October 2014 to October 2021.
6.1.2 Purpose and Authority of the Housing Element
The General Plan Housing Element is required to include an assessment of housing needs of all
economic segments of the community and an implementation program formulated to meet those
needs. Local governments should consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors as well as
the community goals set forth in the General Plan in preparing a Housing Element and should
cooperate with other local governments and the State in addressing regional housing needs.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                             1
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

Housing Elements are required to address the local government’s “fair share of regional housing
need” as reflected in the Regional Housing Need Assessment (RHNA) as determined by the local
Council of Governments (COG). The COG for the Southern California region, including South
Pasadena, is the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). A local government’s
identified RHNA includes both the existing and projected housing needs of the locality. In order
to address their respective fair share of regional housing need, each local housing element must
include an assessment of available suitable housing sites based not only upon the existing zoning
and land use restrictions of the locality, but also on the potential for increased residential
development under alternative zoning and land use restrictions.
The following minimum components are required for the General Plan Housing Element.
Housing Needs Assessment
The housing needs assessment addresses the existing needs of a jurisdiction and includes an analysis of
the number of households overpaying for housing, households living in overcrowded conditions, or
households with special housing needs such as the elderly, developmentally disabled, large families, and
homeless. The number of housing units that need rehabilitation and the number assisted affordable
units at-risk of converting to market-rate must also be identified. The housing needs assessment also
must analyze a jurisdiction’s projected housing need, as established by the COG, identifying the
number of new units needed by income category to accommodate expected population growth over
the planning period of the housing element. This provides a benchmark for evaluating the adequacy
of local zoning and regulatory actions to ensure each local government is providing sufficient,
appropriately designated land and opportunities for housing development to address population
growth and job generation.
Site Inventory and Analysis:
A housing element must include a detailed land inventory and analysis of vacant properties suitable
for residential development, a general analysis of environmental constraints, the availability of
infrastructure, and an evaluation of the suitability, availability, and realistic development capacity of
sites to accommodate the jurisdiction’s RHNA by income level. To meet this statutory requirement,
local governments must either provide a detailed analysis demonstrating how adopted residential
densities accommodate the regional housing need for lower income households, or as an option and
alternative to preparing the analysis described above, Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B) allows
local governments to elect the option of utilizing “default” density standards that are “deemed
appropriate to accommodate housing for lower income households.” The default density option is not a
mandated density. The default density standard provides a streamlined option for local governments to
meet the density requirement. No analysis to establish the appropriateness of the default density is
required and HCD must accept that density as appropriate in its review. The minimum default
residential density established for South Pasadena by HCD to accommodate the RHNA for lower
income residential development is 30.0 dwelling units per acre.
If the housing element does not demonstrate adequate sites, appropriately zoned at the HCD
established default density to meet the jurisdiction’s RHNA by income level, the housing element
must include a program to provide the needed sites such as providing zoning that allows owner-
occupied and rental multifamily uses based on an analysis that includes, but is not limited to, factors

such as market demand, financial feasibility, or information based on development project
experience within a zone or zones that provide housing for lower income households.
Analysis of Constraints on Housing:
A housing element must include an assessment of both the governmental and non-governmental
constraints to development of housing such as land-use controls, fees and exactions, on-site and off-site
improvement requirements, building codes and their enforcement, permit and processing procedures,
and potential constraints on the development or improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
Housing Programs
Housing elements must identify programs designed to assist in the development of housing for low-
and moderate-income households, remove or mitigate governmental constraints, conserve and
improve the existing affordable housing stock, promote equal housing opportunity, and preserve any
units identified as at risk of conversion from affordable housing.
Quantified Objectives
A housing element must include estimates of the number of units, by income level, to be constructed,
rehabilitated, and conserved over the planning period of the housing element.
6.1.3 General Plan Housing Element Update Organization
The South Pasadena 2014-1021 General Plan Housing Element Update (Housing Element
Update)is comprised of the following components in addition to Section 6.1, Introduction.
  Section 6.2 Housing Needs Assessment
  This section is a discussion of the City’s population profile, including household size and
  composition, employment trends in the City, the City’s special needs groups such as the elderly,
  developmentally disabled, homeless and large families, the City’s housing profile, including age
  and condition of housing and housing affordability, and the City’s RHNA. The existing and
  projected housing needs in the City are evaluated in this section.
  Section 6.3 Housing Constraints
  This section is an analysis of the existing governmental, economic, physical, and environmental
  constraints affecting housing development in the City and, as applicable, in the region as a whole.
  Section 6.4 Housing Development Resources
  This section identifies the resources available for housing development, including a discussion of
  adopted land use policies and zoning regulations providing incentives for development of
  affordable housing, a complete site inventory of vacant sites suitable for housing development to
  meet the RHNA, and a discussion of the economic resources available for housing development
  at the federal, state, and local level.
  Section 6.5 Performance Review of 2006-2014 General Plan Housing Element Update
  Performance

2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  The goals and policies contained in the 2006-2014 General Plan Housing Element Update are
  discussed in this section along with a review the progress in achieving quantified objectives.
  Section 6.6 Housing Plan
  The goals, policies and programs that will guide the City’s actions for the planning period between
  July 2014 and October 2021 are presented in this section, along with the quantified objectives for
  the Housing Element Update planning period.
6.1.4 Authority and Scope of the Housing Element
Adopted policies and guidelines affecting the preparation and content of the Housing Element, in
addition to the State Housing Element guidelines, include the City’s General Plan Land Use
Element adopted in 1998. The General Plan Land Use Element identifies general housing goals,
policies, and programs to implement the community’s vision for the ultimate build out of the City
and establishes acceptable residential densities for development in the City. The Land Use Element
also contains plans for each neighborhood of the City, identifying existing and projected housing
units and population.
6.1.5 Public Participation
The City conducted an outreach program with key constituencies in the community including
seniors, affordable housing developers, and service providers to the homeless and developmentally
disabled in order to identify housing programs and policies that can be implemented during the
Housing Element Update Planning period. Lower income residents within the City of South
Pasadena are predominantly seniors who qualify as low-income due to fixed incomes rather than
due to employment in low paying jobs. To ensure the broadest community involvement,
particularly among low-income and special needs groups, the City conducted an outreach program
targeted to seniors, developers of low/moderate income housing, and service providers for special
needs groups in the City to obtain as many ideas and recommendations as possible from these
groups and/or the service providers to these groups. The City’s public participation effort included
the following:
              1. A public study session was held with the Planning Commission on June 24, 2013 to
                 provide a forum for the public and the Planning Commission to identify housing
                 needs and recommend goals and programs for the Draft Housing Element Update.
                 The public, developers and organizations providing community services within the
                 City were invited to attend the Planning Commission study session.
              2. The Draft Housing Element Update was posted on the City’s web page for public
                 review prior to the completion of the final Housing Element Update to obtain
                 public input.
              3. Advertising, in English and Spanish languages, was published on the City’s web
                 newsletter notifying the public that the Draft Housing Element Update was
                 available for public review and also providing the contact information for City staff
                 to enable members of the public to meet with City staff and provide input into the
                 Draft Housing Element Update.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               4

              4. Printed copies of the Draft Housing Element Update were made available at the
                  City’s Senior Citizens’ Center, Public Library, and City Hall for public review.
              5. Outreach efforts were extended to the City’s Senior Citizen Commission in order to
                  identify housing needs and to obtain input on the policies and programs to be
                  contained in the Draft Housing Element Update. A workshop was conducted on
                  June 13, 2013 to review the requirements for the Housing Element Update and to
                  solicit input on housing programs to be included in the Draft Housing Element
                  Update.
              6. Outreach efforts were extended to affordable housing developers.
              7. Outreach efforts were extended to governmental and non-profit agencies providing
                  services to the developmentally disabled residents in the City and homeless persons.
Outreach to the Community
A public study session was conducted with the City’s Planning Commission on June 24, 2013 as
part of the preparation of the Draft Housing Element Update. The agenda for this meeting is
included as Appendix A of the Draft Housing Element Update.
The public study session was open to all members of the public, organizations providing
community service in the City and affordable housing developers. The Housing Element Update
requirements and draft of the 2014-2021 Housing Element Update goals and objectives were
discussed with the Planning Commission, and input was solicited from the public and the Planning
Commission. Staff responded to questions from the Planning Commission and reviewed the HCD
deadlines and schedule for Housing Element Update adoption with the Planning Commission.
There were no additional comments or questions from the public.
Outreach to Senior Citizens
 The City of South Pasadena appoints a Senior Citizen Commission which meets once a month and
also publishes a monthly newsletter. The Senior Citizen Commission recommends to City Council
on matters affecting senior citizens and the special issues affecting this group such as affordable
and accessible housing, health care, and City sponsored senior recreational activities conducted
through the City’s Senior Citizens’ Center. A workshop was conducted at the regularly scheduled
meeting of the Senior Citizen Commission on June 13, 2013 in order to acquaint the Senior Citizen
Commission with the Draft Housing Element Update and to obtain input on housing needs and
programs to be considered in the Draft Housing Element Update.
The meeting was open to all senior citizen residents of the City. At the meeting, the City’s RHNA
and the programs available to assist in the provision of affordable housing were discussed. Ideas
presented to staff from the meeting participants included the following:
         1. The importance of continued participation by the City in the HUD Section 8 housing
              voucher program was emphasized. It was suggested that the City actively work with the
              County agency administering the Section 8 program to increase the number of vouchers
              issued in the City.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               5

         2. The City should continue to administer the existing home improvement programs to
              qualified low-income homeowners.
         3. More senior housing and assisted living housing should be developed in the City
              through the possible acquisition by a developer of some existing underperforming
              senior market rate apartments and the conversion of these units by the developer into
              affordable senior independent living and/or assisted apartments.
         4. Options for requiring universal accessibility for a percentage of units in new multi-
              family residential development should be explored.
The input received at the Senior Citizen Commission workshop guided staff in the development of
programs that were included in the Draft Housing Element Update designed to address the
suggestions above.
Outreach to service providers of special needs groups
 The San Gabriel Valley Consortium on Homelessness (Consortium) is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit
organization leading the effort to end homelessness in the San Gabriel Valley by facilitating
partnerships, coordinating educational programs with community and member agencies, and
advocating for appropriate housing and services by developing and supporting coordinated, region
wide strategies to address homelessness in the region. The Consortium was contacted for input
into potential programs for inclusion in the Housing Element Update to address the homeless
population in South Pasadena. Representatives of the Consortium were also invited to attend the
June 24, 2013 Planning Commission workshop. The City of South Pasadena Police Department
provided information on the number and locations of homeless individuals in the City, the special
needs of these individuals, and service programs available to the homeless in the City provided by
the City and through referrals to adjacent cities.
The Regional Center of the California Department of Developmental Services (Regional Center)
serving the City of South Pasadena was contacted to obtain input on the number of
developmentally disabled individuals in the City served by the Regional Center and the housing
needs of these individuals. Representatives provided information on the number of
developmentally disabled individuals in the City and the types of services provided by the Regional
Center.
Outreach to affordable housing providers
There are several properties in the City acquired by CalTrans as part of the 710 Freeway right of
way acquisitions that are required by State law to be made available for affordable housing. In the
past the City has partnered with a local affordable housing developer in efforts to acquire CalTrans
properties for redevelopment as affordable housing. Input received from this development entity
during the preparation of the City’s 2006-2014 General Plan Housing Element Update included a
recommendation that the City create a Housing Authority, empowered to acquire and develop
these CalTrans properties as affordable housing with the use of Redevelopment Agency set aside
funds designated for this purpose. On April 6, 2011, the City created a Housing Authority for this
purpose. The City has contacted the affordable housing developer as part of the community
outreach effort for the Draft 2014-2021 Housing Element Update to obtain input on potential
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                             6
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

programs to assist in the provision of affordable housing through partnership with the City’s
Housing Authority.
In conclusion, to increase the level of public participation in the preparation of the Draft Housing
Element Update beyond that provided as part of required public hearings, the City conducted an
outreach program with key constituencies in the community to identify housing programs and
policies that can be implemented during the Housing Element Update planning period.
6.1.6 California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that local jurisdictions evaluate the
environmental impacts of any General Plan Update. Pursuant to Section 15070 of the CEQA
Guidelines it was determined that the adoption of the City’s 2014-2021 General Plan Housing
Element Update would not have a significant effect on the environment, and a Negative
Declaration was prepared. The Housing Element Update is a policy document of the City’s General
Plan providing policies to accommodate the housing needs of South Pasadena residents and does
not constitute a project that would result in significant impacts on the environment, therefore a
Negative Declaration was prepared. The policies of the Housing Element Update do not alter any
existing patterns of land use or result in an increased intensity of land use above that provided for
in the General Plan. Potential impacts of the Housing Element cannot be traced to specific
projects or areas. Other General Plan elements that establish land use patterns and development
intensity within the City such as the Land Use Element, Open Space/Conservation Element, and
Circulation Element, were reviewed pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, and an EIR was certified for
these General Plan Elements at the time of their adoption. The Housing Element Update is linked
to the EIR previously completed for the General Plan.
6.1.7 Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The City of South Pasadena General Plan consists of seven elements: 1) Land Use & Community
Design; 2) Circulation & Accessibility; 3) Economic Development & Revitalization Element; 4)
Historic Preservation; 5) Open Space & Resource Conservation; 6) Housing; and 7) Safety &
Noise. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is consistent with
the policies and goals set forth by the entire General Plan. Consistency among General Plan
elements includes the incorporation of residential development capacities established in the Land
Use Element within the Housing Element and inclusion of a discussion of environmental
constraints as part of the Housing Element based on information from the Safety & Noise
Elements.
6.2 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              7
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

Assuring the availability of adequate housing for all social and economic sectors of the City’s
present and future population is an important goal for South Pasadena. To accomplish this goal, an
assessment of the housing needs of the community and the region must first be conducted. The
following section of the Housing Element Update describes and analyzes the current demographic,
socio-economic, and housing characteristics of South Pasadena in an effort to determine the nature
and extent of the City’s specific housing needs.
6.2.1 Community Profile
The characteristics of a city’s population are important factors affecting the housing market in the
community. Issues such as population growth, age, race, ethnicity, and employment all help
determine the city’s housing needs. Table VI-1 compares the population estimates of the City of
South Pasadena and Los Angeles County from 1970 to 2012. The 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010
figures are provided by the U.S. Census and the 2012 figures are an estimate provided by the
California Department of Finance. The City’s population increased between 1970 and 2012 by
11.7% with an average annual growth of 0.3%. The current 2012 population of the City is 25,664.
The City’s population has represented a small percentage of the County’s population at an average
of 3% since 1970.

6.2.2 Employment Trends
According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, 13,496 City residents were in the labor
force. The labor force includes employed and unemployed persons aged 16 years and over. This
represents a labor force participation rate of 48% of the City’s population. Table VI-3 describes
the City’s 2011 employment trends. More than half of the population of employed persons 16
years of age and older are engaged in managerial and professional specialty occupations. Technical,
sales, and administrative support occupations comprise the second largest occupational group.

South Pasadena is primarily a suburban residential community, and therefore, has a relatively small
employment base. It is not anticipated that employment growth within the City will be a major
stimulus to housing demand.
A general measure of the balance of a community’s employment opportunities with the needs of its
residents is through a “jobs-housing balance” test. A balanced community would have a match
between employment and housing opportunities allowing most of the residents to work in the
community. City data indicates that home based occupations more than doubled between 2000
and 2005, and the City projects that home occupations will increase from 424 in 2012 to 530 by
2021, a 25% increase. Because these households in the City also function as home based
employment, increases in numbers of jobs over the period of this housing element does not
necessarily require an increase in housing units to maintain a balanced jobs to housing ratio.
6.2.3 Household Characteristics
The characteristics of a community’s households provide important information about the housing
needs in the community. Income and affordability are best measured and examined at the
household level, as are the special needs of certain groups such as large-family households or
female-headed households.
Household Composition and Size
The U.S. Census defines a “household” as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons
sharing living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other
group situations are not considered households. Household characteristics are important indicators
of the type and size of housing needed in a city.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 61% percent of the 10,318 households in South Pasadena
consisted of two or more persons. Single-person households comprise 29% and two person
households represent 31% of all households representing the largest segments of households in
South Pasadena.

Household size is defined as the number of persons living in a housing unit. A visible change in
the average household size over time reflects a change in the household composition of a city. For
example, a city’s average household size will increase over time if there is a trend towards larger
families. In a community with a growing number of elderly households, the average household size
will usually decline.

Between 1999 and 2012, the average household size in South Pasadena decreased slightly from
2.473 to 2.44 persons per household. This decrease closely mirrors the decrease in the neighboring
City of San Marino but is less than the decreases experienced in the neighboring Cities of Pasadena
and Alhambra, as well as in Los Angeles County.

The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) defines
overcrowding as more than one person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and
porches. Overcrowding occurs primarily because households “double-up” to afford high rents and
because of a lack of available housing units of adequate size to accommodate families with larger
numbers of children. Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered highly
overcrowded and should be recognized as a significant housing problem. Table VI-6 describes the
number of persons per household (i.e. housing unit) in the City in 2011.

Of all occupied units in the City, the average number of persons per unit is 2.46. About 61% of all
occupied housing units in the City are inhabited by households consisting of only 1-2 persons.
Approximately 94% of all occupied units in the City are occupied by 4 or fewer persons.
Table VI-7 identifies the number of persons per room by owner and rental units. Approximately
96% of all occupied units have one or less person per room. Renter-occupied units have more
incidents of overcrowding (1.3% of total units) than owner-occupied units (less than 1% of total
units). A total 142 of units in the City are subject to overcrowding with 1.51 or more persons per
room, a 43% reduction since 2000. This represents two percent of the households in South
Pasadena. Given such low percentages, it is evident that overcrowding is not a significant housing
problem in the City.

Household Income and Income Distribution
Income is a major factor influencing the demand for housing, and to a large extent, reflects the
affordability of housing in a community. According data obtained from the 2009-2011 American
Community Survey (ACS) the median household income for the City of South Pasadena was
$84,914. which is higher than the median household income reported for Los Angeles County of
$52,266 for the same period. Table VI-8 illustrates the distribution of household income for South
Pasadena.

Approximately 68% of all households within the City have incomes at or above 120 % of the
County median income level.
HCD has developed the following income categories based on Median Family Income (MFI) as
described in Table VI-9. Household income categories are based on a four-person household:
         • Extremely low income: Household income of less than 30 percent of the county
              median income.
         • Very low income: Household income of 50 percent of the county median income.
         • Low income: Household income between 50 and 80 percent of the county median
              income.
         • Moderate income: Household income of 120 percent of median income limit.
The following table describes the income limits based on the above categories of income groups.

6.2.4 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
Existing housing need is evaluated based on overpayment for housing by lower income households
and the level to which vacancy rates in the jurisdiction need to be raised for the market to operate
freely. The methodology used to determine future need considers the anticipated growth in
number of households, the need to achieve ideal vacancy rates, and compensation for anticipated
demolition. The City must use the numbers allocated by SCAG under the RHNA when identifying

measures, policies and contemplated ordinances, which are consistent with meeting the RHNA
housing goals. The RHNA numbers are not meant to be a quota for development. City policies
should enable the market to provide affordable units, however the City is not obligated to construct
any of the units. Based on the SCAG 2012 RHNA, South Pasadena has a need for 63 new units to
be provided, distributed across the four income levels established by HCD. Table VI-11 identifies
South Pasadena’s housing need based on income group.

6.2.5 Housing Needs Assessment - Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income is defined as households with income less than 30 percent of the area
median income. The area median income in Los Angeles County is $52,266. For extremely low
income households, this results in an income of $25,300 or less for a four person household or
$12,650 for an individual. Extremely low income households have a variety of housing situations
and needs. For example, most families and individuals whose source of income is from public
assistance, such as social security insurance (SSI) or disability insurance are considered extremely
low income households, and a minimum wage worker could be considered an extremely low
income household with an annual income of approximately $12,650 or less. A single senior citizen
on a limited amount of fixed income, such as social security income, could also be considered
extremely low income. According to U.S. Census data provided to the City by HCD,
approximately 72 percent of extremely low income renter households in the City paid greater than
30% of their income for housing and approximately 91 percent of extremely low income
homeowner households paid more than 30% of their income for housing. The following are
examples of occupations with wages that could qualify as extremely low income for a household.

2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

For purposes of the Housing Element Update, it is assumed that fifty percent of the City’s RHNA
allocation of 17 very low income units represents the housing need for extremely low income
households. As a result, the City projects a need of 9 units for extremely low income households.
Some extremely low income households could include household members with mental, physical,
or developmental disabilities and special needs. To address the needs of extremely low income
households with mental, physical or developmental disabilities, the Housing Element Update
includes a program for providing for housing types for this special needs group. Based on the
RHNA, South Pasadena should provide sufficient capacity for a total of 63 new housing units over
the next Housing Element planning period from 2014 through 2021 to include 17 units for very
low (inclusive of 9 units for extremely low), 10 units for low, 11 units for moderate, and 25 units
for above moderate income households.
6.2.6 Special Needs Groups
This section reviews the characteristics of households with special housing needs, including
disabled persons, the elderly, large families, farm workers, female-headed households, the homeless,
and the developmentally disabled. Table VI-12 summarizes the numbers of households or persons
in each of these special needs groups in South Pasadena.

Disabled Households
This segment of the population, which includes individuals with mental, physical, and
developmental disabilities, needs affordable housing, conveniently-located to services and, where
necessary, has been specially adapted for disabled accessibility with wheelchair ramps, elevators,
wide doorways, and modified fixtures, cabinetry, and appliances. The majority of persons with
disabilities live on an income that is significantly lower than the non-disabled population. Many
disabled individuals live on a small fixed income, which severely limits their ability to pay for
housing. Persons with disabilities have the highest rate of unemployment relative to other groups.

For most, their only source of income is a small fixed pension afforded by Social Security Disability
Insurance (SDI), Social Security Insurance (SSI), or Social Security Old Age and Survivor's
Insurance (SSA), which, in many cases, does not adequately cover the cost of rent and living
expenses even when shared with a roommate. In addition, persons with disabilities oftentimes
experience discrimination in hiring and training. Employment can tend to be unstable and at the
lower wage brackets. A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activities. The 2009-2011 American Community Survey identified 1,385 disabled
persons aged 16 and over in the City of South Pasadena. Of these, 773 are disabled persons
between the ages of 16 and 64 and 612 are disabled persons aged 65 and over.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element Update address the housing needs
of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability”
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that originates before an individual attains age 18
years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability
for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term
also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or that require
treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include
other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature. Many developmentally disabled
persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More
severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The
most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention
and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the
first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s

According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of August 2011, about 116
residents with developmental disabilities were being assisted at the Regional Center.
Housing types appropriate for people living with a developmental disability include rent subsidized
homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes and group homes. Programs appropriate for
providing housing for developmentally disabled persons include Section 8 vouchers, inclusionary
housing, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of
housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of
group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in
serving this need group.
Consistent with State law, group homes, or Residential Care Facilities with six or fewer residents
per facility, are allowed by right in all residential zones of the City. Group homes, or Residential
Care Facilities, with seven or more persons are permitted in the RM and RH residential districts,
subject to approval of a conditional use permit. As part of the approval of conditional use permits
for Residential Care Facilities the City is able to provide an exception to the parking requirements
established in the Zoning Code for these types of projects.
Persons with Physical Disabilities
Housing opportunities for individuals with physical disabilities can be addressed through the
provision of affordable, barrier-free housing. Currently, housing units that are accessible to the
disabled are limited in supply. In addition to the development of new units for the disabled,
rehabilitation assistance can also be provided to disabled renters and homeowners to modify
existing units to improve accessibility. The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend
on the severity of the disability. Many persons live at home in an independent environment with
the help of other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require
assistance. This can be provided in the form of special housing design features for the physically
disabled, income support for those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for
persons with medical conditions. Accessible housing can also be provided through senior housing
developments.
Both federal and State housing laws require certain features of adaptive design for physical
accessibility in all multifamily residential buildings with four or more units built for first occupancy
starting March 13, 1991, however, numerous dwelling units built before that date are not subject to
these accessibility requirements. These laws do not apply in many cases to assist individuals,
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                19

particularly seniors, who choose to remain in their single family homes rather than move to assisted
living facilities and/or other newly constructed units.
Appropriate housing for persons with physical disabilities includes very low cost units in large
group home settings near retail services and public transit, supervised apartment settings with on-
or off-site support services, outpatient/day treatment programs, inpatient/day treatment programs,
single room occupancy units, crisis shelters, and transitional housing.
In 1984, Title 24 of the State Uniform Building Code mandated that all multiple-family residential
construction projects containing in excess of 5 units under construction after September 15, 1985,
conform to specific disabled adaptability/accessibility regulations. In 1988, the Federal government
enacted the U.S. Fair Housing Amendment Act (Act), with the intent of increasing the number of
rental units being built accessible to handicapped individuals. In July 1993, the State of California
issued “California Multifamily Access Requirements” based upon the Act.
The City ensures that new housing developments comply with California building standards, (Title
24 of the California Code of Regulations) and federal requirements for accessibility as part of its
building plan check and inspection process. The City does not require special building codes or
onerous project review to construct, improve, or convert housing for persons with disabilities. Both
the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an
affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning and other land-use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example,
it may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of properties that
have already been developed to accommodate residents with mobility impairments. To further
assist in making housing accessible for the disabled, in June 2013 the City implemented adopted
program objectives of the 2006-2013 Housing Element Update by amending the City’s Zoning
Code to add clear provisions for the granting of reasonable accommodation to promote access to
housing for disabled persons in accordance with State and Federal Fair Housing Laws as described
in Section 6.4.1, “Zoning Code Resources.”
The City of South Pasadena makes rehabilitation grant funds available through the Home
Improvement Program to income qualified homeowners to make repairs and improvements which
could include construction of accessibility improvements to the home, such as ramps and
guardrails, into single-family dwellings to allow first floor access for physically disabled residents.
There is a need for jurisdictions to fast track the permitting process for these projects, as well as to
allow for flexibility in the administration of zoning code standards for these projects. Examples of
flexibility in the administration of development standards include variations from the required
setbacks, floor area ratios, parking and other requirements. In order to facilitate the development of
affordable housing in the City, the City’s Zoning Code includes provisions for approval of a
reduction in development standards as required by the Zoning Code including but not limited to
reduced parking, variation from required setbacks, minimum parcel size or maximum parcel
coverage when affordable housing is proposed as part of a project through approval of a planned
development permit as further described in Section 6.4.1 Zoning Code Resources.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                  20

The physical modification of housing is not necessary to accommodate mentally disabled persons,
but they generally require special services and monetary support. Since jobs and higher earning
potential are often limited to such individuals, affordable housing is important to maintaining
quality of life. Group homes with a live-in resident assistant may be one solution to providing
affordable housing to the mentally disabled.
Consistent with State law, group homes with six or fewer residents per facility are allowed by right
in all residential zones of the City. Group homes, or Residential Care Facilities, with seven or more
persons, and Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (RCFE) are permitted in the RM and RH
residential districts, subject to approval of a conditional use permit. As part of the approval of
conditional use permits for Residential Care Facilities and RCFE the City is able to provide an
exception to the parking requirements established in the Zoning Code for these types of projects.
Elderly Households
Many elderly households have special needs because of their relatively low, fixed incomes, physical
disabilities, and dependency needs. Specifically, seniors, persons 65 years of age and older, have
four main quality of life concerns:
         1. Income: Seniors are usually retired and living on a limited income.
         2. Housing: Many seniors live alone in three and four bedroom houses.
         3. Health Care: Seniors are more likely than others to experience ill health and require
              hospital visits or stays.
         4. Transportation: Many seniors rely on public transportation. Also, seniors with disabilities
              require alternative transportation.
According to the 2009-2011 American Community Survey, the City of South Pasadena has 3,104
persons aged 65 and over. Table VI-13 illustrates that of the total number of elderly households
1,852 or 76% of the elderly households in the City own their own homes and 450 households or
24% of the City’s elderly households rent.

Elderly housing needs include affordable housing located close to commercial shopping areas,
medical facilities, and public transportation services. As seniors are less able to keep up with the
demands of home ownership and seek apartments or condominiums, the housing units they vacate
may represent a large housing stock that could become available to other buyers.
South Pasadena offers a number of apartment complexes and assisted living facilities for senior
residents for its relatively small population. Senior living facilities include the Golden Oaks
Apartments with 65 independent living units, Meridian Manor with 6 beds for assisted living, and
Prospect Manor with 99 beds for assisted living.
South Pasadena has a Senior Citizens’ Center that serves as a meeting place and service center for
seniors in the community. The wide range of services offered at the Senior Citizens’ Center include
daily lunches, interest classes, recreational activities, and health services, such as health assessments,
and blood pressure measurement. The Senior Citizens’ Center also operates a Dial-A-Ride
Program, providing South Pasadena senior citizens transportation anywhere within the City limits,
to nearby medical offices, and to Huntington Memorial Hospital.
Group homes with a live-in resident assistant may be one solution to providing affordable housing
to the elderly. Consistent with State law, group homes with six or fewer residents per facility are
allowed by right in all residential zones of the City. Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly
(RCFE) are permitted in the RM and RH residential districts, subject to approval of a conditional
use permit. As part of the approval of conditional use permits for RCFE facilities, the City is able
to provide an exception to the parking requirements established in the Zoning Code for projects
accommodating senior citizens.
Farm workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural labor. They have special housing needs because of their relatively low income
and the unstable seasonal nature of their job.
As indicated in Table VI-12, the 2009-2011 American Community Survey identifies 49 individuals
in South Pasadena employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing occupations, which accounted for
less than one percent of the City’s employed residents. Given that there are so few persons
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                 22
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

employed in agricultural-related industries, the City can address their housing needs through its
overall programs for housing affordability, and there is no need to create and administer a special
program targeting farm workers.
Female Head of Households
Single parent, and particularly female-headed households, may experience a variety of housing
needs. Such households have a greater need for housing with convenient access to childcare
facilities, public transportation, and other public facilities and services. Because the earning power
of women is generally less than that of men, single mothers with lower incomes often experience
difficulties in finding affordable housing to meet their families’ needs.
Table VI-14 provides a detailed breakdown of the City of South Pasadena’s household composition
in 2010. Female-headed households with children represent 694 or seven percent of all
households. Male-headed households with children represent 230 or 2.2% of all households. It
can be assumed that these single parent households generally spend a greater proportion of their
household income for housing than do two parent households and could represent a special needs
group in the City. Housing opportunities for lower income female-headed households with children
can primarily be addressed through rental assistance and the provision of affordable rental units.

The City’s Police Department implements an informal referral services program with Union Station
Homeless Services, a homeless shelter and service provider located in the City of Pasadena, by
providing transportation to the shelter for any homeless individuals in need and referrals of
homeless individuals to the Union Station service programs. Additionally, the City’s Police
Department conducts regular monitoring of the homeless individuals in the City and maintains a
profile of each homeless individual by name, location, and need.

6.2.7 Housing Profile
A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, or single room, occupied as separate living
quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters
refer to those units in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other person in the
building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall.
A community’s housing stock is the compilation of all its housing units.
Number of Housing Units
 As described in Table VI-15, there were 10,972 housing units in the City per the 2007-2011
American Community Survey. Of this total amount, 48.9% were renter-occupied, 45.1% were
owner occupied, and 6% were vacant.

Housing Growth
According to data obtained from the California Department of Finance, the City’s housing stock
increased from 10,349 to 11,123 between 1980 and 2012. Between 2000 and 2012 a total of 263
new residential dwelling units were constructed representing a 2.4% growth increment over the
twelve year period. This slow growth can be attributed both to the economic recession, which
began in late 2007 and the fact that the City is nearly built-out, offering little available land for
residential development.

Housing Type and Tenure
Table VI-17 identifies the status of vacant housing units in the City. According to the 2007-2011
American Community Survey, the City of South Pasadena had a total of 654 vacant units. Of these
vacant units 22.6% are for rent and 40.1% are classified as “other” vacant units. Table VI-18
describes occupancy status of units according to the number of units in the structure and by either
owner occupancy or renter occupancy. Approximately 50.4% of all housing units are single-family
homes of which approximately, 88% are owner-occupied.

The overall vacancy rate in the City was 6% in 2012, indicating that only a very small proportion of
the housing stock was unoccupied. The State Department of Finance estimated the 2007 vacancy
rate to be 3% equal to the 2000 Census rate.
Age and Condition of Housing Stock
Age is one indication of the quality of the housing stock. As illustrated in Table VI-19,
approximately 37% of all housing the City’s housing units were built in 1939 or earlier, illustrating
the historic nature of the City’s housing stock. In South Pasadena, 94% of the housing stock is
over 30 years old, and will likely have rehabilitation needs. The year 1952 is the median year all
housing structures were built.

While the majority of South Pasadena’s housing stock is well maintained and in good condition,
there are instances of residential properties with signs of deterioration and deferred maintenance.
For example, the most common signs include dilapidated garages, overgrown and neglected
landscaping, deteriorated painting and roofing. The Code Enforcement Division monitors
residential properties exhibiting characteristics of blight and notifies property owners to bring the
property into compliance with City codes.
Recognizing the need for rehabilitation assistance in South Pasadena, the City currently administers
a Home Improvement Program for low and moderate-income households. This program allocates
funds for rehabilitation of owner-occupied homes of eligible residents. On behalf of the City, the
County also provides residential rehabilitation loans to low and moderate-income homeowners in
South Pasadena who are in need of assistance to rehabilitate or repair their homes.
Home Prices
Income is a major factor influencing the demand for housing and to a large extent, reflects the
affordability of housing in a community. When looking at housing value, the 2010 Census is useful
because it provides a breakdown of residential price range, as well as types of units within each
price range. However, more up-to-date data is available through local real estate offices. Table
VI-20 below describes the median home prices for homes in the City. This table indicates that the
majority of home prices in the City exceed the January to March 2013 Los Angeles County average
median sales price of $381,000 with a median home sales price in South Pasadena between March
of 2012 and March of 2013 of $538,500 for a two bedroom home and $790,000 for a three
bedroom home. Comparing the City’s median with the County’s median illustrates that the
housing price gap has widened between the County and City and that the price of homes in South
Pasadena remains greater than the County median and beyond affordability for most families.
According to the data collected from local real estate agents, and described in Table VI-20 below,
the median value of most for sale housing units in South Pasadena is higher than the 2013 County
median home price of $381,000.

Housing Costs and Affordability
An important component of a Housing Element is an assessment of the affordability of housing.
Affordability measures the burden of monthly housing expenditures in relation to the residents’
incomes. The costs of home ownership or renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay
for housing, based on the 2010 HUD annual median income for a two income family of $58,245
for the Los Angeles/Long Beach MSA. Overpayment refers to the payment of more than 30% of a
household’s gross income for shelter. A high cost of housing eventually causes fixed-income
elderly, and lower income households to use a disproportionate percentage of their income for
housing. This may cause a series of related financial problems resulting in deterioration of housing
stock, because maintenance is sacrificed for more immediate expenses such as food, clothing,
medical care, and utilities.
By definition, housing is “affordable” if the monthly payment is not more than 30% of a
household’s gross income. In the case of rent, the 30% does not include allowance for utilities,
which may impose additional costs to the renter of $50 to $100 per month, depending on which
utilities the renter is responsible for paying. These costs may result in an otherwise affordable
rental becoming unaffordable due to overpayment. In the case of purchase, the 30% includes
payment on principal and interest, and an assumed 1.5% allocation for taxes and homeowner
insurance. In actuality, taxes and insurance may exceed the assumed allocation. A 20% down
payment and an approximate 3.5% interest rate are assumed, reflecting the most current market
conditions.

According to the 2009-2011 American Community Survey, 44.2% of all renter households in South
Pasadena are paying more than 30% of their incomes for housing. Of these, 28.2% of renters
earning 80% or less of the County median income are paying more than 30% of their incomes for
housing costs.
Comparatively, 36.3% of owner households are paying more than 30% of their incomes for
housing and 11.3% of owners earning 80% or less of the County median income are paying more
than 30% of their incomes for housing costs. Given the relatively high incidence of overpayment
among owner households, it is apparent that many households may have overextended themselves
financially to afford the opportunity to purchase a home in South Pasadena. Tables VI-22 and VI-
23 describe the estimates of housing costs as a percentage of household income for renter-occupied
and owner-occupied housing units.

Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
The Housing Element must identify, analyze and propose programs to preserve housing units that
are currently restricted for low-income housing and that could become unrestricted and possibly
lost as low-income housing. Rental assistance is provided to qualified tenants in the form of
Section 8 rental subsidies administered by the Community Development Commission of Los
Angeles County. In South Pasadena, there are no federally assisted housing units currently
restricted to low-income housing use, and therefore there are no federally assisted units at risk of
conversion from affordable rental units to market rate rental units.
6.2.8 Summary of Housing Needs
This section of the Housing Element summarizes the major housing need categories by income
groups as defined by State and Federal law. It includes the City’s share of regional housing need as
defined by the Southern California Association of Governments’ (SCAG) Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA). The City recognizes the special status of lower income households, which in
many cases are comprised of elderly or disabled persons, single-parent households, or large
households. Table VI-24 summarizes the areas of greatest housing assistance need in the City.

  Households Overpaying for Housing – Approximately 20% of all households in South
  Pasadena spend 30 percent or more of their income on housing. Of these overpaying households,
  28% were owners. Renter-households have the highest incidence of overpayment, with 44%
  spending more than 30 percent of their household income for housing. Of these, 28.2% of renters
  earning 80% or less of the County median income are paying more than 30% of their incomes for
  housing costs.
  Special Needs Households – Certain segments of the population may have a more difficult time
  finding decent, affordable housing due to their special needs or circumstances. In South Pasadena,
  the Needs Assessment documents the following groups with special housing needs:
           • 3,104 households (31%) headed by elderly persons, 8% percent of which were elderly
                persons living alone;
           • 1,385 persons (5.4%) aged 16 and over with physical disabilities;
           • 694 female-headed households (6.9%) with children.
           • Approximately 15 homeless persons or transients in the City, constituting less than 1%
                of the City’s population.
Age and Condition of Housing Stock – Approximately 94% of the City’s housing units are 30
years of age or older, when most housing units typically begin to require major repairs. In general,
most of the City’s housing stock does not show signs of deferred maintenance. However, some
instances of deteriorated housing can be found in the City, including older apartment buildings and
single-family homes where owners are financially unable to keep up with repairs.
Housing Costs and Affordability – Recent sales data indicate that the median sales price of a two
bedroom single-family detached home in the City is approximately $538,500 and a three bedroom
single-family detached home is approximately $790,000. Average rent in the City among apartment
and single family homes is about $2,400 per month.

Overcrowded Households – Household overcrowding in South Pasadena is relatively nominal,
with only 1.3% of the City’s households having greater than 1.5 persons per room. This low
incidence of overcrowding is indicative of the fact that the vast majority of the housing stock has
three or more rooms and overall higher median incomes in the City.
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) – Regional growth needs are defined as the
number of units that would have to be added in each jurisdiction to accommodate the forecasted
growth in the number of households by different income categories during the Housing Element
Update planning period, as well as the number of units that would have to be compensated for due
to anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate. The RHNA for South
Pasadena for the period 2014 to 2021 is 63 additional dwelling units. This total growth need is
allocated to four income categories: very low-income, low-income, moderate-income, and upper-
income. Table VI-25 shows the housing growth need based on income categories.

  6.3       HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
  Market conditions, as well as governmental programs and regulations, affect the provision of
  adequate and affordable housing. Housing Element law requires an assessment of potential and
  actual governmental and non-governmental constraints affecting the development of new housing
  and the maintenance of existing units for all income levels. Potential market, governmental, and
  environmental constraints that contribute to housing development costs in South Pasadena are
  addressed below.
   6.3.1 Market Constraints
  Construction Costs
  The cost of construction depends primarily on the cost of materials and labor, but it is also
  influenced by market demand and market-based changes in the cost of materials. The cost of
  construction depends on the type of unit being built and on the quality of the product being
  produced. Labor saving materials and construction techniques are available but they tend to reduce
  the quality of the finished product.
  CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                          33
  2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
  January 15, 2014

The type of product largely determines the cost of construction. The cost of labor is based on a
number of factors, including housing demand, the number of contractors in an area and the
unionization of workers, but it is generally two to three times the cost of materials. Thus the cost
of labor represents an estimated 17% to 20% of the cost of building a unit, which is a substantial
portion of the overall cost of construction. Most residential construction in Southern California is
performed with non-union contractors, and as a result, labor costs are responsive to changes in the
residential market. Recent figures published by the International Code Council (ICC) report that a
typical wood frame residence costs approximately $88.46 per square foot for labor and materials,
not inclusive of land. It is likely that construction costs in the City of South Pasadena would
exceed this figure based on the high quality of design standards required by the community. The
construction cost of housing affects the affordability of new housing and can be considered a
constraint to affordable housing in the City that is outside of the City’s control.
A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials, above the minimum acceptability for
health, safety, and performance, could result in lower sales prices. Another factor related to
construction costs is the number of units built at one time as part of a single project. As the
number of units constructed increases, an economy of scale is usually achieved reducing overall
costs. This type of cost reduction is of particular benefit when density bonuses are used for the
provision of affordable housing.
Costs associated with infrastructure improvements to serve development can affect the cost of
housing. In the City of South Pasadena, existing City services including water, sewer and storm
drain facilities are available to serve the level of development projected in the current General Plan.
The City has not required any major upgrades to City infrastructure or the installation of any new
major off-site infrastructure improvements as part development projects to date. New residential
development projects are required to provide new on-site water and sewer lateral connections to
existing City mains and to construct new storm drain improvements, including NPDES required
components, as part of new development. These required on-site infrastructure improvements are
considered typical construction related items and do not impose a typical constraint on the
development of new residential projects in the City.
An additional cost to construction in South Pasadena is related to grading. Many new single-family
detached home sites are located in hillside areas incurring substantial development costs associated
with the need to step the pad and provide for retaining walls. The development of multifamily
housing in hillside areas is cost prohibitive due to the need to provide for multi-stepped pads.
Land Costs
The price of raw land is a key component of the total cost of housing. The diminishing supply of
land available for residential construction combined with a fairly steady demand for housing
development has served to keep the cost of land relatively high in Southern California and in the
City. Vacant land costs can range from $40.00 to $100.00 per square foot in the City depending on
location and development capacity of the land. High land costs, particularly for single family
detached lots and single family attached residential development sites, have resulted in builders
developing predominantly ownership detached and attached housing at higher price points, rather
than rental housing, in order to preserve profits.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               34

Mortgage Financing
National policies and economic conditions determine interest rates, and there is little that local
governments can do to affect these rates. First time homebuyers are the group impacted the most
by financing requirements. Mortgage interest rates for new home purchases ranged generally
between the low 3% range for a fixed rate 30-year loan during 2011 to early 2013. During the
2014-2021 Housing Element Planning period, home mortgage interest rates are anticipated to
increase and are currently in the low 4% range.
Although interest rates themselves are still at an all time low, recent changes in lending practices
have created a constraint to housing. Financing for both construction and long term mortgages
since summer of 2007 have become more difficult to obtain due the higher standards required by
the federal government of lenders to qualify borrowers. Another more critical impediment to
homeownership involves the affordability of the housing stock, the ability of potential buyers to
fulfill down payment requirements, and the ability of buyers to receive a favorable credit rating. A
conventional home loan typically requires 20% of the sale price as a down payment, which is the
largest constraint to first time homebuyers. This indicates a need for flexible loan programs and a
method to bridge the gap between the down payment required and a potential homeowner's
available funds. The availability of financing for developers under current economic conditions
also poses a constraint on development which is outside of the City's control.
Historically jurisdictions could offer interest rate write-downs to extend home purchasing
opportunities to a broader economic segment of the population through the use of state and
federal financing programs when available. In the future, government-insured loan programs may
be available to reduce mortgage down payment requirements.
6.3.2 Governmental Constraints
Housing affordability is affected by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions by the
City and State can have an impact on the price and availability of housing. Land use controls, site
improvement requirements, State building codes, fees and other local programs intended to
improve the overall quality of housing may serve as constraints to the development of affordable
housing.
General Plan
The Land Use Element of the South Pasadena General Plan sets forth the City’s policies for
guiding local development. These policies, together with Zoning Code regulations, establish the
amount and distribution of land to be allocated for different uses within the City. South Pasadena’s
General Plan provides for a range of different intensities of residential land use, which are
described on Table VI-26.

Housing supply and cost are significantly affected by the amount of land designated for residential
use and the density at which development is permitted. In South Pasadena, nearly 62% percent of
the acreage within the boundaries of the City limits is designated for residential use. The City’s
2010 General Plan provides for a maximum of 11,652 dwelling units at build-out.

The strict application of some of the City’s Zoning Code regulations such as maximum height
regulations, lot coverage and/or floor area ratio restrictions, and parking standards could potentially
present difficulties for the development of affordable multifamily housing. Flexibility in the
application of zoning regulations is provided for in the City’s Zoning Code through approval of a
planned development permit for projects that include affordable housing. The planned
development permit process is a program currently in effect through the adopted Zoning Code.
The Housing Element describes the planned development permit in Section 6.4.1, “Zoning Code
Resources.”
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                                              38
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

Mixed use residential and commercial development projects which include development of
affordable housing proposed in the CG zoning district are likely candidates for application of the
planned development permit process. The planned development permit process allows the
approving body to modify any development standard such as the number of required parking
spaces and maximum floor area ratio in order to provide a quality design and facilitate the
development of affordable housing. With the ability to modify the parking requirements for an
affordable housing project through approval of a planned development permit, the City’s parking
standards would not impede residential development. Mixed use projects proposed in the CG
zoning district which include affordable housing would not be constrained by the strict application
of the Zoning Code requirements, such as parking.
Mixed use projects require approval by the Planning Commission of a conditional use permit.
Current zoning requires approval of a planned development permit for mixed use projects
proposing to modify zoning standards in order to make feasible the development of affordable
housing as part of the project. As further discussed in Section 6.4, “ Housing Development
Resources,” the Housing Element includes a program objective for the City to amend the Zoning
Code to eliminate the requirement for approval of a conditional use permit for mixed use projects
which include a request for approval of a planned development permit in order to facilitate the
development of affordable housing.
The City’s Zoning Code includes provisions for hillside protection applicable to lots with an
average slope of 20 percent or greater. The City views its hillsides as a valuable resource to the
community, and therefore, the hillside protection provisions of the Zoning Code are intended to
ensure orderly development of lots located upon the city’s hillsides through the application of strict
development standards. Issuance of building or grading permits for the construction of any
structure on any hillside lot requires prior approval of the project by the Design Review Board and
approval by the Planning Commission of a hillside development permit for the project. The City
does, however, provide for regulatory concessions to development standards for the provision of
affordable housing through Division 36.370 “Affordable Housing Incentives,” of the City’s Zoning
Code.
Building Codes and Enforcement
In addition to land use controls, State building codes also affect the cost of housing. The City has
adopted and enforces the Uniform Building Code (UBC). A Home Improvement Program is
offered to assist low-income homeowners with property maintenance and repairs. This program is
funded with Community Development Block Grant funds. Example projects include roof repairs,
window replacements, and exterior painting.
Development and Planning Fees
The City collects various fees from applicants to cover the costs of processing permits and
providing necessary services and infrastructure. Table VI-28 describes South Pasadena’s 2010
planning fee schedule.

South Pasadena’s development fee schedule is tied to the cost of providing necessary services. City
fees may be waived as part of the incentive package for developers of affordable housing.
The City of South Pasadena has an aging infrastructure of streets, sewers, storm drains, and water
lines. In order to ensure that new developments do not exacerbate the condition of these facilities
new development is required to install all on-site infrastructure, and developers are required to pay
a development impact fee for City maintenance and improvement of these facilities.
Development of the hillside area is costly due to the cost of grading, the public services that must
be provided to these areas, and in some cases, existing substandard conditions of existing
infrastructure available to serve the site. Some of these higher costs are attributable to provision of
water for both consumption and fire prevention and compliance with strict construction standards.
In addition, public and private access to hillside sites is expensive to construct and maintain.

Local Review and Permit Procedures
The Zoning Code stipulates the residential types permitted, permitted with an administrative use
permit, conditionally permitted, or prohibited in each residential zone. Permitted uses are those
uses allowed without discretionary review such as a conditional use permit. Approval of a design
review is required of all new structures with the exception of residential second units, emergency
shelters and single room occupancy housing for the homeless pursuant to Zoning Code
Amendments adopted by the City in May and August 2013. The City’s Director of Planning and
Building has the authority to approve an Administrative Use Permit for development of new
structures otherwise permitted, which allows some flexibility on the part of the City to ensure basic
health and safety, and general welfare concerns are met. Where the Zoning Code requires a
conditional use permit (CUP) for a use, the Planning Commission is the approving body unless
appealed. Projects appealed to the City Council receive priority scheduling. Typical findings of a
CUP include findings that the project is consistent with the General Plan, the use is compatible
with surrounding uses, the use addresses basic public health and safety, and that general welfare
concerns are addressed. Table VI-29 describes the allowable uses in each residential zone.
On May 15, 2013 the City amended its Zoning Code to eliminate the requirement for approval of a
conditional use permit for residential second units implementing respective adopted program
objectives of the 2006-2013 Housing Element Update, consistent with State law. Another program
objective to amend the Zoning Code to eliminate the requirement for approval of a CUP for multi-
family residential projects in the RM and RH zoning districts was adopted by the City in September
2013. Approval of these Zoning Code Amendments has eliminated a governmental constraint to
the development of residential second units and multi-family residential projects. Additionally, in
August 2013 the City amended its Zoning Code to implement a 2006-2013 Housing Element
Update program objective to add transitional and supportive housing as permitted uses in all
residential zones consistent with State law, as discussed in Section 6.4.1., “Zoning Code
Resources.”

Permit Processing
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and governmental approvals
contributes to the high cost of housing. Additional time may be necessary for environmental
review (CEQA), depending on the location and nature of a project. In response to State law, many
California cities have been working to improve the efficiency of permit and review processes by
providing “one-stop processing,” thereby reducing or eliminating duplication of effort.
In 2007, the City implemented an adopted program objective of the 2006-20013 Housing Element
Update and adopted streamlined processing and permit procedures to reduce the number of review
bodies involved in the development process. The City has three regulatory bodies with authority
to review housing projects depending on the type and nature of a project. These bodies, include
the Design Review Board, Cultural Heritage Commission, and Planning Commission.
The streamlined processing and permit procedures adopted by the City in 2007 establish a project
review and approval process for most projects which includes one Design Review and final
approval of a project to be conducted by a single review entity, either the Design Review Board or
the Planning Commission depending on the nature of the project.                Some projects deemed
historically or culturally significant, require design review by the Cultural Heritage Commission for
conformance of the project with the requirements of the City’s Cultural Preservation Ordinance.
In these instances, the Cultural Heritage Commission serves as a design review body
recommending to the Planning Commission which has final approval authority for the project.
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly
related to the size and complexity of the proposal and the number of actions or approvals needed
to complete the process. Table VI-30 identifies the typical processing time most common in the
entitlement process. It should be noted that each project does not necessarily have to complete
each step in the process (i.e., small scale projects consistent with General Plan and zoning
designations do not generally require an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), General Plan
Amendment, Rezone, or Variance). Also, certain review and approval procedures may run
concurrently. For example, a ministerial review for a single-family home would be processed
concurrently with the design review. The majority of projects requiring an EIR include a General
Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and/or conditional use permit request which are processed
simultaneously. The City also requires the joint processing of related applications for a single
project. As an example, a conditional use permit or planned development permit application is
reviewed in conjunction with the required site plan, a tentative tract map, and any necessary
variances. Such procedures save time, money, and effort for both the public and private sector and
serve to decrease the costs for the developer.

        * Depending on entitlement and significance of impact
  The City works closely with developers to expedite approval procedures to reduce the likelihood
  of unnecessary timing constraints on development. For a typical project, an initial pre-consultation
  meeting with the Planning and Building Department is arranged to discuss the development
  proposal. The application submitted by the developer which should contain a site plan, floor
  plans, elevations, landscape plan and, in some cases a subdivision map, is first reviewed by the
  Planning Department and other agencies such as Public Works for consistency with City
  ordinances and the General Plan. Depending on the complexity of the project and required
  entitlements, a single-family project is generally approved within 4 to 6 weeks from date of plan
  submission provided no variances, exceptions, or zone changes are needed. After the project is
  approved, the Building Department performs plan checks and issues building permits. With the
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              44

  exception of residential second units, emergency shelters, and single room occupancy housing, all
  applications for new construction are subject to design review by eitherthe Design Review Board,
  Cultural Heritage Commission, or Planning Commission depending on the nature of the project.
  With the exception of historic properties, the design review entity is also the final approval
  authority for the project. Larger mixed use projects requiring a conditional use permit or applying
  for a planned development permit are sent to the Planning Commission for design review and
  approval. Throughout construction, the Building Department will perform building checks to
  monitor the progress of the project. This process does not seem to put an undue time constraint
  on most developments because of the close working relationship between City staff, developers,
  and the decision-making body.
 Multifamily ResidentialProject Review Procedures
 In order to implement an adopted program objective of the 2006-2013 Housing Element Update
 the City Council adopted a Zoning Code Amendment in September 2013 to eliminate the
 requirement for approval of a conditional use permit (CUP) for development of multifamily
 residential projects in the RM and RH zoning districts, requiring that these projects be subject only
 to Design Review. Pursuant to the State Permit Streamlining Act, the City’s timeframe for project
 processing is dependent upon the CEQA determination for the proposed project and can range
 from 120 days, for a project deemed to be exempt, up to 12 months for a project requiring
 preparation of an Environmental Impact Report. With the approval by the City of the Zoning
 Code Amendment to eliminate the requirement for a CUP for multi-family residential projects the
 permitting process for a new multifamily residential housing project, if determined to be exempt
 pursuant to CEQA, could be approved within approximately three to four months.
 Permits to Encourage Development of Affordable Residential Projects
 The Zoning Code provides for flexibility in the application of Zoning Code standards through the
 planned development permit process for multi-family projects that include a certain percentage of
 the project as affordable housing. The purpose of the planned development permit is to allow
 consideration of innovation in site planning and other aspects of project design and more effective
 design responses to site features, uses on adjoining properties, and environmental impacts than the
 Zoning Code standards would produce without adjustment. Planned development permit
 approval may be requested for an affordable multi-family housing, mixed use commercial and
 multi-family residential development, or senior housing project and also requires approval of a
 conditional use permit. Planned development permit approval may adjust or modify, where
 necessary and justifiable, any applicable development standard of the Zoning Code such as floor
 area ratio, building height, setbacks, parking, and street layout.. The Zoning Code currently
 requires approval of a CUP when a project application includes a request for approval of a
 planned development permit. In order to facilitate the development of mixed use projects which
 may include affordable housing, a program objective is included in the 2014-2021 Housing
 Element Update to amend the current zoning regulations to eliminate the requirement for a CUP
 for project applications which include a request for approval of a planned development permit and
 to extend the term of an approved planned development permit from 12 to 36 months with the
 potential for another 36 month time extension. Approval by the City of this Zoning Code
 Amendment will streamline the permitting process for mixed use projects and eliminate a
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              45
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE

 governmental constraint to the permitting timeframe for multi-family residential projects which
 apply for modifications to Zoning Code development standards.
  Affordable housing projects may also qualify for the granting of a density bonus and incentives
  and/or concessions that can include deviations or waivers from certain development standards as
  established in the Zoning Code for multifamily development. In order to implement an adopted
  program objective of the City’s 2006 -2014 Housing Element, the City approved a Zoning Code
  Amendment to bring the City’s Zoning Code into conformance with state requirements with regard to
  the granting of density bonuses and incentives and/or concessions, and to eliminate the requirement
  for approval of a conditional use permit to grant one or more of the affordable housing incentives.
  On August 14, 2013 the City Council approved a Zoning Code Amendment to add provisions for the
  granting of a density bonus and affordable housing incentives and/or concessions consistent with
  state law, in order to encourage the development of affordable housing as described in Section 6.4.1,
  “Zoning Code Resources.” The Zoning Code, as amended, provides for the granting of a density
  bonus to eligible projects upon approval by the Director of Planning and Building and the granting of
  affordable housing incentives and/or concessions to eligible projects by the Planning Commission
  without the requirement for a conditional use permit. Implementation of this Zoning Code
  provision will eliminate a governmental constraint to the approval process for affordable housing
  project applications seeking an affordable housing density bonus and incentives and/or
  concessions.
  6.3.3 Environmental Constraints
  While the City of South Pasadena is predominantly developed, there are vacant and underutilized
  parcels on which development can be accommodated. Many of these parcels, however, are
  impacted by environmental constraints and sensitivities.
  Topography
  The largest concentration of undeveloped land for new residential development is located in the
  City’s hillside area referred to as the Southwest Monterey Hills. Development in this area is
  constrained due to steep slopes, substandard lots, unimproved roads, and geological and seismic
  related issues. Historically, development has varied in the degree and sensitivity to which it has
  accounted for these constraints. Some developments have sited housing units in ways to maintain
  the hillside’s unique landform while others have used extensive grading to alter the natural
  landform. The extent to which development will be permitted on the City’s hillsides in the future
  is of particular concern.
  The remaining undeveloped or primarily undisturbed open space in the City, located primarily in
  the following areas, represents opportunities for conservation, habitat protection and open space
  use:
          • The canyons, hillsides and steep topography in the Southwest Monterey Hills, and the
              primarily City-owned vacant, undeveloped lands in the southwest corner of the
              Southwest Monterey Hills;
          • The Arroyo Seco and adjacent areas;
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               46
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

          •   Upper slopes in the Monterey Road/Pasadena Avenue/Kolle Avenue/Brunswick
              Avenue/Oak Hill Avenue residential areas;
          •   Raymond Hill Site
  The following are more detailed discussions of the City’s environmental constraints and hazards
  that affect, in varying degrees, existing and future residential developments.
  Slope Stability
  The Safety Element of the General Plan identifies landslide areas in the Repetto Hills just inside
  the City’s western boundary. The Monterey Road Landslide area, in the southwest portion of the
  City, is a particular area of concern. Although small in geographic extent, the landslide area is
  extremely unstable in certain portions and is located in or near the majority of remaining
  undeveloped land in the City. Liquefaction of the soil is of secondary concern. The Los Angeles
  County General Plan Safety Element indicates that South Pasadena is at low risk for liquefaction.
  Seismic Hazards
  The City of South Pasadena is located in a seismically active region, in an area of potential fault
  rupture, strong ground shaking and slope instability. Seismic hazards can affect the structural
  integrity of buildings and utilities, and in turn can cause severe property damage and potential loss
  of life. A series of faults, including regional and local faults, have the potential to impact the City.
  Regional faults with potential sources of ground shaking within the City include the Sierra Madre
  fault system, the Whittier Fault, and the San Andreas Fault. The Raymond Hill Fault is the only
  active fault of local significance extending through South Pasadena and is classified as an Alquist-
  Priolo Study Zone. A seismic event along the Raymond Fault has the potential to generate
  surface rupture that would affect structures on and adjacent to the fault.
 Flooding
 The City of South Pasadena is located within Zone C of the National Flood Insurance Rate Maps
 (FIRM), which designates areas of minimal flooding. As there are no floodplain areas within the
 City, there are no pertinent flood hazards.
 Fire Hazards
 There are potential sources of wild land fire in the Southwest Monterey Hills and Repetto Hills.
 The threat of wild land fire to the City is generally low. A small portion of the southwestern
 corner of the City is identified in the Los Angeles County General Plan as having a high wild land
 fire hazard potential. To reduce the threat of fire in the hillside areas, more restrictive building
 standards are applied to new residential developments, including fire sprinklers and specific
 roofing materials. This requirement increases the cost of developing new residential structures.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                 47
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

 Open Space
 Constraints to development include sensitive environmental resources. Zoning regulations are
 designed so that development in the hillside areas protects the “view-shed” both to and from
 these hillsides, and to retain as much remaining natural vegetation as possible. The City’s Zoning
 Code encourages sensitive forms of development, which complement the natural and visible
 character of the City and its hillsides.
 There are some open space areas that do not lend themselves to development. These areas have
 been left in their natural state and are maintained under private ownerships. Such open space
 lands include the undeveloped portions of the hillsides, steeply sloping topography and canyons in
 the Southwest Monterey Hills, portions of the Altos de Monterey, and Raymond Hill.
 The City owns 15.89 acres of unimproved land in the Altos de Monterey hillside residential tract,
 referred to as Lot 117. This area is considered an open-space resource to the neighborhood and is
 not intended for future development.
 For the above-mentioned reasons, it is not within the City’s ability to provide incentives for
 hillside development in either the very low, low, or moderate income categories in the hillside
 areas.
 6.4 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
 6.4.1 Zoning Code Resources
 Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
 through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of a variety
 of housing types for all income levels, including multifamily rental housing, emergency shelters,
 mobile homes, and transitional and supportive housing. The following is a discussion of the
 Zoning Code resources that serve to encourage and facilitate a variety of housing types, including
 multifamily rental housing, factory built housing, residential second units, housing for the disabled
 and elderly, emergency shelters and transitional and supportive housing.
  Multifamily Rental H ousing
  Multifamily rental housing makes up approximately 48% of the City’s housing stock. South
  Pasadena’s Zoning Code provides for a Medium Density Residential district allowing for
  development of 6-14 dwelling units per acre and a High Density Residential district allowing for
  development of multiple dwellings of 14 to 24 units per acre. To encourage and facilitate
  multifamily residential development commensurate with the projected capacity in the RM and RH
  zoning districts, the City’s 2006-2013 Housing Element Update included a program objective to
  amend the current City zoning regulations to eliminate a requirement for approval of a CUP for
  multifamily uses in the RM and RH zoning districts. In September 2013, the City adopted a
  Zoning Code Amendment to eliminate the requirement for approval of a CUP for multi-family
  uses in the RM and RH zoning districts, requiring that new multi-family development projects be
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              48
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  subject only to Design Review. Implementation of this program objective would facilitate the
  review process for future development of residential units as rental units in the very low, low, and
  moderate income rental range, helping to contribute to the City’s rental property inventory. The
  Zoning Code provides for sufficient sites zoned RM and RH to be available for development of
  multi-family housing types.
  Second Residential Units
  Second residential units are permitted as either attached or detached units in the RE, RS, and RM
  zoning districts. In May 2013, the City implemented an adopted program objective of the 2006-
  2013 Housing Element Update and amended the Zoning Code, pursuant to the requirements of
  State Assembly Bill 1866, to allow for development of second residential units “by right” to be
  reviewed as ministerial approvals. The City’s Zoning Code conforms with state law by allowing
  the development of residential second units “by right” in the RE, RS, and RM zoning districts
  subject to approval of the Director of Planning and Building. The Zoning Code Amendment
  allowing second residential units “by right” in the RE, RS, and RM zoning districts provides that
  sufficient sites are available for development of this housing type.
  Manufactured Homes
  Residential single-family detached housing makes up the majority of the housing stock in the City
  and includes 14 mobile homes. The City’s Zoning Code considers a manufactured home on a
  permanent foundation to be a single family dwelling and, as such, it is a permitted use in the RS
  zoning district subject to the same development regulations as established for conventional “stick
  built” single family detached residential units. Because manufactured housing is permitted in the
  RS zoning district, and the zoning regulations governing construction of manufactured housing
  are the same as those established for conventionally constructed housing, adequate sites exist in
  the RS zoning district for development of this housing type.
  Housing for Persons with Disabilities
  Residential care facilities represent a viable housing type for the disabled and the elderly in the
  form of a supervised group home environment with personal services and assistance with daily
  activities being provided on-site. The Zoning Code includes provisions for residential care
  facilities for the disabled and residential care facilities for the elderly. The Zoning Code defines a
  residential care facility as follows:
  “A dwelling unit licensed or supervised by any Federal, State, or local health/welfare agency which
  provides 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons who are handicapped and in need of
  personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or
  for the protection of the individual in a family-like environment.”
  The Zoning Code defines a Residential Care Facility for the Elderly (RCFE) as follows:
  “A housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the residents, or the residents’ guardians,
  conservators or other responsible persons; where 75 percent of the residents are at least 62 years
  of age, or, if younger, have needs compatible with other residents; and where varying levels of care
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                  49
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE

  and supervision are provided, as agreed to at the time of admission or as determined necessary at
  subsequent times of reappraisal (definition from Government Code Title 22, Division 6, Chapter
  6, Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly). RCFE projects may include basic services and
  community space.
  RCFE projects include Assisted Living Facilities (Board and Care Homes), Congregate Housing,
  Independent Living Centers/Senior Apartments, and Life Care Facilities as defined below.
          1. Assisted living facility. A residential building or buildings that also provide housing,
              personal and health care, as permitted by the Department of Social Services, designed
              to respond to the daily, individual needs of the residents. Assisted living facilities may
              include kitchenettes (small refrigerator, sink and/or microwave oven) within individual
              rooms. Assisted living facilities are required to be licensed by the California Department
              of Social Services and do not include skilled nursing services.
          2. Independent Living Center/Senior Apartment. Independent living centers and senior
              apartments are multifamily residential projects reserved for senior citizens, where
              common facilities may be provided, such as recreation areas, but where each dwelling
              unit has individual living, sleeping, bathing, and kitchen facilities.
          3. Life care facility. Sometimes called continuing care retirement communities, or Senior
              Continuum of Care Complex, these facilities provide a wide range of care and
              supervision, and also provide skilled nursing care so that residents can receive medical
              care without leaving the facility. Residents can expect to remain, even if they become
              physically incapacitated later in life. Life care facilities require multiple licensing from
              the State Department of Social Services, the State Department of Health Services, and
              the State Department of Insurance.
 Pursuant to State law the City permits residential care facilities of six or fewer residents in any
 residential district of the City subject to the same development regulations as are applied to
 residential uses of the same type in the same zone as described in Table VI-27 above. The Zoning
 Code does not define family, does not establish a maximum concentration requirement for
 residential care facilities, and does not impose any special development standards for residential
 care facilities, over and above the zoning standards that are applied to any similar use in a
 residential district, which could constrain the provision of residential care facilities for the elderly
 or disabled.
 The City’s Zoning Code allows for residential care facilities for the elderly and residential care
 facilities of seven or more residents within the RM and RH zoning districts subject to the
 development standards described in Table VI-27 and approval of a conditional use permit (CUP).
 In the case of residential care facilities providing assisted living for seven or more residents, the
 Zoning Code establishes special development standards for these types of facilities as summarized
 below.
          •   There can be no impacts on surrounding properties that are more significant than
              would be caused by standard multifamily rental projects.

         •    Common indoor business, recreational, and social activity areas of a number, size, and
              scale consistent with the number of living units shall be provided, with no less than five
              percent of the total indoor floor area devoted to educational, recreational, and social
              facilities (e.g., library, multi-purpose common room, recreation room, TV room).
         •    Common laundry facilities must be provided of sufficient number and accessibility,
              consistent with the number of living units.
         •    Residents are limited to those in need of an assisted living environment, together with a
              spouse or partner in each unit.
         •    If an approved congregate care/assisted living facility is converted to another use, such
              as a conventional unrestricted multifamily project, the project is required to meet all
              applicable standards of the Zoning Code.
         •    Indoor common areas and living units must be provided with necessary safety
              equipment (e.g., safety bars), as well as emergency signal/intercom systems.
         •    Adequate internal and external lighting must be provided for security purposes.
         •    The entire project must be designed to provide maximum security for residents, guests,
              and employees.
         •    The project may provide common facilities for the exclusive use of the residents such as
              a beauty and barber shop, central cooking and dining rooms, exercise rooms, and small-
              scale drug store and/or medical facility.
         •    A bus turnout and shelter along the street frontage is required if the facility is on an
              established bus route and its location coordinated with the transit authority.
         •    Facilities with 50 or more dwelling units must provide private dial-a-ride transportation
              shuttles, with the exact number and schedule to be determined by the City.
         •    Senior apartments and independent living centers may be allowed additional non-
              residential facilities, including intermediate care facilities, and personal services (for
              example, beauty salon, physical therapy) through conditional use permit approval,
              without a requirement for additional parking, provided that the facilities are only for the
              private use of project residents.
 Because the Zoning Code permits residential care facilities of six or fewer residents in any
 residential district of the City and does not impose any special development standards for these
 residential care facilities, over and above the zoning standards that are applied to any similar use in
 a residential district, the Zoning Code does not impose any constraints to the provision of
 residential care facilities for the elderly or disabled in the City. Because the City’s Zoning Code
 allows for residential care facilities for elderly and residential care facilities of seven or more
 residents within the RM and RH zoning districts subject to the development standards described
 in Table VI-27 above and subject to reasonable conditions through the approval of a CUP, the
 Zoning Code does not impose any undue constraints to the provision of residential care facilities
 in the City for the disabled or the elderly of seven or more residents.
 In June 2013, the City implemented an adopted program objective of the City’s 2006-2013
 Housing Element Update to amend the Zoning Code to establish a procedure for granting
 reasonable accommodation in the application of land use and zoning requirements for persons
 with disabilities. The City’s adopted Zoning Code Amendment provides for granting a reasonable
 accommodation by the Director of Planning and Building for a modification or exception to the
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                 51
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE

 rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing related
 facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability an equal
 opportunity to the housing of their choice. The granting of a reasonable accommodation is
 subject to the following findings:
    1. The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one or more individuals
          with a disability protected under the fair housing laws and entitled to a reasonable
          accommodation;
    2. The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a
          disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling;
    3. The reasonable accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative
          burden on the City;
    4. The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a
          City program or law, including but not limited to, the General Plan, Zoning Code, design
          guidelines, and any specific plans; and
    5. The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a
          direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to
          the property of others.
 To further address the housing needs of disabled persons, the 2014-2021 Housing Element
 Update includes a program objective to explore options for requiring that a percentage of all new
 multi-family residential projects in the City be universally accessible.
 Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive H ousing, and SRO’s
 Emergency shelter means housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
 limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may
 be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay. Transitional housing is defined by the
 State as rental housing for stays of at least six months operated under program requirements that
 call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the housing unit to another eligible
 program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six
 months. Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of
 homeless individuals and families to permanent housing. Supportive housing is housing with no
 limit on length of stay for the target population, often homeless, that is linked to onsite or offsite
 services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her
 health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community
 Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing can provide a valuable form of affordable private housing
 for lower income individuals, and the homeless. An SRO unit is generally between 200 to 350
 square feet in size. These units provide a valuable source of affordable housing and can serve as an
 entry point into the housing market for homeless people transitioning into permanent housing.
 There are currently no emergency shelters or transitional housing or supportive housing facilities
 within South Pasadena, primarily because there are very few homeless persons in the City.
 Currently there are no SRO’s in the City.
 The City’s Police Department implements a referral program for homeless populations connecting
 these individuals to a homeless shelter in the City of Pasadena which participates with the City of

 South Pasadena to provide services to the City’s homeless. The Police Department provides
 transportation to the shelter for homeless individuals desiring to go to the shelter and monitors
 the location and conditions of all homeless individuals in the City.
 The City implemented a program objective of the 2006-2013 Housing Element Update in August
 2013 by amending the Zoning Code to eliminate the requirement for a CUP for an emergency
 shelter within the Business Park (BP) zoning district, to permit development of emergency shelters
 and SRO’s for homeless populations in the (BP) zoning district “by right,” and to list transitional
 and supportive housing as permitted land uses in all residential zoning districts subject to the
 same development regulations and standards as similar residential uses in the same zone. Within
 the BP zoning district there are three sites which offer opportunities for development of
 emergency shelters as follows:

  With the adoption of the Zoning Code Amendment permitting emergency shelters “by right” in
  the BP zoning district, specific development regulations were also adopted to govern development
  of emergency shelters which establishes location requirements that an emergency shelter not be
  located any closer than 300 feet to another emergency shelter or within 300 feet of a residential
  use, public park, or public school, establishes a maximum number of 12 beds plus a residential
  unit for a full-time manager per shelter, requires on-site facilities such as laundry, cooking, and
  bathroom facilities, requires provision of support services, establishes parking requirements,
  security lighting requirements, and requires submittal of a management plan to the City prior to
  occupancy and operations. State Law limits Zoning Code regulations governing buffering of
  emergency shelters to a 300 foot separation distance between emergency shelters, and does not
  allow for establishment of buffering standards between an emergency shelter and other land uses.
  Additionally, State Law allows for Zoning Code regulations to govern the operations of an
  emergency shelter including the establishment of a maximum number of beds in any one shelter
  provided the maximum adequately addresses the City’s homeless population need. In order for
  the City’s Zoning Code regulations to fully comply with State Law, the Housing Element Update
  includes a program objective for the City to amend the Zoning Code to eliminate the requirement
  for a minimum 300 foot distance separation between an emergency shelter and a residential use,
  public park or public school and to increase the maximum number of beds within an emergency
  shelter to 16 beds.
  State Law also requires that the Zoning Code consider transitional and supportive housing as
  residential uses in zones where residential uses are allowed subject to the same development
  regulations as similar residential uses in the same zone. While the City’s Zoning Code was
  amended in August 2013 to list transitional and supportive housing as permitted uses in all
  residential zones, the Zoning Code does not specifically list transitional and supportive housing as
  allowed residential land uses in other zones which allow for mixed use residential and commercial
  development. The Housing Element Update includes a program objective to amend the Zoning
  Code definition of a residential project to include transitional and supportive housing. This
  Zoning Code Amendment will clarify the Zoning Code intent for transitional and supportive
  housing to be considered a residential project and an allowable use in any zone where residential
  development is permitted or conditionally permitted.
  With the adoption of the Zoning Code Amendment permitting SROs “by right” in the BP zoning
  district, specific development regulations were also adopted to govern development of SROs
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                            54

  requiring that SRO’s not be located any closer than 300 feet to one another or within 300 feet of a
  residential use, public park, or public school, establishes a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet
  and a maximum density of one unit per 1,600 square feet of gross floor area, establishes setback
  requirements, and includes requirements for parking, provision of common area open space,
  showers, cooking facilities, toilets, storage facilities, and security lighting. All SRO facilities are
  required to submit a management and operations plan for review by the Director of Planning and
  Building prior to occupancy and operations.
  With the adopted 2013 Zoning Code Amendment to allow emergency shelters and SRO’s as
  permitted uses (“by right”) in the BP zoning district, to specifically list transitional and supportive
  housing as a permitted use in all residential districts, along with the implementation of the
  Housing Element Update program objectives for the 2014-2021 planning period, sufficient sites
  will be available for development of these housing types.
  Mixed Use Zoning Code Provisions
 Mixed use development projects are those which integrate retail and/or office commercial uses
 with residential uses on the same parcel. Mixed use is allowed in the CG zoning district and the
 MSSP zoning district subject to approval of a conditional use permit. The Zoning Code requires
 commercial and residential uses within a mixed-use project to be fully separated, with residential
 units limited to the rear portion of the first story, and/or on the second and higher stories. The
 maximum allowable density for the residential component of a mixed use project in a CG zoning
 district is 24 dwelling units per acre and up to 57 dwelling units per acre in the MSSP zoning
 district.
  The Zoning Code allows for modifications to development standards for mixed use commercial
  and residential uses which include an affordable housing component subject to approval of a
  planned development permit. Current Zoning Code provisions also require approval of a CUP as
  part of the approval of a planned development permit. To encourage and facilitate affordable
  housing as part of mixed use projects, the 2014-2021 Housing Element Update includes a
  program objective for the City to amend the Zoning Code to eliminate the requirement for
  approval of a CUP for mixed use projects that also request approval of a planned development
  permit, and to extend the term of approved planned development permits from 12 months to 36
  months with the potential for a 36 month extension, in order to facilitate the development of
  affordable housing as part of the project. City adoption of this Zoning Code Amendment would
  facilitate the review and approval process for mixed use projects which include development of
  affordable housing through a streamlining of the review process by requiring only the approval of
  a planned development permit in these cases, and would add a measure of surety to developers of
  mixed use projects by providing a longer term on an approved planned development permit.
 Mixed Use Development Regulations in the General Commercial (CG) Zoning District
 When applying development regulations to mixed use development projects in the CG zone, the
 RH zoning district requirements as described in Table VI-27 “Residential Site Development
 Standards by Zoning District,” apply to the residential component and the CG zoning district
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                 55
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

 requirements as described in Table VI- 31, “Commercial District and Business Park District
 Development Standards,” apply to the commercial component.
 Mixed Use Development Regulations in the Mission Street Specific Plan (MSSP) Zoning
 District
 Mixed use development projects in the MSSP zoning district are subject to the regulations as
 specified for the subject parcel in the Mission Street Specific Plan. Development capacity for a
 project site within the MSSP is determined by a number of factors. A maximum of a 0.8 floor area
 ratio (FAR) is allowed to derive the total square footage permitted for development, but if public
 parking spaces are provided as part of the project, the project would be eligible to receive a density
 bonus to increase the development capacity of the site up to 1.5 FAR. The total number of units
 allowed within a mixed use project in the MSSP is derived by dividing the total allowable square
 feet of development, based on permitted FAR, by 763 square feet which is the average size of a
 residential unit within the MSSP. Limitations on the total number of units that can be realistically
 developed in the MSSP include the City wide maximum height restriction of 45 feet, physical
 dimensions and configuration of the project site, and whether required parking is proposed to be
 surface or subsurface level.
  Zoning Provisions to Encourage Affordable Housing
  The City’s Zoning Code includes permitting procedures and incentive programs to encourage the
  development of affordable housing by allowing for flexibility in the application of development
  regulations and standards and through the approval of density bonuses for projects containing an
  affordable housing component. These zoning provisions are discussed below.
  a. Planned Development Permit
  The City’s Zoning Code provides flexibility in the application of development standards for a
  project containing an affordable housing or senior housing component pursuant to the approval
  of a planned development permit. Planned development permit approval may be requested for an
  affordable housing, mixed use, or senior housing project to modify or adjust any applicable
  development standard of the Zoning Code. Approval of a planned development permit may
  adjust or modify, where necessary and justifiable, any applicable development standard of the
  Zoning Code including but not limited to floor area ratio, building height, setbacks, parking, and
  street layout. Planned development permits are approved by the Planning Commission at a
  public hearing and pursuant to findings summarized below.
         1. The project must be consistent with the actions, goals, objectives, policies, and programs
              of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan, allowed within the applicable
              zoning district, and comply with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Code and
              adopted design guidelines other than those modified by the planned development
              permit, and be adequately served by public facilities, services and utilities.
         2. The approved modifications to the development standards of the Zoning Code are
              found to be necessary and appropriate to accommodate the superior design of the
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              56

              proposed project, its compatibility with adjacent land uses, and its successful mitigation
              of environmental impacts.
         3. The location, size, planning concepts, design features, and operating characteristics of
              the project are and will be compatible with the character of the site, and the land uses
              and development intended for the surrounding neighborhood by the General Plan.
         4. The site is adequate for the project in terms of size, shape, topography, and
              circumstances and has sufficient access to streets and highways, which are adequate in
              width and pavement type to carry the quantity and type of traffic expected to be
              generated by the use.
  Standard conditions of approval applied by the Planning Commission as part of an approval for a
  planned development permit are summarized below.
         1. Appropriate City building permits are required prior to construction.
         2. The project must comply with all other requirements of any law, ordinance or regulation
              of the State of California, City of South Pasadena, and any other government entity.
         3. Construction sites are subject to industry standards for construction management for
              management of trash, debris, and disposal of construction materials.
         4. Hours of construction are limited to 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday
              and 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Sunday.
         5. A demolition permit is required for any existing buildings to be demolished.
         6. Fees including sewer connection fees and school developmental fees are required to be
              paid prior to issuance of a building permit.
         7. CAL-OSHA permits are required to be obtained where required.
         8. Compliance with all State of California disability access regulations for accessibility and
              adaptability is required.
         9. Plan check for electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and sewer is required.
         10. Mechanical ventilation in accordance with the Los Angeles County Building Code is
              required for parking garages.
         11. A soils report is required.
         12. A grading and drainage plan approved by the City is required prior to issuance of the
              building permit.
         13. Structural and energy calculations are required to be provided.
         14. Public dedications for necessary right of way adjacent to the project site are required as
              applicable.
         15. Reconstruction of substandard, broken, damaged or out of grade sidewalk or curb and
              gutter, asphalt/concrete, in front of the site is required.
         16. Compliance with all applicable standards of the California Code of Regulations Title 19,
              2001 California Building Code and 2000 Uniform Fire Code with appendices (South
              Pasadena Ordinance 2109) including class A roofing, spark arrestors, and weed
              abatement program is required.
  Depending on workload review and approval of a planned development permit by the Planning
 Commission can be completed within three to four months. The Housing Element includes a
 program objective to maintain the Zoning Code provision allowing approval of a planned
 development permit for projects proposing development of affordable housing in order to
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                57
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014
 encourage the development of affordable housing and to amend the Zoning Code to eliminate the
 requirement for approval of a CUP as part of the approval of a planned development permit and
 to provide that an approved planned development permit be valid for a 36 month period with the
 possibility for extension of the permit for up to an additional 36 months at the end of the initial
 permit period. Implementation of this program objective will assist in the development of mixed
 use projects which include affordable housing and senior projects.
  b. Affordable Housing Incentives
  On August 14, 2013, the City approved a Zoning Code Amendment to add “Affordable Housing
  Incentives,” bringing the City’s Zoning Code into conformance with state requirements regarding the
  granting of density bonuses and incentives and/or concessions for affordable housing, and eliminating
  the requirement for approval of a conditional use permit in the application of one or more affordable
  housing incentives. The “Affordable Housing Incentives” provisions of the Zoning Code allow for
  the granting of a density bonus to eligible projects upon approval by the Director of Planning and
  Building and the granting of affordable housing incentives and/or concessions to eligible projects by
  the Planning Commission without the requirement for a conditional use permit. A ministerial
  approval process is established for the granting of a density bonus by the Director of Planning and
  Building to eligible projects of five or more dwelling units which meet at least one of the following
  criteria:
              •  Ten percent of the total number of proposed units are for lower income
                 households, as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50079.5; or
              •  Five percent of the total number of proposed units are for very low income
                 households, as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50105; or
              •  All proposed units, with a minimum of 35 units, are considered to be a senior
                 citizen housing development, as defined in Civil Code Section 51.3 and 51.12 (for
                 senior citizens of any income level); or
              •  Ten percent of the total number of proposed units in a common interest
                 development, as defined by Section 1351 of the Civil Code are for persons and
                 families of moderate-income, as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety
                 Code, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for
                 purchase.
              •  An eligible land transfer of a site to the City for development of affordable housing.
An applicant proposing an eligible project may request, and is entitled to, special parking
requirements as follows, and the required parking may be provided through tandem parking or
uncovered parking on the project site:
          Number of Bedrooms              Minimum On-Site Parking Spaces
                 0-1                               1
                 2-3                               2
                 4 or more                         2.5
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               58
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

A requested density bonus for the inclusion of a Child Care Facility is granted by the Planning
Commission unless a finding for denial, based upon substantial evidence, can be made consistent
with Government Code Section 65915 (h) that the community has adequate child care facilities.
The location of the designated dwelling units within projects receiving a density bonus or incentives
and/or concessions is at the discretion of the City with the goal to integrate the units into the
overall project with designated dwelling units reasonably dispersed throughout the development
where feasible. Furthermore the density bonus units must contain on average the same number of
bedrooms as the non-density bonus units, and must be compatible with the design or use of the
remaining units in terms of appearance, materials, and finish quality. If a project is to be phased, the
density bonus units must be phased in the same proportion as the non-density bonus units, or
phased in another sequence acceptable to the City. Alternatively, the City may authorize some or all
of the designated dwelling units associated with one housing development to be produced and
operated on an alternative development site.
Any request for incentives and/or concessions for an eligible project which has received a density
bonus, is granted subject to discretionary review by the Planning Commission if the request is
found to be in compliance with applicable sections of the “Affordable Housing and Incentives”
section of the Zoning Code and State Law unless any one of the following written findings for
denial based on substantial evidence can be made consistent with Government Code Section
65915(d):
         a. The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable
         housing costs, as defined in Health and Safety Code section 50052.5, or for
         rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Government Code Section
         65915(c).
         b. The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined
         in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and safety or
         the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California
         Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to
         satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering
         the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.
         c. The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or federal law.
As part of the approval of a density bonus and incentive and/or concession the developer is
required to enter into an agreement with the City which ensures that continued affordability of the
designated units is maintained pursuant to State law and as follows:
         1. Affordable units offered for rent to low-income and very low-income households shall
         be made available for rent at an affordable rent and shall remain restricted and affordable to
         the designated income group for a minimum period of thirty (30) years. A longer period of
         time may be specified if required by any construction or mortgage financing assistance
         program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program applicable to the housing
         development.
         2. For moderate income units, the initial occupant must be directly related to the receipt of
         the density bonus and be persons and families of moderate-income. Moderate-income units
         must be offered at an affordable cost for persons and families of moderate-income as
         defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code. Moderate-income units may be

         offered for subsequent sale to an above-moderate-income purchaser, provided that the sale
         results in a recapture by the City, or its designee, of financial interest in the unit equal to the
         difference between the initial moderate income level sales price and the appraised value at
         the time of the initial sale; and a proportionate share of any appreciation.
Following the granting of a density bonus or incentives and/or concessions, the applicant is
required to record a covenant against all approved affordable units to include provisions with
respect to the long term affordability of the residential project.
The adoption of the 2013 Zoning Code Amendment to add provisions for Affordable Housing and
Incentives, will assist in the development of affordable housing projects.
 6.4.2 Land Resources
This section describes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation
of housing in the City of South Pasadena. This section includes an inventory of vacant sites zoned
for residential development which are suitable for future housing development in South Pasadena
and an evaluation of the City’s ability to provide adequate sites to address its identified share of
future housing needs.
Availability of Sites for Housing
To properly plan for the current planning period and future housing needs, undeveloped land
available for housing within the existing City boundary has been inventoried. Land available for
development in South Pasadena is scarce. Opportunities for residential development in the City fall
into one of the following categories:
         •     Vacant land within the CG zone and MSSP zone, which permit mixed-use
               development with commercial uses on the ground level and high density residential
               uses on the upper levels which would accommodate development of lower income
               affordable housing as well as moderate and above moderate income housing.
         •     Vacant land zoned RH (Residential High Density) which could be developed for
               moderate income and above moderate income housing.
         •     Existing Residential single-family parcels zoned for one unit but which could be
               developed with a second unit pursuant to the Zoning Code provisions for
               development of Second Residential Units to be made available as affordable housing.
         •     Vacant single family zoned lots in the RE (Residential Estate) and RS (Residential
               Single Family) zoning districts which could be developed with above moderate
               housing.
Site Inventory
Table VI-32 below describes the vacant sites remaining in the City zoned RH permitting
development of up to 24 dwelling units per acre, CG permitting development of residential uses of
up to 24 dwelling units per acre in a mixed use project, and MSSP which allows high density

residential development at densities ranging from 36 to 57 dwelling units per acre as described in
Section 6.4, “Housing Resources.” Sites zoned for development of residential units at 24 dwelling
units/acre are adequately zoned to accommodate the City’s RHNA of 25 above moderate income
units and 11 moderate income units. Sites in the MSSP zoned at densities above 30 dwelling units
per acre are adequately zoned to accommodate the City’s RHNA of 11 moderate income, 10 low
income, and 17 extremely low income units.
In determining the realistic unit capacity for sites listed in Table VI-32 below, Zoning Code
provisions applicable to the zoning district for each site, as described in other sections of the
Housing Element, were assumed and no density bonuses were applied. The realistic development
capacity for each site stated below can be increased with approval of a density bonus as part of a
development application.

SITE ANALYSIS
As shown in Table VI-32 South Pasadena has suitable sites zoned to accommodate the potential
development of up to 192 high density multifamily residential dwelling units. This total assumes a
realistic development capacity which addresses each site’s unique physical characteristics, a strict
application of the zoning code development standards, and no density bonuses.
The sites listed in Table VI -32 each are served by adequate infrastructure and unconstrained by
environmental considerations. These sites are suitable to accommodate development of a total of
192 residential dwelling units which could be developed within the Housing Element planning
period and which would meet the City’s RHNA of 63 units. The following site analysis further
describes the development potential of each site.

The Downtown Revitalization project site was assembled through the use of the City’s
Redevelopment Agency. Since the dissolution of redevelopment agencies statewide in 2012, the
City has become the successor agency with authority for the disposition of the Downtown
Revitalization project site. The City has active participation agreements with the property owners
within the project site and/or has site control for the development of the entire project site.
Existing redevelopment housing set-aside funds generated from the creation of the Downtown
Revitalization project have been transferred to the City’s Housing Authority and allocated for
development of affordable housing as part of the project. In order to create opportunities for
development of affordable housing the density permitted for all parcels within the entire 3.0 acre
project site is distributed among the three parcels on 1.46 acres of the project site illustrated as Sites
A, B, and C. The project site has a 2008 approved PDP which permits development of the project
site for mixed use to include 60 residential units. The 2008 PDP was approved for a previous
development concept, however the PDP remains a valid development permit. The City is in
negotiations with a developer for a Development and Disposition Agreement (DDA) which will
lead to the development of a revised concept for a mixed use project including commercial uses
and 60 residential housing units of which 6 units will be made available for low income households
and 6 units will be made available for moderate income households. As part of the project the
City’s Housing Authority will allocate the City’s existing Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside
funds to the project for development of the 12 affordable units.
New mixed use development within the project site will include commercial retail or service uses
on the ground floor of buildings with high density residential uses above. The majority of required
parking would be subterranean parking. A realistic development scenario would include one level
of retail and two floors of residential above. The realistic residential unit capacity for the three
development sites is 63 residential dwelling units based on the maximum density per parcel of 24
units per acre, however the approved PDP permit allows for a maximum of 60 residential dwelling
units. The development plan for 60 residential dwelling units was derived based on the
development limitations affecting each development site which includes the City’s mandated
maximum height limit of 45 feet, the need for some surface parking on one of the sites, and the
extent of open space amenities required as part of the project.
Although the maximum density for the project site is 24 dwelling units per acre, this density is
adequate to allow development of low and moderate income dwelling units. Housing set-aside
funds will be allocated by the City’s Housing Authority as part of the project and restricted for
development of affordable housing. As part of the DDA the City will require that of the total 60
allowable residential dwelling units, 6 be made affordable to low income households and 6 be made
affordable to moderate income households. As part of the DDA the City will amend the existing
PDP where necessary to accommodate the current developer’s proposed development concept.
Based on the existing valid term of the PDP, the City’s commitment of housing set-aside funds to
the project, and the requirement as part of the proposed DDA that the project include 12
affordable housing units, this site can feasibly be developed for affordable housing and qualifies as
a site adequately zoned for development of low and moderate income housing as part of the City’s
vacant site inventory. The City’s negotiations with a developer for the project DDA is anticipated
to be executed by June 2014 with construction of the project to be completed within the housing
element planning period. Table VI-33 below describes the residential development capacity for
each parcel in the Downtown Redevelopment Project Site.

The realistic unit capacity within the entire 3.00 acre project site is 60 residential dwelling units
calculated by multiplying the acreage per parcel times 24 du/acre and adjusting for the site
conditions described above. A PDP approved by the City for the Project Site on May 21, 2008 is
still in effect allowing for the development of the three parcels as a mixed use project with 60
residential units and commercial area. The PDP will be amended by the City as necessary to
accommodate the development proposal as described below.

Development Potential of Small Sites
Due to the built out condition of the City, new construction projects in South Pasadena are of an
infill nature on sites ranging in size from approximately one half acre or less up to approximately
three acres in size. New multifamily residential development can be accommodated within these
sites zoned for multifamily or mixed-use development through the application of the development
regulations established in the Zoning Code. Residential multifamily development with housing
affordable to lower income households is made more feasible through the granting of affordable
housing incentives which allow the use of a density bonus and the flexible application of
development standards through the application of a planned development permit. Residential
development potential for sites identified within Table VI –32 within the RH and CG zoning
districts is calculated based on the development standards established in the City’s Zoning Code, as
applicable, to those districts and as described in Table VI-27. Residential development within a
mixed-use project in the CG district is subject to the RH zoning standards as described in Table
VI-27.
Residential development potential for sites identified within Table VI-32 within the MSSP zoning
district is calculated on the land use and development criteria for each site pursuant to the
provisions of the Mission Street Specific Plan and as described in Section 6-4.
The following is a representative example of the methodology used for deriving an approximation
of site development potential through the application of the Zoning Code for a small site less than
one acre in the RH zoning district.

The following is a representative example of the methodology used for deriving an approximation
of site development potential through the application of the Zoning Code for a small site less than
one acre in the MSSP zoning district.

Development Potential of Mixed Use Areas
The City has zoned several parcels of land to allow for mixed-use development. Areas where
mixed-use development is permitted include the CG zoning district and the MSSP zoning district.
These two zoning districts in the City represent a resource for development of a variety of housing
types, as described below, and offer the opportunity for new housing in all income categories.
Approximately 11.2 acres zoned for CG land use can be developed for mixed-use commercial and
residential projects subject to approval of a conditional use permit. The City’s Zoning Code
designates approximately 40 acres as the Mission Street Specific Plan (MSSP) area designed to
encourage development of mixed-use commercial and residential projects. Areas zoned CG or
MSSP permitting mixed-use development represent a land resource for development of higher
density residential uses.
Residential development of up to 24 dwelling units per acre are permitted as a component of a
mixed use project in the CG zoning district and up to 30 dwelling units per acre if a density bonus
is applied to a project that includes affordable housing. Residential development of 30 dwelling
units per acre and above is permitted as a component of a mixed use development on parcels
zoned MSSP. The development capacity for each parcel within the MSSP is based on a number of
variables including the size of units proposed, total site area, parking, FAR, and height limitations
per subarea of the MSSP. Generally, the MSSP allows for an increased number of residential units
in a project if the units are smaller and will promote affordability. Allowable residential densities
within the MSSP zoning district can range from 36 dwelling units per acre to 57 dwelling units per
acre.

Development Potential of Residential Second Units
The Zoning Code permits residential second dwelling units in the RE, RS, and RM zoning districts
“by right.”
Ministerial permit approval of a residential second unit is subject to the review and approval by the
Director of Planning and Building of the site plan and building plans to ensure compliance with
height, setback, floor area and parking requirements of the Zoning Code. Depending on workload,
review and administrative review and approval can be completed within eight weeks. A summary
of the City zoning standards applicable to residential second units is provided below.
         •    A second dwelling unit must be approved only on a parcel of 12,500 square feet or
              larger and may be either an attached or detached unit from the primary dwelling on the
              same lot but is not permitted above a garage.
         •    A second dwelling unit must comply with the setback requirements of the applicable
              zoning district, must not be visible from the public right of way, and cannot not exceed
              one story in height.
         •    A second dwelling unit must have a minimum floor area of 600 square feet, and cannot
              exceed 850 square feet or 30 percent of the floor area of the primary dwelling,
              whichever is less.
         •    A second dwelling unit must provide living quarters independent from the primary
              dwelling, including living, sleeping, cooking and restroom facilities. A second dwelling
              unit is limited to one bedroom.
         •    A second dwelling unit must have an outdoor entrance separate from the primary
              dwelling. In order to maintain the single-family residential character of the street, the
              entrance to the second dwelling unit must be located so that it is not visible from the
              public right-of-way.
         •    A second dwelling unit cannot have utility services (i.e., an electrical and/or gas meter)
              separate from the primary dwelling.
         •    The architectural design and materials of the second dwelling unit exterior must be
              consistent with the primary dwelling, and approved by the DRB.
         •    A minimum of one covered parking space is required for each second dwelling unit. No
              second dwelling unit is allowed unless the primary dwelling is also in compliance with
              all applicable parking requirements of this Zoning Code.
         •    A second dwelling unit cannot have a separate street or unit address than the primary
              dwelling.
         •    The owner of the property must reside on the property, and a recorded covenant
              establishing this requirement is required prior to a final building inspection for the
              second dwelling unit.
 During the previous housing element period a total of three residential second units were
 constructed in the City in the RE zoning district between 2006 and 2014. Considering this track
 record, in concert with local housing needs and development trends, and with the adoption of new
 incentives, the City is projecting that three residential second units will be approved during the
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               73

 current planning period. As provided for in Government Code Section 65583.1, the City is
 applying second units toward its adequate sites requirement as described in Table VI-36.
  Availability of Infrastructure
  Existing City services including water, sewer and storm drain facilities are available to serve the
  development capacity described above. The build out of the capacity for new residential
  development on sites described in Table VI–31 and residential second units on existing RE, RS,
  and RM residential lots is within the existing General Plan build out projection. New connections
  to City services will be required as part of project development of any new project in the City.
  Comparison of Site Inventory with RHNA
  According to SCAG, South Pasadena has a regional housing need of 63 units for the 2014 – 2021
  planning period. Of the 63 units, 17 very low-income (including extremely low income), 10 low-
  income, 11 moderate-income, and 25 above moderate-income units are needed.
  The City’s General Plan allows for up to 11,652 residential dwelling units. The total number of
  dwelling units reported in the City as of 2011 is 10,972 leaving an available General Plan capacity
  of 680 additional residential units. The development of the City’s RHNA allocation of 63 units
  can be accomplished within the existing General Plan build out limitations and will be consistent
  with the current General Plan. The City’s RHNA of 25 above moderate income units, which
  constitute 40% of the City’s RHNA, can be accommodated in RE and RS zoning districts and can
  also be accommodated on any of the sites identified in Table VI-32. The City’s RHNA of 11
  units of moderate income housing units can be accommodated within Sites 2-5 as identified in
  Table VI-32 as well as through the development of residential second units on existing residential
  lots in the RE, RS, and RM zoning districts. Sites 4 and 5 are zoned at a density in excess of 30
  dwelling units per acre and can accommodate the City’s RHNA of 17 very low, 10 low, and 11
  moderate income units. Site 2 is zoned at a density of 24 dwelling units per acre and, pursuant to
  the feasibility analysis presented above, can accommodate six of the City’s RHNA of 10 low
  income units and six of the City’s RHNA of 11 moderate income units pursuant to the DDA to
  be in place for development of this site by June 2014. As described in Table VI-34 below, the
  City has sufficient appropriately zoned sites to accommodate the RHNA of 63 units.

 6.4.4 Opportunities for Energy Conservation
 Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new
 development. In turn, the home building industry must comply with these standards and local
 governments are responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations. At this time, the
 City enforces all applicable state and federal laws relative to energy conservation.
 The Housing Element identifies a program objective to explore amendments to the Zoning Code
 to promote the use of energy saving building techniques in new construction and to offer
 incentives for developers to incorporate green building techniques for building design and
 construction. Development incentives may include reduced application and permit processing fees
 and allowed deviations from development standards for projects incorporating green building
 design and/or achieving Green Point ratings as well as project streamlining for green projects.
 Other programs to promote energy conservation in the City include public information provided
 on the City’s website and the provision of brochures at City Hall with resource information on
 energy saving xeriscapes, energy rebates, and use of solar power as an energy alternative for homes.
 Southern California Edison offers public information and technical assistance to developers,
 homeowners, and apartment owners on energy conservation measures and programs. The City
 periodically arranges for product presentations by manufacturers of energy saving building
 materials to the Design Review Board and Cultural Heritage Commission to assist these decision

 6.5 REVIEW OF 2001 HOUSING ELEMENT PERFORMANCE
  State housing law requires communities to assess the achievements under adopted housing
  programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These results should be
  quantified wherever possible, but may be qualitative where necessary. In addition, these results
  need to be compared with what was projected or planned in the previously adopted element. The
  results of the analysis should provide the basis for developing the comprehensive housing
  program strategy for the future planning period. Table VI-36 describes the City’s progress in
  implementing the 2006-2014 Housing Element Update programs.

  6.6 HOUSING PLAN and QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
  This section presents the Housing Plan (Plan) for the 2014 - 2021 planning period. This Plan sets
  forth South Pasadena’s goals, policies, and programs to address the City’s identified housing
  needs.
  6.6.1 GOALS AND POLICIES
  The City of South Pasadena, in adopting the Housing Element Update, adopts the goals that
  follow as the framework for implementing its housing policies and programs over the timeframe
  of the 2014 - 2021 Housing Element Update.
  Goal 1.0       Conserve the Existing Supply of Affordable Housing
  The maintenance and conservation of existing housing will serve to meet the overall goal of
  maintaining a healthy and diverse housing supply. The following policies are designed to facilitate
  the maintenance and conservation of existing housing.
  Objective: To maintain and enhance the quality of existing residential housing and
  neighborhoods in South Pasadena.
  Policy 1.1     Promote rehabilitation, as that term is defined by the U.S. Department of Housing
                 and Urban Development (HUD), and home improvement assistance to low- and
                 moderate-income households.
  Policy 1.2     Continue to use the City’s code enforcement program to bring substandard units
                 into compliance with City codes and improve overall housing conditions in South
                 Pasadena.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                          84
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  Policy 1.3     Prevent the encroachment of incompatible uses and/or densities into established
                 residential areas consistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan Land Use
                 Element.
  Goal 2.0       Assist in the Provision of Affordable Housing
  The housing needs of all economic segments of the population must be reflected in the supply of
  housing. The population segments least able to afford adequate housing are those with low-
  incomes. Therefore, provisions have been made to facilitate the development of housing
  affordable to lower income households.
  Objective: To assist in the provision of a variety of housing to meet the needs of the
  community.
  Policy 2.1     Use existing housing set-aside funding to assist in development of new multifamily
                 housing for low and moderate income groups.
  Policy 2.2     Provide information to developers regarding the City’s Zoning Code provisions for
                 the granting of a density bonus and other incentives for residential development
                 projects providing affordable housing.
  Policy 2.3     Continue to refer residents inquiring about rental assistance to the County of Los
                 Angeles Community Development Commission, the entity that administers the
                 Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program to renters.
  Policy 2.4     Encourage the development of senior projects through acquisition by a private
                 entity of existing apartment projects for rehabilitation as affordable senior housing
                 whenever possible.
  Goal 3.0       Provide for Adequate Residential Sites
  The provision of housing is one of the most important issues facing local government. The State
  legislature recognizes significant housing deficiencies among certain economic segments of
  California’s population and considers housing availability an issue of “vital state-wide
  importance.” South Pasadena places particular emphasis on providing housing opportunities to
  lower-income households and those with special needs such as senior citizens. Accordingly, the
  following policies are designed to guide future development toward the production of a diverse
  housing supply to meet the needs of the City’s population as a whole.
  Objective: To provide adequate residential sites through appropriate land use and
  zoning designations to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs.
  Policy 3.1     Promote mixed-use developments by continuing to allow development of
                 residential uses above commercial uses in the GC zoning district and the MSSP
                 zoning district and encourage the development of affordable housing within the
                 residential component of mixed use projects through the use of affordable housing
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              85
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

                 incentives and planned development permits as provided for in the City’s Zoning
                 Code. Conduct early consultations with developers of mixed- use projects to
                 encourage the development of affordable housing units in these projects.
  Policy 3.2     Maintain an inventory of vacant and underdeveloped properties in the City with
                 potential for development of new residential dwelling units. Conduct early
                 consultations with developers of these sites to encourage the development of these
                 sites to include affordable housing units.
   Policy 3.3    Consider offering any publicly owned sites declared as “Surplus” to non-profit
                 developers of affordable housing on a first right of refusal basis for a time set by the
                 terms of the offer.
 Goal 4.0        Remove Governmental Constraints
  Efforts by government to assist in the creation of new affordable housing is part of the
  continuum of planning activities needed to ensure that affordable housing is available over the
  long term. To accomplish this, the City should establish and maintain an ongoing planning
  function focused on removing governmental constraints to promote affordable developments.
  Objective: Implement an ongoing planning function focused on promoting the
  provision of affordable housing.
  Policy 4.1     Consider the adoption of a Zoning Code Amendment to eliminate the requirement
                 for approval of a conditional use permit for development of mixed use projects
                 which include an application for approval of a planned development permit and
                 extend the timeframe for an approved planned development permit to a period of
                 36 months with the potential for an extension of up to an additional 36 months to
                 facilitate the development of affordable housing as part of the project.
  Policy 4.2     Explore amendments to the Zoning Code to implement “green” building design,
                 including the use of solar energy, to reduce energy costs to residents. Consider the
                 adoption of incentives such as reduced permitting fees and streamlined project
                 processing for projects as an incentive to encourage green building design practices.
  Policy 4.3     Amend the City’s Building Code as required to be consistent with the adopted
                 California Green Building Standards Code to require energy conserving building
                 techniques in new construction.
  Policy 4.4     Explore options for requiring that a percentage of all newly constructed residential
                 multifamily dwelling units be designed as universally accessible dwelling units to
                 expand housing opportunities for disabled persons.
  Policy 4.5     Maintain the Zoning Code provision for approval of a planned development permit
                 for development projects which include affordable housing to provide relief from
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                 86
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

                 the strict application of development standards and requirements in order to
                 encourage the development of affordable housing.
  Policy 4.6     Amend the Zoning Code to add clarifying language to the definition of residential
                 projects to include transitional and supportive housing.
  Policy 4.7     Amend the Zoning Code regulations for emergency shelters to delete the language
                 establishing a buffer distance requirement between an emergency shelter and any
                 public park, school, or residential use and to establish the maximum number of
                 beds permitted in any one emergency shelter at 16 beds.
  Goal 5.0       Equal Housing Opportunity
                 The opportunity to obtain adequate housing without discrimination is an important
                 component of a diverse housing supply. The following policies seek to encourage
                 equal opportunity for South Pasadena residents to reside in the housing of their
                 choice throughout the City.
  Objective:     To promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing of
                 their choice.
  Policy 5.1     Participate in the programs offered by the San Gabriel Valley Fair Housing Council
                 (SGVFHC). Provide public information regarding the San Gabriel Valley Fair
                 Housing Council at City Hall.
  Policy 5.2     Provide information on fair housing practices and resources on the City’s web site.
  Policy 5.3      Implement Zoning Code procedures for reasonable accommodation, on a case by
                  case basis, in order to promote equal access to housing for disabled persons.
  6.6.2 HOUSING PROGRAMS
  The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element Update address South Pasadena’s
  identified housing needs and are implemented through a series of housing programs. Housing
  programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve specific goals and policies.
  According to Section 65583 of the Government Code, a city’s housing programs must address the
  following five major areas:
         •    Conserving the existing supply of affordable housing;
         •    Assisting in the provision of housing;
         •    Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing;
         •    Removing governmental constraints as necessary; and
         •    Promoting equal housing opportunity
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              87
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  South Pasadena’s housing plan for addressing housing needs, removing governmental constraints,
  and achieving quantitative objectives is described in this section according to the above five areas.
  The housing programs introduced on the following pages include existing programs as well as new
  programs added to address the City’s unmet housing needs. The Housing Implementation
  Program Summary included at the end of this section specifies the five-year objectives for each
  program, funding source, agency responsible, and time frame for implementation.
  6.6.2.1 Conserving the Existing Supply of Affordable Housing
  Preserving the City’s existing housing stock is an important goal for South Pasadena. The City
  supports neighborhood preservation and improvement through federally assisted housing
  rehabilitation and improvement programs, and code enforcement.
  Energy Efficiency Program
  This CDBG-funded program provides grants to assist low- and moderate-income households in
  the community with funding for necessary energy saving home repairs and improvements. A
  household may be eligible to participate in the program as long as they are homeowners with
  dwellings of two units or less and meet the income limits established for the program.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will continue to use CDBG funds to provide housing
  rehabilitation (as that term is defined by HUD) assistance for low- and moderate-income
  homeowners for energy saving home improvements. The City’s objective is to assist one lower
  income household during the 2014-2021 planning period.
  6.6.2.2 Assisting in the Provision of H ousing
  Housing prices are relatively high in the City of South Pasadena. To enable more households to
  own and rent housing in the City, the Housing Element Update sets forth the following programs.
  Planning Assistance and Permit Processing
 The City provides technical assistance to potential developers of new housing in the City and
 offers a streamlined design review process. Additionally, the City’s Zoning Code includes
 provisions for approval of a planned development permit which allows for modifications to
 certain zoning requirements for projects which include affordable housing and the granting of
 density bonuses and incentives and concessions for projects which meet the affordable housing
 requirements of the Zoning Code.
  Eight Year Objective:
  Facilitate review of development proposals which include affordable housing and continue to
  provide Zoning Code information to developers of affordable housing regarding special permit
  provisions and the potential for the granting of density bonuses and incentives and/or
  concessions to qualifying affordable housing projects. The City’s objective is to assist in the
  provision of 25 above moderate income housing units during the 2014-2021 planning period.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              88
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  Housing Development Program
  This program relies on the availability of state financial assistance to developers from sources such
  as tax credits and CHFA for development of new affordable housing. The City will provide
  Notices of Funding Availability (NOFA) information to developers when NOFAs become
  available and facilitate review of projects linked to these funding applications.
  Eight Year Objective:
  Facilitate review of development proposals which are linked to applications for funding by a State
  or Federal agency. The City’s objective is to provide information to developers to promote
  development of 10 units of low and 11 units of moderate income housing units during the 2014-
  2021 planning period.
  CalH ome Program
  This program is a State Housing and Community Development program providing funds for
  home ownership programs to assist low and very low income households become or remain
  homeowners.
  Eight Year Objective: Provide information to low and very low income households for funding
  within the timetables established by the State Department of Housing and Community
  Development funding when funding is made available to the City. The City’s objective is to
  provide information to households whenever possible in order for a minimum of one low income
  and one very low income household to receive assistance during the 2014-2021 planning period.
  Section 8 Rental Assistance
  The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission funds Section 8 rental assistance
  to eligible renter households and to eligible homeless facilities and individuals. This program
  provides housing subsidy payments to households at or below 50% of the median income for two
  or more persons living together, elderly, and disabled persons.
  Eight-year Objective: Continue to assist South Pasadena renters with housing subsidy payments
  through the Section 8 rental assistance program by referring renters to the County agency
  responsible for administering this program. The City’s objective is to provide information to low
  and very low income households whenever possible during the 2014-2021 planning period.
  Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation
  A number of surplus housing units resulted from the change in the proposed route of the
  extension of the 710 Freeway. The City monitors the status of these properties in order to
  identify any properties deemed surplus by Caltrans and monitors opportunities for their
  acquisition and rehabilitation by non-profit developers as affordable housing.
  Eight-year Objective: The City’s objective is to continue to monitor surplus Caltrans properties
  in the 710 surface route corridor and provide technical assistance where feasible to non-profit
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                               89
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  affordable housing developers pursuing acquisition and rehabilitation of any Caltrans declared
  surplus properties in the 710 surface route corridor as affordable housing.
  Density Bonus for Affordable Housing
  The City’s Zoning Code provides for the use of density bonuses as a developer incentive to
  provide affordable housing in new developments. The General Plan contains a policy to consider
  the development of residential units in excess of the General Plan limits if the units are ownership
  units affordable to low- or moderate-income households.
  Eight-year Objective: Provide technical assistance to developers of affordable residential
  projects by providing Zoning Code information on the possible use of density bonuses and
  incentives and/or concessions to assist in the development of affordable housing. The City’s
  objective is to provide information to developers regarding the use of the Affordable Housing
  Incentives provisions of the Zoning Code whenever possible during the 2014-2021 planning
  period to assist with development of 21 lower income units and 5 moderate income units.
  Homeless Services
  The City will continue its emergency shelter referral program administered through the Police
  Department and investigate entering into participation agreements with neighboring cities and/or
  Councils of Governments that operate emergency shelter programs to expand homeless services
  to the homeless population in South Pasadena.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will continue ongoing referral services through its Police
  Department assisting homeless individuals to obtain emergency shelter and will continue to
  evaluate the possibility of entering into participation agreements with other cities and/or Councils
  of Governments providing emergency shelter programs.
   Senior Housing
   The City’s Senior Citizen Commission has suggested that the City explore the potential for the
   reuse and redevelopment of existing apartment buildings for seniors to expand housing
   opportunities for seniors.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will encourage developers proposing to rehabilitate existing
  apartment buildings to consider rehabilitation and reuse of the existing apartment buildings as
  affordable senior housing whenever possible.
  6.6.2.3 Providing Adequate Residential Sites
  An important element in meeting a community’s housing needs is the provision of adequate sites
  for various types, sizes and prices of housing. The General Plan, Zoning Code, and specific plans
  dictate where housing may locate, which impacts the supply of land available for residential
  development.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                              90
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  Vacant Sites
  The Housing Element identifies vacant sites and vacant sites approved for development in the
  City with the capacity for development of up to 192 new residential dwelling units. The City will
  maintain the inventory of vacant sites and work with future developers of these sites in early
  consultations to encourage the development of affordable units on these sites as part of any
  project proposal and maintain adequate zoning to make feasible the development of housing for a
  variety of income levels.
  Eight-year Objective: Continue to maintain an inventory of vacant and underdeveloped sites
  for development of new affordable housing. Maintain zoning adequate to allow for the private
  development of 17 very low, 10 low income, 11 moderate income, and 25 above moderate income
  housing units.
  Mixed-Use Developments and Adaptive Re-Use
  The City’s Zoning Code permits the reuse and new development of housing above ground floor
  uses in commercial districts and in the Mission Street Specific Plan Area providing opportunities
  for development of affordable housing. The 1998 General Plan also states policies to encourage
  the development of mixed use projects within targeted areas of the city. As part of a mixed use
  residential and commercial development project the provisions of the Zoning Code for affordable
  housing incentives could be utilized in projects which include units for very low, low, and
  moderate
  income households. Additionally, developers of affordable housing may seek relief from the strict
  application of the Zoning Code regulations through approval of a planned development permit
  which allows for flexible application of Zoning Code regulations.
  Eight-year Objective: Continue to promote the development of housing units above ground
  floor commercial uses on vacant properties located within the City’s commercial districts through
  the mixed use development provisions of the Zoning Code and on vacant and reused properties
  located in the Mission Street Specific Plan area. Expedite permit processing for mixed use projects
  which include affordable housing and assist developers with the application of the planned
  development permit and Affordable Housing Incentives provisions of the Zoning Code to
  projects to maximize the potential for a project to include affordable housing. Promote the use
  of the density bonus and notify developers of available sites for development of affordable
  housing. The City’s objective is to provide information to developers to promote development of
  17 units of very low, 10 units of low, and 11 units of moderate income housing units during the
  2014-2021 planning period.
  Residential Second Units
  The Zoning Code permits the construction of residential second units in the RE, RS, and RM
  zoning districts.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                             91
2014-2021 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
January 15, 2014

  Eight-year Objective: Facilitate development applications for residential second units to
  promote this housing type as an affordable housing alternative. The City’s objective is to facilitate
  application review to promote development of three residential second units during the 2014-2021
  planning period.
  6.6.2.4 Removing Governmental Constraints
  Land Use Controls
  The City’s Zoning Code currently includes requirements for approval of a conditional use permit
  as part of the approval of a planned development permit. In addition, the Zoning Code
  establishes a 12 month validity period for an approved planned development permit.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will adopt an amendment to the Zoning Code within one year
  following the approval of the Housing Element to eliminate the requirement for approval of a
  conditional use permit for development projects which request and qualify for approval of a
  planned development permit and to extend the term for an approved planned development
  permit to a period of 36 months with the potential for approval of an extension for an additional
  36 months.
  In accordance with State Law, Zoning Code regulations establishing buffer distances for an
  emergency shelter are limited to the establishment of a 300 foot separation distance between
  emergency shelters, and Zoning Code regulations governing the operations of emergency shelters
  should provide that adequate beds are available to accommodate the City’s homeless population.
 Eight Year Objective: The City will adopt an amendment to the Zoning Code within 24 months
 following approval of the Housing Element Update to delete language establishing buffer distance
 requirements between an emergency shelter and any public park, school, or residential use and to
 establish the maximum number of beds permitted in any one emergency shelter at 16 beds.
  In accordance with State Law Zoning Code regulations must consider transitional and supportive
  housing as a residential use in any zone where residential uses are allowed and subject to the same
  development regulations as other residential uses in the same zone.
 Eight Year Objective: The City will adopt an amendment to the Zoning Code within 24 months
 following approval of the Housing Element Update to add clarifying language to the Zoning Code
 definition of residential projects to include transitional and supportive housing.
  With the adoption of the Zoning Code Amendment permitting SROs “by right” in the BP zoning
  district, specific development regulations were also adopted to govern development of SROs
  which establish location requirements that SRO’s not be located any closer than 300 feet to one
  another or within 300 feet of a residential use, public park, or public school, establishes a
  minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet and a maximum density of one unit per 1,600 square feet
  of gross floor area, establishes setback requirements, and includes requirements for parking,
  provision of common area open space, showers, cooking facilities, toilets, storage facilities, and

  security lighting. All SRO facilities are required to submit a management and operations plan for
  review by the Director of Planning and Building prior to occupancy and operations.
  With the adopted 2013 Zoning Code Amendment to allow emergency shelters and SRO’s as
  permitted uses (“by right”) in the BP zoning district, to specifically list transitional and supportive
  housing as a permitted use in all residential districts, and with the adoption of the Zoning Code
  Amendments provided for in Housing Element Update program objectives for the 2014-2021
  planning period, sufficient sites will be available for development of these housing types.
  The Housing Element promotes flexibility in residential development standards as a way to reduce
  costs of development thereby promoting affordability in design. The City uses the Administrative
  Modification provisions of the Zoning Code as a means of providing flexibility in development
  standards including setbacks, open space requirements, and height requirements.
  Eight Year Objective: The City will continue to implement the Administrative Modification
  Process to provide for flexibility in the application of development standards for affordable
  housing projects.
  The City’s Zoning Code provides for flexibility in the application of development regulations
  pertaining to affordable multifamily housing development developments and senior citizens’
  projects through the use of the planned development permit process. The planned development
  permit is intended to facilitate development of affordable housing in mixed use and residentially
  zoned areas by permitting greater flexibility in the design of projects than generally is possible
  under conventional zoning or subdivision regulations.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will continue the application of flexible zoning regulations to
  promote the development of affordable housing through the planned development permit process
  as provided for in the Zoning Code.
  The City’s Senior Citizen Commission has suggested that a policy be adopted to require that a
  percentage of all new multifamily residential projects in the City be developed as universally
  accessible units.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will explore options for requiring that new residential
  development projects of a certain size include a percentage of the units to be universally
  accessible.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA                                                                                 93

  Provision of Technical Assistance to Developers of Affordable Housing
  The City’s Planning & Building Department currently offers handout materials and provides
  assistance to applicants to guide them through the Design Review process and the discretionary
  and ministerial permit process. The Planning & Building Department provides the same
  assistance to developers of affordable housing to assure that applications for affordable housing
  projects are processed in a timely and expeditious manner and also provides information on state
  and federal financial assistance programs and other available assistance to facilitate development
  of affordable housing.
  Eight-year Objective: Continue to provide information on State and Federal financial assistance
  programs to developers of affordable housing projects and assistance to applicants of affordable
  housing projects during the preparation, submittal, and processing of applications to the City for
  discretionary or ministerial permit approvals. The City’s objective is to provide information to
  developers to promote development of 17 units of very low, 10 units of low, and 11 units of
  moderate income housing units during the 2014-2021 planning period.
  6.6.2.5        Promoting Equal H ousing Opportunities
  In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
  community, the housing program must include actions that promote housing opportunities for all
  persons regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color,
  age, or physical disability.
  Fair Housing Program
  The City of South Pasadena refers fair housing complaints to the San Gabriel Valley Fair Housing
  Council (SGVFHC). The role of the SGVFHC is to provide services to jurisdictions and agencies,
  as well as the general public, to further fair housing practices in the sales or rental of housing.
  Services provided by the SGVFHC include responding to discrimination complaints,
  landlord/tenant dispute resolution, housing information and counseling, and community
  education programs.
  Eight-year Objective: Continue to provide information on fair housing practices and refer
  housing complaints to the SGVFHC as needed. Provide information on fair housing practices
  and resources on the City’s web site. Implement Zoning Code procedures for reasonable
  accommodation for housing for persons with disabilities, on a case by case basis, in order to
  promote equal access to housing.
 6.6.2.6         Promote Energy Conservation
  The City will explore policies and possible Zoning Code Amendments to provide incentives for
  new “green” development in the City. The application of green design and construction principals
  could result in the development of smaller, compact residential projects with the potential to
  achieve a greater economy of scale thus lowering construction costs and providing an opportunity

  for development of affordable housing. Green design and building principals applied to new
  development also incorporate energy saving techniques thereby lowering the cost of utilities for
  residents.
  Eight-year Objective: The City will explore amendments to the Zoning Code to provide
  incentives for the development of energy saving residential development including deviations or
  waivers from compliance with established development standards as part of a development
  proposal involving either adaptive reuse of existing buildings or the construction of new
  residential units. Such deviations or waivers may include a reduction in the minimum required lot
  area for all housing types, an increase from the established maximum floor area ratio and other
  similar standards. The City will explore amendments to the Zoning Code to implement “green”
  building design guidelines and development standards, including the use of solar energy, to reduce
  energy costs to residents. The City will continue the on-going programs to promote energy
  conservation in existing structures in the City which include maintaining information on the City’s
  website that provides the public with resource information on energy saving xeriscapes, State
  energy grants, energy rebates, and use of solar power as an energy alternative for homes.
  Additionally, Southern California Edison offers public information and technical assistance to
  developers, homeowners, and apartment owners on energy conservation measures and programs.

Chapter II
LAND USE &
COMMUNITY DESIGN
2.1      INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element of the General Plan is often considered the “umbrella” element - encompassing the
issues and policies that are considered in greater detail in the other elements of the Plan. For example, land-
use policies have a direct bearing on the local street system described in the Circulation/Accessibility
Element. Housing issues and needs identified in the Housing Element are linked to land use policies and
implementation strategies. Furthermore, the impact of the Land Use Plan on public infrastructure and
services has a direct bearing on the fiscal analysis made a part of this General Plan update and on policies and
implementation strategies related to the provision of public facilities and services now and in years to come.
Even issues and policies related to safety, noise, and the natural environment are directly related to the
policies of this Element.
2.1A Purpose of the Element
The goals, policies and Land Use Policy Map contained in this Element serve as the framework for the rest
of the General Plan.
The policies of this Element reinforce the Vision Statement and the resultant Guiding Principles will set
the theme for South Pasadena’s growth for the next 15 years:
         •    Managed change
         •    Economic development/commercial revitalization
         •    Neighborhood protection
         •    Preservation/conservation of the “built” and “natural” environments
         •    Housing balance
         •    Quality in new development
         •    Reduced auto dependence/circulation without cars
         •    Fiscal and economic viability
         •    Regional coordination
By way of example, this Element directs incompatible higher-density growth away from single-family
neighborhoods, promotes the preservation and adaptive reuse of historic resources, identifies a number of
non-residential Focus Areas for specific policy direction, encourages a mixing of uses as a means of insuring
the continuing vitality of the City’s central district, fosters the development of compatible forms of infill, and
attempts to maintain a city-wide balance between single-family and multi-family housing. In addition, this
Element seeks to emphasize pedestrians over cars in portions of the City, by better defining “pedestrian-
oriented” and “auto-oriented” uses.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                              II-1
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

Most importantly, the Land Use Element provides the necessary direction to manage change, nurturing new
growth and economic opportunity while at the same time protecting and conserving existing uses and
resources.
2.1B Authorization and Scope
The Land Use Element, in accordance with California Government Code § 65302(a), establishes land-use
goals and policies, and supporting standards, for the various categories of land-use - public and private -
envisioned within the community: residential, commercial, professional office, business and light-industry,
institutional, civic and community facilities, open space and recreation.
The goals and policies of this Element are further interpreted in the form of a diagram, referred to as Land
Use Policy Map, which defines the general location and development intensity/density of these uses within
the City.
The expected level of development represented by the Plan is quantified, reflecting the building intensity and
population density standards for various areas and other territory set forth by the Plan.
Community design issues and policies, which invariably permeate the land-use decision process, have been
incorporated with the land-use discussion to create a combined Land Use/Community Design Element.
2.1C Relationship to Other Elements
There are particularly strong relationships between the Land Use Element and the Circulation/Accessibility
Element, inasmuch as the Land Use Element seeks to establish a development pattern and densities which
support the Circulation Element’s strategies for reducing auto dependence, and between the Land Use
Element and the Economic Development Element, from which the Land Use Element derives much of its
direction and to which it hopefully offers viable means to attain fiscal balance.
As required by State law, the Land Use Element must be consistent with all other elements of the City’s
General Plan, including the Housing Element adopted by the City in 1984.
 II-2                                                     CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                        LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

2.2        EXISTING CONDITIONS
2.2A Current Land Use
Land-use analysis in 1963 revealed South Pasadena to be a relatively mature and predominantly residential
community, with 47% of its land allocated to homes and apartments. With the exception of the Monterey
Hills, then about to be developed, most of the land area within the city was occupied.
Today, nearly 62% of South Pasadena’s acreage is devoted to residential uses of varying residential densities.
Approximately 3.87% or 86.6 acres of the nearly 2221 acres of the City is allocated to general commercial,
professional office, mixed-use, and auto sales uses, and 0.6% to light manufacturing. In contrast, 21.4% of
the total land in the City is used for circulation purposes. The remaining 12.9% of the land is distributed
among open space/parks, institutional uses, commercial-recreation, and flood control or is vacant. Of the
vacant land in the City outside of hillside areas, 90% is used for surface parking.
These percentages are materially unchanged from the last General Plan that was adopted in 1963.
Since South Pasadena is effectively a “built out” city, where nearly all sites are actively occupied but not
developed to zoning limits, new development and growth will largely involve the redevelopment of
underutilized parcels and the renovation of existing structures.
Table II-1 provides a statistical summary of land uses in South Pasadena.

2.2B Past Population and Estimated Past Projections
The population of South Pasadena registered 20,562 on April 1, 1962. The 1960 Federal Census reported
8,377 dwelling units and a population of 19,706 in the City. It was estimated in 1960 that by 1980 the
population of the City would increase to between 28,950 and 31,270, with the primary source of this growth
to result from the development of residential lots in the Altos de Monterey and increased development of
apartment units. The “Altos” Redevelopment Project alone was expected to add 1,900 new residents.
If the 1963 General Plan land-use proposals were to be developed to their full intensity, it was anticipated that
the population of South Pasadena would ultimately rise to between 42,000 and 46,000 persons at build-out,
when all sites are developed to the limit established by zoning. The “low projection” called for total dwelling
units on the order of 12,550, 48.4% of those to be single-family. Built-out population was estimated at 28,700
assuming 2.29 persons/unit. By mid-1990’s, none of these projections was realized.
2.2C Current Population, Projections and Demographics
South Pasadena’s total population as of January 1, 1994 was estimated at 24,400, according to the California
State Department of Finance. During the period of 1980 to 1990, the City’s population grew from 22, 681 to
23,936, an increase of only 1,255 over ten years. This represents average annual population growth of about
0.5 percent. In contrast, Los Angeles County population increased on average about 1.7 percent during the
same time period.
The 1990 Census and historic housing data reveal significant trends. The average household size in South
Pasadena has risen steadily in recent years, from 2.24 per household in 1980 to about 2.34 in 1993. Over the
same period, the non-white population share has increased from 17.5 percent to 30.2 percent, driven primarily
by growth among Asians and people with Spanish surnames. Household structure has changed also, with
increasing numbers of seniors. These trends indicate a diversification of South Pasadena’s population in
terms of housing requirements, ethnicity and living arrangements.
2.2D Housing
South Pasadena’s housing growth has been slow in recent years, as the City nears build-out, where all sites are
occupied but not developed to zoning limits. Between 1980 and 1990, South Pasadena added 370 housing
units. Of these units, about 58% were multi-family. Over the same period, the residential vacancy rate has
risen steadily, from 3.92% in 1980 to 4.64% in 1993. Going back to years prior to 1980, South Pasadena’s
housing mix has shifted gradually from single-family to multi-family. Single-family homes, although not
decreasing in number, have declined as a percentage of total units. In the 1963 General Plan, about 63% of
the City’ housing stock was single-family; currently, this figure is 50.6%. The increased pressure for multi-
family units is expected to continue as land values and the short supply of buildable land lead to densification
within the current zoning envelope. The serious shortage of affordable housing countywide is anticipated to
lead to increased demand for multi-family units.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                            II-7
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) projects the overall housing supply to increase
by an additional 873 (1993-2010) units by 2010, about 8% over the current number of units. Housing growth
in the Arroyo-Verdugo Subregion - consisting of Burbank, Glendale, La Canada Flintridge, Pasadena and
South Pasadena - is projected to increase by 13% by 2010, over twice the growth rate of South Pasadena prior
to 1980. SCAG projects an increase of about 32% in housing units during the same period in Los Angeles
County, and an increase of 45% for the six county regions. Managing these housing projections is a primary
goal of the General Plan.

2.2E Employment
Employment projections for the region and local area are extremely variable due to the restructuring of the
national economy. In addition, accurate information concerning local employment totals is not presently
available.
It is estimated that 1990 employment in South Pasadena totaled 8,755 jobs, based on the floor area of South
Pasadena structures available for non-residential use. South Pasadena will provide 9,324 jobs in 2010 (6.3%
growth), if non-residential development continues as projected in this Element. This may be contrasted to
the City of Pasadena, where 1990 employment totaled 95,170 jobs, expected to grow to 127,108 in 2010
(33.6% growth). SCAG estimates that there were 4,640,681 jobs in Los Angeles County in 1990. The SCAG
forecast for Los Angeles County employment in 2010 is 5,699,072 jobs (22.8% growth).

2.3       FUTURE CONDITIONS
2.3A Residential Land Use
Since residential land is virtually “built out” in South Pasadena, land use proposals primarily reflect a re-
categorization of developed land into appropriate density categories. Multi-family land use - the high-density
category - reflects a reduction in acreage, while single-family - low, estate and medium density - reflect slight
increases. The reduction in multi-family acreage is a result of reclassification of existing land uses according
to current development patterns and does not create non-conforming uses. The increase in the estate
category is the result of proper classification of large lot single-family homes that were formerly in the low-
density category. The slight decrease in overall residential acreage is due to various parcels in the downtown
area and Mission Street area that were reclassified to commercial uses.
Table II-3 shows existing and proposed residential land uses by acreage.

        Estate                 205.3                 14.9%                    214.8                 15.6%
  Altos de Monterey            236.3                 17.1%                    236.3                 17.2%

The impact of the proposed residential land use changes is projected to be minimal, since the primary purpose
is to preserve and reinforce existing residential patterns. Projected increases in dwelling units, as discussed
above, are the result of intensification on parcels that are currently developed below the allowable envelope in
response to housing demand and rising land values over the long term. Average density for residential
developments in the medium and high categories is projected to increase from about 17 units per gross acre
to about 21 units per gross acre by 2010.
Table II-4 summarizes the current and projected acreage, units and average density for single and multi-family
land uses.

2.3B Non-residential Land Use
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                     II-9
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

This section discusses the non-residential development currently in South Pasadena, and the potential for
increased non-residential development under the proposed General Plan. Four general types of non-
residential uses are analyzed:
     •   Commercial: Commercial development includes retail stores and commercial office uses.
         Commercial office uses include those that are suited for inclusion with retail uses, such as real estate
         offices, financial institutions, insurance and travel agencies.
     •   Professional Office: Professional office uses include legal offices, accounting, engineering and other
         professional services. This land use designation is intended to establish professional offices as the
         dominant use within the boundaries of the designation along with such appropriate residential and
         commercial uses as office support services, retail coffee, food, and restaurants. Professional office
         uses may also occur in commercial areas subject to appropriate zoning regulations.
     •   Manufacturing: Manufacturing-uses include light-industrial, business parks, research and
         development, and ancillary laboratory and office uses.
     •   Public and Community Facilities: Public, community facility uses and private institutions include
         the city hall, library, senior center, city yard, fire stations, parks/recreation buildings, schools and
         churches.
Table II-5 presents statistics on these land-use categories for existing land-uses in South Pasadena and for the
proposed general plan.

                                                             LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

•    Existing Non-Residential Uses
As shown in Table II-5, there are currently 101.5 acres of non-residential uses in South Pasadena, with 1.37
million square feet of floor space. This information is based on a computerized map analysis on a parcel-by-
parcel basis, including measurements of all building footprints and identification of multi-story buildings.
General commercial uses comprise 665.5 thousand square feet, followed by professional office uses at 333.1
thousand square feet. Manufacturing activities include 328.7 thousand square feet.
•    Proposed General Plan Land Uses
As Shown in Panel B of Table II-5, the proposed general plan would include 113.4 acres of non-residential
uses, slightly above the existing 101.5 acres. This acreage estimate assumes 11.2 acres of mixed use
development in both commercial and professional office uses.
A total of 2.12 million square feet of non-residential space could be accommodated under the new
commercial, professional office and light-industrial designations. The overall FAR for non-residential uses
under the proposed general plan is 0.43, as compared to 0.30 for existing development.
•    Potential Change in Non-Residential Uses
The potential change in non-residential uses is shown in Table IV-1 of the Economic Development and
Revitalization Element. In total, some 800 thousand square feet of development could be accommodated
through increased acreage and intensification. The most significant increase is shown in commercial use.
This increase would be consistent with economic development policies for increased employment and
diversity of employment. The increase in commercial development can be accommodated within existing
demand parameters for South Pasadena, as reflected in the development calculations within the Economic
Development Revitalization Element. Currently, the city captures about 60% of locally generated demand,
therefore, sufficient demand exists to provide viability for the increased commercial development
The decline in manufacturing space reflects the reconfiguration of manufacturing opportunities within the
Mission Street Specific Plan area and the shift in manufacturing emphasis toward research and development
and local crafts manufacturing activities in the Ostrich Farm Focus Area. Finally, the increase of 50.6
thousand square feet of public uses will provide opportunities for increased facilities to serve South Pasadena.

2.4      ISSUES
2.4A Managing Change
South Pasadena prides itself on its small town character. One of the guiding principles of this Plan is to
manage change within this context. Given the inevitability of growth and change, the City of South Pasadena
General Plan must provide the framework to ensure that both are managed to meet the needs and goals of
the community. With a comprehensive strategy, the adaptive reuse can be controlled and channeled to
provide maximum benefit to the City’s residents.
“Managed Change” shall be focused on areas where direction is needed and on considering the special needs
of various areas in the City:
         •   Stable Areas - little or no change is anticipated and changes should be managed to preserve the
             prevailing character of the area;
         •   Transition Areas - due to factors such as the mix of uses and market forces, intensification and
             changes in development may be occurring and will continue as permitted under the zoning code;
         •   Focus Areas - transition in land use and/or intensity and focus is encouraged in order to
             support the rehabilitation and revitalization of an area’s special character.
         •   Directed Development Areas - areas that have unique character and/or conditions that require
             special planning consideration, such as the Mission Street Specific Plan area.
As a “built-out” city, where all sites are occupied but not developed to zoning limits, the City’s strategy for
managing change shall involve six dimensions: type, amount, location, timing, design quality, and
benefit/cost implications. The strategy will define acceptable levels of growth, direct change to where it is
most needed or desired and can be accommodated and shape growth to optimize benefits.
2.4B Targeting Growth and Development: Intent and Direction
The Land Use Element targets higher density development into specific areas in order to protect residential
neighborhoods and to create synergistic mixed use environments oriented to transit and pedestrian activity.
This targeted development is intended to be of high quality and reflect the historic scale and character of
South Pasadena while ensuring the continued vitality of South Pasadena’s economy.
The potential for development in other parts of the City will be reduced through rezoning to enhance and to
encourage the status of the targeted development areas as the preferred location for growth.
Targeted development will not compromise the quality of life. The Land Use Element contains policies to
provide safe and well-designed public spaces, preserve the city’s heritage, ensure accessibility, and sustain the
natural environment.
2.4C Reinforcing Community Structure
 II-12                                                    CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                         LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

The small town character, the human scale, and “walkability” of South Pasadena must be reinforced by
policies of the Land Use Element.
Key components of this character are: a walkable “heart of the City” central business district, surrounding
and extending out from the intersections of Fair Oaks and Mission Street; the nearby Library and City Hall,
providing convenient centralized access to the City’s information resources and administrative functions; six
intimate tree-shaded parks, the city’s oldest -Library Park, Garfield Park, Eddy Park, Arroyo Park, Orange
Grove Park and Legion Park - located on or just off the Fair Oaks and Mission spines and within walking
distance of the downtown “crossroads”; the period brick commercial buildings of the Mission Street Historic
District, the original downtown, now adaptively reused as a specialty commercial zone; and a surrounding
fabric of well-kept residential architecture fronting tree-lined streets and sidewalks and harkening back to the
turn of the century.
A number of small commercial nodes, offering convenience goods within walking distance to the adjoining
neighborhood, are located about the community: Mission at Grand, Pasadena Avenue at Monterey,
Huntington at Fremont, Huntington at Fletcher.
Said to run counter to the historic “everything within walking distance” pattern, but adding economic vitality
to the City, are newer, larger scale, more auto-dependent retail nodes - nodes oriented to the auto by the
nature of goods sold there or the broader inter-community market served: on north Fair Oaks at the
Pasadena Freeway, on south Fair Oaks at Monterey Road, and on Huntington Drive at Garfield. Professional
office uses have begun to infill adjacent to or between these newer nodes and the more historic retail and civic
components of the City. Managed change must be targeted and scaled to reinforce this structure.
2.4D Reducing Auto Dependence
The principal mode of transportation for the past forty years in Southern California has been the automobile.
As our freeways and local roadways have reached capacity, and driver frustration has increased, there is now
an increasing demand for alternative modes of transportation, for rethinking how our energy, air quality, and
transportation goals will be met, and for how land-use decisions impact these goals.
Land-use planning began as an effort to prevent undesirable adjacencies while promoting those configurations
and adjacencies that seemed beneficial. Unfortunately, in the effort to separate incompatible uses, planning
often results in over-correction, creating too many land-use categories and separating them unnecessarily.
This segregation of land uses, has produced environments which are essentially pedestrian-unfriendly,
favoring supposed efficiency over quality of life. Certain kinds of commercial land uses i.e. drive through and
drive-in businesses are not compatible within the community. It is the intent of this Plan to restore the
concept of the mixed-use commercial/residential areas that marked our earlier beginnings, and to enhance the
walkability of the community, creating a distinction between pedestrian-oriented and auto-oriented uses.
Fair Oaks Avenue and Mission Street are and will continue as the City’s primary transportation corridors, but
the creation of activity nodes and increased density at select locations along these corridors can create the
ridership to support different types of transportation. The definitions of Focus Areas, defined by distinct
objectives and guidelines and implemented through the preparation of specific plans, defining precise land-use
patterns, zoning, setbacks, and design within defined boundaries, can do much to encourage transit-oriented
and pedestrian-oriented development. By such means, the Land Use/Community Design Element and the
Circulation/Accessibility Element take on a mutually supporting relationship.
2.4E Assuring Economic Vitality
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                              II-13
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

South Pasadena is a full-service city. As such, the City is especially proud of the qualities that make it unique.
Looking ahead to the next century, decision-makers will be faced with the necessity to continue a full range of
public services that they may find extremely difficult to finance. The City has in the past been reluctant to
charge residents for the full cost of services. However, the City will soon be faced with increasingly severe
reductions in federal and state assistance.
Business and industry have contributed much to the economic well being of South Pasadena over the past
100 years. Not only have commerce and manufacturing provided jobs and services to the population, they
have also contributed tax revenue required to provide health, safety and social services to citizens. Today,
increased competition between cities throughout the Los Angeles area has the potential to erode South
Pasadena’s market share, making it very important that South Pasadena follow a comprehensive economic
development plan. Efforts must be made to secure an appropriate share of the region’s investment.
Significant efforts are required not only to encourage new business, but also to retain existing companies.
Programs must address the negative impacts of fluctuating market conditions.
A strengthened economic base for the City of South Pasadena is essential. It can be segmented into the
following categories:
                  •    Employment Base
                  •    Retail Base
                  •    Cultural Attractions
                  •    Fiscal Viability
For more on these categories, see Chapter IV of this document.

2.5    GOALS & POLICIES
2.5A Managing Change
GOAL 1:          To manage change and target growth by type and location to better serve community
                 needs and enhance the quality of life.
Policies:
1.1:   Continuously monitor and define Focus Areas. Monitor change within the Focus Areas and
       continuously re-assess the objectives of each Focus Area by re-allocating resources when necessary.
1.2:   Encourage intensification within Focus Area boundaries. Direct higher-density development
       away from residential neighborhoods and into these targeted areas, creating an exciting interaction of
       economic, housing, cultural and entertainment opportunities.
1.3:   Encourage Mixed-Use. Authorize, encourage and facilitate “mixed-use” development within
       targeted areas, including horizontally or vertically-integrated housing, live-work spaces, professional
       office and retail commercial uses.
 1.4:  Encourage pedestrian-oriented development. Adopt specific plans, zoning designations and
       development standards for targeted areas appropriate to assure compatible scale and orientation of
       permitted and conditionally-permitted uses, effective site planning, building design, massing and
       signage, shared parking and the joint use of facilities, and an emphasis on transit and bicycle access.
1.5:   Promote inclusion of art and amenities. Encourage and require, where feasible, the incorporation
       of public art, gardens, light and water features, courtyards and passageways, and public plazas into the
       design of public improvements and private projects.
1.6:   Coordinate capital improvement. Coordinate new City capital improvements consistent with
       concentrated development in specified Focus Areas.
1.7:   Support managed change. Utilize means available to the City - including code enforcement,
       permit fee waiver, tax abatement, shared parking offsets, and offerings of expedited plan processing -
       to facilitate change as necessary.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                            II-15
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

2.5B Economic Development/Commercial Revitalization
GOAL 2:         To maintain the character of South Pasadena’s “main street” commercial areas,
                support the proprietary businesses of the city, avoid deterioration of commercial
                areas and the business tax base, and promote those forms of economic development
                that will provide additional jobs, services and opportunities to the city and its
                residents.
Policies:
2.1:   Limit the spread of non-residential development. Keep the downtown retail core and specialty
       and neighborhood commercial areas well-defined. Limit the spread of non-residential development
       outside presently established limits.
2.2:   Strengthen retail. Encourage retail and sales tax producing businesses to remain in, expand in, or
       come to South Pasadena to promote healthy retail areas.
2.3:   Ensure balance. Facilitate a broad mix of retail goods and services in South Pasadena.
2.4:   Encourage ground floor retail. Encourage sales generating uses.
2.5:   Intensify use in select locations. Concentrate higher density and mixed-use development adjacent
       to transit or transportation corridors.
2.6:   Establish controls. Adopt appropriate specific plans, zoning designations, development standards
       and code enforcement procedures to assure compatible scale and orientation of buildings, effective
       site planning, shared parking and the joint use of facilities, with an emphasis on transit and bicycle
       access.
2.7:   Facilitate revenue generating uses and development. Permit uses and structure zoning districts
       and development mechanisms that will generate revenue to the City. Encourage development that
       will produce continuing revenues to the City.
2.8:   Require new development to pay its own way. Ensure that new development pays its own way
       rather than burdens existing business and residents with increased costs for services and
       infrastructure needs.
2.9:   Consider the General Plan in the budget process.
2.10:  Promote fiscal health. Encourage a business climate that contributes to the City’s fiscal well-being.
2.11:  Minimize adverse impacts of commercial development on adjacent low-density residential
       neighborhoods.
2.5C Reduced Auto Dependence/Circulation Without Cars

GOAL 3:         To emphasize pedestrians over cars in portions of the city.
Policies:
3.1    Prohibit Drive-through Businesses. Maintain the prohibition of businesses that promote “drive-
       through” operations.
3.2:   Downscale the street where appropriate. Consider introducing medians and street trees to reduce
       the scale of the street where appropriate.
3.3:   Increase vehicular/pedestrian separation. Provide greater physical separation between vehicles
       and pedestrians, such as restricting and consolidating curbcuts and by narrowing the vehicular right-
       of-way with the addition of protected curbside parking bays. Add bollards to protect pedestrians at
       corners, additional street trees to enhance sense of visual separation, and add textured paving to
       demarcate improved crosswalks.
3.4:   Increase pedestrian amenities. Provide increased amenities such as street furniture, bike racks,
       planters, supplemental lighting, widened walks, and textured paving to encourage walking and
       bicycling.
3.5:   Promote Mobility. Promote mobility for those who do not drive, particularly seniors, youth and
       disabled.
3.6:   Encourage sidewalk interaction and “night-life”. Encourage sidewalk dining; promote uses
       which extend the life of downtown into the evening hours without infringing upon the adjacent
       residential fabric.
3.7:   Encourage neighborhood and pedestrian linkages. Encourage linkages between projects and
       between projects and the surrounding neighborhood by means of walkways.
3.8:   Discourage street closures. Discourage street closures which impede access to adjacent

GOAL 8:          To harmonize physical change to preserve South Pasadena’s historic character, scale,
                 and “small town atmosphere.”
Policies:
8.1:   Require contextual, compatible and responsible design. Encourage new development to
       respect South Pasadena’s heritage by requiring that it “respond to context” - the distinctiveness of the
       locality and region as well as the scale and special characteristics of the fabric of the site’s immediate
       surroundings; require that it be compatible with the traditions and character of the City, and minimize
       adverse impacts on the privacy and access to light and air of its neighbors.
8.2:   Maintain high quality design principles and guidelines. Urban design principles and design
       guidelines shall be maintained and regularly reviewed to address issues at both the Citywide and
       neighborhood level. Priority shall be given to the Focus Areas defined in this Plan.
8.3:   Assure architectural and site design excellence. Actively promote and publicly acknowledge
       architectural and site design excellence in new buildings, public and private outdoor spaces, and
       capital improvements, while at the same time discouraging poor quality development or incongruent
       development, e.g., “mini-malls”.
8.4:   Promote sensitivity to human values. Development should be encouraged to reflect concern for
       the well-being of all citizens - for residents, workers, visitors, neighbors and passersby - and improve
       the environment of the public. New development should be accommodating, inspiring, inviting and
       enduring and should embody the cultural values of the community.
8.5:   Increase public awareness of the City’s heritage. Promote a greater public awareness of the
       architectural, urban design and cultural heritage of the City.

2.5E Preservation of the “Built” Environment
GOAL 9:         To conserve and preserve the historic “built” environment of the city by identifying
                the architectural and cultural resources of the city, by encouraging their maintenance
                and/or adaptive reuse, and by developing guidelines for new and infill development
                assuring design compatibility.
Policies:
9.1:   Maintain and augment the historic resource inventory. Document, and evaluate the significance
       of individual historic and cultural resources and districts identified by the Citywide historic resource
       survey, and continue the City’s long-range program of conducting intensive surveys of historic
       neighborhoods.
9.2:   Promote Historic Districts and Landmark designations.
9.3:   Prepare preservation plan. Prepare a preservation plan that identifies strategies to protect or
       minimize negative impacts to historic resources, including provisions to deter demolition of
       historically, architecturally, or culturally significant structures.
9.4:   Encourage adaptive reuse. Encourage and promote the adaptive reuse of South Pasadena’s
       historic resources.

                South Pasadena’s established residential neighborhoods.
Policies:
10.1:  Prevent mansionization. Ensure that remodeling or infill development in established residential
       neighborhoods is harmonious in scale and building form with its context and that “mansionization”
       is both avoided and prevented.
10.2:  Limit subdivisions. Ensure that lot subdivisions are consistent with the prevailing size and
       character of lots in the immediate vicinity, and that the subdivision would not have a substantial
       adverse impact on adjacent residences.
10.3:  Prohibit development on unimproved streets. No development on unimproved streets will be
       approved until adequate infrastructure improvements can be in place to support the development.

       neighborhoods.
10.7:  Maintain the character of medium density neighborhoods. Encourage retention of existing
       structures when additional units are added in the Medium Density Residential designation.
10.8:  Develop zoning regulations for adaptive reuse. Review and amend zoning regulations and other
       development standards to ensure adaptive reuse.
10.9:  Protect hillsides. In recognition of the special character of the hillsides throughout the city,
       continue strict protections through city grading and hillside ordinances.
10.10: Minimize the adverse impacts of commercial development on adjacent low-density
       residential neighborhoods.
Housing Balance
GOAL 11:         To assure the retention and maintenance of existing inventories and to encourage the
                 creation of affordable housing throughout South Pasadena by providing land and
                 density opportunities.
Policies:
11.1:  Encourage Mixed-Use development. Encourage upper-floor residential and office uses as a
       permitted secondary use in commercial districts.
11.2:  Allow second units in specified locations. Revise conditions and boundaries defining the overlay
       district permitting construction of a detached second or “granny” housing unit on a designated
       single-family lot; establish architectural design standards for such a unit.
11.3:  Permit Artists Lofts as means to adaptive reuse. This is intended to facilitate the adaptive reuse
       of otherwise obsolete structures and to promote the growth of the arts in the community. The
       conversion of structures consistent with this Policy would be permitted or conditionally permitted,
       and defined more fully during the revision of the zoning code.
11.4:  Provide density bonus for affordable housing. Consider the development of residential units in
       excess of the General Plan limits if the units are ownership units affordable to low or moderate
       income households.

11.5:  Reclaim excess right-of-way properties. Seek City’s exclusive right-to-negotiate with CalTrans on
       excess Route 710 right-of-way for purposes of providing ownership of affordable housing or open
       space amenities.
11.6:  Require replacement housing as mitigation. Mitigate the loss of existing affordable housing units
       by requiring applicants for new projects to replace affordable housing demolished by construction or
       to pay “fees-in-lieu.”
City “Gateways” or Entries
GOAL 12:        To define and enhance the primary entryways into the city.
Policies:
12.1:  Maintain “gateway” embankment at Pasadena Freeway and Arroyo Drive Over-Pass. Assure
       proper planning, adequate maintenance and nighttime illumination of this most important and highly
       visible natural sign for the City.
12.2:  Create gateways for other entries. Amend the zoning ordinance as appropriate to establish
       requirements for gateway site dimensions, landscape design standards, site design standards, signs
       (including off-site signs for non-commercial purposes such as imparting visitor information, to be
       integrated into the on-site sign program approved for development), uses, development projects that
       would result in upgrading or creation of designated gateway sites, and other requirements as
       necessary.
12.3:  Seek broad participation in gateway maintenance. Work with appropriate State and County
       agencies, private organizations (such as the Chamber of Commerce), service clubs, and property
       owners to develop and maintain the city gateways identified in the Focus Areas.

19.1:  Regulate all hillside development. Closely monitor all hillside development, paying particular
       attention to properties exceeding five acres; require design review of all projects.
19.2:  Maintain and enhance zoning standards for hillside development. Create zoning standards
       which will control residential development in sensitive areas; compute hillside densities using “net”
       rather than total acreage. For purpose of this general plan, “net” density refers to that land remaining
       for development after all development constraints, extreme slopes, significant ecological areas, and
       hazards have been deducted from total acreage. For the purpose of this policy, “constraints” shall be
       defined to include:
       •    Significant topographic, geographic, geologic and hydrologic features such as ridgelines, knolls,
            fault lines, liquefaction zones, and other similar features determined by the Community
            Development Department to be important to the physical and environmental character of the
            property.
       •    Significant environmental areas and features of the site including but not limited to riparian
            habitat, significant ecological areas, slopes exceeding 30%, fault zones including Alquist-Priolo
            Special Studies Zones; drip lines of significant and heritage trees as defined by City ordinance.
       •    Fuel modification zones required by City ordinance.
       •    Subsurface or surface utility easements and right-of-way not held by the responsible agency to be
            suitable for construction of residential structure.
19.3:  Augment existing grading standards. Maintain hillside development standards that eliminate the
       negative visual effects of grading, require the preservation of unique natural features, and encourage a
       range of architectural and site planning responses.
19.4:  Require adequate mitigation on all projects. Ensure that all hillside development blends with its
       surroundings by reducing building heights and massing, and by incorporating natural materials and
       native landscaping into project designs.
19.5:  Discourage over-development. Discourage over-development and prohibit oversized projects on
       large parcels of unimproved and/open space on hillsides.

       areas in order to create views.
19.8:  Establish slope/density restrictions. Establish clear slope/density restrictions to implement plan
       objectives; effectuate standards by ordinance.
19.9:  Prohibit grading of slopes in excess of 30%.
GOAL 20:        To ensure that the development of hillside areas in adjacent Los Angeles is
                compatible with that in South Pasadena and has adequate utilities and public
                services.
Policies:
20.1:  Establish a natural buffer between communities. Establish a natural buffer zone between the
       two communities if feasible.
20.2:  Promote General Plan compatibility. Work with the City of Los Angeles to ensure that land-use
       proposals within its hillside sphere are consistent with or compatible with the policies of this General
       Plan.
20.3:  Encourage annexation for service extensions. Encourage annexations as a condition of the
       extension of City utilities and public services.

  2.6       STRATEGIES
  2.6A The Land Use Policy Map
  The goals and policies of this Chapter have been interpreted, given physical dimensions, and composited
  graphically in the form of the Land Use Policy Map (see pg. II-35), the primary geographic reference tool
  intended to guide the General Plan’s implementation. Many goals and policies in other chapters are reflected
  on the Map, in that the map directly or indirectly supports their goals.
  Table II-6 is a statistical representation of each land use category both existing and proposed. Table
  II-9 shows how each of the proposed land use categories corresponds to established zoning districts.
  The Land Use Policy Map is divided into several categories of land-use. These categories include residential,
  commercial, professional office, business park/research & development and light manufacturing, institutional
  and community facilities, and open space. The boundaries of the Focus Areas are identified: ultimately
  specific plans may determine more precise land-use patterns, building intensities, pedestrian circulation and
  other defining details within these Focus Area boundaries.
                                                                    Table II-6

  Land Use Designations used in the Land Use Policy Map:
•   Altos de Monterey Residential (1 unit per lot)
  CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                      II-31
  LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

Single-family units may be built only at one unit per lot in the Altos de Monterey Residential category, per recorded
Tract Map 25588. This area is also governed by the Altos de Monterey Overlay Zone in the zoning ordinance.
•    Estate and Very-Low Density Residential (1-3.5 units per acre)
Single-family units may be built to a density of 3.5 dwelling units per acre (one acre is equal to 43,560 square feet) in
the “estate” and “very-low residential” category. For properties so designated situated in hillside settings, clustering of
units is anticipated and encouraged. Population density for this category could range from zero to ten persons per
acre, assuming an average household size of 2.8.
In portions of the city, due to environmental constraints (steep slopes, problem geology and soils, significant stands of
trees, potential fire hazard or limited access), some areas in this category may not be developable. All developments in
the category must first undergo a detailed constraints analysis prepared by the project applicant to determine the
extent of the development that would be feasible. On substandard lots, the density range may be exceeded under a
conditional use permit, provided that the lot was legally created.
Residential densities in hillside areas shall be computed on the basis of “net” rather than “gross” density. For
purposes of this General Plan, “net” density refers to that land remaining for development after all development
constraints, significant ecological areas, and hazards have been reduced from total acreage.
•    Low Density Residential (3.5-6 units per acre)
This category will permit detached single-family units at a density of 3.5 - 6 units per acre. This is South Pasadena’s
prototypical land use and density, reflective of the standard lot of the city’s subdivisions, 50’x150’. Population density
for this category could range from 10-17 persons per acre, assuming an average household size of 2.8. (See Figure II-
4, Land Use Policy Map) This designation has been applied to the majority of existing single-family neighborhoods to
protect and maintain their character and to prevent encroachment of higher density development.
•    Medium Density Residential (6-14 units per acre)
The medium density residential category allows for the development of duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes and other
attached dwellings at a density of 6-14 units per acre, not exceeding two stories, or in combination with single-family
dwellings as “bungalow courts”. This designation invites flexibility in site design and unit type. Population density for
the designation could range from 16 to 36 persons per acre, assuming an average household size of 2.6. The medium
density residential land use category is intended to maintain the character of medium density neighborhoods and to
encourage maintenance of existing structures when additional units are added to the medium density residential
designation.
•    High Density Residential - (14-24 Units per acre)
This multiple-family residential category is intended primarily for 14-24 units per acre on the same site that may be in
the same building or in separate buildings. Courtyard housing, townhouses and apartments are examples.
Population density for this designation could range to 54 persons per acre, assuming an average household size of 2.2.
•    General Commercial
    II-32                                                     CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                           LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

This category incorporates all commercial land uses within the City. General Commercial provides for a variety of
retail, service, office, automotive establishments, entertainment facilities, convenience goods and services to residents
in the immediate neighborhood, and parking facilities. In addition, this category includes “convenience” commercial
uses that provide retail goods and services to residents in the immediate neighborhood. Detailed development
regulations and guidelines for focus areas identified in the underlying General Commercial land use designation may
be addressed in the future through land use planning tools including specific plans and overlay zones.
•    Professional Office
This designation includes primarily general business offices and professional offices including legal, accounting,
engineering, and other professional offices. This designation is intended to establish professional offices as the
dominant use within the boundaries of the designation along with such appropriate residential and commercial uses as
office support services, retail coffee, food, and restaurants. Professional Office uses may also occur in commercial
areas subject to appropriate zoning regulations. Professional Office uses may also occur in combination with the
medium and high density residential designations, subject to conditional use permit approval, and/or as second floor
uses in all commercial areas.
•    Business Park/Research & Development and Light Manufacturing
Retail and service commercial, professional office, research and light-industrial uses in combination are allowed on
property with this land use designation. Well-designed, master-planned, campus-type developments for employers
who will contribute significantly to the City’s objective of increasing employment densities is the intent.
The designation seeks to emphasize business park or corporate headquarters office space, often with supporting
amenities, either with or in lieu of light manufacturing uses, in a garden or campus-like setting, distinct from the
office-above-retail mixed use of the Fair Oaks Corridor or Mission Street Specific Plan Area. The availability of
superior access and a stronger automobile orientation is an additional determinant for application of this use
designation.
Public improvements would enhance the development potential of any such area to include desirable support retail
and restaurant space, health clubs, daycare centers and a host of other uses. An automobile orientation is also
expected because of locational advantages.

  LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

•     Community Facilities
This type of land-use includes institutional, academic, governmental and community service uses. Such
buildings as the Library/Community Room/Senior Center, the Historical Museum, the City Hall, Police and

Fire Stations, private and parochial schools, churches, the War Memorial Building, Eddy House as well as
public utility substations and the City yard all represent this land use.
The designation also includes hospitals, convalescent hospitals, and nursing homes, which are effectively
permitted under any land use designation subject to a conditional use permit. If any of these special facilities
undergoes additional development or a change in use, a master plan must be prepared and approved by the
City.
•   Open Space
The open space category includes city parks and playgrounds, commercial recreation, natural open space,
recreational trails and linkages, utility easements and flood control channels.
•   Mission Street Specific Plan
The Mission Street Specific Plan Area includes the Mission Street right-of-way from Pasadena Avenue to Fair
Oaks Avenue. The Plan was developed to address the impacts of the proposed Blue Line station on Mission
Street and to implement the community vision of Mission Street as south Pasadena’s pedestrian-oriented,
historic shopping street. The Plan includes detailed regulatory mechanisms tailored to the particular needs of
the Mission Street area.
Specific Sites Noted on the Map:
•   Blue Line Station
The proposed station site for the regional “Blue Line” light rail transitway along the former Santa Fe rail right-
of-way and related facilities are included in this category.

Other Areas, Sites, and Uses Noted in the General Plan:
•     Focus Area
The boundaries of the Focus Areas for which more detailed objectives and guidelines have been established
by this Element have been identified. The Focus Area use designations define development potential that is
more specific in intent than the underlying land use designations. The intent is to provide insight on how the
underlying use should be interpreted when actual development proposals are being considered. Focus Areas
are numbered, as follows:
           1. Huntington-Garfield 4. Raymond Hill
           2. Fair Oaks-Huntington           5. Fremont Corridor
           3. Fair Oaks Corridor             6. Mission St. Specific Plan

              b. Upper Fair Oaks             8. Arroyo Annexation
              c. Lower Fair Oaks
•     Historic Districts and Landmarks (See Historic Preservation Element, Chapter V)
Formally designated historic landmarks and adopted historic districts are depicted.
•     City Gateways
Important entries into South Pasadena are identified. It is intended that extraordinary treatment of these
gateways (e.g. through streetscape, signs, lighting, building setbacks and massing) will impart a sense of entry
into the city.
•     Proposed Freeway Corridor
The right-of-way of the proposed Route 710 Freeway Corridor is depicted on the circulation component of
the Circulation Element, due to a court order, C#57393. The City opposes this freeway extension.
•     Bed and Breakfast
Bed and Breakfast type lodging is a permissible use in areas so designated, subject to the conditional use
permit process.
•     Second Unit - “Granny Flat”
Second units or “granny flats” may be permitted in certain residential areas of the City as appropriate pursuant
to the conditional use permit process.

•    Artist Loft - A Land-Use Option
This is intended to facilitate the adaptive reuse of otherwise obsolete structures and to promote the growth of
the arts in the community. Older commercial and industrial buildings located on properties with non-
residential land use designations may be wholly or partially converted into combined studio/workshop and
living quarters for artists, artisans and crafts person engaged in activities commonly considered artistic in
nature. This Policy will be applied equally to new construction. The residential aspect of this use will be
allowed only in combination with individual studio or workshop space of the residents and is intended to
provide an integrated working/living environment. Other uses, such as galleries, antique dealers, restaurants
and the like, may be incorporated as deemed appropriate. The conversion of structures consistent with this
Policy will be permitted or conditionally permitted, and defined more fully during the revision of the zoning
code.
2.6B Development Potential
Since residential land is virtually all built out in South Pasadena, land use proposals primarily reflect a re-
categorization of developed land into appropriate density categories. Multi-family land uses - the high and
medium categories - reflect a reduction in acreage, while single family uses - low and estate and medium
densities reflect slight increases. The reduction in multi-family acreage is a result of reclassification of existing
land uses according to current development patterns and does not create non-conforming uses. The increase
in the estate category is the result of proper classification of large lot single-family homes that were formerly
in the low-density category. The slight decrease in overall residential acreage is due to various parcels in the
downtown area that were reclassified to commercial uses.
Table II-7 shows existing and proposed residential land uses by acreage.

The impact of the proposed residential land use changes is projected to be minimal, since the primary purpose
is to preserve and reinforce existing residential patterns. Projected increases in dwelling units, as discussed
above, are the result of intensification on parcels that are currently developed below the allowable envelope in
response to housing demand and rising land values over the long term. Average density for residential
developments in the medium and high categories is projected to increase from about 17 units per gross acre
to about 21 units per gross acre by 2010.

2.7      SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS
2.7A Focus Areas Defined
South Pasadena is a city with few vacant sites available for development. Since many sites are developed to
the capacity of current zoning standards, redevelopment, adaptive re-use and new development are, however,
essential to economic vitality.
South Pasadena can absorb growth and still remain a healthy and vibrant community if this growth is
managed and is directed to areas that can best accommodate it. The key is concentration - within the Central
Business District and at strategic points of arterial or transit connection - to create vibrant, pedestrian-
oriented activity nodes and corridors.
Targeting the type and location of new growth facilitates the enhancement of those areas of the City in need
of improvement to add jobs and housing without increasing traffic or intruding on the neighborhood quality
of life.
The following eight Focus Areas have been identified for special attention, and are listed below. The Focus
Area designation is intended to define development potential which is more specific in intent than the
underlying land use designations. The intent is to provide insight on how the underlying use should be
interpreted when actual development proposals are being considered. (For development of Focus Areas,
refer to Chapter IV.)
         1. Huntington-Garfield 4. Raymond Hill
         2. Fair Oaks-Huntington             5. Fremont Corridor
         3. Fair Oaks Corridor 6. Mission St. Specific Plan Area
              a. Central District            7. Ostrich Farm
              b. Upper Fair Oaks             8. Arroyo Annexation
              c. Lower Fair Oaks
The Land Use Element outlines the objectives for each Focus Area and provides direction on the mix of land
uses to be encouraged. Guidelines may call for multi-use or mixed-use, residential intensification, theme
implementation, greater intensity or increased flexibility in use as appropriate to each situation. Linkages to
transit and the fostering of pedestrian activity by clustering mixed-use projects are emphasized. Ultimately,
specific plans may determine precise land-use patterns, zoning standards and design guidelines within each
areas defined boundaries.

2.7B Objectives and Guidelines
Specific objectives and guidelines for achieving the intended character of each Focus Area have been
developed to respond to unique attributes and conditions and emphasize their maintenance or managed
transition to a pedestrian-oriented or auto-oriented environment. These objectives and guidelines are
intended to support the overall goals and policy statements found within the General Plan. Additionally,
these identified focused areas may be the precursor of future specific plans, thus the unique layer of guidelines
and objectives may also serve as the framework for the development for those future specific plans.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                             II-41
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
Individual Focus Areas and their objectives and guidelines follow:
1.       Huntington - Garfield
This Focus Area, presently developed with only a large supermarket, offers significant opportunity for the
intensification of commercial uses as a “hub” to serve San Marino and Alhambra as well as South Pasadena.
Highly accessible by virtue of its location at the important cross-roads of Huntington Drive, Garfield and
Atlantic but at the edge of the City, it has the potential to attract retail dollars to South Pasadena from
surrounding communities with minimal traffic impacts. Excellent visibility is another strong point.
OBJECTIVE 1.1:            OPTIMIZE USE OF LARGE COMMERCIAL PARCELS.
     Guideline 1.1:       Prevent parcel fragmentation. Discourage the division of assembled parcels and
                          fragmentation of use. Encourage smaller users to locate in Central District or along
                          Mission Street.
OBJECTIVE 1.2:            FOCUS LAND USE TO INCREASE SALES TAX REVENUE.
     Guideline 1.2:       Intensify commercial use. Intensify use with additional commercial offerings to
                          increase sales tax revenue.
     Guideline 1.3:       Restrict professional office uses. De-emphasize professional office uses,
                          redirecting them to the City’s primary office districts.
     Guideline 1.4:       Seek Complementary uses. Seek a complementary mixture of secondary or
                          support uses to encourage “one-stop” shopping.
     Guideline 1.5:       Maintain “auto-orientation”. Maintain the existing auto-orientation of the area,
                          taking advantage of the adjacency of three major arterial roads.

OBJECTIVE 1.3      ENHANCE “GATEWAY” IDENTITY AND IMAGE.
   Guideline 1.6:  Visually strengthen this important City entry. Encourage the involvement and
                   participation of abutting property owners in design and implementation of public
                   and private sector improvements within and adjacent to the Huntington, Garfield
                   and Atlantic Boulevard rights-of-way to enhance and effectively demarcate this
                   important entrance to the City.
   Guideline 1.7:  Define a desired architectural image. Establish individual project design
                   performance standards compatible with gateway location.
OBJECTIVE 1.4      ENCOURAGE PARKING EFFICIENCY.
   Guideline 1.8:  Encourage parking. Provide incentives to promote parking to add to shopping
                   convenience and to enhance compaction; design parking access so as not to interfere
                   with pedestrian activity.
   Guideline 1.9:  Mitigate visual impacts of parking. Consider fragmenting large expanses of at-
                   grade parking, screen views, and suppress parking wherever possible.
   Guideline 1.10: Encourage shared parking.

2.       Fair Oaks - Huntington
This Focus Area - 3.3 acres on the north side of Huntington Drive, 4.4 acres on the south side - serves as the
visual anchor to Fair Oaks. Split by major traffic arteries - Fair Oaks, Huntington and Fremont - the area
nonetheless has the potential for being more pedestrian-friendly while remaining auto-oriented. A vertical
and horizontal mixing of uses, including both neighborhood retail and community-level retail in combination
with professional office and residential, is to be encouraged.
OBJECTIVE 1.1             CREATE A COHESIVE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.
     Guideline 1.1:       Encourage “Neighborhood” orientation. Encourage more uses that serve
                          neighborhood needs (e.g., local grocery); permit traditionally “auto-oriented” uses if
                          able to conform to “pedestrian-friendly” design criteria of the neighborhood.
     Guideline 1.2:       Seek Complementary uses. Seek a complementary mixture of land uses so that
                          parking may be shared.
     Guideline 1.3:       Encourage parking with adequate access. Encourage parking to add to
                          shopping convenience and to maintain compaction; design parking access so as not
                          to interfere with pedestrian activity.
     Guideline 1.4:       Develop a unified visual image. Develop a unified visual image for the area by
                          establishing design guidelines and development standard. A specific plan is
                          recommended. Encourage projects sensitive to this image.
OBJECTIVE 1.2             FOSTER A PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT.
     Guideline 1.5        Develop and maintain design standards. Maintain “zero-setbacks” except to
                          accommodate outdoor dining, sidewalk-level plazas, or architectural affects;
                          encourage ground-floor retail with a majority of display windows and at least one
                          entrance along the streets; foster attention to building scale and detail through the
                          Design Review process.
     Guideline 1.6:       Establish design incentives. Establish design incentives (e.g., increased FAR,
                          exceptions to height limitations for special architectural features, etc.) so that
                          buildings surrounding the intersection increasingly contribute to create a cohesive
                          whole and adequately denote this important visual terminus of Fair Oaks.
     Guideline 1.7:       Encourage neighborhood and pedestrian linkages. Encourage linkages
                          between projects and between projects and the surrounding neighborhood by means
                          of walkways.

3.       The Fair Oaks Corridor
This Focus Area is actually comprised of three inter-related subareas, including the “heart” of the City, the
Central District and two adjacent activity areas, Upper Fair Oaks and Lower Fair Oaks.
Though heavily impacted by traffic, its existing historic storefronts, zero setbacks, smaller-scale retail uses,
and physical site constraints combine to encourage the strengthening of the Central District as a “pedestrian-
oriented” environment. The comparative ease of access and larger development parcels of the two adjacent
sub areas argue for their accommodation of more auto-oriented characteristics. As the Central District
undergoes revitalization, the adaptive re-use and selective transition of uses essential to a pedestrian-oriented
environment within the general core area may expand into the two peripheral subareas. The integration of the
three components into the larger Fair Oaks Corridor is the key to the ultimate vitality of this Focus Area.
a.       The Central District
This Focus Area is defined by Hope Street to the north, Monterey Road to the south, Brent Street to the east,
and Mound Avenue to the west. Possibly the most land-use and design-sensitive of all the Focus Areas, the
Central District offers the key to commercial revitalization in the City.
Revitalization, adaptive re-use, and new development should capitalize on the historic architectural fabric of
commercial shops and storefronts fronting both Mission and Fair Oaks, and the Rialto Theater, a national
register and locally designated historic landmark. Retention of the historic street walls, the nurturing of
entertainment-oriented retail commercial offerings to complement the Rialto, the replacement of surface
parking with structured parking to improve compaction, and the addition of office and residential above
ground-floor retail are paramount objectives.
The CRA-Block, a formally-adopted redevelopment project area provides acreage of largely interior parcels
presently used for parking, housing, offices, and nursery offers a unique opportunity for infill and design
innovation with minimal disruption to established uses.
OBJECTIVE 1.1              NURTURE ESTABLISHED CHARACTER OF DISTRICT
     Guideline 1.1:        Maintain small town character and scale. Maintain the human-centered,
                           walkable-scale of the downtown, defined by the street-wall, the existing uses, and the
                           building forms. Require contextual sensitivity and consistency of setback with
                           historic fabric. Utilize Design Review to manage change.
     Guideline 1.2:        Encourage community-commercial orientation. Reinforce the established
                           community orientation of downtown retail and service uses. At the same time,
                           allow limited infill of complementary neighborhood-oriented small commercial
                           enterprises.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                              II-45
LAND USE & COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT

OBJECTIVE 1.2       INCREASE LEVEL OF PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY.
     Guideline 1.3: Encourage ground-floor convenience uses. Encourage ground-floors of all
                    structures to accommodate retail and service commercial, restaurant and
                    entertainment uses. (See also Policy 2.4, pg. II-16)
     Guideline 1.4: Add mixed-use upper stories. Foster vertically mixed-use to develop synergism
                    and increased activity, specifically second floor offices and inclusion of housing
                    above retail (alternatively at rear of courtyard uses).
     Guideline 1.5: Encourage Increased Density. Consider building height limitations, lot coverage,
                    shared parking, and structured parking, generally allowing two levels of housing
                    and/or office-use above retail on buildings fronting Fair Oaks; two stories on
                    building fronting on Mission Street (office or housing to occupy upper floor), and
                    three stories on buildings on interior parcels including above, at-grade, and sub-
                    grade parking.
     Guideline 1.6: Encourage retrofitting. Encourage retrofitting of existing frontages that are non-
                    conforming with respect to display windows and sidewalk entrances.
OBJECTIVE 1.3       PRESERVE HISTORIC BUILDING FABRIC AND STRENGTHEN
                    “STREET-WALL”
     Guideline 1.7: Maintain the street wall. Maintain the historic street wall on Fair Oaks and
                    Mission to the fullest degree possible, requiring zero-setbacks except to
                    accommodate outdoor dining, sidewalk-level plazas, or architectural effects;
                    encourage infill between buildings and in existing setback areas to promote
                    continuity of storefronts.
     Guideline 1.8: Concentrate on preservation and adaptive re-use of structures. Focus
                    intensification on less developed portions of Focus Area. Maintain the historic
                    street wall. Preserve, rehabilitate and adaptively reuse historic commercial structures
                    on The Historic Resources Survey: Inventory of Addresses; encourage restoration of
                    historic storefronts. (Refer also to Policy 4.2, pg. V-11)
     Guideline 1.9: Encourage or assist in rehabilitation. Encourage or assist in the rehabilitation of
                    non-historic storefronts to be compatible with the historic fabric of the district.

OBJECTIVE 1.4      PROMOTE OR “SEED” ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION.
   Guideline 1.10: Encourage creation of a new block, internally focused, and linked to existing
                   perimeter of storefronts. Concentrate intensification on under-developed interior
                   portions of Focus Area, capitalizing on the already-established redevelopment
                   project area.
   Guideline 1.11: Promote new entertainment-oriented commercial. Encourage development of
                   new entertainment-oriented ground-floor retail and restaurant uses complementary
                   to the Rialto Theater on interior CRA-Block parcels while maintaining ring of
                   established commercial uses; consider large Von’s parcel south of Oxley as
                   secondary, lower-priority site for such uses.
   Guideline 1.12: Generate new revenue and improve parking. Foster new economic activity and
                   an additional source of revenue for City, at the same time providing development
                   with incentive to provide additional parking.
   Guideline 1.13: Explore marketing and management strategies. Explore new marketing and
                   management strategies for the district.
OBJECTIVE 1.5      FURTHER DEFINE “DISTRICT” DESIGN OBJECTIVES.
   Guideline 1.14: Adopt district design guidelines. Adopt district design guidelines encouraging
                   architectural quality and compatibility with the pedestrian concept: i.e., ground-
                   floor retail to have a majority of display windows and at least one entrance along the
                   street. Consider a specific plan as a vehicle.
   Guideline 1.15: Provide incentives. Establish incentives (i.e., exceptions to height limitations for
                   special architectural features, reduced parking requirements, expedited permits, etc.)
                   to encourage rehabilitation and infill development. Publicize new construction and
                   retrofitted projects sensitive to this desired image.
OBJECTIVE 1.6      ENHANCE AVAILABILITY OF PARKING.
   Guideline 1.16: Improve parking management. Promote greater efficiency in existing parking
                   arrangements and management.
   Guideline 1.17: Provide additional parking and access. Provide incentives to create parking to

b.       Upper Fair Oaks
The Upper Fair Oaks subarea of the Fair Oaks Corridor encompasses properties on both sides of Fair Oaks
between Mound and Brent, south of the Pasadena Freeway to Hope Street. Presently established uses include
largely auto-oriented specialty commercial and fast food as well as professional offices. Though auto-oriented
now, this subarea represents an opportunity over the longer term to expand the pedestrian-friendly core-uses
and character of the Central District.
OBJECTIVE 1.1             CONTAIN COMMERCIAL GROWTH SO AS NOT TO WEAKEN
                          EFFORTS TO INCREASE DENSITY IN CENTRAL DISTRICT
     Guideline 1.1:       Establish priorities for Fair Oaks Corridor. Encourage intensification first in
                          Central District, then in Upper Fair Oaks subarea and finally in Lower Fair Oaks
                          subarea.
     Guideline 1.2:       Limit new development to two-stories. Limit new development to two stories
                          until the Central District reaches an overall FAR of 1.0, then apply objectives and
                          guidelines similar to those of Central District.
     Guideline 1.3:       Allow mixed-use. Encourage the integration of presently established auto-oriented
                          uses with pedestrian-friendly ground-floor commercial (any retail/restaurant) and
                          second-floor commercial or office, fronting Fair Oaks at this gateway to the City.
     Guideline 1.4:       Promote shared parking. Develop shared parking and landscaped parking
                          concepts responsive to development strategy.
 OBJECTIVE 1.2            RE-ESTABLISH THE “STREET-WALL”.
     Guideline 1.5:       Promote design guidelines. Encourage restoration of the historic street-wall on
                          Fair Oaks to the fullest degree possible, requiring zero-setbacks except to
                          accommodate outdoor dining, sidewalk-level plazas, or architectural effects. Foster
                          infill between buildings and in existing setback areas to promote continuity of
                          storefronts. Encourage features such as display windows and sidewalk entrances.
     Guideline 1.6:       Provide transition to surrounding land-use. Provide adequate scale transitions
                          and amenity buffers to adjacent development. Second-story setbacks and varied
                          land setback rules shall be incorporated in development proposals where
                          appropriate.
     Guideline 1.7:       Encourage retrofitting. Encourage retrofitting of existing frontages which
                          are non-conforming with respect to display windows and sidewalk entrances.
     Guideline 1.8:       Improve pedestrian access. Require markets and retail to have a majority of
                          display windows and at least one pedestrian-friendly entrance along Fair Oaks
                          Avenue, or to put other sidewalk retail in front of such uses.

c.        Lower Fair Oaks
The Lower Fair Oaks sub-area of the Fair Oaks Corridor is defined by Monterey Road to the north and
Rollin Street to the south. The area could be said to serve as the southerly gateway or portal to the City’s
Central District. Its accessibility to a significant portion of the residential fabric is relatively unmatched, as is
its ease of vehicular access. It also contains one of the largest single-ownership parcels in the City and abuts
another, totaling nearly eleven acres combined, and presently the location of two community-level
supermarkets.
Presently south of Monterey Road on the east-side of Fair Oaks are automobile sales and a significant cluster
of professional office uses. South of the Pavilion’s parcel on the west-side are more professional offices and a
spot of mixed community and neighborhood-level commercial (bank, restaurant, other service commercial).
Due to the size of assembled land parcels and ease of access, future use of the major corner sites should be
devoted to maintaining auto-oriented commercial uses with significant space requirements. Additional
clustered professional office development in a garden-setting should be encouraged to locate further north
along Fair Oaks in the Central District proper.
OBJECTIVE 1.1:             CONTAIN COMMERCIAL GROWTH SO AS NOT TO WEAKEN
                           EFFORTS TO INCREASE DENSITY IN CENTRAL DISTRICT.

     Guideline 1.2:        Promote compatible parking solutions. Encourage the development of
                           alternative types of parking rather than structured parking.
     Guideline 1.3:        Encourage additional large single-tenant office uses only. Consider only the
                           addition of new large single-tenant professional office uses. Encourage location of
                           smaller professional office users in Central District to support retail and restaurants.
     Guideline 1.4:        Apply goals and policies. Apply the Central Fair Oaks’ goals and policies to
                           Lower Fair Oaks when Upper Fair Oaks reaches an overall FAR of 1.0.
     Guideline 1.5:        Require zero setbacks. Require zero setbacks except for gas stations and for
                           significant architectural effects (as determined by Design Review)
     Guideline 1.6:        Promote design guidelines. Promote design guidelines to maintain a high quality
                           of architectural environment including minimum areas for display windows and
                           frequency of sidewalk entrances.
     Guideline 1.7:        Prohibit curb cuts. Prohibit curb cuts along Fair Oaks Avenue where alternative

4.       Raymond Hill
This predominantly multi-family residential enclave, developed in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s and located
atop one of the highest hills in the City, has warning signals of potential early decline. Bordered on the west
by Fair Oaks Avenue, on the south and east by the Pasadena Freeway, and on the north by an unimproved
State Street and the Pasadena municipal power plant, the area is both blessed and cursed by proximity to
regional thoroughfares and limited access. Tremendous views, some of the highest residential densities in the
city, sub-standard parking, and a lack of design character typify the neighborhood. At the base of the hill
fronting Fair Oaks is a mixture of auto-oriented and neighborhood-focused commercial enterprises.
OBJECTIVE 1.1             STRENGTHEN IMAGE AND IDENTITY.
     Guideline 1.1:       Define this important “gateway” to the City. Define a coordinated package of
                          public and private sector improvements within and adjacent to the right-of-way of
                          Fair Oaks to enhance and effectively demarcate this important entrance to the City.
                          Encourage the involvement and participation of abutting property owners in design
                          and implementation.
     Guideline 1.2:       Develop “hill-town” design standards. Study the unique existing characteristics
                          on the hill and develop vision for future development, possibly hill-town design
                          standards.
OBJECTIVE 1.2             ENHANCE WALKABILITY AND ACCESS.
     Guideline 1.3:       Improve pedestrian linkages. Encourage the inclusion of dramatic pedestrian
                          linkages (Spanish steps, water features, etc.) from the lower commercial areas to a
                          publicly-accessible hilltop space or use, in order to permit community-wide
                          appreciation of the exceptional views.
OBJECTIVE 1.3             ASSURE ACCESSIBLE AND VIABLE RETAIL SERVICES.
     Guideline 1.4:       Foster a strong, visible neighborhood focus. Encourage revitalized mixed-use
                          development at the neighborhood’s southwestern edge with strong identity, a
                          defining design theme, at least one community-level commercial anchor, and
                          improved accessibility to the adjacent residential neighborhood.
     Guideline 1.5:       Maintain “auto-orientation” of retail. Maintain the auto-orientation of existing
                          retail while encouraging increased project design amenities and neighborhood
                          access.

5.       Fremont Corridor
This Focus Area is defined by a mixture of residential and small-scale professional office uses lining the busy
and heavily traveled section of Fremont Avenue from Monterey Road north to the Pasadena Freeway.
Although impacted by traffic and noise, the primary land use is now and is intended to remain residential.
Small-scale professional offices have infiltrated the predominantly residential building fabric, either through
adaptive reuse of structures or new construction, and should continue to be allowed to locate in the area. The
transition in use reflects a trend already underway and provides a graduation to the scale and uses at the
northern end of the Fair Oaks Corridor.
Maintenance of the existing fabric of historic structures, their adaptive reuse, and possible infill with relocated
“structures-of-merit” is to be emphasized over demolition and new building. Continued residential use is not
precluded.
OBJECTIVE 1.1               ENCOURAGE NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION/HISTORIC
                            PRESERVATION.

                            professional offices with residential uses (multi-use) as a means to sustain
                            neighborhood vitality with minimal physical disruption.
    Guideline 1.2:          Encourage adaptive reuse of structures. The adaptive reuse of historic
                            residential structures as professional offices shall be encouraged as a means of
                            preservation, while in no way precluding residential use.
    Guideline 1.3:          Preserve existing institutional structures. Preserve existing institutional
                            structures and require compatibility for new institutional structures, including
                            maintaining existing setbacks.
    Guideline 1.4:          Allow limited commercial growth. Allow limited commercial growth in this area
                            by applying the goals and policies of upper Fair Oaks Avenue to the portion of
                            Fremont Avenue at Mission Street.

contribute to the City’s objective of increasing employment densities are the objective. Present ownerships
should be encouraged to redevelop and offered the financial incentive to convert.
The possible location here of public improvements could enhance the development potential of desirable
support retail and restaurant space, health clubs, daycare centers and a host of other uses. An automobile-
orientation is also expected because of the area’s locational advantages.
Lot consolidation is encouraged to achieve this development opportunity. A maximum FAR of 0.8, a three-
story height limit, and site coverage not to exceed 50 percent is anticipated.
OBJECTIVE 1.1               RECOGNIZE CITY “GATEWAY” OPPORTUNITY.
    Guideline 1.1:          Visually strengthen this important City entry. Encourage the involvement and
                            participation of abutting property owners in design and implementation of public
                            and private sector improvements within and adjacent to the York
                            Boulevard/Monterey Road right-of-way to enhance and effectively demarcate this
                            important entrance to the City.
    Guideline 1.2:          Define a desired architectural image. Establish individual project design
                            performance standards commensurate with gateway location.
    Guideline 1.3:          Capitalize upon exceptional views and access.
OBJECTIVE 1.2               EXPLORE INTENSIFICATION OR MORE-EFFICIENT USE.
    Guideline 1.4:          Encourage office space and supporting retail or services. Seek to emphasize
                            business park or corporate headquarters office space, often with supporting
                            amenities, either with or in lieu of light manufacturing uses, in a garden or campus-
                            like setting, distinct from the office-above-retail mixed use of the Fair Oaks corridor
                            or Mission Street. Discourage additional uses that compete with the Fair Oaks
                            corridor or Mission Street.
    Guideline 1.5:          Seek to intensify employment/point-of-origin sales. Nurture appropriate
                            revenue-benefiting uses and activities.
    Guideline 1.6:          Foster lot consolidation. Explore means to foster lot consolidation and
                            redevelopment of area.

Chapter III
CIRCULATION &
ACCESSIBILITY
3.1      INTRODUCTION
The Circulation & Accessibility Element is one of the seven mandated elements of the General Plan. The
Element contains goals, policies and recommended actions founded on the results of technical analysis and legal
requirements. It is intended to guide the development of the City's circulation system in a manner that is
compatible with the Land Use Element, and has direct relationships to other elements of the General Plan.
While its focus is a system capable of responding to the transportation needs of the land use plan, the Circulation
& Accessibility Element also addresses the role of the City of South Pasadena in a regional context and the
means by which the local circulation system can support and interact with regional travel demand.
3.1A Purpose of The Element
The purpose of the Circulation & Accessibility Element of the General Plan is to state the specific goals, policies,
and plans to improve the operations of city-wide transportation facilities and service through the year 2010.
Perhaps most importantly, the Circulation & Accessibility Element presents the City's goals and policies for
attaining the circulation system which best promotes a safe, efficient and reliable movement of goods and people
throughout the City of South Pasadena.
The Circulation & Accessibility Element of the General Plan demonstrates the relationship between the Land
Use Plan and all other elements. This is because the Circulation & Accessibility Element is more than a
transportation plan, it is actually an infrastructure plan that concerns itself with the circulation of people, goods,
energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and communications. In turn, the Land Use Element reflects the
community's circulation system in terms of pedestrian-oriented and auto-oriented planning proposals for that
system.
The implementation of the proposed improvements of the Circulation & Accessibility Element will enhance the
development and maintenance of a transportation system which will maximize freedom of pedestrian and
vehicular movement and which balances concerns for mobility, safety, and quality in the City's living
environment.
Various provisions of the Circulation & Accessibility Element address efforts to coordinate city transportation
improvements with improvements to the regional transportation network. In addition, the Circulation &
Accessibility Element discusses the need for coordination between the various regional transportation agencies
including the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS), the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transit Authority (MTA), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), and adjoining
municipal jurisdictions and the County of Los Angeles.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                    III-1
CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)
3.2       EXISTING CONDITIONS
The City of South Pasadena is served by roadways as shown on Figure III-1.
The existing network is largely a grid system of north/south and east/west roads. The primary north/south
roadways include Garfield, Fair Oaks, Fremont, Meridian, Orange Grove, and Grand. Key east/west streets are
Huntington, Monterey, and Mission. The exception to the grid system is the southwest quadrant of the City that
has curvilinear streets developed to fit the topography of the area.
From a regional transportation perspective, South Pasadena lies at the crossroads of a number of regional
transportation facilities. Regional facilities that traverse South Pasadena include the Pasadena Freeway (SR 110),
Huntington Drive (regional arterial), Monterey Road (regional arterial), and Fair Oaks Avenue (regional arterial).
Although Fremont Avenue is used as a regional facility, it is not designed as an arterial corridor. Fremont
Avenue traverses through a predominantly residential neighborhood and extends border to border within the
City of South Pasadena. Orange Grove Avenue from the 110 Freeway to Columbia Street (Pasadena border) can
be used as a linkage between the 110 and the 210/134 Freeways. Other street facilities within South Pasadena
are largely developed to serve adjacent land uses and allow for transport of people and goods within the City. A
number of the local streets may be used for regional trip making purposes, but their primary purpose is to serve
local needs.
3.2A Roadway Classifications
The following section describes the geometric and operational characteristics defined for freeways, arterial streets,
collector streets, and local residential streets. The descriptions are generally grouped by facility type and include
the number of lanes and average daily traffic volume. When the classification of a street is not clearly
determined, that the lower classification level should be maintained. Classifications should be made such that
mobility corridors remain open.
•    Freeways
Freeways generally provide inter-regional access. Their primary function is to move vehicles between cities.
Freeways contain anywhere from 8 to 12 lanes with recommended design volumes from 65,000 to 300,000
depending on geometric designs that permit high travel speeds.
•    Arterial Streets
Arterial streets are generally the commercial arteries. They carry the majority of traffic within the city. A major
arterial would contain either four or six lanes of through traffic, plus left-turn lanes at key intersections. Minor
arterials serve the same function as major arterials, but have four lanes of through traffic and may or may not
have separate left-turn lanes. Recommended design volumes on arterials are generally greater than 25,000 for
major arterials and between 4,000 and 30,000 for minor arterials, depending on number of lanes and left-turn
movements.
Arterials serve two primary functions: to move vehicles within the city and to serve adjacent commercial land
uses. Driveways and other curb cuts along arterials are generally limited to minimize disruption to traffic flow.
In particular, the City will encourage a reduction in the number of curb cuts along Fair Oaks Avenue.

                                           CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

•    Collector Streets
Collector streets are intended to carry traffic between residential neighborhoods and the arterial street network.
They are generally two and four-lane roadways that have a mixture of residential and commercial land uses along
them. Average daily traffic volumes on collector streets are generally between 2,000 and 6,000. Higher density
residential land uses or side yards of single-family homes may be located adjacent to collector streets. Higher
traffic volumes may be acceptable on certain collector streets such as those fronting commercial uses.
•    Local Residential Streets
Local residential streets are designed to serve adjacent residential land uses only. They allow access to residential
driveways and often provide parking for the neighborhood. They are not intended to serve through traffic.
Traffic volumes on a residential street should not exceed about 2,500 vehicles per day and 200-300 vehicles per
hour. The maximum residential traffic volume which is acceptable to persons living along a street may vary from
one street to another, depending upon roadway width, type of dwelling units (i.e., high density apartments versus
single-family homes), presence of schools and other factors. The maximum volume of 2,500 is, therefore, to be
used as a guide only. Key components of the South Pasadena roadway network are classified by type in Table
III-1.

•    Proposed Route 710 Freeway Extension
The City has consistently and unanimously opposed a second freeway for over 45 years and this position is
reinforced by Proposition G-G, passed decisively by the voters of South Pasadena in November, 1986, and
Resolution 6473 passed May 21, 1997.
3.2B Roadway Capacity, Level of Service and Environmental Capacity
•    Roadway Capacity
Roadway traffic operation is generally evaluated by estimating the ratio of existing daily traffic volumes to the
daily roadway capacity. Capacity is measured in terms of the ability of the street system to meet and serve the
demands placed on it. It is generally considered the most practical measure of how well the mobility needs of the
City are being met.
Average daily capacity is considered as the maximum number of vehicles that pass over a segment of roadway in
24 hours. Average daily capacity volumes are typically derived by assuming that peak hour volumes comprise
between 8-10% of the total average daily capacity volumes. Whereas roadway classification defines primarily the
function of a roadway, roadway capacity is more a function of the actual geometry of the roadway and its ability
to carry traffic. Capacity is affected by a number of factors including roadway type, street and lane widths, the
number of travel lanes, the number of crossing roadways, signal cycle length, the absence or presence of on-
street parking, the number of driveways, pavement conditions and roadway design. Level of Service C volumes
are used to define the desirable volumes as the evaluation criteria for this study, as shown below.
Table III-2 presents the recommended maximum desirable service volumes of various roadway configurations
for different levels of service.

SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                   III-7
CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)
Table III-3 lists the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios along arterial and collector roadway segments. Volume-to-
capacity ratios less than 1.00 indicate that the roadway has unused capacity and generally operates satisfactorily
throughout the day and acceptably during the peak hour. A volume-to-capacity ratio greater than 1.00 (actual
daily volumes exceed the roadway's design capacity) is an indication that the roadway likely experiences undesired
congestion during peak hours and possibly during other periods of the day.
•    Environmental Capacity
The environmental capacity of a street will be used as a measurement to gauge the impact of the level of
service (LOS) of a street on its surroundings. This concept follows a new approach to street design and
improvements which is based on the following conditions:
1. The traffic volume of a street;
2. The speed of traffic on a street;
3. The number of trucks on a street (on designated truck routes);
4. The parking conditions of a street;
5. The land uses of the street environment.1
These conditions will be reviewed as improvements are undertaken by the City and should be used as criteria
in considering street and sidewalk widening and other street improvements. Interaction with bicycle and
pedestrian activities will also be considered the environmental capacity of a street. The purpose of the
environmental capacity standard is to incorporate the preexisting environments that will be considered during
land use development decision making and local street improvements.
•    Street Closures
The closure of segments of the public right-of-way are sometimes required in order to re-direct the balance of
traffic and not impact sensitive neighborhoods. The closures occur within the boundaries of the public right-
of-way and must be approved by the City Council. As traffic volumes change due to shifting land use
patterns and regional travel routes, street closures should be periodically reviewed as to their need and
effectiveness.
3.2C Truck Routes
Truck routes are an important element of a city's transportation system since they direct heavy truck traffic onto
arterial and collector facilities, providing necessary access to commercial and industrial areas, while limiting or
prohibiting access to local or residential streets. Designated routes help to control noise and air pollution in
residential areas and protects local streets from significant surface damage which is likely to result from heavy
truck traffic and vehicle weights far in excess of those considered for roadway design.
An adopted system of designated truck routes exists within the City of South Pasadena and includes the
following roadways:
                    •   Pasadena Avenue (West city limits to Mission Street)
                    •   Mission Street (Pasadena Avenue to Fair Oaks Avenue)
                    •   Fair Oaks Avenue (North city limits to Huntington Drive)

    III-8                                                          CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                             CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

                   •    Huntington Drive (South city limits to Garfield Avenue)
                   •    Fremont Avenue (Huntington Drive to South city limits)
Signage indicating designated truck routes is located at city entrances, points of connection with other designated
truck routes, and ramps to the Pasadena Freeway.
The South Pasadena Municipal Code currently contains provisions for vehicles transporting hazardous materials
into and through the City along the truck route system (thereby protecting the safety of the community).
Further, SPMC Section 19.20-21 establishes thresholds for trucks transporting loads in excess of 4,000 pounds
into and through the City and for trucks transporting loads in excess of 6,000 pounds on the Pasadena Freeway.
While the designated system of routes adequately serves the needs of the City, the gross maximum weight
restriction (6,000 pounds) in South Pasadena is consistent with the weight limit imposed by most cities for non-
truck route streets. Streets selected for a truck route system should be designed to support loads in excess of this
limitation; possible future revisions may therefore be appropriate.
3.2D Congestion Management Program (CMP)
The Congestion Management Program (CMP) was a part of Proposition 111 passed by California voters in 1990.
 Proposition 111 authorized a nine (9) cent per gallon gas tax increase which produces $80 million annually for
Los Angeles County. It was supported by the environmental community as an approach to allocate new funding
for transportation strategies that improve air quality and keep pace with new development. The CMP was
created for the following purposes:
          •    To link land use, transportation, and air quality decisions.
          •    To develop a partnership among transportation decision makers on devising appropriate
               transportation solutions that include all modes of travel.
          •    To propose transportation projects that are eligible to compete for State gas tax funds.
Los Angeles County is required to develop an annual CMP integrating individual CMP's for each of the cities
within the County; South Pasadena is required to develop an annual CMP for incorporation into the County's
plan. CMP conformance is required annually in order for the City to continue receiving state gas tax funds and
to preserve the City’s eligibility for other state and federal transportation dollars.
The intersection at Fremont Avenue and Huntington Drive is the only roadway within the City of South
Pasadena that is currently listed on the Congestion Management Plan Highway and Roadway System
(CMPHRS). Fremont has been included in the Los Angeles County CMPHRS as a "Principal Arterial". In
addition, the intersection of Fremont Avenue/Huntington Drive within the City has been identified as a
CMPHRS traffic volume monitoring intersection.
Similar to the Fair Oaks Avenue signal synchronization which links the South Pasadena portion of Fair Oaks
with the portion in Pasadena using the traffic control center in Pasadena, an effort to make streets smarter by
implementing new technologies to enhance the mobility and circulation of pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular
movement throughout the city will be undertaken.
 SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                               III-9
 CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

3.3        ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRAVEL
The automobile has traditionally been the primary method of transportation in the southern California region.
However, changing lifestyles, economic pressures and greater social and environmental concerns have increased
the need for alternatives to automobile travel. Public transportation is one of the alternative modes of travel that
can possibly reduce the region's and the City's dependence on the present auto-oriented transportation system.
In order for a transit system to attract users away from the automobile, it must be as convenient and affordable
as possible. Compared to the convenience, flexibility and privacy of travel by car, transit travel is perceived to be
less appealing, especially for recreational purposes. Thus, for transit service to provide a viable alternative to the
automobile in the City of South Pasadena, the City must take an active role in planning, promoting, and
supporting provision of various transit opportunities.
Both fixed route bus transit service and paratransit service operate within the City of South Pasadena. Fixed
route transit services are typically bus lines that operate on regular schedules along a set route, stopping at
predefined bus stops. Fixed route service can be either local (intracity) or regional (intercity). Paratransit services,
more commonly referred to as Dial-a-Ride, are demand responsive services that provide rides to passengers on
an individual request basis. Although they operate within a defined service area, they do not operate on fixed
routes or schedules. Paratransit service typically serve the transit-dependent such as elderly and persons with
disability. They often serve major destinations such as hospitals and medical facilities but may also take
passengers to local destinations such as neighborhood shopping centers.
3.3A Fixed Route Buses
Public bus transit service is provided to the City of South Pasadena by the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (LACMTA) on local service routes 79/379 and 176, and express routes 483 and 485.
All of the fixed route transit lines that service South Pasadena are intercity buses which originate and terminate
outside the city limits. The City of South Pasadena will undergo a transit restructuring program to improve the
efficiency of the existing bus service system. The City will consider other transit service operators such as the
Foothill Transit or other community based transit to provide services to its local residents.
A city wide community based transit system is the long-term goal of South Pasadena. The vision is to provide
safe, reliable, and affordable alternative transportation choices that afford residents the opportunity to access
places, without using the automobile. Connections will be made to the proposed Blue Line stations in South
Pasadena. The following paragraphs describe the services provided by each MTA line.
•    Route 483/485
Express transit service between South Pasadena and the central business district of Los Angeles is provided by
Route 483 (LA-Altadena via Fair Oaks Avenue Express Line) and Route 485 (LA-Altadena via Lake Avenue
Express). Route 483 originates in Altadena and travels south through Pasadena and into South Pasadena. Route
485 originates in Altadena, travels south through Pasadena, then west into South Pasadena. Both routes continue
through Alhambra to the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) where they continue uninterrupted into California State
University of Los Angeles and then further west into central Los Angeles. A "park-and-ride" lot is available at
the War Memorial east of Fair Oaks Avenue northwest of the Pasadena Freeway. The lot provides direct access
to Route 485. The park-and-ride lot is also available to non-transit users who carpool.
•    Route 79/379
Route 79, also known as the LA-Arcadia-via Huntington Drive Line, is an east-west line which operates along
the Huntington Drive/Mission Road arterial through Arcadia, unincorporated Los Angeles County, San Marino,
South Pasadena, and the Los Angeles communities of El Sereno and Lincoln Park, into the central business
district of Los Angeles.
    III-10                                                         CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                           CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

•    Route 176
The Glassell Park-Highland Park-Alhambra-El Monte Line is an east-west line that provides local service to the
cities of El Monte, Rosemead, San Gabriel, Alhambra, South Pasadena, and northeastern Los Angeles.
•    Route 401/402
The Los Angeles to Pasadena Line originates at Venice/Olive in Downtown Los Angeles and continues
uninterrupted north on the Pasadena Freeway (11) to Arroyo Parkway to Colorado Blvd. At this point, Line 401
travels east on Colorado, turning north on Allen Avenue, and terminating at NewYork. Line 402 travels west on
Colorado to Pasadena Avenue, terminating at a park-and-ride facility at Union and Walnut.
3.3B Paratransit Service
Demand responsive transit service is provided by South Pasadena Senior Ride. This Dial-A-Ride service
provides transportation for local trips and medical appointments primarily to senior citizens, although service is
available to persons with disability. This service is limited to the area within the South Pasadena city limits with
the exception of direct service into Pasadena and to Huntington Memorial Hospital and the associated medical
facilities immediately adjacent to the hospital. Users must be a resident of South Pasadena and either 55 years or
older or disabled. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
3.3C Rail Transit
Rail transit service is currently being reestablished in Southern California after a hiatus of thirty years. The 400-
mile Metro Rail Plan proposed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (LACMTA) entails
the development of rail service in multiple corridors throughout the urbanized area of the County. Presently
operating, beyond MetroLink Commuter Rail Service, is the Metro Blue Line serving twenty-two (22) stations
between downtown Los Angeles and downtown Long Beach, the Metro Green Line serving fourteen (14)
stations between City of Norwalk and El Segundo, and the initial segment of the Metro Red Line, serving eight
(8) stations from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles west to Wilshire/Western, which ultimately will be
extended to North Hollywood. Transfers between the Metro Blue, Green and Red Lines, Amtrak and the
Regional MetroLink Rail components of the system would be provided at Union Station.
A northwesterly extension of the Metro Blue Line has begun construction, to run from Union Station in
downtown Los Angeles along the former Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad right-of-way through South
Pasadena to a terminus in east Pasadena. The Pasadena Light Rail System is proposed to start service in the
future. As currently planned, the line will have stops in Chinatown, Avenue 26, French Avenue, South West
Museum, Avenue 57, Mission Street, Fillmore, Del Mar Boulevard, Memorial Park, Lake Avenue, Allen Avenue
and Sierra Madre Villa Avenue. The City strongly supports grade separation of the proposed Blue Line from city
streets.
The Mission and Meridian platform of the Blue Line will provide South Pasadena with direct rail transit service.
The service will attract commuters and visitors away from the automobile and thus, positively impact the
roadway and freeway systems within the City. Projected impacts and usage of the Metro Blue Line service
included in the draft Environmental Impact Report prepared by the LACMTA, were incorporated into the
analysis and development of the Circulation & Accessibility Element.
 SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                   III-11
 CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

To ensure that the planned light rail line is integrated into the City’s circulation system, and City activities,
consideration of the rail line should be incorporated into all aspects of City Planning activities and the
development review process. This is particularly important in the vicinity of the Mission Street station. In
addition, the pedestrian circulation system must be designed to allow convenient walking access to the station.
3.3D Park-and-Ride
"Park and ride" facilities provide an interface between the private automobile or bicycles, and public
transit/mass transit. Park-and-ride facilities enable the public to access the transit system by driving or bicycling
to a park-and-ride facility, parking the car or bicycle, then riding the transit system to complete the trip. The City
should make sure that the “park and ride” facilities do not turn the City of South Pasadena into a parking lot for
Pasadena and downtown Los Angeles.
The City has an established "park and ride" facility at the War Memorial west of Fair Oaks and north of the
Pasadena Freeway for MTA Bus Route 485.
3.3E Bicycle Facilities
The bicycle is increasing in popularity as a mode of transportation for commuter travel as well as for recreation.
This is due to the growing cost of motor vehicle operation, the significantly shorter portal-to-portal time when
bikes are used on short trips, the increasing awareness and desire of travelers to utilize clean-air travel methods,
and the acceptance of the bicycle for personal health, exercise, and increased mobility. There is a need to meet
the growing demand for safe places to ride bicycles, for both recreation and commuter activities.
For many years, roadway facilities have been built exclusively to meet the needs of the motorized vehicle,
resulting in street geometrics, lane widths, and intersections that have not been designed for bicyclist concerns.
Bicycle safety is jeopardized due to bike/auto and bike/pedestrian confrontation on the street, and the lack of
space given over to bicycle movement. Conflicts between bicycles and pedestrians at intersections and on
sidewalks result in the need to separate these three modes, wherever possible to provide a safer and more
efficient operational environment for each.
The following definitions describe the classifications of bike routes in the City, consistent with Caltrans
definitions for bikeway facilities statewide.
          Bicycle Path - Class I: This facility is a special path for exclusive use of bicycles that is separated from
          the motor vehicle traffic by space or a physical barrier.
          Bicycle Lane - Class II: A bicycle facility where a portion of the paved area is marked especially as a
          lane for use of bicycles. It is identified by BIKE LANE signing, pavement marking and lane line
          markings. Usually, special ordinances are necessary to legally define the area's exclusive use of bicycle
          traffic and to exclude mopeds and infringement by motor vehicles.
          Bicycle Route - Class III: A bicycle way designated within a public right-of-way. The purpose of the
          bike route is primarily that of transportation, allowing the bicyclist to travel from one point in the City to
          another. A "shared bicycle route" is a street identified as a bicycle facility by BIKE ROUTE signing
          only. No special markings on the pavement are provided.
    III-12                                                         CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                            CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

The City of South Pasadena has appointed a committee to explore developing a Bikeway Master Plan and Map.
Implementation of any bicycle route facility would be subject to applicable design standards and guidelines. The
State of California has prepared and approved Standards and Guidelines for the Implementation and Design of
Bicycle Facilities. The evolution of design concepts for this mode of transportation continue today, but the basic
conclusions and basis for design remain with the State Guidelines.

III-14                  CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
       CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)
3.4      FUTURE CONDITIONS
The City of South Pasadena is a built-out community with a land use pattern established at the turn of the
century. Major changes in local land use are not foreseen. The General Plan will preserve community identity.
Changes to travel demands and traffic patterns on the South Pasadena circulation system will result from two
principal causes: (1) growth in traffic from adjacent cities, and (2) minor changes in local land uses.
3.4A Regional Tripmaking
Regional tripmaking is responsible for much of the travel demand for the street system in South Pasadena and is
caused by traffic passing through South Pasadena from the residential areas north and east of the City to
employment centers to the south and west, primarily in downtown Los Angeles. Recent Caltrans studies indicate
there will be little improvement to the local street system if the Route 710 Freeway is constructed. Congestion
patterns move around the local system, mixing local and regional traffic much as it occurs today. Clearly, regional
travel has a greater impact on traffic and is responsible for existing aggravated traffic conditions within South
Pasadena, not land uses within South Pasadena.
Similarly, according to the Pasadena-Los Angeles Light Rail Transit Project Draft Environmental Impact Report,
construction of the proposed light rail route through South Pasadena is estimated to result in removal of 2,500 to
4,600 vehicle trips from the street system in the peak hours. This could equate to as many as 20,000 to 38,000
vehicles on a daily basis, using a commonly accepted ratio for peak hour to daily travel. This again provides
some quantitative indication of the amount of regional travel demand placed upon the local streets of South
Pasadena.
The proposed route 710 Freeway extension and the Pasadena Light Rail Transit project provides stark
comparisons towards addressing future traffic conditions. Inasmuch as construction of a major freeway
extension produces untenable environmental conditions, alternative means such as rail transit can satisfy the
regional travel demand while positively influencing the urban environment. Further efforts are necessary to
increase rail transit usage and further decrease regional travel on the street system.
In general, urban communities have squarely faced the challenge of traffic congestion and have largely
determined that greater use must be made of existing transportation resources. To address growth in regional
tripmaking, this Circulation & Accessibility Element is focused upon:
         •          Prioritizing the existing street network, and promoting a Multi-Mode/Low-Build concept;
         •          Encouraging and fostering development of light rail, commuter rail, and other fixed-guideway
                    transit systems;
         •          Facilitating aggressive transportation system and transportation demand management
                    (TSM/TDM) techniques; and
         •          Calming traffic in residential areas.

 CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

3.4B Local Land Use
The Land Use Element of the General Plan indicates that there are six primary categories of land use within the
City of South Pasadena. While new structures may replace older ones or adaptive reuse may occur, the intensity
of the new use will be similar from a traffic and access perspective. Nevertheless, the land use and local
circulation system will be mutually supportive to reflect changes that occur over time in the City.
The exception to the above statement involves special Focus Areas that have been targeted in the Land Use and
Economic Revitalization Elements for particular attention. The Focus Areas define development potential that
is more specific in intent than the underlying land use designations. The intent is to provide insight on how the
underlying use should be interpreted when actual development proposals are being considered. A Focus Area
may provide for mixing of uses, residential intensification, theme implementation, greater intensity or increased
flexibility in use as appropriate to each situation.
For purposes of identifying future conditions and the appropriate response by the Circulation & Accessibility
Element, each Focus Area presents general traffic and access implications. These implications then tend to
dictate if changes are necessary for the local circulation system to serve the future needs of the potential Focus
Areas. The Focus Areas considered include:
                           •         Huntington-Garfield
                           •         Fair Oaks Terminus @ Huntington Drive
                           •         Fair Oaks Corridor (Central, Upper and Lower Fair Oaks)
                           •         Raymond Hill
                           •         Fremont Corridor
                           •         Mission Street Specific Plan Area
                           •         Ostrich Farm
                           •         Arroyo Annexation
3.4C Master Plan of Streets
Combining the issues identified for regional tripmaking and for local land use creates a basis for establishing how
the circulation system (in particular the street network) must evolve in the framework of the General Plan. The
following basic tenets apply:
    •         The current street network as shown in Figure III-1 will remain essentially intact. Major additions or
              deletions in the future are not foreseen.
    •         Classification of existing streets as shown on Table III-1 will remain unchanged in context and intent.
    •         Existing arterials will be monitored and studied to determine how capacity can be increased and how
              congestion, delay, and associated environmental impacts can be reduced. Capacity and operational
              improvements could include, but are not limited to, signal timing and system upgrades; revised lane
              configurations; minor intersection improvements such as new turn lanes and bus turn-outs; parking
              restrictions or removal; traffic calming techniques; and elimination of conflicts such as multiple
              driveways.
    •         The environmental capacity standard (pg. III-7) will be used to determine the appropriate roadway
              capacity and its potential impact on the quality of life factors for area residents. This standard will
              measure the impact of vehicular interaction with the surrounding environs (such as pedestrian, bicycle,
              and transit services) and will be considered in land use development and street improvement
              endeavors.
    III-16                                                          CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                            CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

3.4D Transportation System & Transportation Demand Management
Transportation System Management (TSM) and Transportation Demand Management (TDM) techniques are
cost-effective methods of improving traffic conditions. Roadway system expansion alone will not be enough to
serve all projected circulation needs within the City of South Pasadena. TSM and TDM techniques will have to
be incorporated as an integral part of the City's package of transportation services provided in the future.
•         Transportation System Management (TSM)
Transportation System Management (TSM) techniques are generally low cost methods relative to capital
improvements. They involve changes to the existing system that permit improvements in operation. Caltrans
defines TSM projects as "those projects designed to increase the number of person trips which can be carried on
the system without significantly increasing the design capacity or the number of through lanes."
•         Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) generally refers to policies and programs that increase the use of
high occupancy vehicles (transit, carpooling, and vanpooling), bicycling and walking, shortening trips, and
avoiding trips altogether (telecommuting). TDM techniques can be an effective tool in reducing air pollution as
well as traffic congestion. In addition, the California Congestion Management Program, passed by the voters as
Proposition 111, requires that each jurisdiction implement a TDM program. The City will develop a program
that encourages and assists all the businesses in South Pasadena to plan and maintain TDM programs.
3.4E Truck Routing
Maintenance of an appropriate truck routing system necessitates the ongoing determination of the impact of
truck traffic on abutting land uses. There are land use categories that benefit from heavy truck access. Among
these are commercial uses that require streets and alleys proximate to their development. Commercial land uses
also require access to trucks primarily for the transfer of inventory. As land uses adjust over time, the City must
select proper truck routes and deal appropriately with the issue of truck traffic. Coordination with neighboring
communities' truck routes is required.
Conversely, there is a need to protect those land uses that are adversely affected by heavy truck traffic. Heavy
truck traffic within residential neighborhoods produces annoying and often excessive levels of noise, fumes,
vibrations and unsightliness. Areas in which schools, hospitals, churches, convalescent homes, and mortuaries
are located must also be considered.
 SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                 III-17
 CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)

3.5       ISSUES
The South Pasadena community faces challenges in achieving the principal circulation goal of its Vision
Statement: To provide for convenient and efficient mobility within the City, while reducing reliance on the
automobile as the principal means of travel.
South Pasadena, like other cities, is not an island unto itself: circulation issues and travel patterns extend far
beyond city limits. The circulation system within the City of South Pasadena is heavily impacted by regional
travel demands as well as land use, circulation, and development plans of other jurisdictions. Bottlenecks have
developed at key locations, including Fair Oaks Avenue at the Pasadena Freeway. Existing public transit service
is poor in the community, with few bus routes and long increments of time between buses. Local bike lanes are
non-existent and the west San Gabriel Valley is lacking any coordinated regional bikeway system.
3.5A Prioritize Improvements to the Circulation System
Improvements made to the existing street network will be coordinated with transit, bike, and pedestrian needs.
3.5B Development and Maintenance of an Efficient Vehicular Circulation
          System
The regulations for land use and transportation must be mutually supportive if the changes desired in
transportation choices are to be realized. This will require modifications to the City's land use planning densities,
zoning designations, urban design criteria, and parking controls to support these mobility goals.
Principal transportation corridors within the City are defined and established. These are necessary for the
movement of residents within the City, for residents to travel out of the City to other communities; and for non-
residents to travel into South Pasadena for work, retail, commercial and recreational reasons. Principal
transportation corridors will carry transit vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians and auto traffic, rather than being
principal streets for autos only.
Trips that pass through South Pasadena, or that have one end outside of the City, should be managed and
controlled, so that they travel on designated routes and do not infiltrate residential neighborhoods. The key
strategy of control is to provide incentives for the use of desired routes and disincentives to travel on streets
where high volumes are inappropriate.
3.5C Encourage the Use of Alternative Modes of Transportation
In order to meet the basic General Plan principal of making South Pasadena a City where people without cars
can circulate, the first priority of the Circulation & Accessibility Element is to increase the availability and use of
community based transit.
To respond to these challenges will require a variety of new policies, incentives and services that affect both
transportation and future development in South Pasadena. In addition, South Pasadena needs to evaluate the
regional services available and capitalize on the availability of other systems where possible.
    III-18                                                          CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                           CIRCULATION & ACCESSIBILITY ELEMENT (Amended February 2001)
The pedestrian is an integral part of the circulation system and requires appropriate attention in the Circulation &
Accessibility Element. The sidewalk is an area of refuge that represents a convenient and safe route for
pedestrian travel. The high percentage of residential population in South Pasadena, coupled with mid-day
walkers for shopping trips and jogging, necessitate the establishment of a pedestrian circulation system that will
support and encourage walking as a mode of transportation. The City embraces a policy direction to make South
Pasadena a place where bicycling and walking are encouraged and fostered, and where safety, education and
facilities are provided as an ongoing part of transportation and recreational planning and programs.
3.5D Reduce the Level of Vehicular Trips in General, and Specifically the Use
           of Autos for Drive-Alone Trips
While allowing people to circulate without cars is a primary emphasis of the Circulation & Accessibility Element,
another emphasis is getting people to share rides and reduce the number of vehicular trips. In order to
accomplish this, the City will need to take specific actions that will assist people in finding ways to share a ride,
give priority to vehicles with more than a single occupant, or even eliminate the need for the trip totally.
 SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                  III-19

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT &
REVITALIZATION
4.1       INTRODUCTION
4.1A Purpose of the Element
The purpose of creating an Economic Development and Revitalization Element for the South Pasadena General
Plan is to establish a policy framework for assuring the City's economic vitality over the years to come. Used here,
economically viable means providing a range of commercial and employment opportunities that meet the needs of
residents and workers alike, attracting families and businesses to create demand for planned land uses, and
establishing and funding public service levels that preserve South Pasadena's quality of life.
There is an interdependence among economic development and the overall quality of life in South Pasadena. The
high standards for community facilities and services attract businesses and residents. Population growth,
employment growth and new development in turn generate revenues that make high standards possible. Given
the City’s demonstrated attractiveness to industry and residents alike, opportunity exists for South Pasadena to
further strengthen the local economy and maintain high service levels through effective economic development
planning.
This element will specifically target areas of the City for future economic development based on careful economic
analysis of potential land use. One of the unique qualities of this element is that it builds on the Focus Areas
identified in Chapter II and provides future decision makers with concepts of development, based on reasonable
potential outcomes. In coordination with the Land Use Element that defines the objectives and guidelines for
each Focus Area, the tables contained in this chapter will allow the City to evaluate development proposals as to
their fiscal viability and economic desirability. Finally, the identification of the Focus Areas with their objectives
and guidelines will be used as the pre-cursors for development of future Specific Plans.
4.1B Authorization and Scope
The Economic Development Element is an optional element of the General Plan, as set forth in the State
Planning, Zoning and Development Laws, California Government Code §65303. Although this Element is not
required in the General Plan, the City requested that it be prepared to consolidate and codify a growing body of
policy concerning the economic and fiscal viability of South Pasadena. This Element may be amended by the City
Council to adapt to changing needs and economic conditions.

4.1C Relationship to Other Elements
The Economic Development Element is linked primarily to the Land Use Element. Land use policy, in which the
City takes an active role in defining development intensity, balancing and mixing land uses, and establishing design
guidelines, is fundamental to economic growth and fiscal well-being. Land use policy also helps the City plan in
advance for the secondary effects of development, including employment growth, infrastructure requirements and
fiscal impacts. South Pasadena's housing policy is also linked to economic development planning in that economic
relationships exist between housing types and employment opportunities, as well as between housing densities and
the cost to maintain City service levels. With regard to attracting industry and maintaining mobility for corporate
activities, the Circulation Element is also important to the economic development strategy.
4.1D Related Plans and Programs
•    Arroyo Verdugo Cities Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP)
This plan is a component of the SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and includes the cities of Burbank,
Glendale, La Canada Flintridge, Pasadena, and South Pasadena. The economic element of the Arroyo Verdugo
Cities RCP analyzes employment, personal income, taxable sales, and labor force characteristics for the five-city
region, providing a broader context for the Economic Element of the South Pasadena General Plan.
•    Redevelopment Projects
The City has two adopted redevelopment projects: The Altos de Monterey Redevelopment Project and the
Downtown Redevelopment Project. Redevelopment project areas provide a focused economic strategy for key
areas of the City. The Altos de Monterey Redevelopment Project Area is completed and provided only for
infrastructure necessary to complete residential development. The Downtown Redevelopment Project consists of
five non-contiguous sub-areas. The purpose of the redevelopment project is to create and preserve vital, revenue-
generating land uses in this key commercial area. (See Figure I-1, pg. I-6, for adopted redevelopment areas in
South Pasadena.)
•    South Pasadena Chamber of Commerce
The Chamber of Commerce was established in 1905 and currently has approximately 300 members. The
Chamber represents the entire business community and provides a bridge between the merchants and the City
government. The Chamber is very active, holding monthly legislative meetings, publishing quarterly bulletins, a
membership directory, and sponsoring many educational programs for its membership. The Chamber also plays
an active civic role, sponsoring community events, street fairs, the annual spring event, and City celebrations such
as the 4th of July celebration. Members of the Chamber of Commerce have played an active part in the
Downtown Revitalization Committee's work in the General Plan program and the Mission Street Specific Plan.

•   San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments
The City of South Pasadena participates in the Council of Governments (COG) that was created and consists of
27 cities in the greater San Gabriel Valley. The City of South Pasadena lies on the western edge of the San Gabriel
Valley and coordinates with the Council of Governments and the Arroyo Verdugo subregional planning process.
COG also has its own Economic Development Committee that provides economic development assistance to the
member cities through the Governing Board.

4.2       EXISTING CONDITIONS
South Pasadena is a full-service community. As a "full-service community" the City is especially proud of the
qualities that make it unique. Looking ahead to the next century, however, decision makers will be faced with the
necessity to continue high public service levels that they may find extremely difficult to finance. The city has in the
past been reluctant to charge residents for the full cost of services. However, the City has taken appropriate steps
to secure needed funds in response to reductions in federal and state assistance. For example, in 1992 the City
adopted a utility tax that provided additional revenue to offset service demands from the short fall of the property
tax distribution.
Business and industry have contributed much to the economic well-being of South Pasadena over the past 100
years. Not only have commerce and manufacturing provided jobs and services to the population, they have
contributed tax revenue required to provide health, safety, and social services to citizens. Today, increased
competition among cities throughout the Los Angeles area has the potential to erode South Pasadena’s market
share, making it very important that South Pasadena follow a comprehensive economic development plan. Efforts
must be made to secure an appropriate share of the region's investment. Significant efforts are required not only to
encourage new business, but also to retain existing companies. Programs must address the negative impacts of
fluctuating market conditions.

4.3       FUTURE CONDITIONS
4.3A Economic Development and Revitalization Potentials
Economic development and revitalization potentials are defined as changes in land use and development that will
lead to enhanced economic and fiscal viability. This may include:
                         •         Retail Development
                         •         Bed and Breakfast Accommodations
                         •         Employment Related Land Use
                         •         Mixed-use and Joint Development
•         Retail Development
Retail land uses generate significant sales tax revenues to the City based on taxable sales of retail goods to the
surrounding market area. According to the preliminary retail analysis presented in the "Existing Conditions and
Background for Planning" report, the City of South Pasadena has the opportunity to capture additional sales of
apparel, home furnishings, and restaurants. Currently, the local demand for these goods is leaking from South
Pasadena to surrounding cities.
During the 1960s, South Pasadena lost several significant employers. In conjunction, retail business suffered a
decline, resulting in only 13 percent of the City's revenues being generated from sales tax. Even after two decades
of redevelopment attempts, retail sales tax revenues have not been significantly increased. Currently, sales tax is
estimated to make up only about 14 percent of General Fund revenues, and retail development in South Pasadena
is capturing 60 percent of local purchasing power.
In order to improve retail capture, the City must consider the location and type of retail demanded in a competitive
market, and seek to encourage development in South Pasadena that will meet this demand. Often, this may
include improvements in design and access that will facilitate shopping during more hours of the day, increase the
capture of local purchasing power, and begin to capture more purchasing power from surrounding cities.
•    Bed and Breakfast Accommodations
In addition to providing substantial revenues in the form of transient occupancy tax, lodging development is an
enhancement to employment development. Lodging opportunities in South Pasadena include smaller-scale inn
accommodations for visitors to the City and bed and breakfast uses in conjunction within the historic districts of
the community. South Pasadena could accommodate at least five such bed and breakfast facilities; two bed and
breakfasts exist in the City already (1998).
•    Employment-related Land Use
The potential for employment in South Pasadena is viewed as including garden and mid-rise office uses and
research and development uses. These uses were historically associated with the City prior to the decline of
employment in the 1960's. Areas for employment development may include the Ostrich Farm; sites along Fair
Oaks and Huntington Drive; the Mission West area; and west Mission Street, generally between Meridian and
Orange Grove.
In encouraging employment development, the City may wish to stress its good image within the surrounding
communities, stable and well-educated labor force, and special features and amenities that can be associated with
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                    IV-5
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

potential employment centers. The convenience of the Blue Line light rail for access to Pasadena and the Los
Angeles Civic Center from the Mission West area should also be stressed.
•    Mixed-Use and Joint Development
Typically, mixed-use development combines at least three different revenue-generating land uses--retail, office and
higher density housing--into a single development concept, with the purpose of generating benefits from the
agglomeration and proximity of complementary uses. Given the potential compact scale and high density of new
development in South Pasadena, mixed-use concepts have been explored in detail as the General Plan Land Use
Element has been prepared. Rather than interpreting mixed-use solely as a combination of three distinct uses, the
concept should be viewed in a slightly broader context - as the mixing of a variety of uses - not necessarily as part
of one single development. Such mixing of uses should be considered particularly in proximity to transit stations,
with possible advantages from joint public-private development.
4.3B Focus Area Development Potentials
The City has chosen to include an Economic Element as part of their General Plan. This economic analysis has
been designed to recognize the potential economic opportunities for the City of South Pasadena and to coordinate
closely with the General Plan process in order to provide a structure whereby the City can plan for and be
prepared to realize those economic opportunities.
This analysis draws upon information compiled by the General Plan consultant; the General Plan Advisory
Committee (GPAC); and previous field work and preliminary analysis completed by the consultant. The purpose
of this analysis is to provide statistical compilations of existing development, the General Plan potential and the
development increment based on the GPAC’s recommended land use strategy, computer maps and estimates
made by the consultant and City staff. Property tax and sales tax revenue potential are also estimated based on the
net development increment in 1996 dollars.
For each focus area, development potential has been estimated through the use of five tabulations, they are:
                              - Existing Development
                              - General Plan Potential
                              - Incremental Development Potential
                              - Net Development Potential
                              - Net City Revenue Potential
Existing Development. Existing development was first quantified by land use for each focus area. Building
footprints were digitized from aerial photographs, and merged with digitized parcel lines and streets. Once they
were digitized and the number of floors recorded, building square footage was calculated. This process results in
land use statistics useful in a planning context.
General Plan Potential. General Plan potential was then calculated in 1994 for each land use based on proposed
land use designations, specific parking requirements for each focus area, and varying development intensities
deemed appropriate for the particular focus area. General Plan potential square footage is conceptual because
existing constraints will limit the amount of new development that can be ultimately realized. The land use
designations described in the Land Use Policy Map for the Focus Areas are intended as a guide for future land use
within these Focus Areas.
Incremental Development Potential. Development potential increment is assumed to be a more realistic
estimate of likely development potential given certain constraints to development. Economic constraints include:
                    •    Existing economic viability which limits the likelihood of near-term demolition and recycling
                         of land uses;
  IV-6                                                            CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                    ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

                   •    Site constraints which limit development feasibility, such as parking requirements; lot
                        configuration; parcel size; or height limits
                   •    Existing development in excess of estimated potential, where redevelopment would result in
                        loss of economic potential from existing levels due to higher parking ratio standards.
Historic constraints are defined as existing historic fabric that the City would like to retain. Historic fabric may or
may not have a formal designation on a historic register. However, the City’s desire to maintain its small town
character means that existing structures with aesthetic value should be preserved. Once economic and historic
constraints are identified, remaining parcels constitute the development potential increment where recycling of
existing land uses is more likely to occur.
Net Development Potential. Net development potential is the subtraction of existing buildings assumed to be
removed within the development potential increment from the estimated new development potential. Net
development potential represents the increase over existing development levels and forms the basis for calculating
increased property tax and sales tax revenue.
Net City Revenue Potential. Net revenue potential is calculated for property tax and sales tax. These revenues
are calculated only for the net development increment, so as to avoid double counting existing property and sales
tax from current land uses that are expected to remain in place. Improvement valuation and sales generation
assumptions are included in the detailed tables for each focus area. In some cases, negative revenues are
calculated. These negative amounts relate to development that is recycled into other uses. For buildings that are
assumed to be replaced, valuation assumptions for property tax are estimated to be 15 percent lower than
valuation of new development.

•   Key Findings
1. Land Use
Table IV-2 shows the existing land-use compared to the General Plan land-use designations in acres for the Focus
Areas and the Mission Street Specific Plan. Overall, the general commercial acreage increases while
manufacturing/business park acreage decreases, due to the redesignation of the Mission Street Specific Plan. The
greatest change in General Commercial occurs in the Central Fair Oaks and Mission Street Specific Plan Areas.
Major changes in Professional Office land-use are located within the Upper Fair Oaks, Lower Fair Oaks and
Fremont Corridor areas. Mixed-use development potential is estimated to occur in the Central Fair Oaks and
Fremont Corridors.

2. Net Revenue Potential
New sales tax related to retail uses in general commercial and mixed use land uses is projected at build-out in 15
years to result in about $730.5 thousand annually, or about 69 percent of the total. Property tax revenues would
account for the remaining $324.9 thousand in new revenue, at about 31 percent of the total. Assuming
development of the land uses specified in Table IV-2, South Pasadena is estimated to realize an increase in annual
operating revenue of about $1.06 million. Central Fair Oaks is projected to be the single largest revenue generator,
with new revenue estimated at about $428.1 thousand. Other key revenue generators include Huntington -
Garfield and Upper Fair Oaks.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

3. Long Term Fiscal Impacts
The City of South Pasadena is largely built out. With few opportunities for new development of vacant land, land
use changes in the future will most likely occur through redevelopment of existing sites. This opportunity for
redevelopment, or recycling of land use, offers the City a chance to approve projects that further both the design
principles and economic goals of the City.
The City of South Pasadena has relied largely on property tax revenue over the years, receiving an allocation of
about 24.1 cents of the one dollar of property tax collected. However, since Proposition 13 limits the increase in
property valuation--and thus property tax revenue-- to two percent per year, the City’s largest revenue source is
steadily eroding in relation to costs which increase with inflation. In order to maintain long term fiscal viability, the
City is faced with two choices: increase revenues or cut City services. Revenue increases can be achieved through
direct and indirect methods. Direct methods include new taxes or assessments to augment existing City revenues.
Indirect methods include redevelopment, strategic land use planning and economic development.
The General Plan provides strategic land use planning to encourage a mix of land uses that will be fiscally balanced
over the long term. One of the goals of the Land Use Element is to promote new and existing commercial uses
that generate sales tax revenue. Unlike property tax, the City’s sales tax receipts depend largely upon the degree to
which its retail base performs within the local market. Traditionally, South Pasadena, which has few large vacant
sites available, has not sought large sales tax revenue generators. Rather, the City’s retail base is more specialized,
generally smaller scale and somewhat limited in its ability to attract purchases from outside the community.
4. Economic Implications
As presented in the development potential summary, each focus area has unique land use issues that must be
addressed in relationship to economic development goals. While the City does not have the potential for major,
regional retail centers, there are a number of opportunities that lend themselves to community level retailing and
offices that can serve the local residential population while also attracting additional business from surrounding
communities.
South Pasadena has a close knit community feeling that can be enhanced through emphasis on pedestrian
orientation and shared parking. Since lot configurations, in many cases, do not lend themselves to effective
parking configurations, the use of parking districts and parking management techniques will enhance the business
environment. Also, preserving key, older buildings, while intensifying adjacent parcels, will serve to retain the
historic community character.
The major commercial thoroughfares, Fair Oaks and Huntington Drive, are important assets in expanding the
commercial base of the City of South Pasadena. Huntington Drive provides an effective arterial that links South
Pasadena with surrounding communities and carries significant traffic volumes. Recycling existing uses to greater
commercial opportunities will not occur immediately because of their current economic viability, but this corridor
area will be important in a long term economic strategy.
The Fair Oaks corridor provides the greatest commercial opportunities, but also some of the greatest challenges.
In addition to enhancing parking and pedestrian orientation, this area has many of the older, historic buildings that
may be preserved. While redevelopment authority and a parking district cover a portion of this area, a variety of
implementation approaches and financial incentives will be important in stimulating this area to recycle and
upgrade.
Also, significant mixed use development potential is allocated to the Central Fair Oaks area that could provide an
incentive to attract new development. Since this is a relatively new land use option for the City, its success should
be monitored and closely coordinated with the use of various implementation approaches and financing
incentives.

                                                   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

Additionally, the City of South Pasadena has important opportunities to expand its economic base with the
recycling of older residential structures to offices along the Fremont Corridor and to business park uses in the
Ostrich Farm area. While these are not expected to be major land uses in the context of the larger, more modern
business parks in neighboring communities, South Pasadena does offer the advantages of living close to work, in
an attractive residential community and still having accessibility to major centers such as downtown Los Angeles
and the Pasadena-Glendale-Burbank area. Additionally, a light-rail line will be extended from Los Angeles through
South Pasadena thus providing another important mode of transportation.
4.3C Potential Development Activities
The potential for additional development activity exists in the following areas:
Existing Downtown Redevelopment Project Area: The Downtown Revitalization Task Force has identified a
number of potential improvements, including pedestrian improvements; parking improvements; building
restoration and enhancement; and preservation of unique retailing.
Areas adjacent to the Downtown Redevelopment Project: The two blocks west of the Downtown
Redevelopment Project have been identified by the Task Force as having potential for improvements, including
reuse of the Pacific Telephone Building; shared parking for weekend commercial uses; streetscape improvements
and retail enhancement.
West Mission Street: The area between Orange Grove and Arroyo Drive currently contains opportunities for
employers of moderate size (e.g. 50 - 75 employees). Additional development potential may exist should the City
decide to relocate its public works yard, which is currently located on West Mission Street. Sale or lease of City-
owned property in this area may also yield financial resources for improvements.
Mission West Historic District: The Mission West Historic District has the potential to become a significant
transportation node with the Blue Line Station at Meridian and Mission Street. Within the immediate area is a
large undeveloped parcel, with the potential for housing, specialized retailing or mixed-use development.
Additionally, transit improvements could provide incentives for revitalizing underutilized employment areas south
and west of the Mission West Historic District.
Ostrich Farm: Redevelopment may play a key role in providing necessary infrastructure improvements to
transform this area into a viable employment center. Circulation improvements, and other physical improvements
may be necessary to correct long-standing deficiencies.
Raymond Hill: The Raymond Hill area could potentially be assisted with redevelopment funding for
improvements to the existing housing development. Assistance could be in the form of rehabilitation, cosmetic
facade renovations, infrastructure improvements or new development.
Arroyo Annexation: This Focus Area has no current development potential.
4.4       ISSUES
There is an interdependence among economic issues and the overall quality of life in South Pasadena. The high
standards for community facilities and services attract businesses and residents. This attraction generates revenues
which make high standards possible. Given its demonstrated attractiveness to industry and residents alike,
opportunity exists for South Pasadena to further strengthen the local economy and maintain high service levels
through effective economic development planning.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT
4.4A Economic Expansion
In order for South Pasadena to realize its economic potential and provide more jobs, shopping opportunities and
services for its residents, it must take a proactive stance towards economic development including an enhanced
retail base, more office/professional development and a revitalized light industrial area. A strengthened economic
base for the City of South Pasadena is essential, and can be segmented into the following categories:
Employment base. South Pasadena has an excellent image and very good accessibility to the regional labor force,
especially through the regional transit system. While many major employers have left the City in the past, the new
opportunities associated with regional transit development, and emerging industrial development in adjacent areas
can be tapped to generate job growth in South Pasadena.
Retail base. The City of South Pasadena currently captures about 60 percent of the retail demand of its residents.
 Major retail leakage occurs in specialty retailing, general merchandise, restaurants, apparel, home furnishings and
appliances. High quality retail development in a diverse urban environment could not only satisfy unmet demand
by South Pasadena residents, but may draw in purchasing power from outside the City. Strengthening South
Pasadena's mix of retailers would increase tax revenue to the City and improve shopping and employment
opportunities for South Pasadena residents.
4.4B Fiscal Viability
Long-term fiscal viability must be related to land use. Given the economic realities in California, each local
jurisdiction must maintain its own fiscal viability. Economic cycles, State cutbacks, and increased competition for
revenue producing land uses all contribute to the need for a long term fiscal strategy that is integrated with land
use policy. This requires coordination of land-use planning and policy, economic development policy, and local
fiscal policy, including taxation. It must also be recognized that long-term fiscal viability requires incremental public
and private investment, including development impact fees.
4.4C Managed Growth
Managed change. This land-use concept has been formulated to provide flexibility for the City in achieving
development goals. The land-use plan identifies special Focus Areas in which economic development potential is
concentrated. These Focus Areas could accommodate mixed land uses, residential intensification, theme
implementation, greater intensity or increased flexibility in use as appropriate to each situation. Each Focus Area
receives special treatment to determine appropriate density, land use, and character.

4.4D Mixed-Use Developments
Mixing of land use. Innovative land use combinations should be used to encourage innovative development to
take advantage of the City's character and access to transit, and to provide development patterns unique to South
Pasadena. Mixed-use development combines different land uses with the purpose of generating benefits from the
synergy that occurs with proximity of complementary uses. Given the potential compact scale and high density of
new development in South Pasadena, mixed-use concepts have been explored in detail as the General Plan Land
Use Element has been prepared. The concept should be viewed as the mixing of a variety of uses and not
necessarily limited to part of one single development. Such mixing of uses should be considered particularly in
proximity to transit stations, and in other areas where higher density development is desirable.
4.4E Adaptive Reuse of Structures
The scale, character and architectural heritage of South Pasadena should be capitalized upon to set the tone for
marketing themes, strategy and improvement programs. Strategies to encourage adaptive reuse and the
conservation of worthy structures should be encouraged; demolition should be strongly discouraged and
incompatible uses prohibited. Design guidelines and incentives should be established to point a direction and
foster creativity within the development community.
4.4F Cultural Attractions
The community has expressed a desire to promote cultural attractions as an opportunity to generate positive
economic impacts for South Pasadena. Preliminary economic analysis of the South Pasadena area indicates that
additional events and attractions are needed to complement the Mission West Arts Festival, Safety Fair, Historic
Home Tour, and Concert Series.
4.4G Development Tools
Because of historically high service levels and limited potential for new development, growth in South Pasadena
over the last decade has followed a trend in which recurring costs are increasing more rapidly than recurring
revenues. The City's established residential character has created a fiscal environment in which the demand for
services could eventually exceed the City's potential revenues, possibly forcing a change in service levels. In order
to generate significant long-term increases in recurring revenues such as sales tax and property tax, the City must
facilitate growth in its economic base. Several important tools to encourage revitalization and reuse of outdated
land uses, toward the goal of a more robust and diverse economy, are shown in Table IV-3, pg. IV-20.
In addition to design and environmental improvements, redevelopment serves two primary purposes from a fiscal
perspective. First, redevelopment can provide capital funding through property tax-increment financing for
necessary infrastructure improvements, thus enabling development and revitalization of blighted areas. Second,
redevelopment can significantly augment recurring revenues, such as sales tax, if retail conditions are improved.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT
The City of South Pasadena has current redevelopment objectives as follows:
        •        To provide sufficient land within projects for retail and commercial development to serve both
                 community and regional needs;
        •        To create a climate for combined public and private investment that will benefit the community
                 as a whole;
        •        To provide assistance, enticements and encouragement to ensure future development at its
                 highest and best use in accord with community values; and
        •        To provide plans that transition the character of projects from a blighted area to an economically
                 viable area.

4.6       STRATEGIES
4.6A Economic Development Component
A variety of implementation approaches may be needed for the City of South Pasadena to realize its
desired economic goals and objectives. Since the City is largely built out, each focus area may require a
different combination of implementation approaches and financial incentives as presented in Table IV-3.
 This list is not meant to be all inclusive, but rather to suggest the kinds of techniques that may be
required as part of an overall economic strategy for the City to realize its economic potential.
The implementation approaches are divided into two broad categories: 1) Planning and Regulatory; and 2)
Pro-Active techniques. Currently, the City is using a variety these techniques and the implementation of
others may be appropriate.

The General Plan will provide the overall framework within which economic activities will be considered
and approved.
The next logical step may then be to implement Specific Plans in areas that have the most immediate
potential, such as is already occurring in the Mission District. These planning tools, along with urban
design guidelines and standards, give prospective developers, landowners and builders the level of
information they need to plan projects that have a strong certainty of being approved.
  IV-20                                                           CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

Additionally, streamlining the planning and approval process reduces the risk of development by lowering
the processing and holding costs. Development agreements may also be appropriate for innovative
projects that have a relatively longer time frame and provide developer guarantees of completing their
projects which will assist in obtaining necessary capital financing.
The pro-active approaches include a variety of financial techniques that range from Redevelopment tax
increment and parking districts to alternative financing techniques that include a variety of special taxes
and assessments. Some of these techniques are already available in selected areas of the City. Other cities
that have revitalized older areas, such as Pasadena and Santa Monica, have found that parking districts
and shared parking have been very effective. These districts may be funded through a combination of
assessments and public sources, such as redevelopment tax increments and parking revenues.
Additionally, Business Improvement Districts should be considered which include assessments on local
businesses for clearly defined economic purposes. These assessments are fed back into business districts
for a variety of purposes, including marketing, publicity, beautification, landscaping and lighting and
safety enhancements for participating businesses.
Along with these techniques there are other alternative financing techniques that should be considered
including city-wide or sub-area parcel taxes for the maintenance or enhancement of selected key public
services that are viewed as essential for creating the type of environment conducive to economic
development. These services could range from public safety to public works including repair,
beautification and maintenance to lighting.
Another alternative financing technique is the use of sales tax incentives, particularly for projects that
have the potential for strong sales tax performance. These types of rebates should be carefully structured
so that they provide clear public benefits and leave adequate surplus revenues to the City for other
general government functions.
Finally, as part of a comprehensive economic strategy, the City should pursue the federal, state and
regional grants and loans that are available for downtown revitalization which could range from multi-
modal funding through Inter-modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), to historic
preservation, to business assistance programs. After the General Plan is approved, the implementation
approaches should be continually monitored and evaluated for those Focus Areas or city-wide, where
they can enhance the overall economic goals and objectives of the City.

4.6B Focus Area Development Assumptions and Calculations
1.         Huntington - Garfield
1. Development Assumptions
This area is viewed having potential for intensification of commercial uses, primarily south of Huntington
Drive. Because of its location at the southeast corner of the City, a “gateway” orientation is appropriate.
As such, the site should be able to draw in shoppers from surrounding areas and generate substantial sales
tax revenues to South Pasadena.
GPAC comments support development of a specific plan resulting in a large commercial development
with an auto orientation that would serve a broader community level market. One GPAC member’s
vision for the area states: “This area should become, ultimately, a denser assemblage of structures, auto-oriented, but
established with zero front setback, with parking behind, and vehicular access carefully focused at Huntington Drive and
Garfield/Atlantic. Parking at rear (west) would be a landscaped open space buffer between properties on the west side of
Olive, [allowing these parcels] to continue their residential expression.”
The area is viewed as one of the key opportunities to develop a major sales tax generator in the City. One
possible format for the approximate 12 acre site would be a high-volume retailer with surface parking.
The GPAC vision for the site would require higher commercial densities coupled with parking structures.
 To support the economics of a parking structure, the development would have to reach a broader market
area and contain a mix of well recognized retailers--most likely apparel, home furnishings, restaurants and
specialty shops.
Using the GPAC vision for the site, an average building height of 1.5 floors is envisioned, with surface
parking only. In this configuration, the building footprint occupies about 30 percent of the site. The
recommended auto orientation would suggest parking at 4.0 spaces per thousand square feet. However,
using shared parking and other reduced parking strategies, a ratio of 3.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet may
be feasible. The reduced parking requirement allows for more development on site, increasing the market
potential to realize the GPAC vision for the site. Parking should be located along the western portion of
the large commercial site to buffer residential uses from commercial activity. A parking structure is only
viable if the land value increases substantially. Development approval for multi-story mixed use
commercial could act to increase the perceived value of the site, thus making a parking structure
economically viable at some point in the future.
Few physical development constraints are present, with no buildings deemed worthy of preservation
according to the GPAC and City staff. Development intensification would have little or no effect on
South Pasadena, due to the location at the southeast corner of the City. The key constraint is the
provision of on-site parking. Currently, the supermarket use requires that a substantial portion of the site
be devoted to parking. Intensified commercial uses would have to provide structured parking to support
multi-level, mixed use development.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                            IV-25
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

The viability of existing commercial and office uses in this Focus Area may tend to delay succession of
use. However, the location at a busy intersection with access to relatively affluent markets makes this a
prime development site for retail or other commercial uses. With the current use as a supermarket,
intensification potential on the site is limited. However, if more intense commercial uses can be
supported in the market, the site could support a substantially greater level of development.
2. Development Calculations
Existing development. The Focus Area currently includes lower density commercial development, and
scattered office development. The major use is the Ralph’s Market located on the south side of the
Huntington Drive/Garfield Avenue intersection. The location provides a broader community-level
orientation, serving South Pasadena, San Marino and Alhambra. Existing land use is distributed between
general commercial (12.0 acres, 50,300 square feet) and professional office (0.33 acres, 13,800 square
feet). General commercial uses have a current parking ratio of 4.17 spaces per 1,000 square feet, while the
office parking ratio is currently at 1.45 spaces per 1,000 square feet.
General Plan potential. According to the General Plan, the entire 12.33 acres would be redesignated
general commercial. The only use to change from existing uses is the office building located northwest of
the intersection of Huntington Drive and Garfield Avenue.
Incremental development potential. The existing office building in this area is not anticipated to
redevelop general commercial due to site constraints and viability in its existing use. This effectively
limits the developable area of the focus area to about 12.00 acres, including the entire area south of
Huntington Drive as well as the corner gas station site north of Huntington Drive.
Allowing for these economic and physical constraints (12.0 developable acres instead of 12.33 acres), and
reducing the required parking ratio from 4.0 to 3.5, development potential is calculated at 234,800 square
feet. The reduced parking ratio may be appropriate if the GPAC vision for the site is realized.
Accounting for removal of the existing 50,300 square feet, the net development potential is about 184,500
square feet.

2.        Fair Oaks - Huntington
1. Development Assumptions
Comments generally suggest the development of a neighborhood retail area, with pedestrian orientation
and a continuous street wall. This area is viewed as a primary southern gateway to the City. GPAC
recommendations range from demolition of existing structures on all four corners of
Fremont/Huntington for new development, to the preservation of parcels at all four corners. In general,
comments suggest emphasizing commercial retail and phasing out office development. However, to
achieve multi-story development, other non-retail uses will have to be considered for upper floors.
GPAC comments are both supportive and opposed to mixed use. Due to the lack of agreement by
GPAC members on the development of this area, development assumptions are somewhat limited in
detail. Surrounding uses should fill in underutilized parcels and maintain minimum setback street front.
The existing five-story office building is economically viable, and can be expected to remain. GPAC
comments suggest density that will complement the five story building, such as a four story height limit
with mandatory setbacks limiting building footprints to half the site area. However, given the General
Plan land use designation of general commercial, multi-story development without public parking off-site
is not viewed as feasible. Under a neighborhood orientation, parking can be reduced if linkages to
surrounding neighborhoods can be strengthened. However, these linkages depend upon the types of
retailers attracted to the area. Services, convenience retail and restaurants would be appropriate.
This analysis assumes a full 4.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of new commercial, substantially limiting
development potential.
The area contains smaller parcels separated by major thoroughfares, limiting pedestrian access between
quadrants. Unrestricted turn lanes connecting Huntington Drive to Fair Oaks Avenue further separate
development. Some historic fabric should be retained, including the building at the southwest corner of
Fremont Avenue and Huntington Drive and facades along the south side of Huntington Drive. A vacant
lot located at the northwest corner of Fremont Avenue and Huntington Drive represents a development
opportunity, as do underutilized parcels along the north side of Huntington between Fair Oaks Avenue
and Fremont Avenue.
Due to limitations on parcel size and depth, a neighborhood focus and other physical constraints, this
focus area is not likely to support significant new commercial development. While some GPAC members
support increased development intensity in the area--similar to the existing five story office building--the
market does not seem to support that level of development currently. New development can be expected
first on vacant and underutilized properties where succession of use is not required, such as the vacant lot
at Fremont Avenue and Huntington Drive. However, existing uses that are economically viable are not
likely to see redevelopment unless dramatic change sweeps the area.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT
2. Development Calculations
Existing development. This area currently contains a mix of office, retail and high density residential
uses characterized by older buildings. The five story office building at the terminus of Fair Oaks serves as
a visual anchor for the corridor. The existing uses are spread between general commercial (3.33 acres and
75,000 square feet) and professional office (2.89 acres and 100,400 square feet). Corresponding FARs are
52 percent for general commercial and 80 percent for office, indicating a fairly intense level of existing
uses. Parking is limited, with existing parking ratios at 1.96 spaces per 1,000 square feet for general
commercial and 1.74 spaces per 1,000 square feet for office.
General Plan potential. Conceptual development under the General Plan would result in 95,900 square
feet of general commercial, assuming parking ratios increase to 4.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet.
Incremental development potential. Taking development constraints into account, about 5.0 acres are
considered as having the potential to recycle from their existing use, resulting in development potential of
about 89,600 square feet. This calculation incorporates an average building height of 1.5 floors, rather
than the single floor assumption under the General Plan.
Surface parking is still assumed. Accounting for the loss of existing uses (about 60,000 square feet of
general commercial and 38,100 square fee of professional office), the net development increment is
29,600 square feet of general commercial, with an overall loss of about 38,100 square feet of professional
office.

3.         Fair Oaks Corridor
3a.        Central Fair Oaks
1. Development Assumptions
The Central Fair Oaks district offers the key to commercial revitalization and pedestrian orientation in the
City. Goals specified by the GPAC include the maximization of pedestrian friendly activity; the
promotion of mixed uses; the accommodation of outdoor dining, public plazas, and significant
architectural effects; and overall density increase. The GPAC recommends:
1.) “Designating Central Fair Oaks Avenue as a district consisting of ground level retail/restaurants with offices or
housing above (or as rear or courtyard uses), and concentrating as much activity as possible in one place.
2.) Allowing two stories of office or housing on upper floors of buildings fronting Fair Oaks Avenue, and up to one level of
office or housing on the upper floor for buildings fronting only Mission Street.”
Set backs and height limits should be used, rather than floor area ratios, to regulate density. GPAC
comments suggest a three-story height limit for buildings fronting on Fair Oaks Avenue, with zero-front
set-backs. A two-story height limit is recommended for buildings on Mission Street. The GPAC also
encourages infill development between and in front of existing buildings to promote continuity of
storefronts. This may even occur in alley ways that currently interrupt the street front continuity.
The recommended parking strategy utilizes shared parking, parking management, parking structures and
other techniques to minimize the impact of parking and promote the district’s walkability. In general, this
area should have relatively lower parking requirements than either Upper Fair Oaks or Lower Fair Oaks.
The consultant views a public parking structure as necessary to support the level of development
proposed for this area. Such a structure should be located within easy walking distance of the area’s
pedestrian oriented uses.
Key physical constraints include difficulty in creating development opportunity due to parcelization and
ownership patterns; and adapting existing structures to more economically viable uses.
2. Development Calculations
Existing development. The Central Fair Oaks Focus Area contains a mix of commercial uses, including
older storefronts and newer commercial buildings. The predominance of historic fabric lends the area a
unique appearance. Key existing uses include the Rialto Theater, Vons supermarket and Rite Aid.
Existing land use includes about 373,500 square feet of general commercial and about 9,700 square feet
of professional office. The overall parking ratio is currently less than one space per 1,000 square feet of
development.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                          IV-33
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & REVITALIZATION ELEMENT

General Plan potential. The General Plan allows a mix of uses within the commercial in the core area
(between Mission and Oxley). The Focus Area designation allows for alternative second floor use of
commercial buildings, primarily professional office. Assuming average building heights of 1.5 floors
across general commercial uses and 2.5 floors for mixed use development, a total of 970,000 square feet
of development potential exists. Reduced parking requirements allow for more intensive development.
Incremental development potential. Of the approximately 20 acres within the Focus Area, about 11.7
could realistically be expected to undergo redevelopment, resulting in a development potential of some
585,600 square feet. About 142,200 square feet would have to be removed to achieve this development,
for a net increase of about 443,400 square feet.

3b.        Upper Fair Oaks
1. Development Assumptions
The GPAC states: “This Focus Area, although presently exhibiting automobile-oriented land-use characteristics, represents a
potential for expansion of the Central District core uses and character.” Goals for the area include pedestrian-oriented
commercial growth in support of the Central Fair Oaks area; maintenance of visual continuity; creation of a
sidewalk environment; and increased public safety. Ground level commercial uses are encouraged, primarily
restaurant and retail. Traditional auto-oriented uses are acceptable if they conform to pedestrian-orientation of
the area.
Development intensity in this area is subordinate to growth in the Central Fair Oaks area. Once desired
development levels are achieved in Central Fair Oaks, development should be allowed at levels commensurate
with Central Fair Oaks, i.e., a three-story height limit. In the short term, development intensity should be
focused on infill and maintenance of at least a single-story street wall along Fair Oaks Avenue. This Focus
Area should provide parking opportunities for the entire Fair Oaks corridor. A public parking structure in this
area would support higher-intensity development in both the Central Fair Oaks and Upper Fair Oaks focus
areas.
The existing multi story office building on the west side of Fair Oaks is economically viable and is not
expected to redevelop. Adjacent residential uses limit development potential, primarily properties located
along Brent between Hope and Grevelia.
2. Development Calculations
Existing development. Upper Fair Oaks currently contains a mix of retail, restaurant and other commercial
uses. Key uses include Bristol Farms; a bi-level mini-mall at Fair Oaks and Hope; and the three story “Fair
Oaks Office Building” located at 625 Fair Oaks Avenue. Commercial development is estimated at 93,800
square feet on about 6.00 acres. Professional office development is estimated at about 116,000 square feet on
some 2.80 acres.
General Plan potential. Under the General Plan, professional office acreage increases slightly. General
commercial acres decreases slightly, through the loss of parcels not fronting on Fair Oaks, and through the
transition of office uses at Fair Oaks and Grevelia. General Plan potential is estimated at about 399,800
square feet.
Incremental development potential. Assuming the existing three story office building will not recycle,
potential office development is estimated at about 49,400 square feet. With the abandoned alley space
included in the Bristol Farms development, general commercial potential is estimated at about 191,200 square
feet. To achieve this potential, about 93,800 square feet of existing general commercial uses would have to be
removed, resulting in a net increment of about 146,600 square feet altogether.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                            IV-37

3c.      Lower Fair Oaks
1. Development Assumptions
Auto-orientation is proposed for this area, with primarily commercial development. A pedestrian
environment is to be encouraged through the use of zero front set backs, restricted curb cuts along Fair
Oaks and parking located in transitional buffer zones behind development. In addition to auto
orientation, land uses should serve adjacent residential areas.
GPAC recommendations include medium density auto-oriented commercial, along with two to three
story office buildings and possibly even lodging. Fast food, drive-through and auto sales should not be
allowed. The GPAC did not reach a consensus supporting mixed use development, but with lower
densities and auto-orientation, mixed-use development is not likely to be attracted. Lower overall
commercial density is recommended in this area compared to Central Fair Oaks. Lower density auto-
oriented development should be supported by on-site surface parking.
This Focus Area is exposed to surrounding residential uses and must respect existing residential fabric. A
strong auto-orientation and lower average density will limit the development potential.
The lack of historic fabric worthy of preservation will allow more flexibility for sites to redevelop should
the market see the opportunity. Due to economic viability in its current use, the Pavilions site is not likely
to see succession of use in the short term, limiting the potential for change in this area.
2. Development Calculations
Existing development. Lower density auto-oriented commercial uses predominate in this area. Key
existing uses include Pavilions and auto sales and repair. Existing uses viewed as inappropriate include
used automobile sales, and automobile repair. Some GPAC members suggest preserving historic fabric in
the area, while others see no aesthetic value in existing structures. City staff have not designated any
buildings as worthy of preservation.
General Plan potential. The General Plan redesignates all uses except the Pavilions site as professional
office, with office acreage increasing from 1.82 acres to 5.95 acres. The General Plan would allow
intensified commercial development at the south west corner of Monterey and Fair Oaks, and would
encourage increased density in remaining office land uses. Estimated supportable development is
calculated at 65,100 square feet of general commercial and 240,500 square feet of professional office.
Parking would have to increase substantially to support intensified commercial and office uses.
Incremental development potential. Most of the focus area could conceivably redevelop under
General Plan designations, limited only by historic constraints at the south east corner of Bank and Fair
Oaks. Accounting for this constraint, development potential is slightly less, with 221,900 square feet of
professional office. Redevelopment of this area would require the removal of about 117,900 square feet
of existing uses, for a net increase of about 169,100 square feet.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                               IV-41

4.        Raymond Hill
1. Development Assumptions
Many of the GPAC comments state that this area is a gateway to the City, and that the gateway image should
be reinforced. The GPAC encourages a mixed-use anchor at the Fair Oaks/State Street intersection of the
Focus Area with linkages both to Raymond Hill residential and Upper Fair Oaks commercial uses.
Development intensity is likely to remain low, approximated by a 25 percent floor area ratio. The area will
most likely remain auto-oriented, with required on-site surface parking for commercial.
2. Development Potential
Existing development. The GPAC states: “This predominately multi-family residential enclave developed in the 1950s
and early 1960s is located atop one of the highest hill[s] and affords tremendous views. At the base of the hill fronting Fair Oaks
is a mixture of commercial enterprises.” The Orchard Supply Hardware store is the key commercial use in this area.
 Current development is estimated at about 62,000 square feet of general commercial, and 21,900 square feet
of professional office.
General Plan potential. General Plan potential is estimated at about 105,600 square feet, with minimal land
use changes from existing development.
Incremental development potential. While uses along the west side of Fair Oaks are constrained and are
unlikely to be redeveloped at a higher use, the commercial site east of Fair Oaks could potentially be recycled,
accommodating up to approximately 79,400 square feet. However, accounting for existing development of
62,000 square feet, the net potential is only about 17,400 square feet.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                   IV-45

5.       Fremont Corridor
1. Development Assumptions
Unlike other Focus Areas in this study, the Fremont Corridor is not expected to experience growth through
new development. Rather, growth is anticipated in the transition of residential buildings to office uses,
preserving the original structures along Fremont Avenue.
2. Development Potential
Existing development. Existing uses include general commercial (6,500 square feet); professional office
(87,900 square feet); and manufacturing (17,200 square feet). Total non-residential land uses occupy
approximately 4.39 acres.
General Plan potential. If residential uses transition to professional office, office space could increase to
about 128,500 square feet. Mixed use development potential is estimated at about 35,900 square feet.
Incremental development potential. Accounting for economic and historic development constraints, office
potential is reduced to about 100,200 square feet, and mixed use potential is reduced to about 12,400 square
feet. Approximately 2,800 square feet of commercial uses would be recycled.

6.         Mission Street Specific Plan
The Specific Plan Area includes the Mission Street right-of-way from Pasadena Avenue to Fair Oaks Avenue. It
includes parcels fronting on Mission Street between Fremont and Indiana Avenues, as well as areas to the north
and south of Mission Street between Fremont and Orange Grove Avenues. The Area is divided into the Core
Area, between Fremont and Prospect Avenues within easy walking distance of the Blue Line station, and the West
Area, west of Prospect Avenue. Buildings on Mission Street east of Fremont Avenue are not in the Specific Plan
Area (although the right-of-way is). The area in which these buildings is located is referred to as the Adjacent Area.
In Chapter 2 of the Specific Plan, “Summary of Background Information”, the discussion of land use addresses
both the Specific Plan Area and the Adjacent Area to the east, distinguishing between the two. The market
feasibility analysis treats the entire business district as a single market unit. The transportation and parking analysis
includes the Mission Street business district, as well as a larger study area that extends from the Pasadena Freeway
on the north to Monterey Road on the South.

7.         Ostrich Farm
1. Development Assumptions
The GPAC states: “Recycling of this 29.3 acre light industrial area as an efficiently planned ‘business park’ is recommended.
Well-designed, master-planned, campus-type developments for employers who will contribute significantly to the City’s objective of
increasing employment densities are the objective. Present ownership should be encouraged and be offered the financial incentive to
convert. The ‘business park’ designation seeks to emphasize office space, often with supporting amenities, either with or in lieu of
light manufacturing uses, in a garden-like setting. Supporting retail and commercial service would also be allowed.”
This area could support generally lower density development based on the business park format. On-site
surface parking is anticipated at an average ratio of one space per 1,000 square feet of manufacturing space.
The area requires lot consolidation and redevelopment to achieve the City’s vision of a master-planned
business park. A key constraint is the competition within the region for business park development.
2. Development Potential
Existing development. The area currently contains a mix of some older industrial buildings and marginal
commercial uses. General commercial space is estimated at 25,700 square feet; professional office at 3,700
square feet; and manufacturing uses at 236,700 square feet.
General Plan potential. Under the General Plan, about 1.5 acres of general commercial would be retained.
Manufacturing acreage would increase from 9.76 acres to 12.45 acres, and could potentially support about
453,900 square feet.
Incremental Development potential. No constraints to development have been identified in this area. The
net increase, accounting for removal of existing buildings, is estimated at about 217,200 square feet of
manufacturing space, with slight losses in professional office and commercial space.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION
ELEMENT
5.1        INTRODUCTION
The Historic Preservation Element of the General Plan includes goals, policies and implementation strategies
to ensure the continued appreciation and protection of South Pasadena’s rich legacy of substantially intact
historic buildings, residential neighborhoods, and commercial districts. These resources are worth protecting
and are key to the economic future of the City.
Few cities in California are better recognized for the quality of its small-town atmosphere and rich legacy of
intact late 19th and early 20th century neighborhoods and residences. South Pasadena also has a strong claim
to having the oldest and most historic sites in the San Gabriel Valley.
For many centuries, its adjacency to a natural fording place along the Arroyo Seco had served as a gateway to
travel and commerce for aboriginal peoples here and along the coast. It was here that Hahamognas greeted
Portola and the missionaries who later established the San Gabriel Mission a few miles to the west. The initial
buildings on the Rancho San Pasqual, which subsequently gave birth to the Cities of Pasadena, South
Pasadena and Altadena, were built here. The first of these adobe structures became headquarters for General
Flores and his staff in 1847 where they agreed to surrender to American forces, ending Mexican Colonial rule
in California.
In 1888, South Pasadena incorporated the southern portion of the Indiana Colony and land south and
eastward to the Los Angeles border, becoming the sixth municipality in Los Angeles County. With
establishment of the Raymond Hotel and the Cawston Ostrich Farm, the small community was able to attract
tourists and increasingly large waves of new residents to the Pasadena area in the late 19th and early 20th
Centuries. With completion of the Pacific Electric Short Line, putting the entire city within easy walking
distance of the “red car” stations, South Pasadena also became a one of the first suburbs of Los Angeles. It is
now certainly one of the best-preserved cities, maintaining a small-town quality and humanity in the scale of
its buildings, its residential streetscapes and historic commercial core.
It is this legacy and the tradition-minded, small-town atmosphere that has preserved and perpetuated a quality
of life that has kept so many long time residents in the community and which continues to attract new
residents. It plays no small role in giving South Pasadena an excellent reputation throughout Southern
California and the rest of the state as a wonderful place to live, to raise a family and come to shop or visit.
The essential core of South Pasadena’s historic preservation plan, as detailed in this Historic Preservation
Element, demonstrates a commitment to protect endangered resources, the special character of the City and
quality of its neighborhoods. The Historic Preservation Element will help preserve this commitment by
becoming one part of a comprehensive historic preservation program that recognizes the value that a sense of
history can contribute to the community by providing stability and continuity without sacrificing goals for
new growth and development.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION ELEMENT

5.1A Purpose Of the Element
As an integral part of a comprehensive general plan, the Historic Preservation Element is intended to help
fuse the preservation and protection of historic resources into long-term land-use, economic, and social
planning. Through the following broad goals it provides continuity and guides the actions of City
departments and commissions in preserving and protecting South Pasadena’s historic landmarks,
neighborhoods, and properties on the historic inventory.
•    Preserve and maintain sites, structures, and neighborhoods that serve as significant reminders of the
     City’s social, educational, religious and architectural history.
•    Encourage maintenance and preservation of historic structures and artifacts.
•    Maintain elements of the natural landscape that contribute to the attractiveness and historic character of
     districts, neighborhoods and landmarks.
•    Assure continuity of the City’s historic character, scale and small town atmosphere for all future projects.
•    Build public awareness of preservation issues and appreciation for the unique history of South Pasadena
     and its neighborhoods.
•    Adopt incentives that promote the preservation and rehabilitation of historic structures.
•    Encourage public/private cooperation in preservation efforts that enhance property values, enrich the
     local economy and promote tourism.
•    Integrate preservation into the planning process.
5.1B Authorization and Scope
Section 65303 of the California Government Code specifically includes historic preservation as an optional
element of the general plan. It authorizes the preparation of an historic preservation element “...for the
identification, establishment and protection of sites and structures of architectural, historical, archeological or
cultural significance...” Although the Historic Preservation Element is not one of the mandatory elements of
a general plan, its inclusion implies the same level of importance as any other element of the City’s general
plan.

                                                                  HISTORIC PRESERVATION ELEMENT

5.1C Relationship to Other Elements
The Historic Preservation Element is most directly related to the Land Use Element, the policies and patterns
of which work in concert with preservation objectives. Fiscal and development economics as well as planning
principles often drive land use deliberations, and the land use decisions rendered will affect the City’s built
environment legacy just as much as they will affect new projects - so the Economic
Development/Revitalization Element is strongly related also. As a resource, the policies of the Open Space
and Resource Conservation Element bear on and/or mirror the preservation issue. Each of these elements
contain discussions on preservation-related matters. Timely identification of cultural and historic resources
and the open discussion of policy alternatives related to preservation is consequently essential.

5.2       EXISTING CONDITIONS
5.2A Community Overview
The built environment of South Pasadena reflects its rich heritage. Entire neighborhoods of homes built in
the Craftsman, revival or Art Deco styles of 1900-1939 have survived largely intact and are enriched with
mature landscaping. A handful of homes from the Victorian era are scattered throughout the community.
The historic city center and business district around Mission Street and Meridian Avenue has been listed in
the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the City’s historic institutional buildings, ranging from
religious to civic, continue to play a vital role in town life. These buildings create the historic context within
which the numerous historic resources of South Pasadena can be understood and evaluated.
The preservation movement in South Pasadena began in 1970 when South Pasadena Beautiful created a sub-
committee to study ways and means to promote historic preservation in the community. Eventually, the
subcommittee became the Jean Driskel Foundation, later renamed the South Pasadena Preservation
Foundation, a private non-profit organization. The City restored the 1888 Meridian Iron Works building,
which now serves as a historical museum and base for the Preservation Foundation.
South Pasadena adopted Cultural Heritage Ordinance No. 1591 in 1971 that established the Cultural Heritage
Commission to advise the City Council on all preservation issues. That ordinance was amended by
Ordinance #2004, adopted February 19, 1992, which helped clarify the role and functions of the
Commission.
The City Council contracted for a comprehensive historic resources survey in 1991. The purpose of this
survey was to develop an inventory of historic resources and to provide a foundation for their recognition in
all future planning processes. This professional survey was conducted by an architectural historian, using
National Register criteria. The criteria include age, architectural character, integrity, historical associations,
and existing neighborhood context. The Historic Resources Survey: Inventory of Addresses was adopted by
City Council on November 30, 1994. The City will use this inventory of significant historical and cultural
resources when determining the appropriateness of building permit applications for exterior changes that
would impact neighborhood character and historic continuity, develop appropriate preservation and
conservation programs, guide the location of new developments away from areas of significance, determine
which properties should be nominated for national, state or local designation, and generally raise the
awareness of the community to its heritage.

                                                                  HISTORIC PRESERVATION ELEMENT

5.2B Designated Historic Landmarks
To date, the City Council has designated 41 properties and sites as local City landmarks. The City Council has
also designated four historic districts; the Mission West Historic Business District (1982), the El
Centro/Indiana/Palm residential district (1993), the Oak/Laurel residential district (1994) and Ramona Street
Residential District (1997). Each district retains a distinct character representative of South Pasadena’s past.
Table V-1 lists the designated landmarks by name and location. Figure 1, The Historic Resources Map,
provides a geographic reference to the location of these landmarks and defines the boundaries of the
designated historic districts, and the properties listed on the adopted historic resource inventory.
The entire city was listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of The Eleven Most
Endangered Places in the United States for an unprecedented period of time from 1989-1994 because of the
decades-long fight to halt the extension of the Route 710 freeway through the middle of the City. This
freeway, if built, would destroy numerous historic landmarks and historic districts vital to South Pasadena’s
character and economy.

5.3 CONDITIONS
South Pasadena has buildings, sites or neighborhoods of particular interest or significance, which may be
associated with historic events of local importance or a residence of a founding pioneer of the community.
Other resources may be distinctive in architectural design, site or landscape treatment, and artistic features or
may be distinctive because they possess unique characteristics or may be interesting simply as curiosities.
These buildings and areas contribute to a community’s historic and cultural heritage, which if lost, cannot be
replaced. The preservation of noteworthy structures from all stages of a city’s growth provide a three
dimensional record of the tastes and the values affecting daily lives in the past and the City, preferably as part
of its comprehensive planning program, should take the necessary steps to conserve the identified buildings,
sites and areas that are found to contribute significantly to its historical and cultural heritage.
The Cultural Heritage Commission of the City is charged with the ongoing responsibility for adopting specific
criteria and recommendations for the designation of Landmarks and Historic Districts, subject to approval by
the City Council. The six categories of landmark designation are as follows:
•    Eligible for the National Register of Historic Places - Districts, sites, buildings, structures and
     objects of local, state and national significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture
     that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship and feeling.
•    Eligible for California Registered Historical Landmark Program - Sites and structures that
     contribute in a unique way to the history and heritage of the State. Several categories may determine
     landmark status, such as architectural, influential individuals and other comparable categories.
•    Eligible for California Point of Historical Interest Program - Program recognizes sites and
     structures of local or countywide importance.
•    Locally Significant Resources - Structures, places, or historic sites that are individually significant to
     South Pasadena’s history and heritage.
•    Districts - Structures, groups of structures, historic sites or features, design components, natural features
     and landscape architecture that contribute to the historic or community sense of place or are significant to
     an area’s historic feel. Normally, significant district structures must be located within the district
     boundaries; however, all structures in this area are not necessarily contributors to the district.
•    Resources Eligible for the California Register of Cultural Resources - Register automatically
     includes all properties eligible for or listed in the National Register, California Registered Historical
     Landmarks from No. 770, California Points of Historical Interest, and will include locally registered
     landmarks, inventories and the new category of the California Register itself.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION ELEMENT

The Cultural Heritage Commission is also authorized to develop standards and criteria for determination of
appropriateness in reviewing applications for permits to construct, enhance, alter, modify, remodel, remove,
demolish or affect any inventoried property, Landmark or Historic District. As well, the Commission can
review and advise the City upon the conduct of land use, housing, redevelopment, municipal improvement
and other types of planning programs undertaken by any agency of the City, County or State, as they relate to
Landmarks and Historic Districts in the community.
Preservation of South Pasadena’s character and scale, including its urban design form and historic character,
should be given consideration in future development. Project review and design criteria should be employed
by the Cultural Heritage Commission and the Design Review Boards for projects within the city. Design
review by either group should take into account the importance of maintaining scale and visual harmony in
blending new construction and adaptive reuse of older structures.

5.4      ISSUES
The City of South Pasadena was incorporated in 1888. The town grew rapidly over the next three decades
until the first City zoning standards were adopted. By that time, the City had added considerably to its legacy,
establishing the unique neighborhood fabric for which South Pasadena is famous. It is this early legacy of
historic sites and structures and this unique neighborhood character that the Historic Preservation Element
seeks to protect.
The 1963 General Plan allowed for high residential growth for the City while encouraging protection from
inharmonious encroachments. Subsequent zoning ordinances permitted higher residential densities in older
neighborhoods, damaging the scale and character of South Pasadena’s historic structures and districts. This
Element seeks to re-emphasize the importance of the historic resources, districts and neighborhoods within
the community. Within historic residential areas, non-traditional zoning approaches (such as reduced zoning
or alternative standards) may be necessary to protect the architectural and historic integrity of the
neighborhoods.
Historically significant neighborhoods have been impacted by new developments that are not architecturally
sensitive to neighborhood integrity. The City has recently developed review procedures to assure the
protection of the City’s historical character and scale. However, these procedures require that clear policy
direction and guidelines be developed and maintained for the review bodies of the City. Along with policies
and guidelines, public awareness and education are needed to manifest an appreciation of the historic nature
and character of the City.
The City has limited resources with which to promote preservation and rehabilitation of historic structures.
In the future, the City will need to encourage programs of public/private cooperation if the goals of
preservation are to be achieved. Additionally, intergovernmental coordination between municipalities will be
necessary to achieve their diverse goals.
Historic resources are a public benefit to all South Pasadena residents and the City needs to actively
participate in available preservation programs that provide financial incentives. Local, State and Federal
programs need to be implemented and offered to the community if these resources are to be preserved for
future generations to enjoy.
The proposed extension of the Long Beach Freeway (Route 710) through the City of South Pasadena
threatens many historic structures and neighborhoods. Approximately 500 homes within the City of South
Pasadena would be lost by its construction. As of September 1998, CalTrans owns over 107 dwelling units of
which 43 are listed on the City’s Historic Inventory. There are approximately 150 homes within the 710
Route that are on the City’s list of Historic Resources. Maintenance of the state-owned structures is
imperative to prevent the loss of property values and control the blighting influence of poorly maintained
structures and the City must continue to do all in its power to see that CalTrans maintains the homes it owns.
Existing fire and building codes are not always sensitive to the preservation of the existing architectural fabric,
(materials, elements, features, and architectural context). The City should encourage interdepartmental
cooperation when reviewing projects related to identified historic structures and neighborhoods while
maintaining public safety.

5.5     GOALS AND POLICIES
The following goals and policies were developed to address preservation issues of the City.
GOAL 1:          To preserve and maintain sites, structures, and neighborhoods that serve as
                 significant reminders of the city’s social, educational, religious and architectural
                 history.

Chapter VII
OPEN SPACE &
RESOURCE CONSERVATION
7.1       INTRODUCTION
The Open Space and Resource Conservation Element of the South Pasadena General Plan contains goals,
policies and implementation strategies to encourage the conservation and proper management of the
community’s natural and open-space resources, and to ensure the provision of adequate parks and recreation
opportunities for all citizens of the community.
Open space, both natural and developed, is one of the key features that defines the character of South
Pasadena and contributes to the quality of life that residents seek to maintain. Open space performs a
multitude of functions beneficial to the community: outdoor recreation; view-shed protection; conservation
of important natural resources, which provide a hospitable environment for a diversity of wildlife; flood and
erosion control; protection of the public health and safety; buffering between incompatible land uses; and the
enhancement of roads and public spaces.
Some 5% of the City are presently devoted to open space uses, including parks, golf courses, and passive
open space. As a built-out city, the challenge facing South Pasadena is to create an open space system that
does not solely consist of the unusable spaces leftover from development, but rather one which integrates
parks and playgrounds, connecting “corridors,” natural habitats, and natural and cultural resources into a
meaningful multipurpose network.
7.1A Purpose of the Element
The purpose of the South Pasadena Open Space and Resource Conservation Element is as follows:
•   To clearly identify the natural, environmental and cultural resources of the community;
•   To assure their stewardship by the establishment of appropriate resource-related development standards,
    including but not limited to those assuring the preservation of natural open space for the enjoyment of
    scenic beauty, for recreation, and for conservation;
•   To maintain and enhance those natural resource areas necessary for the continued survival of significant
    wildlife and vegetation, and to establish a proactively planned, coherent and connected system of open
    space to protect wildlife habitat and movement corridors as part of a larger, self-sustaining ecosystem;
•   To establish the basis for City collaboration with adjacent jurisdictions in broader open space and
    environmental resource management, including establishment of linkages with adjoining open spaces and
    trail systems; and
•   To maintain and promote the cultural, historic and archaeological heritage of the City.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                             VII-1
OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

7.1B Authorization and Scope
State legislation requires the inclusion of both an Open Space Element (Government Code Section 65302(c))
and a Conservation Element (Government Code Section 65302(d)) in all local government general plans.
Due to the interrelationship of the goals and policies of the Open Space Element and Conservation Element
and the overlap in State requirements, these two Elements are here combined into a single all-encompassing
Element.
The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies concerned with managing all open space areas,
including undeveloped “wilderness” lands and outdoor recreation uses. The Government Code directs that
open space should be preserved (1) for the preservation of natural resources, (2) for the managed production
of resources, (3) for recreation, and (4) for public health and safety.
The intent of the Open Space Element requirements is to assure cities and counties recognize open-space
land is limited valuable resource that must be conserved wherever possible. The purpose is also to assure
every City and County will prepare and carry out open-space plans which , along with state and regional open-
space plans, will accomplish the objectives of a comprehensive and integrated open-space program.
Although state law does not mandate the preparation of either a Parks and Recreation Element or a Trails
Element in the General Plan, these topics are often included in the Open Space Element which may
incorporate goals, policies and implementation programs specifically related to parks and recreation, focus on
the relationship of developed park space to a city’s entire open space system, and address the dedication and
provision of parkland, trails and recreation facilities.
The Conservation Element of the General Plan overlaps with provisions found in the open space, land use,
and public safety portions of the General Plan. It differs, however, in that it is almost exclusively oriented
toward natural and cultural resources. The Conservation Element contains goals and policies that further the
protection and maintenance of resources such as air, water, soils, vegetation and wildlife, minerals, and
archaeological and historic sites, and prevents their wasteful exploitation, degradation, and destruction.
“Man-made” resources, or the “built” environment of the city - its architectural fabric - are included here
because of the citizen-stated desire to see their conservation.
7.1C Relationship to Other Elements
Policies of the Open Space and Conservation Element do often overlap with provision found in the Land
Use and Community Design, Circulation and Mobility, and Public Safety Elements of this General Plan
document.
There are a number of other plans and programs, either adopted or under preparation, that bear directly on
the aims and objectives of the Open Space and Conservation Element: the consortium of San Gabriel Valley
Cities’ Air Quality Element and the City’s own Master Plan of Parks and Recreation. The relevant goals and
policies from these plans and programs, where appropriate, have been incorporated into the Element to the
fullest degree possible.

7.2       EXISTING CONDITIONS
7.2A Development Parklands and Facilities
The parks and recreational facilities within the City of South Pasadena are valued and highly regarded by
South Pasadena’s citizens. Community parks provide open space and a place to go for active recreation or
passive enjoyment of the outdoors. Neighborhood parks and playgrounds within the City of South Pasadena
are designed to serve as a place for family recreation within a convenient distance from home.
•   Community and Neighborhood Parks
Currently there are 92.2 acres of parks within the City of South Pasadena. The majority of this acreage (73.9
acres) is located in Arroyo Seco Park in the northwest portion of the City. Five other parks exist within the
City boundaries: Garfield Park, Eddie Park, Library Park, Orange Grove Park and War Memorial Park.
Not included in the total is Lot 117 in the Altos de Monterey residential tract, which the City owns. This
unimproved 15.89 acre site presents an opportunity for habitat protection and urban open space, free of
development.
Table VII-1 lists these parks with corresponding acreage and facilities.

includes the historic Eddie House, group barbecue area, and an open lawn area and small play area. The park
is framed by a three-foot high brick wall. The two story Eddie House and grounds were donated to the City
by the Eddie family. The 2,200 square foot building is an example of Transitional Craftsman architecture.
Only the first floor is utilized as a meeting place for various groups and programs that include: a
toddler/parent education program from Pasadena City College, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, and an
Alcoholics Anonymous group.
•    Library Park
Library Park consists of 2 acres of landscaped grounds surrounding the South Pasadena Library at El Centro
Street, Diamond Avenue, Fairview Avenue and Oxley Street. The park landscape consists of mature trees,
mounded grass areas and meandering walkways. Library Park is a passive neighborhood park which reflects
the low key activities and functions of the Library and the Senior Center. The Senior Center consists of 800
square feet of space with a separate entrance on the north side of the library building. On the south side of
the Library, there are four benches, two bicycle racks and trash receptacles. The grassy mounds are favorite
places to read and relax. Programs and activities at Library Park are primarily related to the Library and
Senior Center functions.
•    Orange Grove Park
The 2.5 acre rectangular shaped Orange Grove Park is located at Mission Street and Orange Grove Avenue.
As one of the City’s older parks, the site was formerly a beer garden and gaming house in 1886. Today,
Orange Grove Park is an active recreation park providing facilities for a lighted softball and soccer field, 2
lighted tennis courts, and a small playground. Orange Grove Park has a two-story 9,500 square feet
recreation building. The first floor of the building is used for recreation and day care programs. It is also
equipped with a restroom accessible from the both inside and outside of the building. The second floor
serves as a meeting room for the Chamber of Commerce and other groups. It also provides space as book

storage for the Friends of the South Pasadena Library. Other park amenities include: drinking fountains,
picnic tables, bleachers, and a bicycle rack.
•    War Memorial Park
The two-acre War Memorial Park located on Fair Oaks Avenue provides a site for the two-story 12,000
square feet War Memorial building. The War Memorial building was built in 1921 and is identified as a city
cultural heritage landmark. The building was built on the former Oak Law Park with funding from city bonds
and donations from the American Legion. The upper floor of the building includes a kitchen and a large
multi-purpose room for dancing, meetings, banquets and other activities for groups up to 200 people. The
lower floor consists of smaller rooms, storage and restroom facilities but is currently not utilized. The
grounds north of the building are dedicated for a landscaped memorial garden.
Each of these parks is shown on the Open Space & Resources Component of this General Plan, included in
Figure 1 at the end of this chapter.
•    School Recreation Facilities
School recreation facilities are owned and operated by the South Pasadena Unified School District. Fields,
courts, and playgrounds are available for the use of students during school hours and available to the general
public after school, on the weekends, and in the summer.
There are 51.22 acres of school recreation facilities in South Pasadena that help meet the recreation needs of
residents. Table VII-2 identifies each school site and the approximate acreage of areas used for recreation.

•    Institution and Quasi-Public Facilities
In addition to parks and schoolyards, additional recreation resources in the city include private and
institutional facilities. Private and institutional facilities include private schools, the YMCA, and many local
churches that provide additional programs and gathering places.
Privately developed, “open-to-the-public-for-a-fee” enterprises on city-owned land are common. The golf
course facility in Arroyo Seco Park is privately owned, maintained and operated, and open to the public: the
land is leased from the City. The stables in Arroyo Seco Park are privately owned and maintained, also on
land leased from the City.
7.2B Public/Quasi-public Recreation Programs
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                VII-5
OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

The Parks and Recreation Department of the City offers an active schedule of quality programs. New and
creative approaches to recreational programming for a continually changing community are being
implemented. Programs are provided for a range of age groups and it is the Department’s policy that these
programs be accessible to all residents. Programs are offered at various locations throughout the City in order
to maximize the number and variety of offerings. The City also provides facilities for use by Little League,
soccer leagues and other organized sports activities, which are the primary users of City owned and
maintained sports fields.
Recent trends in recreational programs in the City are geared toward the youth of the City. Table VII-3
describes youth programs and the number of children enrolled in programs.

In order to provide complete programs for residents, the City also works with community groups and
businesses to offer cooperative and interfacing programs. Private, youth oriented organizations utilize a
variety of facilities within the City. The YMCA sponsors a number of recreational programs, including
athletic instructional programs for the community. The City cooperates with the YMCA to meet the
recreational needs of the community.
7.2C Unimproved or “Natural” Open Space
Natural features help define South Pasadena’s borders. Raymond Hill, to the north, overlooks the city of
Pasadena. The Monterey Hills, in the southwest, straddle South Pasadena’s border with Los Angeles. The
dry watercourse of the Arroyo Seco, arising in the San Gabriel Mountains and extending to the Los Angeles
River, traces the western boundary of the city.
The City seeks to strike balance between accommodating growth, providing recreational relief and developed
open space amenities for residents, and conserving the natural environment as an exercise of responsible
stewardship.
•    The Arroyo Seco
The Lower Arroyo Seco provides not only opportunities for recreation but also the potential for a wildlife
ecosystem within the City limits. The development of recreational opportunities and protection and
restoration of the ecosystem, while recognizing the important flood control functions of the area, should be
encouraged.
Along the northeast and east sides of town, the former creek, now flood channel, defines the city boundary
and, though traversing residential fabric, it in certain portions provides an already established riparian and
wildlife corridor.
•    Hillside Areas
The hillsides and ridgelines of South Pasadena provide a scenic backdrop for the entire community. Because
of the view, potential ridgelines are often the first choice of developers to locate homes.
  VII-6                                                     CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

Protection of the City’s hillside areas is a matter of ensuring that development minimizes severe alteration of
landform, flood problems, soil erosion, and slide damage. It is also a matter of protecting the “view-shed,”
both from and to these hillsides, and retaining as much natural vegetation as possible.
The City has adopted a Hillside Development Ordinance to guide development and protect this natural
resource. It is the intent of the General Plan to put “teeth” to and strengthen this ordinance, to encourage
sensitive forms of development which complement the natural and visible character of the City and its
hillsides.
•     Lot 117, Altos de Monterey
The City owns 15.89 acres of unimproved land in the Altos de Monterey hillside residential tract, commonly
referred to as Lot 117. This area is considered an open-space resource to the neighborhood, with no facilities
or amenities provided.
•     Private Undeveloped Open Space
Certain open space lands which do not lend themselves to development or active recreational use have been
left in their natural state, maintained under private developments or ownerships rather than under the
responsibility of the local jurisdiction.
Such open space lands include the undeveloped portions of hillsides; steeply sloping topography and canyons
in the Monterey Hills, Altos de Monterey and other hillside residential tract developments: greenbelts and
easements within a few recently-developed housing tracts; and the easements and right-of-way discussed
hereinafter.
7.2D “Sensitive” Environmental Resources
Very often constraints to development are, in fact, sensitive environmental resources. Constraints as defined
here can include:
          •    Significant topographic, geologic and hydrologic features such as ridgelines, knolls, fault lines,
               liquefaction zones, and other similar features determined by the Community Development
               Department to be important to the physical and environmental character of a property.
          •    Significant environmental features of the site, including but not limited to riparian habitat,
               significant ecological areas, slopes in excess of 30% grade, fault zones including Alquist-Priolo
               Special Studies Zones; significant and heritage trees as defined by City ordinance.
          •    Fuel modification zones required by City ordinance; and
          •    Subsurface or surface utility easements and rights-of-way not held by the City to be suitable for
               construction of residential structures.
7.2E Abandoned Easements and Rights-of-way
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                VII-7
OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

Flood control channels and their often-abutting service roads, utility easements, and abandoned railroad
rights-of-way are frequently undiscovered and unused resources in open space planning and management, and
such is the case in South Pasadena.
Even more actively maintained properties, such as reservoir sites or the City’s water tower property, may have
multi-use potential as open space resources.

7.3       FUTURE CONDITIONS
7.3A Park Planning Parameters
Neighborhood parks characterize South Pasadena, designed to accommodate the needs of its various
neighborhoods. These parks provide a place for family recreation within a convenient distance of the home.
They are located and designed to serve generally the same area as an elementary school, i.e. 4,000 to 6,000
people. However, the size of a neighborhood park depends on the population within its service area and the
extent of amenities provided, generally ranging from about 2 to 5 acres. The following facilities are usually
provided within a landscaped setting:
                   •   Play lot and Mothers area.
                   •   Play area and equipment for elementary school age children.
                   •   Paved area for court games.
                   •   Field for organized sports.
                   •   Family picnic area.
                   •   Other special facilities - clubhouse, tennis courts, wading pools, etc.
The following guidelines should be used to meet the City’s park space needs:
          Planning Guidelines:      Four (4.0) acres of park and recreation facilities per 1,000 persons
          Population served:        4,000 to 6,000 residents per park.
          Service area:             All residential areas within 1/2 miles distance from a neighborhood park.
          Park area:                Between 2 and 5 acres.
7.3B Community Needs Assessment
South Pasadena presently has an adequate supply of parks and playgrounds to meet this requirement.
Additional parkland acquisition to meet accessibility requirements should be ranked with other city capital
priorities as they are described within the park improvement plan.
Table VII-4 reflects a goal of 108 acres of improved parkland, established for the community at buildout
population, based on the City’s standard of 4.0 acres of parkland per 1,000 population. The current improved
parkland facilities adequately address the needs of both the current population and the forecast population at
buildout. When school recreation facilities are incorporated into the assessment, calculated at 50% of usable
acreage to account for use restrictions, a surplus of 32.6 acres of parkland exists. Inclusion of Lot 117 - Altos
de Monterey in the inventory would increase the available parkland assets even further.

      4.  Population estimate based on Table II-4 (11,652 dwelling units x 2.34 persons per unit).
Currently, there are no planned additions to existing parks and/or recreational facilities. The municipal
plunge, formerly located at Orange Grove playground, was closed in the late 1970’s. Previously, the
community had identified the desire for a community center/gymnasium.
7.3C Sources of Funding
•    Acquisition and Development
The Quimby Act, enacted by the State in 1965, provided an implementation mechanism for local park
development. This legislation enabled local agencies to require dedication of local park acreage, the payment
of fees, or a combination thereof, as part of the subdivision process. The Quimby Act set a standard for a
parkland-to-population ratio of 3 acres of parkland per 1,000 population, unless the City has already
established a higher rate, as in the case of South Pasadena, which is set at 4 acres per 1,000 population.
As currently amended, the Quimby Act allows the City to require, by ordinance, dedication of land or impose
payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for neighborhood parks and recreation purposes.
The Quimby Act provides that the ordinance must set definite standards for dedication of land and the
amount of any fee to be paid in lieu thereof. The City has not established such a regulatory mechanism for
the collection of fees and land dedications for acquisition and development of new parks and/or
rehabilitation of existing parks and recreation facilities.
Acquisition funding is limited and may compete with funding needed for ongoing maintenance of existing
facilities and equipment as well as with other City needs. Because the City does not require land dedication or
in-lieu fees for new or infill development, the potential annexation and acquisition of the 8.6 acre “Arroyo
Annexation Focus Area” property for open space or recreational purposes would require implementation by
other funding sources, including such mechanisms as a Parkland Bonds or General Assessment Bonds.
Other funding options can include corporations, individuals, and foundations. The private sector is a viable
resource.
  VII-10                                                              CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                       OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

•    Operations and Maintenance
The Public Works Department is responsible for the maintenance of parks in the City.
The Parks and Recreation Department is responsible for park operations and recreation programs. Sources
of revenue for the Department of Parks and Recreation include camp fees, summer and spring; after-school
activity fees, building rentals, contract classes, and special activities fees.
7.3D Commercial Recreation Potential
The private sector represents a relatively untapped resource to the City with respect to the provision of
recreation facilities.
Opportunities for joint public/private development of recreational facilities in the City appear to be many,
and this and the possible commercial operation and maintenance of existing facilities warrant further studies.
7.3E Sensitive Resources: Natural and Built
Conservation of resources includes undeveloped lands that contain open space for the preservation of natural
resources, wildlife habitat, open space, open space for public safety, and conservation of cultural/historical
resources.
•    Conservation/Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
As the remaining parcels of land in the City are considered for development, additional pressures will be
placed on the natural environment. Natural and/or primarily undisturbed territory may potentially diminish
further, resulting in loss of wildlife or alteration of wildlife distribution, a loss of open space resources and
wildlife habitat, and visual relief from the built environment.
The remaining undeveloped or primarily undisturbed open space in the City, located primarily in the
following areas, represents opportunities for conservation, habitat protection and open space use:
            •   The canyons, hillsides and steep topography in the Monterey Hills, and the primarily City-
                owned vacant, undeveloped lands in the southwest corner of the Monterey Hills;
            •   The Arroyo Seco and adjacent areas;
            •   Lot 117 in the Altos de Monterey residential tract;
            •   The drainage wash east of Garfield;
            •   The vacated railway easement (between Marengo and Fair Oaks).
            •   Upper slopes in the Monterey Road/Pasadena Avenue/Kolle Avenue/Brunswick
                Avenue/Oak Hill Avenue residential areas.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                  VII-11
OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

The Land Use Element also establishes a “Focus Area” to evaluate land outside of the City limits adjacent to
the Arroyo Seco Channel, termed the Arroyo Annexation, for potential annexation into the City. The intent
is to augment the City’s open space resources through a natural extension of presently undeveloped land.
These lands contain natural resources, such as steep slopes, canyons, hillside vegetation (both native and
introduced), wildlife travel corridors, drainage courses and vegetation associated with rainfall runoff. Some
contain natural resources that can act as a constraint to development; some provide important food source
and shelter for wildlife and potential connections to significant open space uses; all help to define the area’s
environmental and urbanized character.
•    Conservation/Open Space Used for the Managed Production of Resources
Open space for the managed production of resources, by definition, includes agricultural lands, areas of
economic importance for the production of food or fiber, and areas containing major mineral deposits. In
the City of South Pasadena, agriculture and mining are neither current nor anticipated land uses; neither are
there any designated Mineral Resource Zones for areas possessing minerals which are of state-wide or
regional importance.
•    Conservation/Open Space for Public Health and Safety
South Pasadena must protect the public health and safety of the community. This involves the identification
of areas that pose a potential threat to health and safety, as well as the implementation of proper planning
techniques to minimize potential health and safety threats. Such areas in the community requiring special
planning considerations to avoid potential hazards include: any 100-year floodplain zones, slopes over 20%
grade and wildland fire-prone areas.
There are no portions of the City located within the 100-year floodplain boundaries, as identified by the Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). A small portion of the southwestern corner of the City, in the Repetto hillside
area, is identified in the Los Angeles County General Plan as having wildland fire hazard potential. In
addition, dry grasslands, brush and wood shingle roofs provide fuel for potential fires caused by airborne
embers.
Thirty percent grades, representing a constraint to traditional and historical development practices, occur in
the hillside areas of the southwest portion of the City. The steeply sloped lands also define the natural
landform of South Pasadena and are an aesthetic resource.
•    Conservation of Historic and Cultural Resources
The City of South Pasadena has completed the Historical Resources Survey: Inventory of Addresses and
should use this inventory of significant historical and cultural resources to develop appropriate preservation
and conservation programs, guide the location of new developments and redevelopment projects away from
areas of significance, determine which properties should be nominated for National Register designation, and
generally raise the awareness level of the community to its heritage.

7.3F The “Ambient” Environment
The “ambient” environment - our air and water quality, and our energy resources - can be expected to
continue to degrade and deplete without innovation in the conservation of these resources and rededication
of effort. These resources, just as much as the more tangible “sensitive” natural resources of the community,
warrant attention.
7.3G Connecting Paths and Linkages
•     Existing Recreational Trails
The City of South Pasadena has approximately 1.2 miles of combined hiking/equestrian trails located within
Arroyo Seco Park. The Arroyo Seco equestrian trails provide linkage to other trails in Pasadena north of the
stables on San Pascual Avenue, outside the City’s jurisdiction.
Class I and III bike trails, primarily the Class I - Arroyo Seco Trail, provides linkage from South Pasadena
south to Lincoln Heights and north to the City of Pasadena. There is a proposed Class II bike trail in
Pasadena which would extend south from Del Mar Street in Pasadena to Columbia Street and would ideally
provide linkage to the City. Table VII-5 provides a description of these bike trails by class.

        I            Bike Path or Trail. A separate right-of-way for bicycles; typically fenced and found along
                     flood control channels and the beach. Access is limited to designated points.
        II           Bike Lane. A restricted right-of-way for bicycles, most often designated by a painted line
                     and signs on the road. Motor vehicles are permitted to use the bike lane to make turns
                     and to park.
       III           Bike Route. A travel lane shared by bikes and motor vehicles, designated by signs only.
                     This type of bikeway does not provide cyclists with increased privileges, but rather,
                     informs motorists of the preferred cycling route.
    * According to the Los Angeles County of Transportation, 1992
According to the Department of Parks and Recreation, a state-proposed Rim of the Valley Riding and Hiking
trail would extend from the existing L.A. County Devil’s Gate-Arroyo Seco Riding and Hiking trail (near the
Foothill freeway) south through South Pasadena to the County proposed Los Angeles River Trail Extension
near the Golden State freeway.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN                                                                        VII-13
OPEN SPACE & RESOURCE CONSERVATION ELEMENT

 7.4 ISSUES
The primary open space and conservation issues in South Pasadena are:
7.4A Adequate Parks and Recreation Programs
Existing park facilities and recreation programs may not continue, over time, to adequately address the
recreation needs of their users. The ability of government to provide recreational facilities and programs, or
to assure their ongoing maintenance, is increasingly limited. It is an important goal that the children of the
community are offered enough quality programming to keep them interested in positive activities. The
corridor of the proposed Route 710-freeway extension, adjacent to if not directly passing through Orange
Grove Park, threatens the City’s only “hub” for recreation programs.
7.4B Maintenance of Streetscapes
Municipal streetscapes are an oft-forgotten portion of the City’s developed open space system. These
landscaped corridors provide daily open space relief to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, and add to the
character of the city. The City is known as “The City of Trees” with over 21,000 street trees and mature
vegetation presenting a lush and kept appearance. The issue is how to maintain and enhance this landscaped
heritage through sensitive design, appropriate regulations, and adequate funding.
7.4C Sensitive Resource Protection
The City must strike a balance between accommodating growth and providing recreational amenities for
residents, and conserving what remains of the natural environment of the City. Wildlife and their habitats,
sensitive environmental features and natural resources, and the prominent landforms of the City that establish
its character - now more than ever, these must be preserved. Very often, areas of great natural distinction and
amenity represent development opportunities, particularly in a nearly built-out community.
So too with the built environment. Some of the past must be conserved to remind us of the City’s heritage,
to establish a sense of place. How much and where, are the pivotal questions. The issue is striking that
balance.

7.4D Environmental Conservation
Improving air quality has long been an issue in the Los Angeles basin. The value of vegetation as a significant
filter to pollution is now generally recognized. Water conservation, energy conservation, and decreased
reliance on fossil fuels is gaining increasing importance in southern California: all are critical issues to South
Pasadena as well.
The City has taken affirmative steps in the air quality arena through its participation in the San Gabriel Valley
Consortium of Cities’ preparation of an Air Quality Element for the region. The Circulation and Accessibility
Element of this Plan bears witness to an earnest effort to reduce vehicular dependence in every day life.
Solid waste management has become an issue as available landfill space decreases. The City prepared a
Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) in 1991, to comply with Assembly Bill AB 939 in meeting
state requirements for a targeted reduction of waste.

          the joint use of facilities for recreational purposes.
1.4:      Set priorities for new capital improvements for those facilities located in areas that are presently
          under-served by parks and explore innovative ways and means of financing the maintenance and
          operation of athletic fields and game courts located on all recreational sites.
1.5:      Incorporate public plazas and open space amenities in new or infill non-residential development
          projects.
1.6:      Discourage site development and facilities that compromise the natural setting, natural vegetation
          and open space of the Arroyo Seco.
GOAL 2:           To permit joint development of certain recreational opportunities with private
                  enterprise on city-owned property.
Policies:
2.1:      Identify joint public/private development opportunities, establish performance standards, and
          solicit competitive private sector proposals for certain recreational facilities.
2.2:      Continue to permit operation of established equestrian facilities on city-owned lands in the Arroyo
          Seco. (See pg. II-28, Section 16.11)

Streetscape & Public Spaces
GOAL 3:           To maintain South Pasadena’s established image as “a city of trees” and enhance
                  roadways and urban open spaces by the inclusion of landscaping.
Policies:
3.1:      Establish and maintain a master plan for street trees on all City streets, including major arterials and
          infill of the incomplete landscape links on streets already lined with trees.
3.2:      Cooperate with any local area groups or neighborhood residents in their efforts to beautify their
          streets with landscaping.
3.3:      Develop standards and guidelines that encourage conservation of vegetation rather than installation
          of “hardscape” in the public right-of-way.
Preservation of the Open Space
GOAL 4:           To preserve and maintain public and private open space and natural resources for the
                  enjoyment of the entire community, and to encourage a hospitable environment for
                  wildlife.
Policies:
4.1:      Retain significant trees wherever possible, particularly those that are rare, endangered or candidate
          species.

          compliance with that ordinance.
4.3:      Encourage preservation of the wide variety of plant communities in the hillside areas, and habitats
          that support diversity of wildlife species.
4.4:      Encourage the preservation or creation of wildlife travel corridors and vital links necessary to allow
          relatively free, sheltered movement between green areas and habitat throughout the City. Avoid
          site development that isolates an area without a natural/year-round link to other habitat areas.
4.5:      Control existing and future commercial development of parklands in the Arroyo Seco.
Preservation of Scenic Resources
GOAL 5:           To preserve and protect the scenic and visual quality of the community.

7.6      IMPLEMENTATION
7.6A The Open Space and Resources Component of the Plan
The Open Space and Resources Component Map of the General Plan reflects the foregoing policies and is
presented in Figure VII-1 hereinafter.
Open Space Classifications
The Open Space and Resources Component Map depicts six categories of open space: parks, schoolyards,
commercial recreation, open space “corridors”, hillside areas, and other natural open space.
Parks - The parks designation is applied to open space areas that provide active and passive forms of
recreation. These areas are owned by the City and accessible to all residents.
Schoolyards - The schoolyard designation is applied to public school sites, owned by the South Pasadena
Unified School District. Private schools provide additional recreational facilities to the community but are
not accessible to all residents and therefore not identified.
Commercial Recreation - The commercial recreation designation is applied to areas that provide active forms
of recreation which require a user fee. Typical commercial recreation uses are golf courses, YMCA, tennis
courts, etc.
Open Space “Corridors” - The open space “corridors” designation is applied to greenbelts, landscaped
corridors, easements and existing or abandoned utility and railroad right-of-way. These areas have value in
that they provide open space relief within the immediacy of the developed urban setting.
Hillside Areas - The hillside area designation is applied to those areas identified for inclusion in the “Hillside
Overlay Zone.” In order to preserve significant open space areas in the City’s undisturbed hillside areas, the
City has adopted a Hillside Development Ordinance. For properties within South Pasadena with an average
slope of 20% or greater, undisturbed hillside and slope areas will be preserved as open space conservation
areas through the property owner dedication of upper and lower slopes of lots (either presently developed or
yet to be developed) to the City under an open space easement, subject to standards established by the
Hillside Ordinance.
Other Open Space - The other open space designation incorporates such areas as reservoir sites, the water
tower grounds, other municipal open space ownership, and flood control channels and easements. Lot 117
within the Altos de Monterey is included in this category; the City will preserve it in its natural State as an
open space conservation area.
Additionally, the Component Map shows the location of designated historic landmarks and historic districts
in the City, and displays existing and proposed bicycle, equestrian and walking trail access to many of the
natural and “built” resources shown.

Chapter VIII
SAFETY &
         NOISE ELEMENT
8.1      INTRODUCTION
South Pasadena’s General Plan is required to address the health and well-being of its citizens and businesses.
Issues related to protecting the community from natural and man-made hazards are the central focus of the
Safety and Noise Element.
This Chapter considers the public health and safety from the several different perspectives of geological hazards
and the potential of slope instability, structural building collapse in a seismic event, inundation from reservoir
collapse or one-hundred year storms, the unrest and physical harm of civil commotion, brush or urban
wildfires, emergency preparedness and disaster response, community evacuation, disease prevention and
community health, hazardous waste, noise pollution and air and groundwater pollution.
The City of South Pasadena receives its health services through the County of Los Angeles - the Alhambra
office. Some programs are administered through the South Pasadena Senior Center.
8.1A Purpose of The Element
The Safety and Noise Element is a combined element which formally incorporates the requirements of State
Law. The Safety Element, which is intended to provide a planning framework for the protection of the
community from natural and man-made hazards, and the Noise Element, which is intended to identify noise
sensitive land uses and noise sources and to provide for the protection of the community from the adverse
affects of excessive noise.
8.1B Scope and Authority
This Element identifies specific hazards that have the potential to impact the human population and the built
and natural environments of the City of South Pasadena. Seismic activity, storm runoff and flooding, erosion,
wildfires and the degradation of air and water quality are the primary natural hazards. Exposure to hazardous
materials, improper sanitation and vector control, the potentials for dam inundation, the threat of civil
commotion and crime, and noise pollution are pertinent man-made hazards.
Air and water quality are separately and specifically addressed by sub-regional plans prepared or being prepared
by a consortium of West San Gabriel Valley cities. More within the domain of the State and County,
community health risks may be minimized by establishing supportive policy at those levels of government
intended to realize early intervention and mitigation of risk.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN VIII-1
SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT

8.1C Relationship to Other Elements
The combined Safety and Noise Element establishes goals and policies to guide local government decision-
making in noise, safety and community health-related matters. Noise conflicts may be mitigated through
adoption of specific policies intended to achieve land use compatibility with respect to noise in the community.
Through investigation of hazard risks, and careful land use planning to reduce or restrict development in high
risk areas, the potential for disaster can be reduced.
VIII-2                                                    CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN
                                                                           SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT
8.2        EXISTING CONDITIONS
This portion of the Chapter discusses South Pasadena’s readiness to cope with emergencies and the major natural and
man-made hazards that confront us. Local hazards are identified and goals and policies that will mitigate the hazards
are proposed.
8.2A Seismic and Geological Hazards
Geologic events, and seismic activity in particular, are the primary natural hazards of the community.
Earthquakes are caused by violent and abrupt releases of strain built up along faults. When a fault ruptures, energy is
released in all directions from the source, or epicenter, in the form of seismic waves. Earthquakes generate two types
of hazards. Primary hazards are ground shaking and surface rupture along faults. Secondary hazards result from the
interaction of ground shaking with existing ground instabilities and include liquefaction, settlement and landslides.
The City of South Pasadena is located in seismically active region, in an area of potential fault rupture, strong ground
shaking and slope instability. These geologic and seismic hazards can affect the structural integrity of structures and
utilities, and in turn can cause severe property damage and potential loss of life.
In California, faults are common, ranging from small breaks of an inch or less, to the San Andreas fault which extends
for hundreds of miles. In addition to size, the age of a fault has a direct bearing on the likelihood of generating an
earthquake. Many large faults have not moved for millions of years and are considered “dead” or inactive. The
Alquist-Priolo Zones Special Studies Act defines “active” faults as those that have experienced surface displacement,
or movement during the last 11,000 years. Faults classified as potentially active have moved during the last 2 million
years. Faults that have not moved within the last 2 million years are considered inactive.
Effective March 1999, the State Department of Conservation will be releasing twelve new seismic hazard zone maps
covering 63 cities in Los Angles and Orange County, including South Pasadena. New legal requirements for local
governments mandated by the State include requiring site investigation reports for certain properties prior to
permitting development and providing copies of such site investigation reports to the State Geologist.
•     Regional Faults
The seismicity of the Southern California region and its relationship to the City of South Pasadena are shown in
Figures VIII-1 and VIII-2. The faults identified on the map are potential sources of ground shaking within the City.
Principal among them are the Sierra Madre Fault system, the Whittier Fault, and the San Andreas Fault. An
earthquake anywhere on any of these faults could trigger secondary impacts in the City.
•     Local Faults
Three other faults influence the City of South Pasadena, the Raymond Hill Fault, the York Boulevard Fault, and the
Elysian Park Fault. Between these three faults, much of the City is subject to earthquake hazard.

•    Raymond Hill Fault
Raymond Hill Fault is the only active fault running through South Pasadena that is designated as an Alquist-
Priolo Special Study Zone. This fault is a reverse, left-slip, 12 miles in length, and extends through the southern
portion of South Pasadena. The Raymond Hill Fault is believed to have moved within the past 3,000 years and is
classified as an Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zone.
According to a 1973 report, an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude is assumed along the Raymond Hill-Santa Monica-
Malibu Coast fault on the average of about once in every 5,000 years. This rate suggests a recurrence interval of
about 500 years for a 6.5 magnitude event, and 100 years for a 5.6 magnitude event. A seismic event along the
Raymond Hill fault has the potential to generate surface rupture that would affect structures on and adjacent to
the fault. In addition, a seismic event could generate ground shaking and associated secondary impacts that could
affect areas beyond the immediate proximity of the fault.
•    York Boulevard Fault
The York Boulevard Fault was initially documented by the Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and
Geology, in a report prepared in 1970. The fault was believed to have run through the City of South Pasadena
south of the Raymond Hill Fault.. The report was later rescinded in 1975 after discovering that it contained
erroneous information. Today, the fault is commonly referred to as a parallel extension of the Raymond Hill
Fault, and therefore, is not depicted on Figure VIII-1. It has not been designated as an Alquist-Priolo Special
Studies Zone.
•    Elysian Park Fault
The Elysian Park Fault has been identified as a seismically active plane fault buried at a depth of
approximately 10 kilometers beneath the City. It underlies most of the City, including the 710 Freeway
extension through South Pasadena. Because the Elysian Park Fault is buried and runs horizontally
underground, it is not easily depicted on a map. As such, the fault is not included on Figure VIII-1. The
Elysian Park Fault is second to the Raymond Fault, only in that since it is buried, ground rapture is not
expected. In considerations of earthquake size and activity of the fault, it must be considered at least as
significant as the Raymond Fault.
Two independent modelings of the strong ground motions on the Elysian Park Thrust System/93, Sacci/94,
Heatman Wall, the behavior of the Thrust System is not well understood. However, if the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake, which occurred on a similar structure, is an indication earthquakes and magnitudes of 6.5 to 7.0
range are reasonable.
•    Other Seismic Hazards
Liquefaction of the soil, occurring during a quake and often caused by high water table, is of secondary concern.
The Los Angeles County Safety Element, however, indicates that South Pasadena is at low risk for liquefaction.

The principal threat in an earthquake is the potential for injuries or threat to human life due to damage or
collapse of structures, such as buildings, freeways, bridges, and other infrastructure. Pursuant to Section 8876 of
the California Government Code, cities and counties located within this Seismic Zone 4 are required to identify
all potentially hazardous buildings and establish a program for their mitigation. All potentially hazardous
buildings and mitigation programs have been reported to the Seismic Safety Commission by January 1, 1990.
Hazardous buildings, according to the General Plan Guidelines, are structure that are hazardous to life in the
event of an earthquake because they were constructed prior to the adoption and enforcement of building codes
requiring earthquake resistant building design; are constructed of unreinforced masonry; or include features that
are not capable of resisting or withstanding a seismic event.
The City of South Pasadena adopted Ordinance 1912, Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings. This
Ordinance establishes minimum standards for structural seismic resistance. The Ordinance also provides
systematic procedures and standards for the identification and classification of unreinforced masonry buildings.
Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be
structurally analyzed and anchored. An updated inventory of hazardous buildings was conducted in January
1992. The report identified 12 buildings in the City, including three within the Mission West Historical District,
that require structural reinforcement.
According to the 1996 Annual Report, four buildings still remain within the Mission West Historic District that
have not been structurally reinforced and six unreinforced buildings in the remainder of the City.
8.2C Runoff and Flood Control
•    Flooding Hazards
As part of the National Flood Insurance Program, floodplain studies have been conducted for various
communities in Los Angeles County, including the City of South Pasadena. The results of these studies are
presented on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), which identify 100 and 500-year floodplain boundaries.
The City of South Pasadena is located on Panel No. 0650671 of the FIRM maps. The entire City is located
within Zone C, which designates areas of minimal flooding. As there are no floodplain areas within the City,
there are no pertinent flood hazards.
•    Flood Inundation from Man-Made Structures
Reservoir or dam failure generally occurs for one of three reasons: as the result of ground shaking from an
earthquake in excess of design assumptions; structural instability; or from heavy rains in excess of design capacity.
In addition, reservoirs and dams located in seismically active regions may overtop due to seiche during seismic
activity or from seismically-induced landsliding. The resulting disaster could affect downstream communities and
neighborhoods located in the inundation area.
California Government Code § 8589.5 (1972) requires dam owners to submit to the Office of Emergency
Services maps showing inundation zones for catastrophic dam failure. The Office of Emergency Services is
responsible for designating areas with potential for loss of life and for reviewing procedures for population
control and evacuation below dams in the event of a dam failure.
Devils Gate Dam is located approximately 5 miles north of the northwesterly City boundary. This dam is part of
the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and is a concrete gravity dam. The dam has a capacity of 2,709
acres feet, and is 103 feet in height. However, the Dam has not retained its maximum capacity since the 1971

8.2D Police and Fire Protection
The South Pasadena Police and Fire Departments are the two city agencies responsible for public safety. These
services are funded through revenues generated by property tax. The Fire Department has a volunteer group and
an auxiliary group which supplement the Fire Department.
•    Fire Services
The South Pasadena Fire Department provides fire protection and medical emergency response service within
the City. Additionally, the Department provides annual business fire inspections, residential fire inspection of
three units or more, weed abatement of hazardous brush areas and fire sprinkler inspections.
The Department also has a hazardous materials coordinator and a full disclosure program.
The Fire Department operates one fire station located at 817 Mound Avenue. The Department on duty
personnel currently consists of nine dual role paramedic/firefighters. Current citywide departmental resources
include two front-line triple combination pumpers, one having a 65 foot telesquirt ladder; one back-up paramedic
ambulance; one salvage/overhaul vehicle with mobile air compressor; one back-up paramedic squad; and one
reserve triple combination pumper.
The City maintains a full service Fire Department, including 24 sworn personnel, one chief, and one fire
prevention specialist. Additionally, the Department maintains a volunteer program and an auxiliary program
composed of 10 volunteer firefighters and 14 auxiliary firefighters who are trainees intending to pursue a career
in fire service.
The majority of the personnel are Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) trained. The Department also maintains a
trailer outfitted for USAR operations. Additionally, most of the personnel are trained in Swift Water Rescue
which specializes in water related rescue operations.
The emergency response time of the Department ranges from three to six minutes for calls within the City
boundaries. The number of personnel responding depends on the type of incident. Types of incidents range
from a basic medical call with two responding personnel, to a structure fire call with eight responding personnel.
A second station is being considered for the southwestern portion of the City. This station would lower
response time, create better freeway access, and provide stronger regional support.
The City of South Pasadena is currently a signatory to automatic aid agreement with the Pasadena Fire
Department, City of Los Angeles Fire Department, and San Marino Fire Department. Automatic aid means that
the South Pasadena Fire Department, if available, would respond to another jurisdiction as the first due unit, or
as part of the first alarm response. In most instances this means that the closest unit responds regardless of
jurisdiction. The City also is a signatory to statewide and countywide mutual aid program whereby agencies with
depleted resources may call upon others for assistance during major emergencies. The City is a signatory to the
Verdugo Dispatch Center in Glendale along with Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena, South Pasadena, and San Marino.

•   Police Services
The South Pasadena Police Department (SPPD) is a full service police agency serving the community. The
Department is currently undergoing a full organizational transformation to a Neighborhood Oriented Policing
Philosophy. Under this operating philosophy, the Department and all of its operations will be closely linked to
specific neighborhoods throughout the city. All of the Police Department’s efforts are coordinated with and
developed in cooperation with a very active, committed citizenry.
The Police Department has an authorized strength of 34 sworn police officers and 18 civilian employees. These
individuals are deployed in such a way as to provide top quality policing service 24 hours a day, seven days a
week to the residents of South Pasadena. In addition to the full time employees, the SPPD has a long standing
reserve program. Through this program, the size of the uniformed force is almost doubled, with over 30
individuals volunteering large blocks of time to the Department and the community.
The Department is committed to a high quality of service with a strong emphasis on the traditionally very rapid
response to demands for police service (within 3 minutes for in-progress calls, under 10 minutes for most
requests for police service) coupled with high quality service once the officers arrive on the scene. There is
regular cooperation and coordination with surrounding police agencies (Pasadena, San Marino, Alhambra,
LAPD). This offers the best opportunities for apprehension of criminals and reduction of losses and crime in
South Pasadena.
8.2E Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Response
The City has an adopted Disaster Response Plan, administered by the City Manager’s Office. The Disaster
Response Plan, incorporated by reference into the General Plan, details responsibilities and roles of the City staff
and supporting entities in the event of a major natural or man-made disaster. The maintenance of the Disaster
Response Plan is important to meet the emergency protection needs of the General Plan buildout population.
Additionally, the Public Safety Commission has developed a program that complements the Disaster Response
Plan by supporting it with the Community Emergency Response Team.
The City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is located in the City Hall. The Emergency Operations
Activation Procedures set forth responsibilities, personnel, and information necessary to establish the Emergency
Operations Center and respond to disasters.
8.2F Violence Prevention
The City currently sponsors and actively supports such programs as D.A.R.E., Neighborhood Watch, the Safety
Fair and the Coalition Against Neighborhood Violence. A public health approach considers four elements in
violence prevention:
    •    The HOST of violence or intentional injury -- the at-risk adult or youth who may be injured or who may
         injure him/herself or another person.
    •    The AGENT of intentional injury -- usually a gun, knife, blunt object or fist.
    •    The PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT -- home, neighborhood, school or work-place.
    •    The SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT -- shaped by racism, the media, alcohol, other drugs, family disarray
         and despair.

8.2G Hazardous Waste Storage and “Hazmat” Transport
A material is considered hazardous when it exhibits corrosive, poisonous, flammable and/or reactive properties,
and has the potential to harm human health and the environment. Hazardous materials are generally substances
used to produce high technological products. In contrast, hazardous wastes are chemical remains. These
substances are no longer usable and need treatment and/or disposal. Storage, transport and disposal of these
materials require careful and sound management practices.
Hazardous materials are utilized by a number of businesses in South Pasadena, and several facilities are actual
hazardous waste generators. Any number of common household products - motor oil, old paints, cleaners,
aerosols, and pesticides - contain hazardous materials, potentially destined for disposal in landfills where they
could leach through the soil and contaminate groundwater. Current truck routes pass over streets on which are
located schools, hospitals and residential areas, perhaps not the most suitable routes for the transport of
hazardous materials.
State legislation requires local jurisdictions to do one of the following:
1)       Adopt a City Hazardous Waste Management Plan containing all of the required elements [per California
         Health and Safety Code, Section 25135.1(d)] that shall be consistent with the approved County
         Hazardous Waste Management Plan;
2)       Incorporate applicable portions of the approved County Plan, by reference, into the City’s General Plan;
         or
3)       Enact an ordinance which requires that all applicable zoning, subdivision, conditional use permits and
         variance decisions are consistent with the portions of the approved County Plan which identify general
         areas or citing criteria for hazardous waste facilities.
South Pasadena has presently adopted the County of Los Angeles’ Hazardous Waste Management Plan into its
plans and processes by reference.
Safe and responsible management of hazardous waste is critical to the protection of the public health and
environment and to economic growth. All segments of society generate hazardous waste, including service
industries, small businesses, hospitals, medical facilities, schools and households. It is anticipated that the
community will continue to produce hazardous waste, and therefore, require continued diligent management
of the material or waste.
8.2H Sanitation and Vector Control
Los Angeles County Health Department inspects and/or cites food-service establishments as well as any possibly
unhealthful condition within the City that may harbor rodents and disease.
The City of South Pasadena contracts for solid-waste collection and disposal throughout the community.
Hazardous waste is collected and disposed through special multiple-city drives. City sewer lines are connected to
the City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles Sewer System.
The City of South Pasadena has experienced resource limitations with regards to sanitary sewers. In the late
1980’s, the City of Los Angeles imposed a moratorium that directly affected the building potential for multi-
family in the west side of the City of South Pasadena. Although there are no current moratoriums on sewer

limitation and hook-ups, the development potential for the City will be directly impacted by the available sanitary

8.2I Noise and the Community
Land use compatibility with noise is an important consideration in the planning and design process. Some land
uses are more susceptible to noise intrusion than others, depending on the nature of activities expected with that
use. For instance, at educational facilities it is important to concentrate and to communicate. An interior noise
level in excess of 50 dBA may interfere with these activities. Similarly, interference with sleep may occur at 45
dBA from external noise sources, so the planning of residential land uses should address this as a standard.
Some land uses are more tolerant. These uses typically include activities that generate loud noise levels or those
that do not require verbal interaction, concentration or sleep. Commercial and retail facilities require very little
speech communications and therefore are generally allowed in noisier environments. Industrial areas can
generate loud noises that would interfere more with communications than any exterior transportation-related
noise.
In the future, the community may be exposed to significant unmitigatable noises due to major construction of
infrastructures and road improvements. Extensive grading by the use of heavy equipment will present a negative
impact to the community during the course of the construction. Although construction projects are considered
short term, mitigation measures and monitoring will need to occur in order to extend the greatest level of
protection to the community from excessive noise. The City will need to exercise great caution in addressing
projects with significant noise impacts to the community.
•    Sound Propagation
Noise sources may either be a “line source’ (e.g. a heavily traveled highway) or a “point source” (e.g. a stationary
engine or compressor). Highway traffic noise on high volume roadways simulates a “line source” and the drop-
off rate of sound with distance approaches “cylindrical spreading,” wherein a nominal 2.0 dBA drop occurs with
each doubling of distance between the noise source and the noise receiver.
Environmental factors such as the wind direction and speed, temperature gradients, the characteristics of the
ground (hard or soft) and the air (relative humidity), the presence of grass, shrubbery, and trees, often combine to
increase the actual attenuation achieved outside laboratory conditions to 4.5 decibels per doubling of distance.
Thus, a noise level of 74.5 decibels at 50 feet from a highway centerline would attenuate to 70.0 decibels at 100
feet, 65.6 decibels at 200 feet, and so forth. This is particularly true where the view of the roadway is interrupted
by isolated buildings, clumps of bushes or scattered trees, or the intervening ground is soft or covered with
vegetation and the source or receiver is located more than 3 meters above the ground.
In an area which is relatively flat and free of barriers, the sound resulting from a single “point source” of noise
spreads in a spherical manner away from the source, and drops by a 6 decibels for each doubling of distance or
20 decibels for each factor of ten in distance. This applies to fixed noise sources and mobile noise sources which
are temporarily stationary such as an idling truck or other heavy duty equipment operating within a confined area
(such as industrial processes).
Sound attenuation from a train resembles a line source near the railroad tracks and a point source at distances
beyond three-tenths of the train length.
•    Motor Vehicle Noise
Noise levels adjacent to roadways vary with the volume of traffic, the mean vehicular speed and the truck mix. It
takes a 26 percent increase in the traffic volumes on a given route to increase the adjacent noise levels by 3.0
dBA.
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN VIII-13
SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT

Changing the vehicle speed or truck mix has a more dramatic effect. Noise from motor vehicles is generated by
engine vibrations, the interaction between the tires and the road, and the exhaust system. As vehicle speed
increases, so does the noise from these areas of the vehicle. The noise level adjacent to a roadway is highly
dependent on vehicle speed, especially at lower speed levels. The highest speeds are typically measured midlink,
where traffic lights, stop signs and cross traffic provide less interference. In most areas, the average speed is
generally just below the posted speed limit.
•    Significant Noise Sources
Noise in South Pasadena is primarily generated by vehicular traffic. Traffic noise comes from traffic on surface
streets, from truck traffic on truck routes through town and from the Pasadena Freeway. Land uses adjacent to
these roadways in the City are affected by motor vehicle generated noise.
Secondary sources of noise in the City are generated by construction and maintenance activities associated with
both public and private works and development projects. In the future, the community may be exposed to
significant unmitigatable noise due to major construction of infrastructures and road improvements. Extensive
grading by the use of heavy equipment will present a negative impact to the community during the course of the
construction. Although construction projects are considered short term, mitigation measures and monitoring will
need to occur in order to extend the greatest level of protection to the community from excessive noise. A long
term source of significant construction noise would result in the event the 710 Freeway extension is approved.
While the City has gone on record as opposing the 710 Freeway extension, the City does support the Multi-Mode
Low Build alternative that would result in minimal and short term construction noise.
The City will need to exercise great caution in addressing projects with significant noise impacts to the
community. South Pasadena has taken a strong proactive position against this type of noise pollution by
establishing an ordinance in 1991 to prohibit the use of “gas powered leaf blowers” in the City. Also, noise
generated by aircraft, especially hovering helicopters, can be localized and temporary.
Current noise levels were monitored at six “sensitive receptor” locations in the City during a typical weekday in
September of 1993, encompassing both single-family and multi-family residential units and a convalescent
hospital. Measurements were made during the peak traffic hour to record maximum noise levels or during off-
peak conditions and then modified to reflect peak conditions. The “ambient environment” includes noise
emanating from the Pasadena Freeway (SR-110) and the local roadway network.
The findings are presented in Table VIII-1. Existing ambient noise levels range from 63.4 dBA to 70.6 dBA.
Noise levels exceeded 65 dBA, a typical standard for “sensitive locations”, at four of the six locations monitored.

 Source: The Planning Center: data from September 19, 1993
Five of the monitoring locations were located at residential sites; one measurement was at a convalescent facility.
The residential noise measurement locations consisted of single family residences along major roadways or
abutting freeways, with front yards and front doors often facing and at grade with the roadway. The noise level
measured at the convalescent hospital on Mission Street was 68.7 dBA in front of patient rooms facing the
roadway and therefore, outside the limits considered acceptable for this type of sensitive land use.
The measurement on Fair Oaks Avenue is representative of conditions at the middle school across the street, and
the measurement on Alhambra Road is representative of conditions at the park across the street and to the

exterior environment for the playgrounds and classrooms of educational facilities.

8.3      FUTURE CONDITIONS
8.3A Slope Instability
Slope stability is dependent on a number of interrelated factors such as rock type and degree of porousness, and
slope characteristics. In addition to geologic processes, climatic conditions, man-induced topographical
alterations and earthquakes also trigger failure of unstable slopes.
According to the Los Angeles County Safety Element, landslide areas exist in the Repetto Hills just inside the
western City boundary. The Monterey Road Landslide area, in the southwest portion of the City, is a particular
area of concern. Although small in geographic extent, the landslide area is extremely unstable in certain portions.
The extent of the landslide area is shown in Figure 3 below.
8.3B Structural Failure
Being an older City with numerous historic structures, South Pasadena has the potential for impacts associated
with the collapse of unreinforced masonry. A number of the structures are concentrated within the Fair Oaks
Corridor and Mission Street Specific Plan area, although a large number of unreinforced masonry residential
structures are scattered throughout the City. Many older residential structures also lack adequate foundations and
foundation anchorage. Building codes in use in the City need to be assessed to determine if they are sufficient
for the level of ground shaking anticipated in proximity to major faults.
8.3C Flood and Inundation
Because of the City’s situation on a sloping plateau above the Arroyo Seco, no real concern exists about flooding
on any significant scale. Heavy runoff from rain in hillside areas will continue to occasion localized flooding and
soil erosion.
There is a risk of dam inundation in the Arroyo Seco Valley in the event of the failure of the Devil’s Gate Dam.
Some consideration should also be given to the impact on homes below should the City’s water tower and
reservoirs be damaged in a seismic event.
8.3D Civil Commotion
The South Pasadena Police Department has long-standing operational procedures for dealing with civil
commotions of either a localized or widespread nature. For purposes of this document, a civil commotion can
be defined as any unlawful civil disruption or criminal disorder requiring the response of the majority of the
available on-duty police force.
Local civil commotions can generally be handled through the use of on-duty police personnel. For protracted
situations, including those that might extend beyond the city’s boundaries, the South Pasadena Police
Department has mutual aid agreements with neighboring cities (Pasadena, San Marino, Alhambra and Los
Angeles), or the South Pasadena Police Department has a plan for the organization to be divided in two and
placed on 12 hour shifts until the end of the civil commotion.

8.3E Brush and Urban Wildfire
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN VIII-17
SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT
•    Brush Fires
The major potential sources of wildland fire in South Pasadena are the Monterey Hills and Repetto Hills and the
natural brushlands of the Arroyo Seco. The steeper slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains on the north of
Pasadena and the vegetated Puente Hills slopes on the south pose a secondary threat to the City in that
windborne embers may travel long distances in the wind and ignite rooftops and/or areas of dry grasses.
The threat of wildland fire to the City is generally low. A small portion of the southwestern corner of the City is
identified in the Los Angeles County General Plan as having a high wildland fire hazard potential.
•    Urban Fire
Urban fire is always a potential threat to property and life. Certain development patterns pose more difficult fire
problems. These include multi-story, wood frame, high density apartment development; multi-story research
development; large continuous developed areas with combustible roofing materials; and facilities that use and/or
store hazardous materials. These situations exist in the City.
Features that affect fire control include type and use of structure, area of building, number of stories, roofing
materials, and exposure to the building.
8.3F Community Evacuation
The City has enjoyed a relatively risk-free past from severe natural or man-made catastrophes where community
evacuation has not been required. On a yearly basis, the City continues its participation with area wide and
county earthquake preparedness drills that would generate the greatest possible potential for community wide
mobilization. The primary agencies within the City that would be responsible for this task would be the Police
and Fire Departments, in conjunction with any local or state agencies that may be mobilized after the episode.
The Fire Department has particular concern regarding the evacuation of the older part of the Monterey Hills
from brush and structure fires. Due to the limited width of certain streets, effective community evacuation in
that area would be hindered. The City will need to explore various means of increasing the accessibility of
resident evacuation and emergency vehicle response.
8.3G Pollution Prevention and Disease Control
The primary threats of pollution that effect the City come in air and water pollution. Although no major
generators of air pollution exist within the City, its geographic location in relationship to the Southern California
air basin places the area in a non-obtainment area. Pollution from industrial thick sources and mobile sources
will be the continuing air quality issues in the future. The City will need to take every and all available efforts to
reduce the admissions of air pollution caused by mobile sources.
The City draws its primary water sources from the upper San Gabriel water basin that historically has had
acceptable water quality. Increased urbanization and sub-surface discharge of contaminants will ultimately have
an effect on the groundwater supply. Isolated instances of groundwater pollution have been experienced within
South Pasadena (i.e., removal of gas stations and appropriate remediation processes have occurred). The City
does have a cooperative agreement with the Metropolitan Water District to acquire additional water upon
demand.
In conjunction with other county and state services, the City will need to be vigilant regarding its living
environment so as to not foster the spread of contagious disease. Controlling the internal and external
conditions that perpetuate vermin and unsanitary conditions will greatly assist in accomplishing this goal.
Programs to facilitate community awareness of personal hygiene and proper food preparation will greatly reduce

the health risk. In the future, the City should consider adding a community-health component to its Public
Works Department to provide the oversight that is continually required.
8.3H Noise Impacts and Mitigations
Noise impacts on the South Pasadena of the future will be largely the same as today.
Based upon the empirical data provided by noise measurements, the highway traffic noise prediction model
developed by the Federal Highway Administration (RD-77-108) was used to evaluate existing noise conditions in
the study area. This model utilizes various parameters including the traffic volume, vehicle mix and speed, and
roadway geometry, to compute typical equivalent noise levels during daytime, evening and nighttime hours. The
restaurant noise levels are then weighted and summed over 24 hourly periods to determine the CNEL value.
Contours are derived through a series of computerized iterations to provide the 60, 65, and 70 CNEL locations.
These contour locations can be used as a planning tool to locate noise sensitive receptors away from major noise
generations. They apply only to first line receptors, as receptors set back further from the noise source will
benefit from the shielding provided by intervening land uses. The contours do not assume the presence of any
sound walls or barriers. In addition, the contours do not account for the fact that the Pasadena Freeway is
depressed throughout the City. However, it can be assumed that the depression would result in a dBA reduction
from levels identified in the table.
Land uses sensitive to noise will continue to include residences, schools, libraries, hospitals and convalescent
homes, and recreational receptors. Certain areas in the City will continue to be subject to noise levels higher than
is considered appropriate for these sensitive uses. For example, noise measurements showed that noise levels
currently exceed 65 dBA at South Pasadena Middle School on Fair Oaks Avenue, which is considered only
conditionally acceptable for outdoor classroom areas. A number of residential areas and perhaps some hospital
facilities will likely remain subject to higher than optimal noise levels as a result of traffic on adjacent streets.
The light rail system of the Blue Line may eventually replace the terminated Santa Fe rail service, a previously
significant noise source. Residential areas exist along the Blue Line’s route through the City, however, and
residences along the rail right-of-way may still experience noise levels in excess of acceptable levels. For these
reasons, the future noise contours would look the same as the existing noise contours.

traffic volume of 81,0001 vehicles, the 65 dBA contour is projected to be located 343 feet from the centerline of
the freeway with noise modeling. The noise measurement indicated 63.4 in proximity to the freeway in a
residential area.
•    Impact of Designated Truck Routes
Truck routes are so designated to direct large trucks onto roadways constructed for that purpose. In South
Pasadena, local and regional growth patterns over time have directed trucks into these routes. Recently-approved
projects have taken the additional noise into account; older development may not be constructed to appropriately
attenuate the higher noise levels.
Truck routes within the City of South Pasadena have been designated for the following roadways:
         •    Pasadena Avenue (West City limits to Mission Street)
         •    Mission Street (Pasadena Avenue to Fair Oaks Avenue)
         •    Fair Oaks Avenue (North City limits to Huntington Drive)
         •    Huntington Drive (South City limits to Garfield Avenue)
         •    Fremont Avenue (Huntington Drive to South City limits)
Traffic noise generation varies according to the number and types of trucks as a percentage of the total vehicles
using the roadway on a daily basis. Approximately 6 percent of the traffic along these routes are trucks, of which
50 percent are medium trucks. Medium-duty trucks are those with two axles and heavy-duty trucks are those
with three or more axles. Since heavy-duty vehicles create much higher noise levels during a pass-by, the
percentage of these trucks of the total mix is equally important.
Truck circulation is an important component of traffic flow in a City’s street network and provision of adequate,
well placed truck routes is essential to maintaining the smooth circulation of traffic flow. Truck routes should be
located such that truck travel on streets near residential areas is minimized, while facilitating the efficient
transport of commodities throughout the City.
•    Noise Standards
New development within the existing fabric can be subject to new noise standards. The following discussions
address those standards.

SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT

•    City of South Pasadena
The City of South Pasadena developed a Noise Element for its General Plan (1975) for use in local project
planning. The goal of the Noise Element is to identify present noise levels and set forth a program for the
control of noise levels that would be harmful to the health, safety and general welfare of the community. Some
general objectives of the Element include limiting the noise levels within residential areas, establishing compatible
land use adjacent to transportation facilities, and maintaining an ambient noise level within the City that will not
be physically or psychologically detrimental to the residents of South Pasadena. Lastly, it is the objective of the
element to establish appropriate standards and criteria for desirable sound levels and the identification of means
available to achieve the sound levels in the community.
The League of California Cities has suggested that community ambient (average noise level of all background
sounds) noise levels stay below the following levels identified in Table VIII-3.

The City of South Pasadena has a noise ordinance that provides noise guidelines and standards for significant
sound generators. Chapter 19A of the South Pasadena Municipal Code, Noise Regulations, limits building
construction activities including the operation of any pile driver, steam shovel, pneumatic hammer, derrick, steam
or electric hoist between the hours of 7 p.m. and 8 a.m. on Mondays through Saturdays, and on Sundays before
10 a.m. and after 7 p.m. within a residential zone or within a radius of 500 feet therefrom. These standards are
provided to limit noise during sensitive time periods.
•    State of California
Land Uses deemed noise sensitive by the State of California include schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term
care and mental care facilities. Many jurisdictions consider residential uses particularly noise sensitive because
families and individuals expect to use time in the home for rest and relaxation, and noise can interfere with those
activities. Some variability in standards for noise sensitivity may apply to different densities of residential
development, and single family uses are frequently considered the most sensitive. Jurisdictions may identify other
uses as noise sensitive such as churches, libraries, day care centers, hospitals and parks.

CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN VIII-23
SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT
Land uses that are relatively insensitive to noise include office, commercial and retail develpments. There is also
a range of insensitive noise receptors that include uses that generate significant noise levels or uses where the
level of human occupancy is typically low.
Table VIII-4 diagrammatically identifies “normally acceptable,” “conditionally acceptable,” “normally
unacceptable” and “clearly unacceptable” noise levels for various land use types. As shown therein, multiple
family residential land use is “normally acceptable” in exterior noise environments up to 65 CNEL and
“conditionally acceptable” up to 70 CNEL. Single family residential areas are “normally acceptable” up to 60
CNEL and “conditionally acceptable” up to 70 CNEL. Schools, libraries and churches are “normally acceptable”
up to 70 CNEL, as are office buildings and business, commercial and profession uses. Recreational uses, such as
water recreation, are “normally acceptable” up to 75 CNEL and “normally unacceptable” from 70 to 80 CNEL.
A “conditionally acceptable” designation implies that new construction or development should be undertaken
only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements for each land use type is made and needed noise
insulation features are incorporated in the design. By comparison, a “normally acceptable” designation indicates
that standard construction can occur with no special noise reduction requirements.
8.3I Metro Blue Line Safety Impacts
The proposed MetroBlue Line extension through South Pasadena has potential safety impacts. The pending
construction of the rail line along the MTA right-of-way will run from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles
through South Pasadena to a terminus in east Pasadena. As a result, the South Pasadena Police and Fire
Departments have determined that there may be public safety issues that may arise should the rail line proposal
be implemented.
The MTA plans permanent street closures on Fairview Avenue and Magnolia Avenue. Street closures are
expected to slow down the response time of the Fire Department by approximately 90 seconds, from an average
3 minute to 4.5 minute response time.
The proposal to construct a Blue Line rail station on Mission Street will result in a 90 second traffic blockage on
Mission Street during transition periods when trains are concurrently operating en route from Pasadena to Los
Angeles and to Pasadena from Los Angeles. During this time period, safety vehicles will not be able to cross on
Mission Street and must use alternative routes to cross the right-of-way.

8.4       ISSUES
The primary public safety and noise issues of concern in South Pasadena are:
8.4A Seismic and Geological Hazards
The City of South Pasadena is located within a seismically active region. South Pasadena is likely to experience a
strong earthquake sometime within the next 30 years which will be many times more powerful than the recent
Whittier and Sierra Madre quakes. Faults shown in Figure 1, addressing local and regional seismicity, should be
evaluated and a determination made of limitations to be imposed on any development in these areas. Although
few of these faults are within the City boundaries, in the event of major seismic activity the City has the potential
for landslides and severe ground shaking.
Land uses, such as hospitals, schools, fire stations and large auditoriums are most critical from a safety
standpoint, and may warrant high levels of planning precaution. Secondary consequences such as slope
instability, soil erosion, subsidence and groundwater contamination can impact hillside development.
8.4B Unreinforced Masonry Buildings
Being an older City containing a historic fabric, South Pasadena has the potential for impacts associated with the
collapse of hazardous structures. Unreinforced masonry commercial buildings, as well as residential structures
with unreinforced foundations or inadequate foundation anchorage, are scattered throughout the City. Building
codes in use in the City need to be assessed to determine if adequate protection exists for the level of ground
shaking anticipated in proximity to major faults.
8.4C Brush and Urban Wildfires
Brush and urban wildfires and adequate fire protection are matters of concern in both hillside areas, where dry
brush can abound, and the balance of the City, where natural wood roofs and compact conditions are common.
8.4D Community Protection and Disaster Preparedness
Police and fire protection is vital to a resident’s feeling of well being in a community. Residents in the
community pride themselves on the safe environment of their City. This environment is maintained by the
adequate provision of police and fire personnel, proper and maintained equipment and well-located facilities.
8.4E Violence Prevention
Preventing violence is vital to creating and securing a nurturing community for every person, regardless of age.
Violence in America is a major public health problem with alarming rates of rape, abuse, suicide and homicide
being recorded annually, both nationwide and in our neighboring cities of Los Angeles and Pasadena. In the
majority of reported cases, firearms are the instruments of death and youth are the main victims. Hand guns are
the leading cause of death among California’s youth -- more than drugs, car crashes, or any single disease. We
must deal with youth violence in South Pasadena through a proactive public health approach rather than by
relying exclusively on a reactive criminal justice-oriented strategy.
8.4F Hazardous Waste Storage and “Hazmat” Transport
CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA GENERAL PLAN VIII-27
SAFETY AND NOISE ELEMENT

Hazardous materials are utilized by a number of businesses in South Pasadena every day. Large amounts of
hazardous materials are transported over California’s highways. Any number of common household products
contain hazardous materials. Serious environmental problems occur when hazardous and household chemicals
are improperly disposed and these hazardous substances can leach through the soil to contaminate groundwater.
Storage, transport and disposal of these materials require sound management practices at all levels.
8.4G Noise Considerations
The planning process has not traditionally been concerned with noise. In many instances, noise problems have
been identified only after the noise sources have been allowed to establish in a community. It is now evident that
these situations can be avoided by considering noise generators and sensitive noise receptors as part of the
comprehensive planning process.
8.4H Community Wellness
The City of South Pasadena’s authority over public safety also includes public health.
City government should become observant of unhealthful conditions and be responsible for reporting them to
proper authorities for verification and possible correction.
Community wellness is improved whenever local governments and community organizations actively develop
positive relationships with county, state, and federal public health services, as well as with nearby emergency
rooms, established clinics and hospitals.
Health education for all ages and services for pre-natal care and for adult screening are available through public
and private agencies, and should be actively pursued and sponsored by the City.

8.5    GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL 1:         To minimize personal and property damage resulting from seismic hazards, including
                earthquakes and landslides.
Policies:
1.1:   Closely monitor the geologic special studies zones, which extend 350 feet on both sides of known and
       suspected faults (see Figure 1). Prior to development in any such zone, continue to require a study by a
       registered geologist or certified engineering geologist to determine exact location and nature of the fault
       and the probability and probable extent of earthquake damage.
1.2:   Pursue funding and programs to retrofit buildings in need of structural reinforcement.
1.3:   Include earthquake preparedness in all regular building inspections by the fire department.
1.4:   In all new residential construction, require that water heaters be bolted to the wall. Encourage owners of
       existing homes to bolt water heaters to the wall and encourage the use of tankless water heaters.
1.5:   Review and update the Disaster Response Plan on a regular basis, including incorporation of evacuation
       routes into the Disaster Response Plan.
GOAL 2:         To minimize risk to life and property from brushfires.
Policies:
2.1:   Map and identify areas of wildfire hazard.
2.2:   Maintain maximum standards for fuel modification zones between developed areas and natural areas in
       the Monterey Hills and Arroyo Seco. Fuel Modification Zones shall be maintained at private expense
       and on private property according to the applicable standards and regulations of South Pasadena Fire
       Department.
2.3:   Maintain annual inspection of hillside properties to reduce the potential for wild fire hazards.
2.4:   Maintain publicly owned properties to the same fuel modification standards as required for private
       property.

GOAL 3:          To ensure the protection of all residents from geologic and groundwater hazards.
Policies:
3.1:    Encourage critical structures that exist or may be built in the city (e.g., hospitals), to incorporate site-
        specific seismic design into the structure design.
3.2:    Promote opportunities for aquifer recharge, encouraging developers to minimize paved areas in new
        developments and requiring these areas to be interspersed with landscaping.
3.3:    Encourage, where feasible, use of turf block, decomposed granite, grasscrete or similar permeable
        surfaces rather than conventional pavement.
GOAL 4:          To protect citizens and property from use, transport and disposal of hazardous
                 materials.
Policies:
4.1:    To the extent required by state and federal law, require an environmental audit for all new commercial
        and industrial development, including submittal of a site inspection report describing any pre-existing
        contamination of land, groundwater and structures. The site inspection report shall also specify steps to
        be taken to correct the problem prior to development.
4.2:    Promote informational brochures summarizing hazardous waste management plans, including any
        updates of the plans and encourage organizations to share the plans with their members.
4.3:    Develop programs to inform residents of the types of household hazardous wastes and the proper
        manner of disposal.
4.4:    Explore the feasibility of a City-sponsored household hazardous waste collection program.
GOAL 5:          To adequately protect indoor and outdoor living areas, and noise-sensitive uses such as
                 schools and convalescent homes, from transportation noise impacts.
Policies:
5.1:    Consider the noise impacts of new projects involving increases in noisy activities or traffic. An increase
        of 3 dBA or noise in excess of 65 dBA in sensitive areas shall be considered significant.
5.2:    Work with neighborhoods affected by high traffic noise levels to determine and implement the
        appropriate types of noise mitigation.
5.3:    Promote programs to enforce the Noise Ordinance. Review the Noise Ordinance for any needed
        updating on a regular basis.

8.6A The Safety Hazards and Noise Component
8.6B Strategies
POLICY 1:        Minimize personal and property damage resulting from seismic hazards, including
                 earthquakes and landslides.
Strategies:
1.1:        Require all development in a geologic special studies zone to be setback 50 feet from each side of a
            mapped active fault trace.
1.2:        Require structural reinforcement of all inventoried unreinforced masonry structures.
POLICY 2:        Minimize risk to life and property from brushfires.
Strategies:
2.1:        Require fire-resistant building materials for all structures in hillside areas and encourage use of fire
            resistant landscaping, such as iceplant.
2.2:        Require house sprinklers where determined necessary by the Fire Department.
2.3:        Require adequate fire flow and emergency access as a condition of approval for discretionary
            entitlements within Hillside areas.
POLICY 3:        Ensure the protection of all residents from geologic and groundwater hazards.
Strategies:
3.1:        Require a full site-specific geologic study of any hillside site within the purview of the hillside
            ordinance. The study shall adequately address site-specific questions such as slope stability, erosion,
            subsidence, groundwater effects and earthquakes.
3.2:        Adopt and maintain regulations controlling grading and geologic study prior to construction.

POLICY 4:        Protect citizens and property from use, transport and disposal of hazardous materials.
Strategies:
4.1:        Enforce the “right-to-know” laws governing the disclosure of hazardous materials used by
            businesses located in South Pasadena.
4.2:        Require that the transport of hazardous materials in the city be restricted to the routes designated for
            such transport.
4.3:        Adopt, by reference, the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
POLICY 5:        Adequately protect indoor and outdoor living areas, and noise-sensitive uses such as
                 schools and convalescent homes, from transportation noise impacts.
Strategies:
5.1:        Coordinate with CalTrans, Los Angeles County and adjacent cities to implement noise mitigating
            measures associated with the “Multi-Mode/Low Build” Route 710 Alternative and Pasadena’s
            Traffic Diversion Program.
5.2         Requires the inclusion of appropriate noise mitigation measures in the design as a condition of
            approval for projects involving a significant increase in noise.
5.3:        Review truck routes for noise impacts on residential areas and sensitive land uses such as schools
            and hospitals. If changes in truck routes could reduce noise impacts on sensitive receptors, consider
            changing the routes.
5.4:        Require the inclusion of appropriate noise mitigation measures in the design of any roadway
            projects.
5.5:       Require sound insulation of all new development adjacent to high noise areas, including arterials and
            the freeway, to reduce interior noise levels to 45 dBA.
5.6:        Promote the use of technology that minimizes the noise generated by the warning horns on the Blue
            Line System as it crosses public rights-of-way.
