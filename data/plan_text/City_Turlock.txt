x | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

1	         Introduction
Twenty years after the last comprehensive General Plan Update in 1992, it is an appropriate time
for the City of Turlock to take stock of what it has accomplished in the past two decades and lay
out a vision for its future. As a thriving community of over 70,000 in the heart of California’s
Central Valley, Turlock has held firm to its agricultural roots while diversifying economically
and expanding opportunities for its residents. It has become a very desirable community, attract-
ing many people to both live and work locally. The City’s rapid growth is expected to continue,
adding some 35,000 new residents over the next 20 years. A new General Plan is needed to guide
the City in providing critical services, amenities, infrastructure, and growth management.
Turlock has had a long history of planning. A general plan for the City was prepared in the early
1950s, and although it was never adopted, it served as a point of departure for future plans. The
General Plan prepared in 1969, much before general plans acquired their present political and
legal stature, addressed such contemporary issues as urban sprawl and unnecessary destruction of
farmland, and was updated in the early 1980s. The next General Plan (formally adopted in 1993
and partially updated in 2002) has served the City well, guiding the creation of attractive new
neighborhoods, parks, and major new retail and employment areas.                                     Turlock’s new General Plan reflects the changes the
                                                                                                     city has seen over the last 20 years and presents a
The present effort, begun in 2008, represents a continuation of this planning tradition. The         vision for the next 20.
General Plan articulates a vision for Turlock that draws on the ideas of the many citizens, business
owners, and elected officials who participated in the planning process. Designed to guide growth
and development, the Plan emphasizes the creation of attractive new neighborhoods and success-
ful employment centers, while preserving the valuable farmland in which the city has its roots.
                                                                                                                                   INTRODUCTION | 1-1

                                                       1.1	 General Plan Themes
                                                       City Council Resolution 2009-063, passed and adopted on April 23, 2009, established the
                                                       following vision statement for the General Plan:
                                                       “Turlock will grow sensibly and compactly, maintaining its small-town feel, while enhancing
                                                       quality of life, meeting housing needs, and providing high quality jobs and recreation opportuni-
                                                       ties for its diverse population.”
                                                       Supporting this vision statement are eight General Plan Themes, which are reflected in this plan’s
                                                       elements and policies:
                                                       1.	 Establish limits to urban growth that will maintain Turlock as a freestanding city surrounded
                                                           by productive agricultural land.
                                                           The City’s identity, history, and economy derive from its site in the center of one of the richest
                                                           agricultural regions in the country. Preserving farmland and maintaining Turlock as a free-
The General Plan enables and encourages the
development of housing to suit all types of residents.     standing community surrounded by farmland emerged as high priorities for residents. At the
                                                           same time, new neighborhoods are needed to support the city’s growing population and the
                                                           Westside Industrial Specific Plan adopted in 2002 as a 2,500-acre industrial job area. The General
                                                           Plan balances these needs by limiting the development footprint of the city, promoting infill
                                                           development, and planning for compact, mixed use neighborhoods that offer a high quality of
                                                           life to new residents and are logical extensions of the current city limits. These strategies together
                                                           can minimize conversion of prime agricultural land, one of the city’s greatest assets.
                                                       2.	 Maintain an economically and socially diverse population by promoting a greater variety of
                                                           housing types citywide and a localized mix of housing types in some areas.
                                                           Numerous factors contribute to the need for Turlock to provide a wide variety of housing choices:
                                                           changing demographics, an aging population, increasingly diverse family types, and the contin-

                                                           structures, circumstances, and income groups, and the General Plan calls for a more diverse
                                                           housing stock to allow opportunities for all. Elderly persons, students, single-parent households,
                                                           adults sharing housing, multifamily households and multigenerational households are household
                                                           types that evolve from economic need or personal preference. Turlock’s economically and socially
                                                           diverse population deserves a wide range of housing options.

3.	 Attract new businesses to Turlock to create well-paying jobs and maintain a good jobs/
    housing balance.
    Population and economic growth in Turlock are intertwined. The city seeks to attract new indus-
    tries and create jobs in order to boost revenue, remain competitive, attract new residents and
    provide opportunities for existing ones. The growing resident population demands increased
    goods and services which in turn fuel economic growth. The General Plan takes a multi-pronged
    approach to economic development in order to achieve these goals: supporting the buildout
    of the Turlock Regional Industrial Park (established by the Westside Industrial Specific Plan),
    drawing new businesses Downtown, identifying new industries to target, and building on exist-
    ing assets such as California State University, Stanislaus.
4.	 Improve the local and regional circulation system to serve businesses and new residential
    development.
    In order to foster balanced, sensible growth, it is critical that land use and transportation plan- Complete, mixed use neighborhoods place residences

    network, emphasizing connectivity, logical spacing, multimodal service, and “right-sizing” of
    roads to match the travel demand generated by new homes and businesses in the city. Addition-
    ally, the plan identifies and responds to potential regional transportation developments, such as
    commuter and high speed rail, ensuring that Turlock residents can take full advantage of con-
    nections to the rest of the region and beyond.
5.	 Implement sustainable development and green building principles in City projects and new
    development projects. Foster development that encourages alternatives to auto use, especially
    for non-commute trips.
    Issues of sustainability are addressed in elements throughout the General Plan: in Land Use, City
    Design, Circulation, Conservation, and more. By enabling alternatives to automobile travel and
    encouraging green building construction and sustainable site design, General Plan policies help
    achieve the increasingly important goals of protecting the natural environment and reducing
    greenhouse gas emissions. Turlock’s level topography makes it ideal for pedestrians and bicy-
    clists. However, many destinations, such as shops, services, parks, and schools, are difficult or

                                                        these trends by calling for the renewed use of traditional neighborhood street patterns and more

                                                        city. Related policies call for mixed use neighborhood centers, where services and amenities are
                                                        easily accessible.
                                                    6.	 Revitalize and enhance older areas of Turlock. Create an economic and social balance among
                                                        different city sectors. Enhance the County islands within the City limits, and annex them into
                                                        the City if feasible.
                                                        While the General Plan expects Turlock’s growing population to require the development of new
                                                        neighborhoods outside current city limits, it is an equal priority for current residents to maintain
                                                        and improve Turlock’s older neighborhoods and the Downtown. Numerous infill sites—includ-

                                                        Growth management has been a key component of planning in Turlock since the early 1990s.
                                                        The City’s proactive approach to master planning, phasing, and service and infrastructure pro-

                                                        Plan continues this planning tradition and strengthens it with a New Growth Areas and Infra-

                                                        ties, and the phasing of growth is established. This ensures that city services, public investment,
                                                        and infrastructure can keep pace with development while still maintaining high standards for

8.	 Provide a wide variety of recreation and cultural activities for all ages.
    A key component of the General Plan is the enhancement of Turlock’s park system and network
    of community and cultural facilities. While the City has built successful new parks in recent
    years, including popular sports facilities, the amount of projected population growth necessi-
    tates a new community park to serve the southeastern area of town. Turlock’s existing parks will
    also be augmented by a system of multiuse linear parks and trails, linking new housing to neigh-
    borhood schools, parks, and shopping centers, providing space for walking/jogging for health
    and time with neighbors, and serving additional purposes of storm drainage and agricultural
    buffering.
1.2	 State and Regional Planning Context
Turlock’s new General Plan comes at a time when issues of sustainability, global climate change,
and smart growth are being actively addressed at the State and regional levels. New legislation
and regional planning efforts have framed this update to Turlock’s General Plan in new and
innovative ways, and underscore the way in which each California community plays its part in
confronting these larger challenges.
California’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Legislation
California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32)
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006, also
known as Assembly Bill (AB) 32) directed the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to
perform numerous tasks aimed at achieving the state’s reduction targets, including approving
a statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimate that is equivalent to the 1990 GHG               New park and recreation facilities will augment Tur-
emissions level to be achieved by 2020. As the roadmap for achieving AB 32’s reduction goals, the    lock’s existing network of parks and open space.
CARB Scoping Plan outlined the combination of policies, programs, and measures necessary to
reduce statewide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, the equivalent of reducing emissions by
15 percent below current levels and 30 percent below projected business-as-usual levels in 2020.
Many of the measures would, when implemented, contribute to emission reductions statewide as
well as in local communities. CARB continues to adopt measures outlined in the Scoping Plan
                                                                                                                                  INTRODUCTION | 1-5

                           and is in the process of preparing rules to implement these measures. Turlock’s General Plan
                           responds to CARB’s implementation strategy as it pertains to cities’ general planning efforts.
                           Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB 375)
                           The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (Chapter 728, Statutes of
                           2008, also known as Senate Bill (SB) 375) promotes better integration of transportation and land
                           use planning throughout California. The statute was intended to complement efforts under
                           AB 32 by requiring CARB to develop regional GHG emission reduction targets for passenger
                           vehicles. CARB was tasked with establishing targets for the years 2020 and 2035 for each region
                           covered by the state’s 18 federally-designated metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs),
                           which in turn would be required to meet that target by considering the impacts of land use and
                           transportation on GHG emissions. CARB adopted regional GHG emission reduction targets for
                           cars and light trucks on September 23, 2010.
                           Pursuant to SB 375, each of California’s MPOs must prepare a Sustainable Communities
                           Strategy outlining how the region will meet its GHG reduction target by integrating land use
                           planning, transportation planning and funding, and housing needs. The SCS will be incorpo-
                           rated into the regional transportation plan, typically prepared by each MPO every 4 to 5 years.
                           CARB is required to review each SCS to determine whether it would achieve the necessary
                           GHG emission reduction for each region. SB 375 sets new requirements for coordinating the
                           RTP process with the regional housing needs allocation and housing element update processes,
                           and also provides incentives for implementation by establishing new California Environmental
                           Quality Act streamlining opportunities. The Stanislaus Council of Governments, the MPO to
                           which Turlock belongs, is responsible for developing an SCS pursuant to SB 375.
                           California Environmental Quality Act and Guidelines Amendments
                           Senate Bill 97 (Chapter 185, Statues of 2007) amends the California Environmental Quality

1-6 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358)
This act requires all cities and counties to plan for the development of multimodal transportation
networks in their general plans, beginning in January 2011. “Complete Streets” meet the travel
needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways, and of all modes of travel (walking, cycling,
driving, etc.). Turlock’s General Plan responds directly to the Complete Streets Act in its Circu-
lation Element, Chapter 5.
Regional Efforts
San Joaquin Valley Blueprint and Smart Valley Places Partnership
Communities in California’s San Joaquin Valley have been engaged in an eight-county planning
process known as the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint since 2005. The Blueprint is a regional
planning process aimed at engaging communities in the region in developing a shared vision
for land use and transportation that will guide growth in the area over the next 50 years. The
“Blueprint Roadmap Summary Final Report” was released in September 2010. It describes the            Planning for the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and
Preferred Scenario and 12 Smart Growth Principles adopted by the Regional Policy Council that        other transportation modes helps meet State require-
                                                                                                     ments for greenhouse gas reductions and “Complete
resulted from the process, and it outlines steps for implementation.                                 Streets.”
As a partner city in the Valley Blueprint process, Turlock is also participating in the Smart Valley
Places Partnership, a formal network of cities, agencies, institutions, and nongovernmental orga-
nizations with the goal of implementing a regional plan for sustainable development in the San
Joaquin Valley. With the assistance of a Sustainable Communities Planning Grant from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the partnership is continuing the work of
the Blueprint with the development of a shared Regional Sustainability Toolbox and individual
cities’ projects and plans.
The Smart Valley Places Partnership adopted the HUD-EPA-DOT Livability Principles, which
Turlock’s General Plan also reflects through its themes and policies. The Principles are:
 •	 Provide more transportation choices;
 •	 Promote equitable, affordable housing;
 •	 Enhance economic competitiveness;
                                                                                                                                  INTRODUCTION | 1-7

                            •	 Support existing communities;
                            •	 Coordinate and leverage policies and investment; and
                            •	 Value communities and neighborhoods.
                           Turlock’s involvement in these and future regional planning processes will ensure that the city’s
                           interests are represented in the region and will contribute positively to creating a consistent and
                           feasible strategy for regional growth.
                           1.3	 Scope and Purpose
                           The General Plan governs all City actions relating to Turlock’s growth and development. It
                           is both a long-range vision and a guide to ongoing decision-making and near-term actions. It
                           expresses the general ideas and desires of the community; the seven themes described above
                           together convey a sense of what is most important to the City’s residents and how the community
                           will focus its efforts in dealing with change during the coming decades. The defined policies,
                           maps, standards, and guidelines outline what actions must be implemented in order to accom-
                           modate population and employment growth over a 20-year time period. Guiding policies in each
                           chapter are statements of vision and overall intent.
                           However, the Plan will be in use long before the City’s vision is achieved. The Plan is a document
                           for landowners and developers to consult prior to formulating development proposals, and for
                           City officials to consult when reviewing proposals for private development and public projects.
                           As a guide to the City’s physical development, the Plan offers criteria for evaluating the consis-
                           tency and desirability of development proposals, and it also sets forth actions to be undertaken by
                           the City. These range from public works projects to revisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Because
                           of the requirements that a variety of other City actions be consistent with the General Plan,
                           regular ongoing use of the Plan is essential. Additionally, the General Plan can help guide shorter
                           term strategic and financial planning for the City. As each City Council engages in visioning for
                           the future, the shorter-term strategic plans should be consistent with and reflect the overall long-
                           range goals of the General Plan.
1-8 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

1.4	 Regional Location and Planning
Boundaries
Regional Location
The City of Turlock is located in Stanislaus County, on the eastern side of California’s San
Joaquin Valley, 100 miles east of the San Francisco Bay Area. The City is on the State Highway 99
corridor, linking it to other Central Valley cities including Stockton and Sacramento to the north
and Fresno and Bakersfield to the south. Turlock remains a stand-alone city surrounded by pro-
ductive agricultural land. Figure 1-1 shows Turlock in its regional Northern California context.
Turlock’s largest neighbor is the City of Modesto, which lies 14 miles north. The communities of
Keyes, Denair, and Ceres are the closest neighboring communities to the north; Delhi, Hilmar,
and Livingston are located within 10 miles to the south. Twenty miles to the west and southwest,
Patterson and Newman are along the I-5 corridor. This collection of communities represents
the area in which most Turlock residents work, as well as the area from which people come to
Turlock for employment and shopping.
Planning Boundaries
Planning Area
The Planning Area is the geographic area for which the General Plan establishes policies about
future urban growth, long-term agricultural activity, and natural resource conservation. The
boundary of the Planning Area was determined in response to State law requiring each city to
include in its General Plan all territory within the boundaries of the incorporated area as well as
“any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its
planning” (California Government Code Section 65300).
The Planning Area, shown in Figure 1-2, extends beyond Turlock’s city limits and includes the
unincorporated communities of Keyes and Denair. They have been included because the City
believes these unincorporated communities and lands bear relation to planning activities the
City undertakes, and in some cases, benefit from City services. For example, Turlock provides
wastewater treatment services to Keyes and Denair. However, the City recognizes Stanislaus
County’s role in land use planning for these unincorporated but urbanized areas. The extension

                            of the Planning Area to these communities underscores the importance of interjurisdictional
                            cooperation and planning in key areas. The Planning Area occupies 29,800 acres or 46.5 square
                            miles.
                            Study Area
                            The Study Area represents the greatest extent to which Turlock’s urban development may take
                            place over the next 20 years. Only land within the Study Area has been assigned urban uses or
                            designated as Urban Reserve. Urban Reserve is land that would likely be developed in the next
                            20 to 50 years—beyond the scope of this General Plan, but may be considered for possible longer
                            term development. The Urban Reserve includes land for future urban neighborhood develop-
                            ment, future jobs west of Highway 99, regional shopping centers, and a greenbelt surrounding
                            the city to the maximum extent possible.
                            The majority of existing conditions research, analysis, and policy formulation pertains only to
                            the Study Area, and this is the area that is depicted on the Land Use Diagram and other support-
                            ing maps in the General Plan. The Study Area is roughly bounded by Taylor Road to the north,
                            Waring and Verduga roads to the east, Harding Road to the south, and Commons and Wash-
                            ington roads to the west. It also includes some additional land at the northwest corner, along the
                            State Route 99 Corridor, encompassing the Taylor Road interchange. The Study Area comprises
                            17,460 acres or 27 square miles.
                            Sphere of Influence
                            The General Plan must cover Turlock’s adopted Sphere of Influence (SOI) as well as any land
                            outside of it that is relevant to the city’s planning. The SOI is a boundary that encompasses
                            lands that are expected to ultimately be annexed by the City, and it will be updated to match the
                            extent of planned urban development as part of the General Plan Update. The SOI is determined
                            by the Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which is an entity
                            empowered to review and approve proposed boundary changes and annexations by incorporated
                            municipalities. Portions of the Planning Area beyond the SOI may or may not be annexed to
                            Turlock, but are still considered to be related to and influenced by the City’s planning.

1.5	 General Plan Requirements
California’s tradition of allowing local authority over land use decisions means that the State’s
cities have considerable flexibility in preparing their General Plans. However, though land use
policies are not mandated, the issues to be addressed in the Plan are prescribed by State law. Cali-
fornia Government Code Sections 65300 et seq. establish requirements for the content of General
Plans, as well as for their adoption and subsequent amendments.
General Plan Elements
Seven general plan elements are required by State law, which permits the required contents
of the elements to be combined at the discretion of the local government producing the Plan.
The seven required elements are: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Open Space, Conservation,
Noise, and Safety. Section 1.8 describes how this plan meets State requirements and how the
material required to be in these elements is organized and integrated with optional elements
in the Turlock General Plan. The Housing Element is the part of the Plan for which the most
                                                                                                     Residents weighed in on all aspects of the General

State law to be updated at specific times—more frequently than the rest of the General Plan—it       focus group meetings.
is published as a separate document. However, the Housing Element is written to be consistent
with the rest of the General Plan.
COMPREHENSIVENESS
The General Plan must be comprehensive. This requirement has two components. First is a geo-
graphic component, which requires that the Plan cover the entire incorporated area of the City,
as well as any other land which bears relation to the City’s planning. Figure 1-2 illustrates the
planning boundaries. Second, the Plan must address the full range of issues associated with the
City’s physical development.
INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
The consistency requirement established by State law (Government Code Section 65300.5) and
interpreted in several significant judicial decisions requires the separate parts of the Plan to be
fully integrated and to relate internally without conflict. This horizontal consistency requirement
extends to the diagram and figures, as well as to text, data, and analysis in addition to policies.
                                                                                                                                 INTRODUCTION | 1-13

                            All portions of the Plan, whether required by the State or included at the option of local govern-
                            ment, have equal legal weight. None may supersede another. Furthermore, if a single element of
                            the General Plan is judged to be inadequate with respect to legal requirements, the entire Plan
                            may be considered inadequate. Comprehensive General Plan revisions provide an ideal opportu-
                            nity to satisfy the requirements of both comprehensiveness and consistency.
                            1.6	 Relationship to Other City Regulations,
                            Policies, and Programs
                            The General Plan provides the basis for all of the City’s regulations, policies and programs that
                            relate to issues addressed in the Plan. In addition to requiring that the Plan be internally consis-
                            tent, the State requires what is sometimes called vertical consistency — i.e., consistency between
                            the General Plan and other City actions. This requirement means that the City’s zoning and sub-
                            division ordinances, specific plans and redevelopment plans, all development approvals, public
                            works projects, and open space implementation programs have to be consistent with the General
                            Plan.
                            The State’s General Plan Guidelines provides the following rule for defining consistency: “An
                            action, program, or project is consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will
                            further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment.” This
                            rule clarifies that consistency does not require all subsequent city actions to be specifically antic-
                            ipated by the General Plan. Because the Plan is both general and long-range, there are many
                            circumstances where future City actions will be addressed only generally in the Plan.
                            CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE PLAN AND ZONING
                            The City’s Zoning Ordinance is one of the most important tools for implementing the Plan.
                            Requirements for consistency between the General Plan and zoning can be broken down into
                            three aspects:
                             •	 Uses and Standards. The General Plan’s land use classifications are more general than the
                                Zoning Ordinance classifications. For example, the Plan has four different categories for residen-
                                tial use, while the zoning ordinance may have more. Multiple zoning districts may be consistent
1-14 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

    with a single General Plan residential classification, as long as all of the densities and unit types
    allowed in each zoning district are also permitted in the relevant General Plan category.
•	 Spatial Correlation. The Zoning Map should reflect the general pattern of land use depicted on
    the Plan Diagram. However, the two need not be identical. Boundaries of land use classifica-
    tions depicted on the General Plan Diagram are typically more precise in developed areas and
    more generalized in undeveloped properties. In particular, future master plan areas are given a
    single General Plan land use designation with overall density requirements; precise master or
    specific planning and pre-zoning is required prior to annexation. Following the adoption of a
    master or specific plan, establishment of zoning, and annexation, the General Plan must then be
    updated.
•	 Timing. There are two main issues related to timing. The first addresses the time frame for
    bringing zoning into compliance with the General Plan; State law allows a “reasonable time”
    for reconciling the zoning ordinance with the General Plan. The General Plan has a 20-year
    horizon, while zoning focuses on the immediate appropriate uses for individual sites. In many
    cases, zoning will only gradually fulfill the prescriptions of the General Plan, particularly as it
    pertains to new growth areas, which are expected to be master planned, pre-zoned and brought
    into the city in phases over a number of years.
   The second issue relates to the timing and sequencing of development. All land within City
   limits should be zoned in accordance with the General Plan land use designations. In instances
   where land outside the City is designated for non-agricultural uses on the General Plan Diagram,
   the designated General Plan uses can be applied for at the time of annexation using master plan-
   ning, specific plans, and prezoning, as is currently the practice in Turlock.
Many General Plan policies, in particular those in the Land Use and Economic Develop-
ment, Housing, and City Design elements, call for specific changes to be made to the Zoning
Ordinance.

                                                          Because the General Plan is intended to be a statement of community preferences, and because
                                                          it will result in significant changes to the City, public participation in making the Plan is very
                                                          important. Broad outreach and news coverage, including a newsletter, continually-updated
                                                          project website, and press releases published prior to the first workshop, served to offer education
                                                          to the City’s citizens early in the Plan Update process. Additionally, interviews were held with
                                                          approximately 40 community leaders (elected officials, City staff, leaders of local organizations,
                                                          and other members of the planning and development community) in order to identify specific
                                                          technical issues that the Plan would need to address.
                                                          During General Plan preparation, community participation was solicited at a number of well-
                                                          attended workshops. The first focused on visioning and issue identification, the second on land

                                                          each case, written and graphic material was prepared in advance and made available to partici-

                                                          Groups with special interests have also contributed. The Housing Element was prepared sep-

                            The General Plan Land Use Diagram found in Chapter 2 (Land Use and Economic Develop-
                            ment) illustrates a number of policies relating to land use, circulation, conservation, and public
                            facilities. The Land Use Diagram is an important part of the plan that contains information not
                            presented anywhere else. However, General Plan policies cannot be interpreted from the Diagram
                            alone. Policies throughout the Plan complement the information in the Diagram. Other maps
                            and diagrams illustrating existing conditions and desired planning outcomes are found through-
                            out other chapters in the Plan as well.
                            Each section of the Plan includes narrative text providing information about the topics addressed,
                            followed by two sets of policies:
                             •	 Guiding Policies are statements of philosophy or intent;
                             •	 Implementing Policies are commitments to specific actions that are to be undertaken in order to
                                achieve the results called for by the Guiding Policies.
                            Many policy statements are followed by explanatory text, additional descriptive information, or
                            cross-references, which are in italic type. The General Plan Land Use Diagram, other figures, and
                            the Land Use Classifications in Section 2.2 are also adopted parts of the General Plan.
                            1.9	 Plan Administration
                            The General Plan is intended to be a dynamic document. As such, it may need to be updated over
                            time to address site-specific or comprehensive needs, to respond to new State or federal law, or to
                            modify policies that may become obsolete or unrealistic over time.
                            AMENDMENTS TO THE PLAN
                            The Plan may be amended from time to time, but opportunities for such amendments are limited
                            to four times per year. Each amendment may make an unlimited number of changes to the Plan.
                            However, this restriction does not apply to optional elements (such as Community Design), to
                            amendments needed to comply with a court decision, or to allow for the development of afford-
                            able housing. Because the requirement for internal consistency is never relaxed, particular care
                            must be taken to ensure that amendments maintain consistency with text and diagrams in all
                            Plan elements.

Annual Report
The California Government Code requires that City staff submit an annual report to the City
Council on the status of the General Plan and progress in its implementation. This report is
submitted to the Governor’s Office on Planning and Research and the Department of Housing
and Community Development. The report must include an analysis of the progress made in
meeting the City’s share of regional housing needs (identified in the Housing Element) and local
efforts to remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development
of affordable housing. Also, any mitigation monitoring and reporting requirements prescribed in
the General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR) should be included in the annual report.
Finally, the report should also include a summary of all General Plan amendments adopted
during the preceding year, a description of upcoming projects or issues to be addressed in the
coming year, and a work program and budget.
                                                                                                 INTRODUCTION | 1-19

2	         Land Use and Economic Development
The way in which a City allocates its land to meet the needs of residents and businesses is central
to the General Plan. In order to accommodate a growing, changing population and increasingly
diversifying employment, Turlock must meet the needs of these groups and uses while still main-
taining the aspects of the built environment that current citizens value: a compact city with a
small-town feel.
Chapter 2, the Land Use and Economic Development Element, begins by describing the City’s
existing land use pattern, and then describes land use classifications and the City’s develop-
ment potential. Policies and a land use plan, referred to as the General Plan Land Use Diagram,
designate the proposed general location and extent of each use category. The Element also
includes policies to manage growth and inter-jurisdictional relationships. The following chapter,
Chapter 3: New Growth Areas and Infrastructure, focuses on detailed standards for land use,
design, infrastructure, and development phasing in the areas for new urban development. Issues
related to city form, design, and character are addressed in Chapter 6: City Design.
The General Plan Land Use Diagram and the land use policies will have a major impact on
Turlock’s form and character over the life of the General Plan. Critical issues faced by Turlock
that are addressed in this Element include: direction of urban expansion and phasing of growth,
location of retail and neighborhood centers, revitalization of downtown, and location of proposed
parks and recreational facilities. The General Plan Land Use Diagram is a graphic representation
of the planning values and ideals of the community as expressed throughout the Plan. General
Plan text should be read in conjunction with the Land Use Diagram.

                           2.1	 Current Land Use Pattern
                           Overview
                           Turlock’s current land use pattern and built form are products of the City’s historical growth
                           within an agricultural area. Turlock was incorporated in 1908. Like many San Joaquin Valley
                           towns from the time period, the original downtown core was focused around the railroad station,
                           with streets arranged in a grid oriented to the tracks. The town proceeded to grow outward,
                           shifting to an orthogonal north-south grid matching the rural road and parcel pattern around it.
                           Golden State Boulevard, paralleling the railroad, was part of the original highway through the
                           Central Valley, which became U.S. 99 roadway in 1926.
                           The city’s growth since the 1940s has mainly occurred north of the downtown area and east of
                           the railroad. When the California State University, Stanislaus campus opened in 1965, it was still
                           well to the north of town. By the end of the 1980s housing boom, Turlock had reached Zeering
                           Road on the north and Daubenberger Road on the east. Completion in 1973 of the Route 99
                           freeway bypass, a long arc to the west, also drew development west of the railroad.
                           Beginning in the 1990s, Turlock’s growth occurred through a master planning process, one area
                           at a time. Almost all the recent residential development has occurred north of Monte Vista Avenue
                           on the east side of the railroad. The “Northwest Triangle,” north of Fulkerth Road between the
                           railroad and Highway 99, has also grown to be a major new commercial area.
                           It is the City’s goal to continue to provide a balance of jobs and housing in Turlock, which
                           stimulates the local economy, reduces commuting, and maintains Turlock’s competitiveness in
                           the region. Therefore, the master planning process has extended to the non-residential sector, as
                           well. In 2006, Turlock completed the Westside Industrial Specific Plan (WISP), which identi-
                           fied land use, transportation improvements, infrastructure improvements, and design guidelines
                           for industrial and business park uses for some 2,500 acres west of Route 99. Aided by this specific
                           plan, the city’s industrial sector is expanding and shifting to this area.
                           Land Use Distribution and Magnitude
                           There are approximately 8,730 acres in the current city limits (not including the County islands),
                           and an additional 8,560 acres of land are contained within the Study Area outside of city limits.
                           Figure 2-1 and Table 2-1 show the breakdown of existing land uses in the city limits, and each

                                                        land use is discussed in more detail in the paragraphs that follow. It is important to note that
                                                        the existing land uses shown in these figures and described below, which illustrate how land is
                                                        currently actually developed and/or being used, are not the same as the General Plan land use
                                                        classifications, which express desired land uses, as described in the following section.
                                                        Residential
                                                        Altogether, residential land uses occupy 41 percent of the land in the city limits. The majority of
                                                        existing residential development is located on the east side of the railroad, north of Downtown.
                                                        There are also several residential neighborhoods on Turlock’s west side, between the railroad
                                                        and Highway 99. Of the 3,589 acres of residential development, 90 percent is low- and medium-
                                                        density (3 to 15 units per acre), 6 percent is high density or multifamily (15 to 30 units per acre),
                                                        and three percent is residential “ranchettes,” which are very low density homes on large lots (less
                                                        than 3 units per acre). The majority of Turlock’s residential development is low density single
The majority of the developed land in Turlock is tradi- family homes, ranging from three to seven dwelling units per acre. Older neighborhoods close to

seven units per acre.                                   Downtown also consist of predominantly single family homes, but have slightly higher densities
                                                        than the more recently developed areas. While multifamily housing types occupy just three
                                                        percent of the land area in Turlock, these high density projects contain many more units than
                                                        single family development on comparable acreage. Some of the more recently developed neigh-
                                                        borhoods in the northwest quadrant of the city include a greater diversity of housing types,
                                                        including townhouses and three-story apartment complexes.
                                                        Residential “estate” lots, with densities from 0.2 to 3.0 units per acre, make up much of the
                                                        eastern border of the city near Denair. They function as part of the rural buffer between the two
                                                        communities. Residential development outside of the city limits, in the southeastern quadrant
                                                        of the Study Area, is primarily very low density “ranchette” style homes, generally on five- to

                                                        Commercial development in Turlock is comprised of several specific nodes in different locations,

                                                        which generally involves a mix of commercial and residential or office uses, is also included in this
                                                        category. The largest concentration of retail development is Monte Vista Crossings, located just
                                                        east and south of the Monte Vista interchange of SR 99. Developed over the last ten years, Monte

Vista Crossings includes numerous large anchor tenants such as Target, Safeway, Home Depot,
and Kohl’s; two hotels; and numerous smaller national-brand specialty stores and restaurants.
Community-oriented shopping areas, comprising both national chains and locally-owned busi-
nesses, characterize the Downtown core and the Geer Road corridor. Much of the development
Downtown can be characterized as mixed use, though it is primarily commercial with some
office and residential uses mingled throughout. Emanuel Medical Center is a large office land use
northeast of downtown, with the hospital anchoring a collection of smaller medical offices sur-
rounding it. Older automobile-oriented commercial development lines Golden State Boulevard
and is also concentrated just south of Downtown.
Industrial
Eleven percent of the Study Area (934 acres) is currently developed with industrial uses. The
industrial development east of Highway 99 is located immediately south of the downtown core,
on both sides of the railroad tracks. Additional industry is located just west of the SR 99/Lander
Avenue interchange. In 2006, approximately 2,000 acres were designated for industrial and            Prior to the adoption of the Westside Industrial

acres has been developed as such. Most of Turlock’s industrial users are in the food processing
industry, including Foster Farms, Sensient Flavors, and Kozy Shack.
Public, Semi-Public, and Community Facility
Public, semi-public, and community facility uses account for approximately eight percent of
development within city limits. These uses include city buildings, schools and other govern-
ment-owned facilities. Several large public and institutional users have sizable land holdings in
Turlock. The California State University, Stanislaus (CSUS) occupies 210 acres along Monte
Vista Avenue and Geer Road. The Stanislaus County Fairgrounds are on 67 acres, just northwest
of the downtown core on the west side of the railroad. The City wastewater treatment facility is
on 166 acres in the TRIP. The remainder of acreage in public, semi-public or community facility
use consists primarily of public school grounds and stormwater detention areas.

Vacant Sites
Vacant land is scattered throughout the city. Parcels range from small urban infill sites measuring
less than one acre to large, formerly agricultural parcels measuring up to 25 acres. Some vacant
parcels are clustered, creating larger development opportunity sites of 100 acres or more.
Altogether, vacant sites make up around 12 percent of the land area within the city limits, approx-
imately 1,020 acres. Areas where vacant land is more concentrated include along SR 99, in the
TRIP, along major corridors such as Geer and Golden State Boulevard, and near CSU-Stan-
islaus. The County islands in the southern part of town also contain vacant sites, though most are
a quarter acre or less in size.
Larger Study Area and Agricultural Uses
Agriculture is the predominant existing land use in the unincorporated area outside of city limits
but inside the Study Area boundary. Additionally, many vacant parcels within city limits are
currently in agricultural use, especially those in the TRIP and in the undeveloped portions of the
far eastern edge of the city. In the TRIP, there are over 1,000 acres of farmland, while the area is     Agriculture characterizes most large undeveloped

2.2	 Land Use Classifications
The following descriptions apply to land uses indicated on the Land Use Diagram (Figure 2-2)
and the Master Plan Area Diagram (Figure 2-3). The legend on the diagram is an abbreviated
version of the descriptions. The classifications are adopted as General Plan policy and are inten-
tionally broad enough to avoid duplicating existing City or County zoning regulations. More
than one zoning district may be consistent with a single General Plan land use category, and
revisions to the zoning regulations will be necessary to implement the General Plan.
According to State law, the General Plan must establish standards of population density and
building intensity for each land use classification. The General Plan stipulates residential densities
in housing units per gross acre; population density can be obtained by applying average persons
per housing unit count11 to the housing unit densities. For nonresidential uses, the Plan specifies
a maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to site area (Floor Area Ratio or FAR).
1	 Based on 2000 U.S. Census data, the number of persons per total housing units is 2.9.
                                                                                                       LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-7
                           Table 2-2 shows gross density standards for residential categories and FAR standards for the
                           other uses. Assumed averages for residential categories are listed in the descriptions that follow.
                           RESIDENTIAL
                           Residentially-designated areas permit housing, as well as childcare facilities, places of religious
                           assembly, retail grocery stores not exceeding 2,500 square feet in size, and Residential Care
                           Facilities consistent with applicable Federal and State Laws. A brief description of each of the
                           Residential General Plan designations follows.
                           Residential densities are per gross acre of developable land, provided that at least one housing
                           unit may be built on each existing legal parcel designated for residential use. State-Mandated
                           second dwelling units and density bonuses for the provision of affordable housing are in addition
                           to densities otherwise permitted.
                           Assumed average densities and persons per unit (based on Census information and recent demo-
                           graphic trends) are used to calculate probable housing unit and population holding capacity for
                           each residential classification; however, neither the averages nor the totals constitute General
                           Plan policy. The housing types referred to in the discussion below are illustrated in the City
                           Design Element.
                           Very Low Density (VLDR)
                           The Very Low Density Residential uses allows 0.2 - 3.0 units per gross acre. It assumes three
                           persons per unit, resulting in population density of one to nine persons per gross acre. Typical
                           lots will be one-third of an acre in size. This designation is proposed primarily for the northeast
                           edge of Turlock and is to act as a residential, large lot buffer between the higher density urban
                           uses in Turlock and the lower density rural uses in Denair; the intent is to maintain parcel sizes
                           that can serve to keep both Turlock and Denair as separate, independent communities. The
                           average density assumed for General Plan calculations is 1.6 units per gross acre.
                           Low Density (LDR)
                           The Low Density Residential designation allows 3.0 to 7.0 units per gross acre and assumes 3.2
                           persons per household resulting in a range of population density of 13 to 22 persons per gross acre.
                           Housing in this density range is typical of recent subdivisions built throughout Turlock, though

                                              few subdivisions have achieved densities at the high end of the range. The intent of the classifica-
                                              tion is to provide locations for construction of single-family homes with a range of lot sizes. The
                                              typical density assumed for General Plan calculations is 5.0 units per gross acre.
                                              Low-Medium Density (LDR-MDR)
                                              Low-Medium Density Residential areas have between 5.0 and 10.0 units per gross acre. At three
                                              persons per unit, this translates to a population density of 15 to 30 persons per gross acre. The
                                              intent of the LDR-MDR designation is to accommodate a range of more compact housing types
                                              in a traditional neighborhood environment, including small-lot single family homes as well as
                                              single family attached townhouse units. The establishment of an RL4.5 zoning district as part
                                              of the new zoning ordinance adopted in January of 1997, allows for 4,500 square foot lots (gross
                                              density = 9 units per acre), which are typically located in the LDR-MDR area. Because housing
                                              at this density accommodates a range of traditional single family homes, small-lot single family

                                              The Medium Density Residential area allows 7.0 to 15.0 units per gross acre and assumes 2.7

                                              At the lower end of the range, this designation allows zero-lot-line homes, semi-detached houses
                                              and duplexes, typically built at 7 to 11 units per acre. The upper end of the density range accom-

also within the Medium Density range. The typical density assumed for General Plan calcula-
tions is 11.0 units per gross acre.
In some cases, particularly in older residential neighborhoods immediately surrounding the
Downtown core, the MDR designation is applied to lots that are smaller than one acre in size.
Traditionally, these lots have been developed with single family homes, but recent “tear-downs”
and redevelopment have created small multifamily projects amidst single family neighborhoods.
While a mix of housing types within a neighborhood is desirable, the General Plan puts addi-
tional standards describing “graduated density” in place for development of medium density
multifamily housing on traditional single family lots so as to ensure continued neighborhood
quality and character (see Section 2.5).
High Density (HDR)
The High Density Residential designation allows 15.0 to 40.0 units per gross acre and assumes
2.4 persons per household (plus State-mandated bonus for affordability where applicable). The

development as Turlock grows over the next 20 years. High density housing supports compact
development, provides housing choices to match changing demographics, and facilitates needed
affordable housing. The State-mandated density bonus could result in net densities as high as
48 units per acre at the top end of the range. The resulting housing type will to a great extent be
determined by unit size, parking, and open space requirements but will include triplexes and
quadruplexes, stacked townhouses, walk-up garden apartments, and apartment buildings with
elevators. The typical density assumed for General Plan calculation is 22.5 units per gross acre.

                                                        The General Plan includes a number of commercial land use classifications, each with a separate
                                                        purpose. This category also includes mixed use designations, which generally consist of a combi-

                                                        Downtown Mixed Use (DT)
                                                        This classification is applied to Turlock’s traditional Downtown and indicates the area in which
                                                        the Downtown Overlay zoning districts apply. The classification provides for a full range of retail
                                                        and personal services uses, including apparel stores, restaurants, specialty shops, entertainment

                                                        Nonresidential development in this classification shall generally not exceed a FAR of 4.0. The
                                                        DT classification also applies to the older residential neighborhoods in the downtown area and
                                                        provides for both single and multiple-family uses at densities ranging from 7.0 to 40.0 units

market. Large scale commercial uses (large discount centers, big box retailers, etc.) serving a
region wide market are specifically excluded from this designation. Development in this designa-
tion shall not exceed 0.25 FAR. While facilitating automobile access and parking, Community
Commercial areas shall also be designed such that they are pedestrian- and bicycle-oriented, in
order to enable nearby residents to accomplish their daily shopping needs without a vehicle.
Regional Commercial (RC)
This designation provides for region-serving commercial uses, including large-scale shopping
centers, discount “club” type stores, factory outlets, and other commercial uses such as retail
stores, food and drug stores, apparel stores, specialty shops, motor vehicle sales, home furnishings,
commercial entertainment facilities, hotels/motels and other similar uses that serve a region wide
market. Development in this designation shall not exceed 0.35 FAR, except for hotels/motels,
which may have FARs up to 2.0. In the future, as development shifts from the north Turlock area
to the south, the area east of State Route 99 south of Glenwood Avenue could also been an attrac-
tive site for region serving retailers, in close proximity to the proposed new freeway interchange.
Regional Commercial and/or large-scale region serving uses are not permitted on Geer Road and
other areas classified for Community and Neighborhood Commercial development.
Market analysis has demonstrated that as of the time of this General Plan Update, regional com-
mercial uses (specifically discount superstores) are currently not economically prudent land uses
in Turlock. While the Land Use Diagram does not designate any areas in Turlock as Regional
Commercial, City Council has determined that further study should be undertaken on this topic
once the city reaches approximately 27,000 housing units, at which time the land use can be
reconsidered. Policy 2.6-e provides detail on implementation.
Highway Commercial (HWC)
This designation provides for uses designed to serve motorists traveling along State Route 99 at or
near interchanges that are convenient and safe for such uses, and to a lesser extent along Golden
State Boulevard. This designation is also intended to provide locations for uses that depend on
high visibility from the freeway. Allowable uses in this designation include service stations, hotels/
motels, restaurants, auto sales and other similar types of automobile-dependent uses. This desig-
nation corresponds to the Commercial Thoroughfare zoning district. The maximum allowable
FAR is 0.35.

                                                     between industrial activities or major transportation corridors and residential areas. Typical uses
                                                     in this classification include repair facilities, distributing uses, sales of building materials, motor

                                                     fication are often similar in character to industrial uses. Historically, many of these types of
                                                     uses have been located along Golden State Boulevard. Development in this designation shall not

                                                     The General Plan Land Use Diagram also shows several “multiple use” designations, which

professional offices, institutional uses, limited light industrial uses, warehousing and distrib-
uting, “back-office” uses, and other similar uses locating in a low intensity, landscaped setting
with high design and development standards. Similar to the Industrial designation, Business

public safety facilities, public schools, California State University Stanislaus (CSUS), the State
fairgrounds, and other prominent public uses and facilities. The Land Use Diagram shows the
specific locations of existing major Public/Institutional facilities. Stormwater detention basins
are also designated as public uses on the Land Use Diagram. Except for sites that have been
acquired, the Land Use Diagram shows only the general location of future public or institutional
uses in the area they will be needed. Selection of specific sites is the responsibility of the applica-
ble governmental agencies and/or private institutions serving the Turlock area.
The designation on the Land Use Diagram of any future public or institutional site that has not
been acquired shall not be construed to limit the existing or future use of the designated land.
The predominant land use designation surrounding any property designated for public facilities
shall be used to determine the potential use of the property prior to its acquisition by the applica-

                            mini-park sites may not be large enough to be displayed on the Land Use Diagram, but this
                            shall not prevent a site from being considered to have been appropriately classified. Chapter 4:
                            Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities contains information and policies pertaining to park

                            URBAN RESERVE (UR)
                            This classification is established for the purpose of identifying land that is reserved for future
                            unspecified urban uses. Additional environmental analysis, a General Plan amendment, master
                            planning, and annexation, if located outside the city, will be required before urban uses and/or
                            development is permitted on land classified Urban Reserve. However, given the master plan pro-
                            gramming and phasing described in Chapter 3, it is unlikely that areas designated Urban Reserve
                            on the Land Use Diagram will be required for urban uses during the buildout period of this
                            General Plan. Agricultural uses are permitted on property classified Urban Reserve, although
                            they may eventually be replaced by permanent urban development. Public facilities and recre-
                            ation facilities may also be located on land classified Urban Reserve.
                            In some cases, areas designated as Urban Reserve may already have some developed uses (for
                            example, in the area north of Taylor Road to Barnhart Road, near State Route 99). Should these
                            properties desire incorporation, the City shall work with the property owners on annexation
                            agreements (see Policy 2.10-b).
                            Master Plan Areas
                            The Land Use Diagram also shows areas that are designated as new Master Plan Areas. These
                            correspond to areas that shall be planned, pre-zoned, and annexed to the city one at a time,
                            according to the phasing diagram (see Section 3.1). Rather than depicting specific plan uses on
                            parcels, the Master Plan Area designation requires that each area achieve a specific mix of land

uses, intensities, and other requirements (described in detail in Section 3.2) that are to be deter-
mined through the preparation of a master plan for each one. Figure 2-3 shows the residential
density ranges planned for each new Master Plan Area.
2.3	 Development Potential
Development potential is calculated based on assumptions about new residential and commer-
cial development that could be built under the General Plan land use designations and their
respective densities and intensities over the timeframe of the General Plan. It also takes into
account properties that have approved or pending development project applications associated
with them at the time of the General Plan’s writing, which, along with vacant and underutilized
properties, accommodate a portion of the city’s expected future growth. A detailed list of the
proposed, pending, and approved development projects at the time of the General Plan’s writing
is found in the Existing Conditions and Key Issues report (March 2009).
Population and Employment Projections
Over the next 20 years, Turlock is expected to attract a substantial number of new residents and
new jobs. Historical and recent growth trends give some indication of the amount and type of
growth that Turlock can expect to see. The General Plan plays an important role in projecting
these growth numbers, estimating how much land for housing and employment the new growth
will require, analyzing Turlock’s existing capacity for new development, and determining where
the remaining demand for urban land uses should go.
This section describes Turlock’s projected population and employment in 2030, the time horizon
of the General Plan. The location, phasing, and land uses of this growth are described in Chapter
3: New Growth Areas and Infrastructure.
Residential Population
Population Projections
Turlock has grown rapidly since the 1970s. Its 2000 population of 55,810 was a 32 percent increase
over the 1990 count. The 2007 American Community Survey shows 26 percent growth between
2000 and 2007, bringing the estimated population to 70,412. Turlock added some 3,644 housing

units in the 1990s and issued permits for another 4,745 units between 2000 and 2008. Since 2000,
housing development has kept pace with estimated population growth.
Population projections for the City of Turlock in 2030 are derived from countywide forecasts
from a variety of public and private sources. These sources cite a variety of factors driving growth
in the Central Valley in general and Stanislaus County in particular. According to the Public
Policy Institute of California (PPIC), over half of the growth in the Central Valley has been due
to migration. Job growth, affordable housing, and strong family relationships are the primary
reasons for migrating to the Central Valley. Although most of the migration comes from coastal
California where housing is less affordable, an additional component is also generated from
outside the U.S. (e.g. Latin America, Asia). Additionally, the Central Valley’s newest residents are
more likely than its out-migrants to be married and have children.
This trend is supported by analysis from the Center for the Continuing Study of the California
Economy (CCSCE). According to the CCSCE, net migration (the difference between immigra-
tion into and emigration from the area) now accounts for the majority of the population growth
in the San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, net migration has been the largest component of growth
in Stanislaus County since 2000.
At the outset of the General Plan Update process, Turlock was estimated to gain between 36,000
to 55,000 new residents by 2030. The low end forecast projects 106,500 people by 2030, or a 51
percent increase over current levels; this forecast assumes the City’s percentage share of County
population of 13.2 percent remains constant. In contrast, the high end forecast projects 127,000
people by 2030, or a 76 percent increase over current levels; this forecast assumes that the change
in the City’s population growth rate relative to historic trends will mirror the projected change in
the County’s population growth rate.
Buildout Population
At buildout, assuming construction at midpoint densities and intensities, the Study Area could
support approximately 104,500 residents. This represents an average 1.9 percent annual growth
rate from 2008 through 2030. In light of an extended period of slower growth in California
between 2008 and 2012, this General Plan uses the low end population forecast as its guidance
for buildout. This is also more consistent with recently developed forecasts that revise downward
the amount of projected growth in the San Joaquin Valley by 2030.
                                                                                                     LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-19

                            With an average household size of 2.92 persons per household, 36,000 new residents equates to
                            approximately 12,300 new households and 12,800 new housing units (assuming a vacancy rate
                            of approximately 3.6 percent). Different housing types often attract different household sizes.
                            Traditional single family homes are assumed to have 3.1 to 3.3 persons per household, whereas
                            multifamily housing types may average 2.4 to 2.8 persons per household. Overall, Turlock’s
                            average household size across all housing types is around three persons per household.
                            However, it is important to note that current economic conditions have placed a strain on the
                            Central Valley that may require a longer recovery period than other areas of the State. Until
                            unemployment and housing market conditions stabilize, growth will likely occur at a substan-
                            tially slower rate in the short term, and the ultimate buildout of the General Plan may not occur
                            by 2030. In order to accommodate population and job growth at the pace at which it occurs, this
                            plan stipulates that development occur in phases. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
                            Non-Residential
                            Similar to population, employment projections for the City of Turlock are based on forecasts
                            provided at the County level. Given the various economic factors that could influence future
                            growth in the City, the General Plan relies on these county-wide forecasts to provide a high and
                            low range estimate for Turlock and bracket potential outcomes. Again, the actual outcome will
                            depend on a variety of demographic and policy considerations as well as differences between the
                            City and County growth patterns.
                            A number of factors drive job growth in the Central Valley in general and Stanislaus County
                            in particular. A significant proportion of the future job growth in the County will be related to
                            providing goods and services to the local and regional population. In other words, growth in
                            the local population and workforce will be an important driver for future employment growth.
                            North San Joaquin’s economy (Merced, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin) is also likely to get a boost
                            from the continued expansion of educational facilities such as CSU Stanislaus and UC Merced,
                            as well as spill-over from the San Francisco Bay Area economy. The presence of lower-skilled
                            workers, inexpensive land, and central location in the State will also ensure that the region
                            remains competitive for manufacturing.
                            According to the Stanislaus Council of Governments (StanCOG), the region anticipates more
                            rapid growth in the Service and Retail Trade industry sectors relative to education or other
2-20 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

industries. Government jobs are expected to experience minimal growth. Additionally, because
of the changing nature of the local economy, StanCOG anticipates unemployment levels will
gradually decrease by 2030, and become more reflective of statewide rates.
Turlock is estimated to gain between 17,200 and 35,000 new jobs by 2030. The low end forecast
(46,200 total jobs or a 59 percent increase over current levels) assumes the City’s percentage share
of County employment of 14.3 percent remains constant. The high end forecast (64,000 total jobs
by 2030 or a 121 percent increase over current levels) assumes that the change in the City’s employ-
ment growth rate relative to historic trends will mirror the projected change in the County’s
employment growth rate. At buildout, the land uses described in the General Plan would support
around 51,000 total jobs—close to the midpoint of the jobs forecast.

                            Full buildout of the General Plan, including all master plan areas, would result in a total of
                            around 37,120 housing units citywide (including existing) and a cumulative population of
                            around 104,500 (Table 2-3). Of these, new housing units and population would be 12,800 and
                            36,000 respectively. More detail on phasing and buildout by phase is found in Chapter 3: New
                            Growth Areas and Infrastructure.
                            Table 2-4 shows the potential non-residential buildout in terms of square feet of new buildings
                            and number of jobs. Jobs are calculated based on standard assumptions about square footage per

2-22 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

An important consideration to recognize in this calculation is that the TRIP in particular rep-
resents an approximately 50-year (or more) industrial land supply—far beyond the time horizon
of this General Plan. Altogether, available land in the TRIP alone (Industrial and Business Park
designations) could support nearly 56,000 jobs. However, employment projections for Turlock
indicate that over the course of the General Plan buildout, through 2030, the city is likely to gain
between 6,000 and 8,000 industrial jobs. This corresponds to roughly 15 percent of the TRIP
being built out, or around 390 acres. Using this assumption regarding the TRIP, and assuming
full buildout of the other non-residential land uses, Turlock will be able to support approximately
51,000 jobs at General Plan buildout.
It should be noted that for the purposes buildout calculations, approximate acreages of various
residential and non-residential land uses are assumed for the master plan areas. These amounts
are based on the conceptual plans for these areas, described in Chapter 3. Actual buildout of each
land use type will depend on subsequent master planning processes. Similarly, for the purpose
of infrastructure capacity calculations, the General Plan and supporting documents assume a
25 percent buildout of the TRIP. By using this higher buildout assumption for capacity calcula-        Downtown Turlock is home to many thriving small

require substantial flexibility in site size and location.
2.4	 Downtown
The Downtown is roughly one quarter-mile square (160 acres), consisting of a core commercial
area of approximately 90 acres, and residential, civic and heavy commercial uses at the periphery.
It owes its location and geometry to the Union Pacific Railroad. Historic records indicate that
the town survey started at what is now the southeast corner of the intersection of Center and
East Main streets. From there, as in most towns of the San Joaquin Valley, an orthogonal street
network was extended out parallel and perpendicular to the railroad tracks. Newer parts of the
town were laid out in true cardinal directions; the transition between the new grid and the older
diagonal one is never clean and is often disorienting.
The emergence of newer shopping centers in recent years, first along Geer Road and then at
Monte Vista Crossings, has significantly reduced Downtown’s share in the retail and commer-
cial growth experienced by the City. The shopping complexes along Geer Road rival the retail
                                                                                                    LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-23

                                                     Monte Vista Crossings have better access and orientation to the automobile, proximity to newer
                                                     neighborhoods, easier parking and larger sites than Downtown.
                                                     Compared to the newer shopping centers, Downtown, with its narrow streets, short blocks
                                                     (typically 400-foot square), and historic buildings, is more appealing and better suited to explo-

                                                     could draw people from afar.
                                                     A survey conducted as part of the 1992 Downtown Plan estimated the amount of commercial
                                                     space in Downtown to be about 1.4 million square feet. Of the 0.8 million square feet of retail
                                                     space in the Downtown, automobile dealers and home furnishings accounted for the two largest
                                                     groups of businesses. Eating and drinking establishments, specialty retail and apparel stores
                                                     together constituted about 350,000 square feet of space. The survey did not consider Downtown’s

                                                     A second study of Turlock’s Downtown was completed in 2008, which focused on marketing
                                                     and branding opportunities. The study identified wedding planning and bridal shopping as a

                                                     Downtown’s long-term economic viability will depend on its ability to compete not only with the
                                                     newer shopping centers, but more critically with regional discount and retail operations, such as
                                                     Wal-Mart and freeway-oriented regional shopping centers. Its success will depend on specialty
                                                     stores offering wider selection than department stores, competitive pricing by merchants, and a
                                                     pleasant environment for pedestrians where one-of-a-kind shops, restaurants and entertainment
                                                     facilities can attract patronage from the entire City and beyond.
2-24 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

The 1992 Downtown Master Plan
The 1992 Downtown Master Plan offered a comprehensive urban design, parking-landscape
framework, and a funding mechanism for implementation. It helped to identify infrastructure
and beautification improvements for Downtown Turlock, which were implemented successfully
and are responsible for many positive aspects of Downtown’s environment today..
The 2003 Downtown Design Guidelines and Zoning Regulations
Adopted in 2003, the Downtown Design Guidelines and Zoning Regulations build on the vision
for Downtown Turlock outlined in the Downtown Master Plan. The Zoning Regulations and
Guidelines are intended to encourage and facilitate appropriate private investment within the
Downtown Area that reflects the historic commercial character of the core and the traditional
residential character of the adjoining neighborhoods. The documents contain guidelines and
standards for physical design and land use in the area, emphasizing the importance of pedestrian
access and accessibility throughout the Downtown Area, making it a place people can access
easily and where they will want to linger and spend time.
The goals for the Zoning Regulations and Design Guidelines include:
 •	 To ensure the current and future success of the Downtown by preserving and enhancing its
    unique historic character.
 •	 To encourage future development that is compatible with the overall feel of Downtown.
 •	 To protect and enhance the pedestrian environment and accessibility in and around the Down-
    town Core Area.
 •	 To conserve the traditional character of the immediate surrounding residential neighborhoods
    while guiding future development for use and reinvestment through alternative uses.
 •	 To promote renovation of historic buildings in Downtown and promote new investment and
    construction.
                                                                                                 LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-25

                            Downtown Planning Update
                            Using a portion of the funding that the city received through the Smart Valley Places Partner-
                            ship, Turlock initiated an update to the Downtown Design Guidelines and Zoning Regulations
                            in January 2011. Issues to be addressed in this update include the location of a potential train
                            station downtown, as well as the possibility of allowing heights up to 60 feet in certain zones
                            (Office/Residential and Industrial/Residential) for the purpose of providing additional housing.
                            The infrastructure analysis in the General Plan will ensure that adequate infrastructure exists to
                            support this potential increased intensity.

                                    activity center. Encourage office and residential development near Downtown.
                                    Continuing viability of the Downtown is of economic as well as symbolic value to the
                                    City. Downtown has scale and character that is hard to replicate in shopping centers
                                    elsewhere. Downtown should be the preferred location for accountants, attorneys,
                                    dentists, realtors, engineers, and other local-serving office tenants, unless they
                                    provide medical services and need to be near the Emanuel Medical Center. Downtown
                                    provides a good location for the concentration of non-medical offices.

       Downtown.
       These areas are well established and contribute to the diversity of scale and use near
       Downtown. Permitting non-residential uses will create pressure on surrounding resi-

                            2.5	 Residential Areas
                            The General Plan promotes the development of walkable, compact, mixed use residential neigh-
                            borhoods in new development areas. Compact neighborhoods use resources more efficiently,
                            conserve valuable farmland, and are convenient to residents. New residential development
                            will include a broad mix of housing types, from traditional single family homes to townhouses
                            and apartments, in order to serve the needs of Turlock’s diverse population and changing
                            demographics.
                            Some community facilities that are appropriate for residential environments, such as day care,
                            elderly care, and alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities, shall be allowed within neighbor-

                                   by encouraging development of housing at a broad range of densities and prices,
                                   including small-lot single-family, townhouses, apartments, and condominiums. Aim to
                                   achieve an overall housing type mix of 60 percent traditional single family, 40 percent
                                   medium and higher density housing types.
                                   The current mix is 70 percent single family and 30 percent medium and high density.

2-28 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Implementing Policies
2.5-d	 Zoning ordinance revision to match General Plan. Revise the zoning ordinance and
       residential design guidelines to be consistent with the objectives and classifications in
       the General Plan, including the General Plan Land Use Diagram. These would include,
       but are not limited to:
       •	 Establishing minimum and maximum densities consistent with the Plan
       •	 Establishing graduated density standards (see Policy 2.5-l)
       •	 Establishing overlay districts for traditional neighborhoods (see Policy 2.5-m)
       •	 Accommodating potential future regional retail uses, such as discount superstores
          (see Policy 2.6-e)
2.5-e	 “No net loss” of housing. Do not allow development at less than the minimum density
       prescribed by each residential land use category, without rebalancing the overall plan
       to comply with the “no net loss” provisions of State housing law.
2.5-f	 Master planning required. Require comprehensive master planning of new residen-
       tial neighborhoods in expansion areas consistent with the requirements in the General
       Plan. Also require that 70 percent of one master plan area is completed (building
       permits issued) before another starts.
       See Chapter 3: New Growth Areas and Infrastructure.
2.5-g	 Locations for high density development. Maintain the highest residential develop-
       ment intensities Downtown, along transit corridors, near transit stops, and in new
       neighborhood centers.
2.5-h	 Transit and pedestrian accessibility from housing. Work with developers of affordable
       and multifamily housing to encourage the construction of transit-oriented and pedes-
       trian-oriented amenities and appropriate street improvements that encourage walking
       and transit use.
                                                                                                 LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-29

                            2.5-i	 Housing downtown. Create incentives to increase residential development
                                   Downtown, on infill sites and in existing buildings. Examples include:
                                   •	 Providing public subsidies for the development of affordable housing
                                   •	 Utilizing Historic Building Code where applicable to encourage development of the
                                      second floors in Downtown Turlock
                                   •	 Reducing on-site parking requirements
                                   •	 Updating the Capital Facility Fee program to more closely reflect the reduced
                                      contribution of walkable neighborhoods to the need for additional roadway and
                                      operational infrastructure (see Policy 5.3-k).
                            2.5-j	 Redevelopment in existing neighborhoods. Preserve and enhance existing pedes-
                                   trian-oriented neighborhoods and commercial districts by pursuing redevelopment
                                   that reinforces activity, making investments in the public realm, establishing overlay
                                   districts to preserve the neotraditional character of development, and avoiding desig-
                                   nating competing commercial areas in close proximity.
                            2.5-k	 Improvements in existing neighborhoods. Enhance the character of existing neigh-
                                   borhoods by implementing public realm improvements where needed, and by
                                   allowing changes in scale and/or use on specified sites.
                            2.5-l	 Graduated density. Amend the zoning ordinance to establish graduated density
                                   standards for medium and high density residential development in neighborhoods
                                   with narrow lots, by today’s standards, generally located south of Canal, east of
                                   Soderquist, north of South Avenue and west of Golden State Boulevard. In these
                                   neighborhoods, the narrow lots often cannot support Medium Density Residen-
                                   tial development unless combined with neighboring parcels. The standard would
                                   tie allowable density to lot size, ensuring that the maximum residential density is
                                   only permitted on single lots over a certain minimum size, or on adjacent lots being
                                   developed as a single site.
                            2.5-m	 Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zones. Establish overlay zoning districts for areas
                                   immediately adjacent to the Downtown, but outside the Downtown Overlay Districts
                                   which were developed post-WWII to preserve the historic quality and cohesiveness of
                                   these neighborhoods. Areas include Southwest Turlock generally bounded by Canal,

2.6	 Retail, Commercial and Mixed Use Areas
Retail areas offer convenience to Turlock residents and help shape the City’s image. As of 2007,
about 14 percent of Turlock’s residents are employed in the retail trade sector. (See Table 2-7
in Section 2.10: Economic Development for more information on employment by industry.)
Shopping and use of services are activities that enable social contact as well as business transac-
tions. Though residents may not be familiar with neighborhoods outside their own, community
shopping areas are likely to be equally well known by people living in all areas of the City.
Therefore, retail districts are a critical element of people’s perception of their city.
Retail and related uses within the City are also important ingredients in the City’s success from
a fiscal and employment viewpoint. Sales tax revenues represent the largest single revenue source
                                                                                                                       LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-31

                                                       in the City’s General Fund: in fiscal year 2008-2009, sales tax revenues accounted for over 26
                                                       percent of General Fund revenue (approximately $10.6 million). Moreover, such businesses also
                                                       provide jobs in the community.
                                                       As shown in Table 2-5, per capita sales in Turlock in 2000 were above the average for Stanislaus
                                                       County but below the city of Modesto. By 2008, per capita sales in Turlock were higher than both
                                                       Modesto and the county as a whole, showing substantial increases in many categories, including
                                                       apparel, general merchandise, building materials, and service stations. The strong increases in
                                                       general merchandise and apparel is related to the opening of Monte Vista Crossings Shopping
                                                       Center in 2000, and its subsequent growth, with Home Depot and Target as the main anchors.
                                                       Additionally, residents of smaller communities (Patterson, Newman, Delhi, and Hughson, as
                                                       well as Keyes and Denair) come to Turlock to make purchases.
                                                       However, despite Turlock’s per capita sales growth in apparel, it is still small relative to Modesto.
                                                       This is also the case with home furnishings and appliances, which are types of merchandise for
                                                       which shoppers like to have a wide selection. Turlock’s relatively weak per capita sales in these
                                                       categories reflect continuing weak selection in the City compared to other nearby destinations.
                                                       Plan policies support the addition of retail facilities that will provide more choice in these and
                                                       other categories.
                                                       Turlock’s previous General Plan succeeded in considerably expanding the retail sector in the City.
                                                       As such, there remains ample land designated for retail uses that is yet undeveloped. Regarding

2-32 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

2.6-b	 Neighborhood and community commercial areas. Facilitate the development of
       neighborhood and community commercial areas, which will: (a) conveniently serve
       current and future residential needs, (b) provide employment opportunities, (c) con-
       tribute to the attractiveness of the community, and (d) contribute to the City’s tax base.
       Mixed use commercial areas are also encouraged, and shall be incorporated into new
       master plan areas.
2.6-c	 Downtown retail. Make Downtown a unique shopping district emphasizing specialty
       shops, entertainment opportunities, restaurants, and professional services.
       See Section 2.4 for discussion and policies on Downtown.
2.6-d	 Pedestrian orientation of commercial areas. Emphasize compact form and pedestrian
       orientation in new community and neighborhood commercial areas, in locations that
       many residents can reach on foot, by bicycle, or by short drives.
       Local-serving shopping centers are key elements of the neighborhoods described in
       Section 3.2.
Implementing Policies
2.6-e	 Timing and location of regional retail. Once Turlock grows to approximately 27,000
       housing units, conduct an updated Discount Superstore Market Demand Analysis
       to determine the economic impacts of allowing this type of retail use within the city.
       As appropriate, evaluate a range of zoning options to accommodate discount super-
       stores, including, but not limited to:
       •	 Increasing the allowable percentage of non-taxable floor area for discount super-
          stores; or
       •	 Designating a new Regional Commercial zoning district or an overlay district that
          may include areas along State Route 99 located adjacent to Monte Vista Avenue,
          Fulkerth Road, Lander Avenue, or by the new southeast interchange.
2.6-f	 Regional commercial developments fund transportation improvements. Require
       regional commercial center developers to fund transportation improvements that will
       be necessary to accommodate the level of activity anticipated.
2.6-g	 Local-serving shopping in new neighborhoods. In new master-planned residential
       neighborhoods, ensure development of neighborhood-oriented mixed-use centers
       that provide convenience shopping for nearby residents. Local shopping centers

        See Section 2.4 for discussion of the Downtown.
2.7	 Industrial Areas
Turlock’s agricultural setting has historically provided a basis for the City’s industry. Food pro-
cessing is the primary industry, providing the largest number of industrial jobs in Turlock. Four
of the top ten employers in the city are food processors, and Foster Farms, the third-largest
employer in the city, employs 1,500 workers. Fourteen percent of jobs in Turlock are in man-
ufacturing, and four percent are in the warehousing and transportation industries, which are
large users of industrial space. More detail on employment by industry is found in Section 2.11,
Economic Development.
Through the creation and implementation of the Westside Industrial Specific Plan (WISP),
Turlock has reaffirmed the continuing importance of industrial development as a main source
of jobs and economic growth in the City. Policies in this section reinforce the WISP and aim to
make industrial development a viable enterprise without negatively impacting other land uses in
the city.
Policies
Guiding Policies
2.7-a	 Concentrate industrial uses in the TRIP. Minimize conflicts between industry and
        other land uses by concentrating industrial activity west of Highway 99, specifically in
        the Turlock Regional Industrial Park (TRIP) area.
        Though some industry, including major poultry processing operations, is located
        east of the freeway, future industrial growth will be directed to the west, into the TRIP,
        where land use conflicts will be minimized.
2.7-b	 Attract industry to Turlock. Enhance the positive factors that have made the City
        attractive to industry, including freeway access, available large parcels of land,
                                                                                                   LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-35

                                   Some of the factors that affect industrial location are not within the control of the City;
                                   for example, the long-term availability of water. The City’s investigation of alternative
                                   water sources including well-head treatment may result in a solution to this problem
                                   before it becomes a constraint on future development. Plan policies in section 3.3
                                   address these issues.
                            Implementing Policies

2.8	 Professional Office and Business Park
Areas
In recent years, office employment in Turlock is provided by jobs in education (Turlock school
districts and CSUS), government (City of Turlock and Turlock Irrigation District), and the
health care industry (Emanuel Medical Center). The City’s largest concentrations of office space
are along East Main Street and Canal Drive in the central part of the city, City Hall on South
Broadway, around Emanuel Medical Center, and Downtown. Offices are also found along the
southern part of Geer Road, mixed with retail businesses. As the City grows, it is likely that the
space needed for both government services and health-care related services will increase.
While office employment has not historically been a major contributor to the City’s economy,
there are good reasons to implement strategies to increase office activities. Growth in trade, man-
ufacturing and service sectors, projected to account for the largest increase in employment over
the next 20 years, is likely to spur office development. Office employment does not create heavy
demands on the City’s water supply and wastewater treatment facilities, or directly generate air
pollution emissions. Further, expansion of office activities such as those in the finance, insurance
and real estate (FIRE) category would diversify the City’s economic base and offer more varied
employment opportunities for Turlock area residents.
Policies
Guiding Policies
2.8-a	 Provision of sites for office and business park uses. Contribute to diversifying the
        City’s employment base by maintaining large sites designated for office/business park
        use, including sites on Golden State Boulevard and business park sites in the TRIP.
2.8-b	 Office locations. Encourage local-serving offices to locate in and near Downtown
        and in proximity to existing professional office clusters, such as the Emanuel Medical
        Center.
Implementing Policies
2.8-c	 Nodes of offices throughout the city. Continue creating a concentration of medical
        offices in the vicinity of Emanuel Hospital, while still encouraging new nodes of office
        development along Geer Road and North Golden State Boulevard.
                                                                                                    LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-37

                            2.8-d	 Offices linking destinations. Link two prominent office clusters—Emanuel Medical
                                   Center and Downtown—by extending the Office designation along Colorado Avenue
                                   to East Main Street. These offices may be part of mixed use developments that include
                                   retail and/or residential uses.
                            2.8-e	 Largest office users in the TRIP. Direct the largest office users to appropriately desig-
                                   nated sites in the TRIP office and business park areas.
                            2.8-f	 City administrative offices located Downtown. Prioritize Downtown as a preferred
                                   location for the construction of any new City administrative offices, to maintain
                                   the government’s central location and to set a precedent for Downtown office
                                   development.
                            2.9	 The Planning Area and City/County
                            Relationships
                            As described in Section 1.3, The Planning Area is the geographic area for which the General
                            Plan establishes policies about future urban growth, long-term agricultural activity, and natural
                            resource conservation. The boundary of the Planning Area, which encompasses approximately
                            40 square miles, was determined by the City Council in response to State law requiring each city
                            to include in its General Plan all territory within the boundaries of the incorporated area as well
                            as “any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its
                            planning” (California Government Code Section 65300). The Planning Area is defined as such
                            because it is that portion of the unincorporated area that has a direct impact on City services and
                            infrastructure demands.
                            Turlock also defines a Study Area, which is a smaller area (27 square miles) defining the outer
                            limit of where urban development may take place over the next 20 years. The Study Area includes
                            land that is currently unincorporated, as well. As described in Chapter 3: New Growth Areas
                            and Infrastructure, unincorporated areas within the Study Area shall be annexed into Turlock
                            following an explicit phasing and master planning process. Inclusion of unincorporated land
                            in the Planning Area and the Study Area does not mean that the City disagrees with County
                            policies—in many cases the intent of the General Plan is to support or express agreement with
                            County policies for surrounding areas. Additional policies relating to City/County relationships
                            are addressed in Chapter 3: New Growth areas and Infrastructure; and Section 7.2: Agriculture
                            and Soil Resources.

Policies
Guiding Policies
2.9-a	 Agriculture belongs in unincorporated areas. Support Stanislaus and Merced County
       policies that promote continued agricultural activity on lands surrounding the urban
       areas designated on the General Plan Diagram.
2.9-b	 Urban land uses belong in incorporated areas. Work with Stanislaus County to direct
       growth to incorporated areas and established unincorporated communities.
       A key policy of the General Plan is the limited and orderly expansion of the City. This
       policy would be undermined by approval of urban activities in unincorporated areas.
2.9-c	 Encourage infill and more compact development to protect farmland. Relieve
       pressures to convert valuable agricultural lands to urban uses by encouraging infill
       development.
2.9-d	 Incorporate existing urbanized areas. Seek to include in the City all urbanized areas
       contiguous with City territory. The City’s first priority for annexation shall be the
       numerous unincorporated County islands located wholly within Turlock (see accompa-
       nying policies in Section 3.1). A second area of priority, should property owners desire
       it, is the area of commercial uses north of Taylor Road on both sides of State Route 99
       to Barnhart Road. While the City shall not initiate the annexation of these properties, it
       will work with property owners on developing financing and infrastructure improve-
       ment strategies to facilitate annexation should they express interest.
2.9-e	 Work with County on regional projects. Cooperate with County agencies in planning
       for transportation improvements and other major projects affecting multiple agencies.
       The Stanislaus County Expressway Study and the County’s Congestion Management
       Program are two of the major projects in which the City and County are participat-
       ing. Both projects are led by the Stanislaus Council of Governments (StanCOG), the
       County’s Regional Transportation Agency.
2.9-f	 Work with County on mitigating impacts of growth. Work with Stanislaus County
       to implement financing mechanisms to ensure that development within the Planning
       Area pays its fair share of both City and County improvements required to mitigate the
       impacts of growth.
                                                                                                  LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-39

                            Implementing Policies
                            2.9-g	 Stanislaus County plans for Denair and Keyes. Stanislaus County shall remain respon-
                                   sible for land use planning for the unincorporated communities of Keyes and Denair.
                                   However, the City of Turlock shall review development proposals in these commu-
                                   nities to ensure that they are consistent with the City’s ability to provide wastewater
                                   treatment services, on which they depend.
                            2.9-h	 Cooperate at the City/County line. Seek Stanislaus County cooperation in designating
                                   unincorporated land for uses compatible with adjacent City lands.
                            2.9-i	 LAFCO approval for Sphere of Influence changes. Seek LAFCO approval of Sphere of
                                   Influence changes to reflect the General Plan Diagram, upon completion of the master
                                   plan updates for the sewer, water, and wastewater treatment systems, and upon com-
                                   pletion of the Capital Facilities Fee update (within two years of adoption of the General
                                   Plan).
                                   LAFCO action would clearly demarcate those areas that are expected to be urbanized
                                   and incorporated in the future. Lands not within the City’s Sphere of Influence (and
                                   outside of Keyes and Denair) are to remain subject to the County’s regulations for
                                   lands designated for agricultural use. Including Turlock’s expansion areas in the City’s
                                   sphere will mean that prezoning and annexation criteria relating to orderly expansion
                                   of the City will have to be met before development proposals will be considered.
                            2.9-j	 Phasing of annexations. Annexations to the City should proceed according to the
                                   phasing plan described in Section 3.1.
                            2.9-k	 Fee-sharing programs. Update the City’s agreement with Stanislaus County regarding
                                   collection of the public facilities fee. The agreement should stipulate that the City will
                                   collect and pass on to the County development fees for County improvements, and
                                   the County will refer to the City applications for development in the City’s Sphere of
                                   Influence.
                                   The fee sharing agreement helps avoid the fiscalization of land use decisions in the
                                   county, discourage urban commercial development in unincorporated areas, and
                                   promote urban infill and redevelopment.
                                   This policy is consistent with the Stanislaus County General Plan, which was amended
                                   following a pioneering agreement made between the City and County. Subsequent
                                   to that time, the County entered into similar agreements with each of the cities in the
2-40 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

        County. However, the agreement between Turlock and the County lapsed without
        renewal. This policy advocates renegotiation of the agreement without provision of a
        sales tax revenue pass-through.
2.9-l	  County island incorporation. Work with Stanislaus County to identify possible
        revenue tools for underwriting necessary improvements in order to encourage incor-
        poration of County islands.
        Development standards in the islands differ from those in the surrounding areas. Incor-
        poration should be made a condition of project approval on any property in any of the
        islands. See also policies in Section 3.1, Growth Strategy, for timing strategies related
        to County island incorporation.
2.9-m	 Work with StanCOG on regional issues. Continue to participate with StanCOG on
        matters of mutual concern to the City and County. These include programs such as
        regional expressway studies, housing needs determination, the Regional Transporta-
        tion Plan (RTP), the Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), and others.
                                                                                                        Land in Urban Reserve is predominantly agricultural in

The General Plan Diagram classifies land in the Turlock Study Area for a variety of land uses,
which the City believes addresses future community needs through the year 2030. Land classi-
fied as Urban Reserve in this General Plan is that which is believed may remain committed to
agricultural uses for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, land outside current city limits
that is believed to be necessary to accomodate future growth is designated as master plan areas.
It is the City’s intent that land classified as Urban Reserve should remain agricultural in use over
the course of the planning period (through 2030), but may eventually give way to urban uses as
the community’s economic needs continue to evolve over time (likely beyond the time horizon of
this General Plan). The timing of conversion of Urban Reserve land to urban uses may be recon-
sidered if development occurs at a substantially slower or faster pace than projected in this Plan.
However, this conditions would generally give way to another update of the General Plan.
Policies that address the timing and circumstances for the reclassification of land classified
Urban Reserve to specific land use classifications to accommodate urban uses are outlined below.
The conversion of Urban Reserve land to urban uses is treated in more detail in Chapter 3: New
Growth Areas and Infrastructure.

                                      b)	 the City Council, by a 4/5ths affirmative vote, finds in the public interest to reclas-

                                          shall accompany any secondary residential use in this area.
                                    In either case, the reclassification must take place as part of a master planning process,
                                    or, ideally, trigger an update to the General Plan.
2-42 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

2.11	 Economic Development
Turlock’s economy has traditionally been based on agriculture, agriculture-related indus-
tries (primarily food processing), and other manufacturing. Its location in the heart of the San
Joaquin Valley, home to some of the most fertile farmland in the world, naturally led to Turlock’s
agricultural heritage and employment base.
Over the past 50 years, Turlock’s population has grown from 9,000 in 1960 to 70,000 today.
The economy has shifted to focus on schools, government, and service businesses to serve the
population. The largest single employer is now the Turlock Unified School District. The largest
industry sectors are state and local government (15 percent), retail (14 percent), manufacturing (14
percent), health care and social assistance (12 percent) and accommodation and food services (10
percent). These activities will likely remain the strongest components of the city’s job base as the
population continues to grow.
While most economic activity occurs in the private sector, the City can take an active role in
furthering its economic prosperity. Examples of what the City can do to spur economic develop-
ment include:
 •	 Ensuring that local policies do not impede the needs of businesses to move or expand;
 •	 Facilitating and acting as a catalyst for development in strategic market segments, especially
    those that may spur other activities or provide fiscal benefits;
 •	 Coordinating and providing for infrastructure improvements; and
 •	 Generating revenue to support community development objectives.
This section describes Turlock’s economic development strategy and provides policies to
implement the City’s goals.
Economic Context and Employment Profile
Overall, the key economic drivers in Stanislaus County are retail trade, manufacturing, and
public or non-profit (e.g. health care) related sectors. While the manufacturing sector reflects the
regions’ competitive location and labor force characteristics, the latter two sectors are primarily
                                                                                                    LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-43

                            population driven. Modesto currently serves as the primary employment center in Stanislaus
                            County, providing about 70 percent of the total jobs, with Turlock in second at about 20 percent.
                            Turlock’s employment composition is reflective of the County as a whole. Turlock’s major
                            sectors are State and Local Government (15 percent), Retail Trade (14 percent), Manufactur-
                            ing (14 percent), Health Care and Social Assistance (12 percent) and Hotel and Food Services
                            (10 percent). For the County, Manufacturing and Retail Trade represent the largest employment
                            sectors, followed by “Health Care & Social Assistance.” These three sectors account for about 40
                            percent of total jobs in Turlock and 45 percent Countywide (Table 2-6).
                            The leading employers in Turlock and the County reflect the trends described above. As shown in
                            Table 2-7, the Turlock Unified School District (TUSD) employs the highest number of employees
                            in the City with 2,200 employees. Emanuel Medical Center is second, with over 1,500 employees.
                            The City’s poultry processing plant, Foster Farms, is the third-largest employer in the City with
                            a total of 1,500 employees. Overall, the top ten employers employ a total of approximately 8,000
                            employees in the City or close to 30 percent of the total. Four of the top employers within the
                            County are located in the City, which includes California State University (CSU) Stanislaus,
                            Emanuel Medical Center, Foster Farms, and Stanislaus County Community Services.
                            For the most part, historical employment growth has reinforced the economic patterns described
                            above and substantiates the declining importance of agriculture both regionally and locally (near
                            and within urbanized areas). Specifically, population-driven sectors such as State and Local Gov-
                            ernment, Health Care & Social Assistance and Accommodations & Food Services have provided
                            the largest contributions to employment growth in Turlock and the County as a whole since
                            2000. Meanwhile, agriculture was the only sector to experience declining employment across all
                            jurisdictions during this period. Turlock also experienced a significant decrease in Management
                            of Companies and Enterprises (with 1,100 jobs) and Construction (with 300 jobs).
                            Jobs/Housing Balance
                            Commute patterns play an increasingly important role in population growth and thus, urban
                            land demand. Information on Turlock’s jobs-housing balance and the travel patterns of both
                            local residents and employees provide important insight into its evolving role in the regional
                            economy. In the long-run, areas such as Turlock that are not centrally located relative to major
                            job centers need to expand economically in order to sustain future population.

                            Historical data on Turlock’s jobs-housing balance and jobs to employee ratios suggest that
                            the City has maintained relatively balanced population and employment growth. Specifically,
                            since 1991 the City has consistently provided about 1.1 jobs per household (Table 2-8). This ratio
                            compares favorably to the County as a whole which provides about one job per household. In
                            addition, the City provided about one job per resident in the workforce in 2007, a 12 percent
                            increase from 1991. Again, the City has out-performed the County in this regard as the County
                            currently provides about 0.8 jobs per resident in the workforce.
                            The 2000 Census provides detailed data on travel patterns by both place of work and place of
                            residence. Although relatively dated, this data also suggest that most of Turlock’s residents and
                            employees work and live locally. Specifically, about 48 percent of the City’s employed residents
                            worked in Turlock while about 82 percent worked in the County in 2000 (Table 2-9). In addition,
                            about 54 percent of Turlock employees live in the City and about 81 percent live in the County.
                            Turlock is a city where most people work locally: over 50 percent of jobs in Turlock are held by
                            Turlock residents, and 82 percent of Turlock residents work somewhere in Stanislaus County.

Over 75 percent of the Turlock workforce commutes less than 30 minutes to work. Less than five
percent of Turlock workers commute to the San Francisco Bay Area.
Economic Development Strategy
Over the time frame of this General Plan, the City of Turlock is expected to add around 45,000
new residents, an increase of nearly 65 percent. In order to support this population, the City will
need to add jobs. While many jobs will “naturally” arise from the services needed to support this
growing population (such as schools, retail and personal services, police and fire protection, and
others), additional jobs in other sectors—appropriate for workers with a range of skill types—
will also be necessary.

2-48 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

The City recognizes that while its location in the Central Valley lends many advantages in job
attraction, it is also a competitive environment. Many similar cities in the Valley possess the
same assets—central location, available inexpensive land, freeway and rail access—and therefore
Turlock must build upon its unique strengths and differentiate itself from its neighbors.
Turlock’s Strengths
Turlock’s strongest assets for economic development include:
 •	 CSU-Stanislaus, a four-year public university campus with approximately 6,800 full-time
    equivalent students. Disciplines seeing the most significant growth include business, health sci-
    ences and services, psychology, security and protective services, agriculture, and biomedical
    sciences. Similarly, Turlock has a well-educated workforce, with education levels exceeding those
    of Stanislaus County overall (23 percent of Turlock residents had a bachelor’s degree or higher in
    2007, versus 16 percent countywide).
 •	 Adoption of the Westside Industrial Specific Plan (WISP) in 2006, which allocated over 2,600
    acres for industrial and business park development on the west side of Highway 99. Through
    development of the TRIP, Turlock aims to enable significant industrial development and
    improve the jobs-housing balance in the area. The plan covers land use regulations, design guide-
    lines, and phasing. Through the creation and nurturing of an ‘Agri-Science’ industry cluster,
    which would include biotech, life sciences, and agri-business, the TRIP aims to create a “bridge”
    for Turlock’s current agriculture and manufacturing industries to transition to newer products
    and technologies.
 •	 A strong existing food processing sector, including such large employers as Foster Farms, Sen-
    sient Flavors, Supherb Farms, and Mid-Valley Dairy. These businesses form an “anchor” and
    may help attract similar establishments by appearing as a long-time successful industrial node.
 •	 Emanuel Medical Center, with its 209-bed acute care hospital, 145-bed skilled nursing facil-
    ity, 49-bed assisted living facility, and outpatient medical offices for primary care on Colorado
    Avenue and Monte Vista Avenue, is both a community and a regional asset and a source of high
    paying, high-skilled jobs.
                                                                                                       LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-49

                                                    •	 Downtown Turlock, anchored by City Hall, is home to historic building stock, recently imple-
                                                       mented streetscape and public realm improvements, and a number of restaurants and specialty
                                                       shops. The Downtown Property Owners Association is actively involved in the betterment and
                                                       continued development of Downtown and works closely with the City. Additionally, in 2008,
                                                       a Branding, Development, and Marketing Action Plan was completed for the Downtown that
                                                       posed the idea of a bridal shopping and wedding planning theme for the area.
                                                    •	 Youth Sports. Particularly with the completion of the Regional Sports Park, Turlock has
                                                       become a center for youth sports competitions attracting teams from across the State. This activ-
                                                       ity has had noticeable positive “spin-off” impacts, providing business for hotels and restaurants.
                                                       With the establishment of more community parks through 2030, as well as increased utilization
                                                       of the County Fairgrounds, Turlock can further establish itself as a youth and amateur sports
                                                       destination.
                                                    •	 Competitively priced electricity. Turlock’s homes and businesses receive electric power from

                                                    •	 An active Chamber of Commerce. The Turlock Chamber of Commerce, comprised of over 500
                                                       members, plays an active role in advocating for business interests and a strong local economy.
                                                       The Chamber facilitates networking and business opportunities amongst its members, and it
                                                       maintains a strong working relationship with the City.
                                                    •	 Available water and wastewater treatment capacity. With the development and recent upgrade
                                                       of the Turlock Regional Water Quality Control Facility (TRWQCF), Turlock is well posi-
                                                       tioned to accommodate future growth in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The
                                                       TRWQFC now produces recycled water suitable for reuse in city landscaping and in industrial
                                                       processes. The current and planned treatment facilities will occupy less than half of the facility’s
                                                       140 acre site, allowing for ample future expansion.
                                                    •	 Land available at low cost. Not only does the TRIP enable significant industrial development in
                                                       Turlock, but the specific plan area has ample developable land. Land costs in Turlock are signif-
                                                       icantly lower than those in coastal California or even the outer edges of the Bay Area; this is the
                                                       case for both industrial/commercial as well as residential land.

 •	 Presence of County Fairgrounds. Turlock hosts the Stanislaus County Fairgrounds, a major
    asset for business generation and tourist attraction. The Fairgrounds are used not only for the
    annual County Fair but also for other regional events throughout the year. The County has also
    expressed interest in expanding the fairgrounds.
Turlock’s Challenges
Turlock’s economic development strategy must not only capitalize on the City’s strengths, but
also recognize and address its challenges. Some challenges that Turlock faces regarding economic
growth include:
 •	 Location. While Turlock is ideally located for distribution to west coast markets, particularly
    the San Francisco Bay Area, other nearby cities enjoy this same advantage, including Modesto,          Economic development policies aim to both at-
    Manteca, and Lodi. Moreover, Turlock has excellent access to Highway 99 but limited access             tract new economic growth as well as support and
    to Interstate 5. The City cannot change its location, but it can direct its efforts toward economic    strengthen the city’s existing business establish-
                                                                                                           ments.
    development that benefits from the City’s location but is not entirely dependent upon it. Addi-
    tionally, planning efforts are underway with Stanislaus County and the City of Patterson to
    develop West Main Street as an east-west expressway that would connect Turlock more effi-
    ciently to I-5.
 •	 Downtown Turlock. While Downtown has made great strides in recent years, the current eco-
    nomic downturn has taken a toll on the area’s vitality. The deep recession that has affected the
    entire nation has also impacted Downtown Turlock, raising vacancy rates and turnover in the
    past few years. The existing stores and the presence of City Hall create activity during the day,
    but the area experiences less activity at night. More people living close to Downtown, and more
    active uses in Downtown buildings (or new buildings) would be of great benefit.
 •	 Lack of linked economic activities. While Turlock has numerous economic assets and several
    employers with over 1,000 jobs, they have not attracted a significant amount of linked economic
    activities—either because they take care of their needs in-house, or because they rely on suppliers
    and other businesses outside of Turlock or even the State. Some examples of linked activities and
    economic synergies do exist, such as between the hospital and the university’s nursing program,
    but more horizontal and vertical linkages could be made.
                                                                                                        LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT | 2-51

                                                    •	 Social Issues and Public Safety. Turlock, like many other communities in the Central Valley,
                                                       struggles with a number of social issues such as homelessness. While the majority of Turlock’s
                                                       neighborhoods are safe and secure, the persistence of some of these social and public safety issues
                                                       may affect the city’s image.
                                                    •	 Perception of Permit Process for Small Businesses. Many involved in Turlock’s economic
                                                       development have voiced concern over the City’s practices as not being sufficiently “business
                                                       friendly” to attract new employers. Even though the City has made strides in improving its per-
                                                       mitting process, some involved in Turlock’s economic development voice concern over the
                                                       perception of the City’s practices as not being sufficiently easy and welcoming to attract new
                                                       employers. Rigid code enforcement for small businesses and renovations were cited as potential
                                                       problem areas.
                                                    •	 Transportation and Infrastructure Maintenance. The City has struggled to maintain the
                                                       quality of existing city streets that are seeing heavy industrial truck traffic, and those in the

                                                       that requires major users to help pay the way.
                                                    •	 County Islands. Turlock has several areas of unincorporated county land surrounded on all
                                                       sides by the incorporated city, creating “county islands.” Because the county is lands are not
                                                       served by city infrastructure, the lack of improvements and the quality of development is gen-
                                                       erally below the City’s standards and therefore negatively impacts Turlock’s image. The City is
                                                       engaged in developing a strategy with Stanislaus County to incorporate and upgrade these areas.
                                                   Economic development policies aim to both leverage the City’s assets and address its chal-
                                                   lenges in order to foster continued economic growth through 2030. The policies presented in
                                                   this section include specific economic development programs as well as more generalized strate-

                                     youth sports tournaments. This City resource will be someone that businesses, such
                                     as hotels, can contact for information on when large groups of visitors will be coming

3	        New Growth Areas and Infrastructure
The New Growth Areas and Infrastructure element builds on Turlock’s successful history of
growth management and master planning, which has been a main contributor to the city’s
enduring compact form, cohesive neighborhoods, and lack of “leap frog” development patterns.
By formalizing the master planning process in the General Plan, as well as identifying the City’s
infrastructure needs and priorities necessary to serve this new growth and maintain service to
the existing urbanized area, Turlock is ensuring that this means of development continues in the
future. Moreover, new standards and policies in this element identify important land use and
urban design aspects of new developments so that future master plans help achieve the City’s
overall goals of providing diverse, compact, walkable neighborhoods.
3.1	 Growth Strategy
Background
Turlock has adopted a very wise growth management strategy, which has enabled the city to          This element guides the development of active,
maintain fiscal stability, preserve farmland, and develop desirable new neighborhoods for its      vibrant new neighborhoods to serve Turlock’s growing

established for its development. Seventy percent of the master plan area must be issued building
permits before the next can commence. Turlock has distinguished itself this way over the last
planning period and wants to carry forward this successful method of growth and develop-
ment over the next planning period. The strategy has resulted in attractive new neighborhoods,
complete infrastructure, and well maintained new roads and public facilities. Area-wide plans
must address land use, circulation, housing, open space, infrastructure, public facilities, and
public services consistent with the General Plan.
This chapter summarizes the existing growth management and master planning strategy and
adds some key new provisions, such as how to incorporate compact development types, how to
achieve neighborhood commercial centers, and how to integrate the City’s parks plan into new
residential areas.
                                                                                              NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-1

                                                  Turlock’s Growth Management History
                                                  Turlock’s rapid growth in the late 1980s led to concerns about adequacy of public facilities and
                                                  impacts of expansion on agriculture, which in turn led to adoption of the Growth Manage-
                                                  ment Program (GMP). Due to reduced demand for building permits as a result of the early 1990s
                                                  recession, the GMP was rescinded by City Ordinance 914-CS on January 14, 1997 as part of the
                                                  Zoning Ordinance Update.
                                                  In 1998, the City of Turlock adopted a Residential Annexation Policy that focuses annexations
                                                  and growth to one quadrant of the city at one time (City Council Resolution No 98-036). New
                                                  residential development was designated to occur first in the northwestern quadrant of the City.
                                                  Focusing development in one area at a time has allowed for the timely and efficient construc-
                                                  tion of infrastructure and use of resources. Furthermore, in 1999, the City adopted a policy that
                                                  requires area-wide planning in conjunction with future annexations (City Council Resolution
                                                  No 99-021).
Turlock’s growth management strategy has produced Existing Master Plans and Specific Plans
a strong “edge” of urban development.
                                                  In accordance with its growth management strategy, Turlock has adopted a number of Specific
                                                  Plans and Master Plans following the adoption of the 1992 General Plan, which guide growth in
                                                  the specified areas. Specific and Master Plans implement General Plan policies by analyzing the
                                                  land use, circulation, public facilities, infrastructure, and financing issues of particular areas to
                                                  evaluate their development potential, often prior to annexation by the City. The existing Specific
                                                  and Master Plan policies are still in effect, and in some cases, the plan areas are still being built
                                                  out. Figure 3-1 shows the areas where Master Plans and Specific Plans have been established.
                                                  Northwest Triangle Specific Plan (1995, amended 2004)
                                                  New residential development was designated to occur first in the Northwest quadrant of the
                                                  City, and the Northwest Triangle Specific Plan was adopted in 1995 to allow development in
                                                  that area. The Northwest Triangle Specific Plan (NWTSP) covers an area of approximately 800
                                                  acres in the triangle created by Golden State Boulevard to the east, Highway 99 to the west, and

3-4 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Northeast Turlock Master Plan (2004)
The next master plan, the Northeast Turlock Master Plan (NETMP), focused on an area at the
northeast corner of the City. Covering approximately 255 acres, the plan area is bounded on the
north by Taylor Road and the Turlock Irrigation District Lateral 3; on the east by the rear parcel
lines of the lots that front the east side of Berkeley Avenue; on the south by the midpoint between
Christofferson Parkway and Monte Vista Avenue; and on the west by Colorado Avenue, with a
rectangular “finger” that stretches along Christoffersen Parkway to Olive Avenue. At the time of
the plan’s creation, the subject area was not yet annexed to the city.
The NETMP pursued the goal of expanding carefully guided development (primarily resi-
dential) to the northeastern edge of Turlock and integrating it into the rest of the city. At the
same time, the NETMP endeavored to create a well-defined “edge,” maintaining a clear separa-
tion between Turlock and the neighboring community of Denair. Nearly all of the land in the
plan area prior to development was productive agriculture, but the area had been designated for
growth in the General Plan.
                                                                                                       The Northeast Turlock Master Plan includes a well-

buffer, creating a transition zone from urban to rural uses between Turlock and Denair, includes
detention areas and a community trail.
East Tuolumne Master Plan (2005)
The East Tuolumne Master Plan (ETMP) was adopted by the City in 2005. The plan area covers
approximately 100 acres along East Tuolumne Road between North Quincy and North Waring
Roads. The purpose of the ETMP is similar to the Northeast Turlock Master Plan—to create a
smooth transition from urban to rural land uses along the City’s eastern border, while creating a
distinct boundary between Turlock and Denair.
The plan calls for the development of very low density (generally less than three dwelling units per
acre) single family homes, with some open space and trails. However, since the plan’s adoption,
the market conditions in Turlock have not supported developing the land in this manner. The
planning area remains largely agricultural with a few existing estate homes.

                           Westside Industrial Specific Plan (2006)
                           The Westside Industrial Specific Plan (WISP) is the most recent of the City’s Specific Plans, and
                           the first to focus exclusively on non-residential development. The Plan Area covers 2,615 acres,
                           bounded by Fulkerth Road to the north, Highway 99 to the east, Linwood Avenue and Simmons
                           Road to the south, and Washington Road to the west. The Plan Area, also referred to as the
                           Turlock Regional Industrial Park or TRIP, is partially developed with industrial and commercial
                           uses, and the majority of the site is currently used for agriculture.
                           The City prepared the plan in order to facilitate economic growth in the industrial sector, with
                           an emphasis on agricultural products, food processing, and related businesses. Through devel-

                           center in Turlock, simultaneously improving the jobs-housing balance in the area. The plan
                           covers land use regulations, design guidelines, and phasing. Through the creation and nurturing
                           of an ‘Agri-Science’ industry cluster, which would include biotech, life sciences, and agri-busi-
                           ness, the WISP aims to create a “bridge” for Turlock’s current agriculture and manufacturing
                           industries to transition to newer products and technologies.

                           Section 2.3 of the Land Use and Economic Development Element (Chapter 2) establishes low
                           and high range population growth estimates (Table 3-1).
                           The General Plan uses the low end of these projections as the target number of households to
                           accommodate over the course of the planning period (through 2030). However, the City acknowl-
                           edges that due to this current climate of slow growth and economic recovery, it is also possible
                           that Turlock’s population will not even achieve this low end projection by 2030.

Development Sites within City Limits
According to their General Plan Land Use designations, infill sites (those that are vacant or sub-
stantially underutilized) have a maximum capacity for approximately 5,000 new housing units.
However, given site constraints, property owners’ intentions, and other factors, it is likely that
only a portion of these sites will actually develop over the next 20 years; an estimate is 60 percent
(3,000 units). The remainder of the development needed to house Turlock’s expected growth
would be within new neighborhoods in master plan areas, several of which are outside of the
current city limits. The phasing and capacity of these areas is described below.
Growth Phasing and Development of Master Plan Areas
Total development permitted under the General Plan land use diagram accommodates a reason-
able amount of growth given regional projections and current market conditions, and historical
trends. In fact, there is substantial capacity for new residential development within city limits on
infill parcels throughout Turlock as well as in partially built out master plan areas (specifically the
Northeast Turlock Master Plan and the East Tuolumne Master Plan areas). In addition to these              A substantial amount of development needed to sup-
master plans, the General Plan defines three additional new master plan areas: Southeast 1 (also          port future growth can be accommodated on vacant
                                                                                                          and underdeveloped sites within city limits.
known as Morgan Ranch, and located within city limits), Southeast 2, and Southeast 3. Areas 2
and 3 are outside of city limits. Policy 3.1-p requires that 70 percent of the aggregate housing units
in the Northeast Turlock Master Plan, the East Tuolumne Master Plan, and Southeast 1 (Morgan
Ranch) must be issued building permits before annexation, master planning, and development
of Southeast 2 may begin.Table 3-2 shows the development potential and cumulative develop-
ment by area.
Prezoning and Annexation
Turlock’s current prezoning and annexation ordinance allows the City to prezone unincorpo-
rated land adjacent to the city limits for the purposes of establishing the zoning that will apply in
the event that the land is annexed to the City. The purposes are twofold:
1.	 To promote the orderly development and expansion to boundaries of the City and
2.	 To protect, preserve, and promote the quality of life in the City by establishing control over the
    quality, distribution, and rate of growth in the City of Turlock.

                           Land to be prezoned (and subsequently annexed) must be adjacent to the current city limits,
                           located within the primary sphere of influence, and be planned for development consistent with
                           the designations in the General Plan. The proposed development must also show that it fully
                           mitigates all potential impacts to the schools, public park and recreation facilities, public safety
                           facilities, and infrastructure.
                           The ordinance also requires that proposed annexations be accompanied by an area-wide plan,
                           which may be accomplished either by a Specific Plan (subject to State government code require-
                           ments) or a Master Plan, with requirements specified by the City. Master Plans must describe
                           the location and development standards for land uses and intensities; roads, utilities, and other
                           public infrastructure; and parks, schools, and other public space. It must include a phasing plan
                           and identify means of financing public improvements. The plan must also identify and describe
                           any mitigation measures needed to offset any environmental impacts, and finally discuss consis-
                           tency of the proposed Master Plan with the General Plan (including the Housing Element).
                           The General Plan supports the continuation of Turlock’s prezoning, annexation, and master
                           planning strategy. It has proven to be a successful tool for creating desirable new neighbor-
                           hoods, ensuring that new development pays its way and does not strain the City fiscally, and
                           allowing Turlock to become a growth management model for other Valley cities facing similarly
                           rapid population growth. New policies in this section build on Turlock’s development strategy,
                           strengthening it to ensure that new growth areas create complete neighborhoods with a mix of
                           uses and a range of housing types to best serve the city’s current and future population.
3-8 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

County Island Strategy
Turlock has a number of unincorporated “County Islands,” areas of unincorporated county land
that are surrounded by incorporated Turlock on all sides. The islands are a result of piecemeal
annexation over the years and property owners’ interests and preferences. Generally, the county
islands are not served by City infrastructure or services; some have no curb and gutter improve-
ments and their roads are not maintained to City standards. Similarly, Stanislaus County is
technically responsible for their public safety services.
Turlock has an interest in incorporating the county islands and bringing their public infra-
structure up to City standards, as this would help ameliorate public health and safety concerns.
However, willingness on the part of landowners and Stanislaus County is necessary for incor-
poration, as is funding for infrastructure upgrades. Turlock is in the process of negotiating a
cost-sharing strategy with the County that would split the cost burden between the two jurisdic-
tions. For the largest of the islands (the “Montana-West” area), incorporation would likely take
place through a master planning process similar to that for other unincorporated areas outlined
later in this chapter. The boundary of the Montana-West master plan area is shown on Figure          A number of county islands lack curb and gutter infra-
                                                                                                     structure. A financing plan for these and other infra-

3, but is not subject to the phasing policy that restricts when master plan development may
proceed; in other words, development of Montana-West could proceed at any time.
While a formal master planning process may not take place for incorporation of the smaller
county islands, property owners seeking annexation must still demonstrate that they have a
plan to finance the needed improvements to bring their properties up to City infrastructure
standards. At the time that annexation is being considered, the City and property owners may
also reexamine the General Plan land uses designated on the properties and determine whether
higher density/intensity uses are warranted or desirable, especially if increasing the intensity of
development would improve the financial feasibility of incorporation.
The City’s overall strategy for County Island incorporation is described in Policy 3.1-m. The pre-
liminary approach to the Montana-West area—treating it as a master plan area—is described in
further detail in Section 3.2.

                                   establish fiscal and infrastructure tools to ensure that improvements to County roads
                                   and other infrastructure are being made as new development proceeds.
                            3.1-c	 Promote good design in new growth areas. Design new growth and development
                                   so that it is compact; preserves natural, environmental, and economic resources;
                                   and provides the efficient and timely delivery of infrastructure, public facilities, and

                            3.1-g	 Master Plan Areas. Plan for growth in phases and discreet master plan areas, so that
                                   neighborhoods are fully planned and at least 70 percent of building permits issued
                                   prior to the construction of the next master plan area.
                            3.1-h	 Provide a range of housing types. Ensure a balance of housing types affordable to the
                                   complete range of income and age groups.

3-10 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Implementing Policies
3.1-i	 Utilize Housing Element. Integrate Housing Element program components with
       growth policies.
3.1-j	 Capital improvement program review. Continue to annually review the City’s Capital
       Improvement Program in order to increase capacity of needed public services in
       response to City growth.
3.1-k	 Northern boundary establishment. Maintain Taylor Road as the northernmost
       boundary of urban development. The exception to this policy is for the area along
       State Route 99 at the northwestern corner of the Study Area (south of the Keyes
       Community Plan boundary).
3.1-l	 Capital Facilities Fee program. Update the Capital Facilities Fee (CFF) to cover
       improvements and infrastructure that are used by residents and businesses citywide.
       The CFF shall include:
       •	 Major new transportation infrastructure such as arterials, expressways, railroad
          and highway overcrossings, and interchanges
       •	 New bicycle lanes, traffic signals on existing streets and other operational
          improvements
       •	 New transit facilities and amenities
       •	 Downtown parking lots and structures
       •	 Regional rail facilities
       •	 Public landscaping
       •	 Park and ride facilities
       •	 Traffic calming strategies
       •	 Police and fire services
       •	 General government services
       The CFF shall not cover the costs of new collectors and local streets in new develop-
       ment areas, as these are to be funded through Master Plan fees. The CFF update shall
       also reflect the lower impacts of walkable neighborhoods within the city.
3.1-m	 Develop County Islands incorporation strategy. As development proposals for county
       island incorporation come forward, develop a financial plan with Stanislaus County
       to implement infrastructure improvements and any other requirements for annex-
       ation. The plan shall include a schedule and a priority list, focusing initial efforts on
                                                                                                 NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-11

                                   the Montana-West area, as a master plan. It is the City’s preference that whole county
                                   islands incorporate at one time; however, individual project-level proposals shall also
                                   be considered if the applicant can prove ability to provide the required infrastruc-
                                   ture improvements. Preparation of financial plans may also offer the opportunity to
                                   reexamine these parcels’ General Plan land use designations, and consider increasing
                                   density/intensity if it facilitates the financial feasibility of incorporation.
                            3.1-n	 Continue prezoning and annexation. Continue to require that proposals for prezoning
                                   and annexation comply with the Residential Annexation Policy, Area-Wide Planning
                                   Policy, and the municipal code requirements relating to orderly and contiguous devel-
                                   opment, and public services and facilities. The policies under the City’s Prezoning and
                                   Annexation ordinance shall be amended to reflect the new policies for master plans
                                   enumerated in Section 3.2.
                            3.1-o	 Update existing master and specific plans. For existing master and specific plans
                                   that are not yet fully built out, evaluate the current plans for consistency with the new
                                   land use designations and other policies outlined in this General Plan, and update as
                                   necessary. Where the land use diagram (Figure 2-2) proposes a higher intensity land
                                   use within the boundary of an existing master or specific plan, rezoning shall occur
                                   only after the specific or master plan is updated and adopted. In these cases, until such
                                   time that the specific or master plan is updated, the current zoning for the property
                                   shall remain in place. Changes in designation that result in equal or lower intensity
                                   may be processed as part of the Citywide rezone action required to impelement the
                                   new General Plan. The Northwest Triangle Specific Plan and the East Tuolumne Master
                                   Plan are high priorities for evaluation and updating.
                            3.1-p	 Timing. A new master plan area may not proceed with planning, annexation and devel-
                                   opment until 70 percent of the building permits associated with the previous area have
                                   been issued. Prior to proceeding with the planning, annexation, and development of
                                   Master Plan Area Southeast 2, 70 percent of the building permits shall be issued for the

3.2	 Land Use and Design of New Growth Areas
Designating Neighborhoods: A new General Plan Approach
This General Plan introduces a new concept of designating residential neighborhoods. Rather
than assigning specific land use designations to individual parcels (like the previous General
Plan), this approach identifies future master plan areas for new residential neighborhoods. While
the City has engaged in the master planning process for some time, this General Plan is the first
to specify the locations, boundaries, and phasing of those master plans in the document. The mix
of uses, types of development and average density are defined for each master plan area.
The plan specifies a mix of uses that each master plan area must include, but does not precisely
dictate where each land use must go. For instance, a neighborhood type might be required to
include certain minimum percentages of housing at different densities, a minimum percentage of
park land, schools, and public space, and a percentage of commercial and/or office uses. When a
master plan is prepared for the development of the neighborhood, it must conform to these spec-
ifications. Precise locations of each land use are to be determined during the master planning
process. The General Plan includes illustrative examples of how the required neighborhood spec-
ifications could be achieved, in the next section.
Each of the areas is given a general designation of a residential density range. Residential density
is not assigned on a parcel-specific basis. Rather, when the area is master planned and developed,
the overall density and number of units in the master plan area would have to meet this target (or
exceed it by up to 20 percent), and would include a mix of housing types. When the master plan
is approved, zoning is also put in place to reflect the specific land uses at the same time.
Compact Neighborhoods
The character of the residential neighborhoods proposed for development over this planning
period is more compact than the type of development that Turlock has seen over the last 10 years.
The proposed residential neighborhoods include a mix of traditional single family, small-lot
single family, townhouses, and multifamily apartments or condominiums.
                                                                                                     Residential development in new master plan areas will
                                                                                                     incorporate a variety of housing types and densities.

                            Why Compact Neighborhoods?
                            Turlock will be trending towards more compact residential development for several reasons:
                             •	 Changing demographics, relating to an aging population, means that there will be greater
                                demand for smaller housing types. The number of residents over the age of 60 is growing rapidly,
                                more than any other age group. Turlock has built up its single family detached housing stock
                                significantly, and the next planning period needs to provide smaller housing types needed by
                                seniors and other small households such as singles, empty-nesters, and single parents.
                             •	 State mandates for greenhouse gas emission reductions mean that Turlock will have to explore ways
                                to reduce its carbon footprint. Land use and transportation are the single most important factor
                                in achieving this goal. More compact housing means that residents can travel more easily on foot
                                or by bicycle, and make fewer, shorter car trips.
                             •	 Conservation of agricultural land. Higher density development results in less farmland convert-
                                ing to nonagricultural use, helping Turlock support its agricultural economic base and farmland
                                that creates a greenbelt.
                            Demographic Factors and Housing Types
                            An important component of designing future neighborhoods is planning for an appropriate pro-
                            portion of single family (very low, low and low-medium density) and multifamily (medium and
                            high density) units. Estimating the number and percentage of these various unit types is driven
                            by demographic trends and projections, by examining the average household sizes and age of
                            householders in different unit types.
                            Demographic analysis (using Census and California Department of Finance data) shows that by
                            2030, Turlock’s demographics will have shifted such that a greater percentage of the population
                            is over the age of 65, and the percentage of adults aged 45-64 will have fallen (Figure 3-3). These
                            changes in the city’s age profile have implications for the type of housing that should be provided
                            over the course of the General Plan buildout.
                            The data regarding housing type choices confirms what logic tells us. Young and small house-
                            holds often prefer multifamily units because of their affordability and their appropriateness for
                            their household size and stage in life. Families and middle aged couples often prefer single family

                            In order to match Turlock’s projected age demographics, just over half (54 percent) of the new
                            development over the planning period should be single family detached units, and the remainder
                            should be multifamily units. Adding this proportion of housing types would result in Turlock’s
                            entire housing stock reaching a split of 60 percent single family detached and 40 percent single
                            family attached and multifamily. Currently, it is at 70 percent single family and 30 percent
                            multifamily.
                            Average Residential Densities across Master Plan Areas
                            The Master Plan Areas are each assigned a Residential Neighborhood designation, which sets
                            the overall target residential density that the area must achieve. The housing mix for each master
                            plan area must, while incorporating a range of housing types, achieve a minimum average density
                            overall. Each neighborhood type also specifies a maximum average density. In each case, the
                            maximum average density allowed is 20 percent higher than the minimum. If the developer of a
                            master plan area wishes to build to a higher density than 20 percent above the minimum, then a
                            General Plan amendment and an analysis of environmental impacts would be required.
                            The target density is specified for each master plan area or sub-section of a master plan area, and
                            will be one of the following (Table 3-3):
                             •	 Low Density Neighborhood: Minimum average density of 5.0 units per gross acre; maximum
                                average density of 6.0 units per gross acre;
                             •	 Compact Mixed Use Neighborhood: Minimum average density of 8.0 units per gross acre;
                                maximum average density of 9.6 units per gross acre; and
                             •	 Very Compact Mixed Use Neighborhood: Minimum average density of 11.0 units per gross
                                acre; maximum average density of 13.2 units per gross acre.
                            In order to achieve the minimum average density, individual housing developments within the
                            master plan area may be above or below that density. In other words, each master plan will likely
                            include a full range of housing types, from single family detached to townhomes and multifam-
                            ily condominiums and apartments. The mix of these housing types over the entire master plan
                            area must achieve the target minimum density, on average.

Mixed Use Residential Neighborhoods also contain non-residential uses, generally consisting of
a neighborhood center with neighborhood-serving commercial uses, a park, and a school. The
neighborhood center should be walkable from the majority of households. Specific requirements
for the mix of residential uses, non-residential uses, and other features of each Residential Neigh-
borhood are found in Section 3.2.
Neighborhood Center Land Use Classification
The Neighborhood Center classification designates mixed use areas outside of Downtown—new
neighborhood centers designed as part of new master planned residential neighborhoods. Neigh-
borhood Centers are intended to serve as multi-use anchors for neighborhoods, emphasizing
pedestrian access and orientation. Sites designated NC are required to have ground-floor retail,
restaurants, or service uses facing the street, with offices and/or housing either above or behind.
Both vertical and horizontal mixed use developments are permitted. Buildings are required to
be oriented towards the street and may be up to four stories tall. Residential uses may be built at
densities ranging from 7.0 to 22.0 units per acre (gross), with an average of around 15.0. If the mix
of uses on the site includes residential and commercial/office uses, these non-residential uses in
this classification shall generally be built to an FAR of 1.0, and up to 1.5 if two stories, in addition
to the allowable residential density. Pedestrian linkages through the development to neighboring
housing or other uses are encouraged; further design specifications and development standards
are described in Chapter 6: City Design.

                                                     Policies Common to All Master Plan Areas
                                                     The General Plan Land Use Diagrams (Figure 2-2 and 2-3) delineate four master plan areas: three
                                                     in the southeast and one centrally located in the city (the Montana-West county island area).
                                                     Each master plan area will be planned and developed via an area plan (either a Master Plan or a
                                                     Specific Plan), in accordance with the phasing schedule described above, that conforms to the
                                                     requirements set forth in the City’s Prezoning and Annexation ordinance and this section of the
                                                     General Plan.
                                                     A number of planning and design features should be common to all of the new master plan
                                                     areas, which are described in the policies below. Additional requirements pertain to some master
                                                     plan areas individually, which are detailed in the subsequent section and depicted in Illustra-
                                                     tive Master Plan Diagrams for each area. These are intended to provide guidance for the master
                                                     planning process and to clearly state the City’s intentions for these areas. Where the size, location,

                                                     design and function, it is included. However, in general, details such as park size, wet utility

                                                     standards and policies set forth in other relevant sections of this document. Phasing of infra-
                                                     structure improvements will be established in the master plan documents.
                                                     Principal Master Plan Area Policies
                                                     Size and Boundaries
                                                     3.2-a	 Master plan size. A new master or specific plan should be approximately 200 to 400
                                                            acres in size, and occupy a logical area, contiguous to the city limits.
                                                            However, one master plan area shown on Figure 2-3 is larger—Southeast 3—because it
                                                            incorporates a large area of existing low density housing (rural “ranchettes”) and other
                                                            existing commercial and industrial development.
                                                     3.2-b	 Rights of way within planning boundary. Rights of way, utilities, and agricultural
                                                            buffers shall all be included within the master plan boundary.
3-18 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

3.2-c	 Urban/rural edge. Where master plan areas meet the edge of the study area boundary
       (outside of which land remains in agricultural use), deep landscaped setbacks and agri-
       cultural buffers shall be used to screen the edge of urban development. Acceptable
       buffer types and setback requirements are found in Section 6.1.
Land Uses, Intensities, and Mix
3.2-d	 Minimum average densities established for master plan areas. Each master plan,
       or portion of a master plan, must be built to achieve the minimum average residen-
       tial density specified on the Land Use Diagram and may go up to an overall average
       density that is 20 percent higher. (If the developer of a master plan area wishes to
       build to a higher density than 20 percent above the minimum, then a General Plan
       amendment and an analysis of environmental impacts would be required.)The
       minimum density calculation does not apply to land that is to be used for public parks,
       schools, or other non-residential uses.
3.2-e	 Mix of housing types and densities required. Each area will have a required mix of
       housing types, including traditional single family, small-lot single family, townhouse,
       and apartments/condos. The housing mix must achieve the minimum average density
       specified for each master plan. Regardless of the minimum average density, every
       master plan must include a minimum of 15 percent multi-family units.
3.2-f	 Neighborhood centers required. A “neighborhood center” location shall be zoned
       and required, and will include a park, school, local-serving retail and/or office uses,
       and some upper-level or adjacent multifamily residential development. The zoning
       ordinance shall also be updated to reflect and allow this type of mixed use designation.
       Appropriate non-residential land uses for neighborhood centers in residential areas
       include, but are not limited to, those in the following list. Drive-through establishments
       are strongly discouraged.
       •	 Grocery and other convenience retail sales
       •	 Personal services
       •	 Banks and financial institutions
       •	 Restaurants, coffee shops, and cafes
       •	 Upper level residential
       •	 Business and professional offices
       •	 Medical and dental offices

                                                    3.1-g	 Parks and trails provided in new neighborhoods. The master plan areas will include
                                                           park sites, a pedestrian/bicycle network of trails, and a multi-use agricultural buffer
                                                           along the edge (serving park, stormwater detention, trail, and buffer purposes). When
                                                           a school is present, a neighborhood park shall be located adjacent to it whenever
                                                           feasible. The minimum amount of gross land area in a master plan devoted to parks
                                                           and public facilities shall be 10 percent, and should generally be higher.

                                                           support the residential population. Schools shall be located along local, collector, or
                                                           arterial streets, but entrances may not be located on arterials.
                                                           Schools are to be provided according to the citywide size and distribution standards
                                                           listed in Section 4.3.
                                                           In most cases, these will be elementary schools; however, given expected popula-

                                                           For some master plan areas, existing schools near new development have sufficient
                                                           capacity to support the new population, and where that is the case, new schools will

Streets, Blocks, and Connectivity
3.2-j	 Consistency with General Plan circulation diagram. In order to ensure connectiv-
       ity to the existing city, through new neighborhoods, and to the freeway, collector and
       arterial streets in master plan areas must be designed, and sufficient right-of-way
       reserved, to comply with the citywide circulation plan described in Chapter 5. Minor
       deviations may be approved provided that they have no negative impact on the overall
       circulation network.
3.2-k	 Maximum block sizes. Encourage a fine-grained street pattern, vehicular and pedes-
       trian connectivity, and a human scale of development by requiring maximum block
       sizes, measured from street centerline to street centerline:
       •	 In low density residential areas, block length shall not exceed 660 feet.
       •	 In medium and high density residential areas, block length shall not exceed 500
          feet, with the ideal block length around 300-400 feet.
3.2-l	 Limit Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs, hammerheads, or similar dead-end streets shall not
       make up more than 10 percent of the total length of all streets in a master plan area.
       Pedestrian connections through the ends of cul-de-sacs to adjacent through streets
       are encouraged, especially where such pathways would facilitate connections to parks
       or schools.
3.2-m	 Local street connections between neighborhoods. Where a new residential subdivi-
       sion occurs adjacent to undeveloped land, which is planned to be developed as part
       of a master plan, stubs must be provided for future connections to the edge of the
       property line. Where street stubs exist on adjacent properties, new streets within a
       new subdivision shall connect to these stubs.
3.2-n	 Pedestrian and bicycle connections. Continuous and convenient pedestrian and
       bicycle connections shall be provided from every home in a master plan area to the
       nearest neighborhood center, school, and park. Pedestrian connections may be in the
       form of sidewalks, linear parks, or Class I multi-use trails. Bicycle connections may
       be in the form of Class I, Class II, or Class III bicycle facilities (refer to Section 5.3), and
       local streets.

                                                     Southeast Area 1 is also known as Morgan Ranch. As of 2012, Morgan Ranch is in the entitle-
                                                     ment process. Comprising approximately 170 acres, the roughly triangular area is bounded by
                                                     Highway 99 to the south, Golf Road to the east, and Glenwood Avenue to the north. Morgan
                                                     Ranch will be developed as a compact mixed use residential neighborhood, exhibiting somewhat
                                                     higher overall densities than the city as a whole. Primary access to the neighborhood would be via
                                                     Golf Road, Glenwood Avenue, and new east-west arterials and collectors.

                                                      Overview
                                                      Southeast Area 2 consists primarily of the two quarter sections (320 acres) located north of
                                                      East Avenue, south of Hawkeye Avenue, and east of Daubenberger Road. For the purposes of
                                                      efficient infrastructure provision, the master plan area also includes another 24 acres of unincor-

to be developed as a new residential neighborhood, showcasing many aspects of neighborhood
planning that this General Plan emphasizes:
 •	 Compact residential development;
 •	 A complete linear park system linking several neighborhood parks; and
 •	 A mixed use neighborhood center with a school, park, higher density housing, and offices.
On the General Plan Land Use Diagram, the large contiguous section of SE2 (east of Dauben-
berger) is designated as a Compact Residential Neighborhood, with a minimum gross density of
8.0 dwelling units per acre and a maximum density of 9.6 dwelling units per acre. The smaller
area west of Quincy Road is designated as a Very Compact Residential Neighborhood, with a
minimum gross density of 11.0 units per acre and a maximum density of 13.2 dwelling units per
acre.
The majority of development in SE2 will be housing, with the balance consisting of parks (linear        Residential development will be separated from the

elementary school. While most neighborhood centers in master plan areas might have a predom-
inance of retail uses, the center in SE 2 shall have more of an office focus so as not to compete
with the neighborhood-serving retail located at the nearby Village Corner center.
Figure 3-4 shows an illustrative diagram of how the master plan area may be developed in accor-
dance with these standards, including a potential distribution of land uses consistent with the
land use designations described in Chapter 2. The following master plan development guidelines
apply.
Master Plan Guidelines
 •	 Concentrations of medium and high density residential development are in the smaller, western
    portion of the master plan area, west of Quincy Road. Medium and high density housing shall
    also be located adjacent to the neighborhood center, school, and park, on both sides of Canal
    Drive. This concentrates the highest density of homes closest to Downtown.

•	 Connected linear park systems run north-south through the center of the larger master plan area
   and along the eastern border of the study area. The Class I multi-use trail also continues along
   the Canal Road extension (however, the canal itself may be put underground). If the canal is not
   put underground, the north-south linear park shall include a crossing over the canal to ensure
   connectivity of the park and trail system. Neighborhood parks are distributed throughout the
   area, walkable from the majority of households; one is adjacent to a new elementary school. The
   dimensions and sizes of the linear and neighborhood parks shall meet the standards set forth in
   Chapter 4: Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities.
•	 The only roadways permitted to cross the linear park system are Canal Drive, Hawkeye Avenue,
   and East Avenue. Pedestrian and bicycle crossings are permitted at any point, and a pedestrian/
   bicycle crossing must be provided over the canal where it intersects the north-south linear park.
•	 The new neighborhood center is located in the central area of the master plan on Canal Drive,
   and consists of a park, school, and local-serving office and personal service uses It is close to other
   stores and Turlock High School. The shopping center is approximately three to five acres.
•	 A range of low-medium density housing types, with an average density of around 7.5 units per
   acre, occupies the majority of the master plan area east of Daubenberger Road. Low density
   housing (average density around 5 units per acre) may be located in the northeast and southeast
   corners of the master plan area.
•	 The small sub-area of Southeast 2, roughly bounded by Marshall Street, North Quincy Road,
   East Avenue, and North Johnson Road, and including several additional parcels west of Johnson,
   shall have a mix of medium and high density residential development, with a neighborhood park
   occupying the southwest corner of Marshall and Quincy. The size of the park shall be developed
   in accordance with the standards in Chapter 4.
Circulation Access and Major Improvements
•	 Class I bicycle access shall be provided through the linear park that runs north/south through
   the center of the master plan area, through greenbelt buffer along the east side, along Canal
   Drive, and between the linear park and the greenbelt buffer near the southernmost neighbor-
   hood park (see Figure 5-3).

                                                      between 70 and 80 acres.
                                                      Development of this master plan area will lead to an improved railroad at-grade crossing at the
                                                      historically problematic Golf Road/Berkeley Avenue intersection as well as a new railroad over-

                                                           •	 Low-medium, medium, and high density housing shall be located along East Avenue and along
                                                              the northern side of the mixed use neighborhood center.
                                                           •	 Housing density shall gradually decrease as it moves south toward Brier Road.
                                                           •	 Low density residential is located primarily south of Brier Road and west of Daubenberger Road.
                                                           •	 A neighborhood center, consisting of neighborhood-serving retail and housing, is located north
                                                              of Brier Road, just east of Daubenberger Road. The neighborhood center, including retail,
                                                              housing, and other uses, shall be approximately 40 acres.
                                                           •	 An elementary and middle school shall be located immediately east or west of the neighborhood
                                                              center, near the community park.
                                                           •	 A new high school is to be located in the southeast corner of the master plan area, adjacent to
                                                              and east of the new community park and north of Linwood Avenue. It is to be separated from
                                                              the new east side expressway by a greenway buffer, which may be used by the school for joint
                                                              open space use purposes. Automobile access directly from the expressway to the high school
                                                              shall not be permitted.

 •	 A community park is included, at a minimum size of 30 acres (not including storm drainage
    area). It is the southern terminus of the north/south linear park system that runs through SE 2
    and 3. It may include a lake (that also serves as storm drainage) on up to an additional 12.5 acres.
 •	 A linear park and multiuse trail system runs north from the community park and east-west, con-
    necting the schools and park in the east to higher density housing to the west. The linear park
    must be continuous and connected both east-west and north-south. Brier Road and East Avenue
    may cross the linear park. Industrial land uses are located on both sides of South Golden State
    Boulevard, north of Linwood Avenue.
Circulation Access and Major Improvements
 •	 Class I bicycle access shall be provided along all linear parks and greenbelt buffers, along the
    perimeter of the new community park, along the north side of the new middle/high school
    campus, and south from the community park to Linwood Avenue.
 •	 At minimum, Class II bicycle access shall be provided along Daubenberger Road, Linwood
    Avenue, Verduga Road/new East Side arterial, Johnson Road, East Avenue, and Berkeley
    Avenue.
 •	 The roadway network necessary to support development in the master plan area is shown in
    figures 3-5 and 5-2. Major roadway improvements include, but are not limited to, the Linwood
    overcrossing and improvements of various county roads to City collector standard.
Master Plan Area: Montana-West (County Island)
Overview
“Montana-West” is an area encompassing three of Turlock’s seven unincorporated County
Islands, including the largest one, comprising approximately 50 acres. It is roughly bounded by
Montana Avenue to the south, State Route 99 and Soderquist Road to the west, South Avenue
to the north, and Orange Street to the east. Low density residential development is the predomi-
nant land use, with a significant number of vacant and/or underutilized parcels.
                                                                                                     NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-31

                            The lot sizes, development density, and parcelization pattern create a significant opportunity for
                            introduction of new streets and parcel subdivisions on a lot-by-lot basis. The street plan concept
                            would provide an attractive neighborhood street network, adding value and allowing owners
                            to subdivide. The new streets would allow the area to avoid an overabundance of “flag lots” and
                            overuse of existing, substandard streets, while creating a new neighborhood feel. Subdivision of
                            large lots would create opportunities for a denser, more connected neighborhood while retaining
                            the area’s single family character. Improvements to the street and infrastructure system would
                            be financed by the subdivision process. Overall, over 180 new single family lots could be created.
                            Master Planning and Timing of Development
                            Incorporation and improvement of all County Islands is a high priority for the City of Turlock.
                            From a phasing perspective, these areas are treated as “infill” and therefore may fully develop
                            at any time. Pursuant to Policy 3.1-m, a strategic plan for the annexation and improvements of
                            the County Islands will be prepared, with the Montana-West area as a high priority for devel-
                            opment. The plan will include a financial strategy for bringing infrastructure in the area up to
                            City standards. In order to arrive at an appropriate fee per unit, overall density in the master
                            plan area would likely have to be increased from its current state. The strategic plan will evaluate
                            whether this could be accomplished via the illustrative lotting plan presented in the General Plan
                            appendix, which would retain the predominantly single family nature of the area, or whether
                            residential density would be further increased to accommodate medium and or high density
                            development on certain larger parcels.
                            The master planning, annexation, and further development of this area may proceed at any time
                            during General Plan buildout and is not subject to the master plan phasing policy. Figure 3-6
                            illustrates land uses for Montana-West, which reflect the existing single family nature of the
                            area and show where higher density development could be accommodated. A conceptual street
                            network and lotting plan for the Montana-West area is included as Appendix A; this is intended
                            to inform the preparation of a more detailed master plan in the future.
                            Circulation Access and Major Improvements
                             •	 The master plan area is already served by marked Class III bicycle access along Orange Avenue.
                                At minimum, new Class II bicycle access shall be provided along Soderquist Road, West Avenue
                                South, South Avenue, Linwood Avenue, and Orange Avenue between .

                                 master plan area. However, some improvements beyond those listed in the other master plan
                                 area descriptions will be needed to support buildout of infill areas citywide, and overall growth
                                 as the master plans develop. These include improvements to the Fulkerth Road interchange and

                            3.3	 Infrastructure
                            This section discusses the planning, provision, and maintenance of City infrastructure
                            including: potable water, sanitary sewers, wastewater treatment, storm drainage, and solid waste.
                            As required by State law, this section also addresses water conservation, water recycling, and
                            solid waste recycling. The goal of planning for public infrastructure is to ensure the provision of
                            adequate facilities to serve new development under the General Plan while maintaining service
                            standards for existing development.
                            Water and wastewater utilities require substantial financial investment for both construction
                            and maintenance; therefore, the provision of such infrastructure is a major factor in the amount,
                            type, and location of growth that the community can anticipate. Consistent with the General
                            Plan land uses, infrastructure must be sized and planned according to reasonable anticipated
                            growth rates.
                            It is important that the City’s water, wastewater, and stormwater systems be viewed and planned
                            as interrelated systems. For example, potable water used in homes and businesses becomes waste-
                            water that must be conveyed by the sanitary sewer system and treated at the Turlock Regional
                            Water Quality Control Facility. Some of the highly treated effluent is used for landscape irriga-
                            tion and for cooling a power plant, which reduces the water demands placed upon the aquifer.
                            Also, stormwater recharges the groundwater, which is then used for potable water supply.
                            Water SUPPLies, DEMANDs, and Distribution
                            The City’s water supplies, demands, and distribution system are discussed below. Turlock’s
                            existing potable water infrastructure is shown on Figure 3-7.

Water Supplies
The City of Turlock has several existing water supplies, including:
 •	 Groundwater for potable water uses;
 •	 Groundwater for nonpotable uses;
 •	 Recycled water for nonpotable uses; and
 •	 Stormwater runoff for landscape irrigation.
Additionally, as a member of the Stanislaus Regional Water Authority (SRWA), the City is
actively developing a future surface water supply from the Turlock Irrigation District (TID) for
potable water uses.
Groundwater Supplies
The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) delineates groundwater basins through-
out California through its publication “California’s Groundwater Bulletin 118.” The City of
Turlock is located in the Turlock Subbasin of the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin.
The Turlock Subbasin lies on the eastern side of California’s San Joaquin Valley, and encom-
passes portions of both Stanislaus and Merced counties. The groundwater system is bounded
by the Tuolumne River on the north, the Merced River on the south, and the San Joaquin River
on the west. The eastern boundary of the system is the western extent of the outcrop of crystal-
line basement rock in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Land uses in the Turlock Subbasin are
diverse and include agriculture, urban, and commercial or industrial uses distributed in a mosaic
throughout the region.
The Turlock Subbasin underlies an area of approximately 347,000 acres, with irrigated crops
(245,000 acres), native vegetation (69,000 acres), and urban development (20,000 acres) as the
predominant land uses. The general trend in land use throughout the Subbasin has been an
increase in urbanization from less than 4,000 acres in 1952 to approximately 20,000 acres in
2006. The majority of this urbanization has occurred within the cities and unincorporated urban
areas within the Turlock Irrigation District boundary.
                                                                                             NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-35

                            There are three interconnected bodies of groundwater in the Turlock Subbasin—the uncon-
                            fined/semi-confined aquifer, which is fresh water in the alluvium above the E-clay,1 the confined
                            aquifer contained in the alluvium beneath the E-clay, and saline groundwater in the older marine
                            sediments and rocks beneath the fresh water.
                            Groundwater levels fluctuate with seasonal rainfall, withdrawal and recharge. Rainfall in the
                            Turlock Subbasin Area averages about 12 inches per year, much less than the annual groundwa-
                            ter extraction and evapotranspiration. Inflows to the Turlock Subbasin result primarily from the
                            deep percolation of agricultural and landscape irrigation water and the infiltration of precipita-
                            tion. According to the Turlock Groundwater Management Plan (2007), the estimated average
                            total inflow for 1997-2006 was 519,000 acre-feet per year. Approximately 72 percent of this inflow
                            occurs on 245,000 irrigated acres of cropland within the Subbasin. The use of groundwater by the
                            City and for adjacent agricultural purposes has resulted in periods of lowered groundwater levels
                            near Turlock. Since the mid-1990s, the groundwater levels near the City have fallen by about 15
                            feet.
                            Most of the groundwater recharge comes from surface application of water in the form of agricul-
                            tural irrigation. Landscape irrigation, precipitation and septic tank seepage account for a smaller
                            share of the recharge.
                            Groundwater levels have been declining since the mid-1990s. In 2008, the Turlock Groundwa-
                            ter Basin Association published “Assessment of Future Groundwater Impacts Due to Assumed
                            Water-Use Changes Turlock Groundwater Basin.” The Assessment was essentially a “water
                            budget study” that analyzed past trends in land use and groundwater use and extrapolated those
                            trends into the future to assess the impact of land use changes on groundwater supplies. The
                            groundwater contour maps used in the water budget study indicated that estimated volume
                            of groundwater in storage decreased by approximately 21,500 acre-feet per year between 1997
                            and 2006. Unfortunately, recent reductions in the California Department of Water Resources
                            (DWR) monitoring network have introduced uncertainty in the measurement of groundwa-
                            ter levels, which translates into uncertainty in storage estimates. Therefore, the magnitude and
                            direction of changes in groundwater storage cannot be fully characterized through an analysis
                            based solely on the groundwater contours.

The estimated reduction in storage between 2002 and 2006 suggests that the Subbasin may
no longer be in the equilibrium state that existed in the 1990s. Most likely, increased urbaniza-
tion within the western part of the Turlock Subbasin and expanded agricultural irrigation with
groundwater within the eastern part have resulted in this slight long-term downward trend in
groundwater levels. Although water use within the basin has been increasing, hydrodynamic
adjustments within the basin have been nearly keeping up with the changing water use. The
principal hydrodynamic adjustment has been an increase in the recharge of the groundwater
from the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers. Correspondingly, groundwater levels have not shown
any significant temporal trend.
Due to the regional nature of the groundwater aquifer system, actions within the City area alone
are not sufficient to curtail the decline in groundwater levels. Since the mid-1990s, groundwater
levels near the City have fallen by about 15 feet, due primarily to increased agricultural acreage                               Turlock’s potable water supply comes entirely from
and increased urbanization.                                                                                                      groundwater. One of the city’s newest wells was con-
                                                                                                                                 structed in 2007 near the northeast greenbelt.
All of the City’s current potable water supply comes from groundwater. In 2010, the City had 23
potable water wells that provide a maximum water supply of about 50 mgd2. A new well (Well
No. 40) went on line in early 2011. These wells draw water from a deep aquifer, and have casing
depths ranging from about 200 to 580 feet. These wells have capacities of 650 to 2,800 gallons per
minute (gpm). The City also has two storage tanks, each with a storage capacity of one million
gallons.
The City used about 21,800 acre-feet of groundwater in 2010, and the expected use in 2011 is
20,600 acre-feet. In recent years the City’s use of potable groundwater has decreased due to
a greater use of nonpotable water for landscape irrigation, potable water conservation efforts,
installation of water meters, and the initiation of water meter based billing. However, as the City
grows in the future, this recent downward trend in water use will be reversed and the City will
begin to use more water.
The City also uses shallow groundwater for irrigation of some landscape areas such as the
Northeast Greenbelt. The quality of this shallow groundwater is not suitable as a source of
potable water, but is adequate for landscape watering. Also, dry weather run-off is collected in

                                                      water supplies to specific uses based on the water quality of the supply is a very innovative and
                                                      creative approach that is not yet widely used by other cities.

                                                      Protecting water quality is as important to maintaining the local groundwater supply as sustain-
                                                      ing groundwater recharge. As water travels through the ground or over the surface of the land, it
                                                      dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases radioactive material, and it can pick up
                                                      contaminants from animals or from human activity. In the Planning Area, contaminants that
                                                      may be present in groundwater include: salinity, nitrates, iron, manganese, boron, arsenic, radio-
                                                      nuclides, bacteria, pesticides, and trichloroethylene.
                                                      Nitrate is the most commonly occurring contaminant in the area. It has been introduced into

                                                      drinking water standards, except that one of the wells slightly exceeds the arsenic limit and one
                                                      well exceeds the drinking water standard for nitrate; both wells are no longer online. The City is

                                                      Recycled Water
                                                      In the summer of 2006, the Turlock Regional Water Quality Control Facility (TRWQCF) was
                                                      upgraded to provide disinfected, tertiary effluent. This highly treated water complies with the
                                                      State of California water recycling criteria (Title 22) for unrestricted reuse. However, even with
                                                      this high level of treatment, the effluent cannot be used for human consumption. The average
                                                      dry weather flow to the TRWQCF is about 12 million gallons per day (mgd). The TRWQCF
3-38 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

also treats 1 mgd of partially treated flow from the City of Ceres. Up to 2 mgd of tertiary effluent
is available for cooling water at the Walnut Energy Center Power Plant. The City Council has a
goal of increasing the use of recycled water, and the City has constructed the infrastructure to
allow for the irrigation of the Pedretti Sports Complex with recycled water.
Surface Water Project
As a member of the SRWA, the City of Turlock is pursuing the development of a Regional
Surface Water Supply Project (RSWSP) that would supply treated Tuolumne River water from
the Turlock Irrigation District (TID). The RSWSP has formally created a Joint Powers Authority
(JPA), the SRWA, consisting of the cities of Turlock, Modesto, and Ceres. The SRWA will pursue
funding for various phases of the project. The SRWA is developing an agreement with TID
for the provision of the drinking water. Extensive planning and environmental work has been
performed for the RWSWP, and TID completed an EIR on the project in 2006. A supplemen-
tal EIR is now being prepared to update some aspects of the environmental assessment that may
have changed in the intervening years.
By being a member of the JPA, Turlock continues to be committed to the project. The RSWSP
would initially provide up to 16,800 acre-feet per year (15 million gallons per day, mgd) of potable
water to the City of Turlock, but could ultimately provide up to 22,400 acre-feet per year (20
mgd). The RSWSP facilities would include a surface water treatment plant and water transmis-
sion mains. The total cost of the RSWSP is estimated to be in the range of $180 million to $200
million. The City of Turlock’s share of this cost is estimated to be about $65 million. The City
would also have to construct a water storage reservoir (an enclosed water tank), a booster pump
station and water distribution pipelines at a cost of about $20 million. This potential surface
water supply would provide over half of the City’s future water needs.
Water Conservation
Prompted by the prolonged drought of 1987 to 1992 and previous water shortages, the City passed
a Water Conservation and Education Ordinance in March 1991. The ordinance aims to accom-
plish conservation through restricting the times of outdoor residential water use. This program
was quite successful in the latter stages of the drought. However, residential per capita water
usage increased dramatically after the end of the drought in the mid-1990s.
                                                                                                 NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-39

                            Similarly, in 2007-09, the State of California experienced drought conditions. In response to the
                            drought and due to the pending implementation of meter-based water billing, per capita water
                            use declined significantly in the years 2008-10.
                            In more recent years, the City also conserves potable water from the deep aquifer by using
                            recycled water for landscape irrigation and for power plant cooling. The City also uses shallow
                            groundwater (non-potable water) and stormwater runoff for landscape irrigation, which further
                            conserves potable water.
                            Senate Bill X7-7 (SB 7) was enacted in November 2009 as part of the Urban Water Management
                            Planning Act. SB 7 requires water suppliers to increase water conservation efforts. The legislation
                            sets an overall goal of reducing urban per capita demand by 20 percent by the year 2020.
                            The Water Conservation in Landscaping Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill1881) requires cities and
                            counties to adopt landscape water conservation ordinances by January 1 2010. In accordance
                            with this law, the State Department of Water Resources prepared the Model Water Efficient
                            Landscape Ordinance. If a local agency (like the City of Turlock) had not adopted its own
                            ordinance by January 1, 2010, the State’s Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance became
                            effective within the jurisdiction of the Agency on January 1, 2010. The State’s Model Water
                            Efficient Landscape Ordinance is in effect in the City of Turlock.
                            Distribution
                            The City’s water is distributed through over 250 miles of water pipelines ranging in size from 6 to
                            16 inches in diameter. The City currently has plans for expansion of the distribution system for
                            the growth of the City both with and without the RSWSP. Figure 3-7 shows the City’s existing
                            potable water infrastructure. Figure 3-8 shows the proposed water infrastructure needed to
                            support buildout of the General Plan and the backbone infrastructure needed for the RSWSP.
                            The major potable water infrastructure needed includes the water supply from the RSWSP, a
                            water storage reservoir, a booster pump station, transmission mains, connections to the existing
                            water distribution system, one new well in the northwest master plan area, and two new wells in
                            the southeast master plan areas.

3-42 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN
Conclusion – Supply and Demand
In the past, the City has pumped as much groundwater as needed by its residents and businesses;
consequently the City’s available supply has matched its demands. As noted above, the ground-
water levels have fallen about 15 feet in the last 10 to 15 years. The decline in groundwater levels
has raised concerns about the sustainability of the groundwater resource to meet future water
demands. City Staff have estimated that the groundwater basin can sustain an annual water
demand of about 24,550 acre-feet per year. At this usage, in drought years, however, pumping
this amount of groundwater will cause groundwater levels under the City to decline.
In 2010, the City’s wells produced about 21,770 acre-feet of water. The estimated water demand
for 2011 is 20,600 acre-feet per year. As the City grows toward buildout of this General Plan, the
water production will have to increase to supply the needs of the new residents and businesses.
The expected increase in annual water demands are shown on Figure 3-9, and includes demands
from three primary areas:
 •	 New growth in master plan areas: 5,100 acre-feet per year
 •	 Infill of the existing city (including development by 2030 of about 24 percent of the currently
    undeveloped TRIP): 4,500 acre-feet per year
The City wide water demand in the year 2030 shown on Figure 3-14 is lower than the year 2030
water demand from the City’s Draft 2010 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) because the
Draft UWMP was prepared using a land use plan that had a larger area of future growth than
the land use plan that was adopted in this General Plan. Similarly, the year 2030 population used
in the Draft UWMP was 115,363, whereas the 2030 population for this General Plan is 104,500.
These increases in water demands will lead to a total water demand in the year 2030 of approx-
imately 30,200 acre-feet per year. This demand exceeds the estimated sustainable groundwater
supply of 24,550 acre-feet per year. If the water demands increase at about 1.0 percent per year
(as shown in Figure 3-9), then the sustainable groundwater supply will be exceeded in the year
2020.

With the RSWSP, the City could still use groundwater, but at a sustainable amount. With the
RSWSP providing a long term supply of 17,000 to 22,000 acre-feet per year (15 to 20 mgd), the
City would have a total sustainable water supply of 41,550 to 46,500 acre-feet per year. This water
supply would meet and exceed the demands estimated for the year 2030 of 30,200 acre-feet per
year. When the TRIP is fully developed, the citywide buildout water demand is estimated to be
34,500 acre-feet per year, which could safely be supplied by the combined use of groundwater and
surface water.
Wastewater collection and treatment System
The wastewater collection system generally flows from the northeast to the southwest to the
Turlock Regional Water Quality Control Facility (RWQCF), where the wastewater is treated
and then discharged to the Harding Drain. The existing sanitary sewer system is shown on
Figure 3-10. In the future, it is planned that treated effluent will be pumped farther west and dis-
charged directly to the San Joaquin River. The sanitary sewer system consists of about 220 miles
of sewer pipes ranging in diameter from six inches to 48 inches, and 20 pump stations.                Tertiary Filters at the RWQCF help treat the water to a
                                                                                                      very high level, allowing it to be used in the community
The proposed sewer system to serve the southeast master plan areas is shown on Figure 3-11. The       for landscape irrigation, for agricultural irrigation, for

from Denair out of this sewer and into a new trunk sewer. The proposed sewer system collects all
of the flow from the southeast master plan areas, and no existing sewers are needed to serve the
southeast master plan areas.
The current average dry weather flow to the RWQCF is about 12 mgd. This includes flow from
Turlock, Keyes and Denair. The RWQCF also treats 1 mgd of partially treated wastewater from
Ceres, and the flow from Ceres is expected to increase to 2 mgd in the future. With the con-
struction of improvements planned in the Water Quality Control Facilities Improvement, Turlock
Capacity Assessment (March 2007 hereafter called the Capacity Assessment), the RWQCF could
treat a flow of about 20 mgd. Thus, the proposed improvements would provide capacity for about
a 50 percent increase in the flow to the plant. The past and previously projected future flows to
the RWQCF are shown with the green lines on Figure 3-12 (including the flow from Ceres). The
previous projection of flow in the Capacity Assessment resulted in an ADWF of 23.0 mgd in the
year 2030 (the light green line on Figure 3-12).

                            Based on the land uses included in this General Plan update, the expected increase in annual
                            wastewater flows are shown on Figure 3-12, and includes flows from three primary areas:
                             •	 New growth areas in the Southeast: 2.30 mgd
                             •	 Infill of the existing city (including development by 2030 of about 24 percent of the currently
                                 undeveloped TRIP Area): 2.32 mgd
                            These increases in wastewater flows total 4.62 mgd and lead to a total ADWF wastewater flow in
                            the year 2030 of 21.6 mgd. When the TRIP is fully developed, the citywide buildout ADWF is
                            estimated to be 24.3 mgd.
                            The estimated ADWF for the new General Plan land uses account for the projected increased
                            population of the City and the anticipated increase in the ratio of jobs to population. The previous
                            wastewater flow projection in the Capacity Assessment was based only on increased population,
                            and did not account for the various land use types in this General Plan.
                            The existing treatment plant with currently planned improvements will provide an ADWF
                            capacity of 20 mgd and will only occupy about 60 acres of the 140 acre wastewater treatment
                            plant site. Consequently, there is adequate room to expand the plant to provide the required year
                            2030 ADWF flow of 21.6 mgd and the ultimate buildout capacity of 24.3 mgd.
                            This preliminary projection of wastewater flow should be verified through preparation of master
                            plans for the sanitary sewer system and the wastewater treatment plant.
                            In early 2006, an upgrade to the RWQCF was completed that included the installation of tertiary
                            filters to produce highly treated wastewater, termed disinfected tertiary effluent. The tertiary
                            effluent from the RWQCF meets the legal requirements for unrestricted reuse. However, even
                            with this high level of treatment, the effluent cannot be used for human consumption. When this
                            highly treated water is put to use, it is called recycled water. Currently, up to two mgd of recycled
                            water is used for cooling water at the Walnut Energy Center Power Plant, a 250 Megawatt power
                            plant owned and operated by the Turlock Irrigation District. The City Council has a goal of
                            increasing the use of recycled water, and the City intends to irrigate the Pedretti Sports Complex
                            with recycled water in the future. Additionally, recycled water pipelines (purple pipe) have been

The City currently protects surface water quality by requiring the implementation of Best Man-
agement Practices (BMPs) during the construction of new development projects and requires
projects to comply with post-construction BMPs, as identified in the City’s NPDES Phase 2
Storm Water Management Plan. Surface water quality is also protected by complying with the
current State of California Construction General Permit Order 2009-0009-DWQ.
The City’s existing storm drain system is shown on Figure 3-13. The City’s existing storm water
system includes about 130 miles of storm drain collection/conveyance piping, with sizes ranging
from 6 to 60-inches in diameter; 49 pump stations, several detention basins, and use of the TID
open channels.
Currently, most of Turlock’s stormwater drains to detention basins located throughout the City.

southwest corner of the City to a large stormwater basin near the TRWQCF, where it is either
pumped into TID Lateral 4 or the Harding Drain. To avoid overloading the trunk storm drains,
it is necessary to drain several of the detention basins in the north part of town sequentially,
starting with the more downstream basins and progressing to the more upstream basins. This
approach of using detention basins with sequential draining of the basins can continue to be used
to provide stormwater storage and disposal as the City grows to buildout of the 2030 General
Plan. The required future detention basins and trunk lines needed to drain the basins have been
preliminarily located and sized and are shown on Figure 3-14.
Part of the eastern area of the City flows directly to Lateral 4 without first being stored in
detention basins. Use of the TID laterals for stormwater disposal is allowed through agreements
with TID. However, this does not always provide reliable disposal of the stormwater because
sometimes the TID laterals are also being used to convey irrigation water or the laterals are out
of service for maintenance by TID staff. To eliminate this problem, the runoff from this area
should be diverted into a more reliable stormwater disposal system, and the future trunk lines
shown on Figure 3-14 are sized to also convey the runoff from some of the area that currently
flows to Lateral 4.

                                                      Many of the City’s detention basins are used for both stormwater detention and as recreational
                                                      open space. This joint use of stormwater basins provides numerous sports and recreational facili-
                                                      ties for City residents.
                                                      The existing stormwater system has generally protected the City from flooding. However, minor
                                                      street flooding occurs in certain areas of the City approximately once per year or every couple of
                                                      years. This flooding typically occurs when two large storms occur back to back, and the City’s
                                                      basins have not fully drained from the first storm when the second storm hits. This type of minor
                                                      street flooding for short time durations in large storm events does not warrant the construction
                                                      of a major storm drain project to eliminate the flooding. Indeed, due to Turlock’s flat topogra-
                                                      phy, the streets are designed to store storm water temporarily until capacity becomes available in
                                                      the storm drain system.
                                                      Solid Waste Management and Recycling
Detention basins are distributed throughout the City, Solid Waste
capturing runoff during stormwater events. Some of
these detention basins also serve as City parks.      The City contracts with a franchise hauler to collect garbage and recyclables at curbside. Garbage
                                                      is taken to the transfer station on Walnut Road, and from there hauled to the Fink Road landfill
                                                      near Crows Landing, or to the waste-to-energy facility adjacent to the landfill. The waste-to-
                                                      energy facility reduces the volume of waste going into the landfill by about 90 percent. According
                                                      to the, Stanislaus County Department of Public Works, the landfill — the only one operating in
                                                      Stanislaus County — has capacity until 2017 for garbage and 2023 for the waste-to-energy ash.
                                                      The total landfill capacity is 6.8 million tons. The County has plans for further expansion.
                                                      In accordance with Public Resources Code Section 41000 et seq., a goal of 50 percent waste
                                                      stream diversion through reduction and recycling has been established. In May 1992, the City’s
                                                      franchise waste hauler implemented a dramatic new program to reduce Turlock’s waste stream.
                                                      Instead of voluntary separation by the resident, the program provides three separate bins to each
                                                      home throughout the City. The largest of these is a 90-gallon container reserved exclusively for
                                                      compostable green waste. Next is a 65-gallon container for all recyclable materials, which are
                                                      separated by the refuse company after pick-up. Finally, each household is limited to one 32-gallon
                                                      container for non-recyclable household wastes.

Source Reduction and Recycling
Public Resources Code Sections 41000 and 41300 et seq. require each city and county in the State
to prepare a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) to meet waste diversion reduction
goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000.
Turlock’s SRRE was adopted by the City Council in 1994. The SRRE was later reviewed and
approved by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) in 1995. The SRRE
includes source reduction, including recycling and composting activities for solid waste generated
within the City.
The study also details means of reducing commercial and industrial sources of solid waste.
Funding and public information components are also included.
Waste diversion in Turlock has been steadily improving. The amount of waste diverted in the
City of Turlock was 40 percent in 1997 and 47 percent in 2000. In 2001, the Regional Solid Waste
Planning Agency (RSWPA) was formed including Stanislaus County and the eight cities within
the county. The RSWPA’s current target is 6.3 pounds of non-diverted waste per person per day
(50 percent diversion equivalent). In 2009, the Agency’s jurisdiction achieved 3.3 pounds of non-
diverted waste per person per day, or a 72 percent diversion equivalent.
Policies
Guiding Policies
3.3-a	 Protect Water Quality and Supply. Continue efforts to safeguard the quality and avail-
       ability of Turlock’s water supply.
3.3-b	 Use Groundwater at a Sustainable Rate. Undertake steps to ensure the use of ground-
       water does not exceed the sustainable supply by verifying the estimated sustainable
       supply of 24,550 acre-feet per year and limiting groundwater use to the sustainable
       supply.
       Aquifer depletion is a valley-wide problem. Use of groundwater for potable water and
       agricultural irrigation is the prime reason for the declining groundwater levels. The City
       has little control over the use of groundwater for agricultural irrigation. Recent drought
       years have also been a contributing factor.
                                                                                               NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-55

                            3.3-c	 Sustainable water supply. Ensure that a new system for potable water provision,
                                   either through implementation of the Regional Surface Water Supply Project or
                                   other means, is in place by the time that Turlock’s projected annual potable water
                                   demand exceeds the sustainable annual groundwater supply level of 24,550 acre-feet,
                                   estimated to occur in 2020.
                            3.3-d	 Meet projected needs. Promote the orderly and efficient expansion of public utilities
                                   and the storm drainage system to adequately meet projected needs, comply with
                                   current and future regulations, and maintain public health, safety, and welfare.
                            3.3-e	 Coordinate infrastructure provision with growth. Coordinate capital improvements
                                   planning, design, and construction for all municipal service infrastructure with the
                                   direction, extent, and timing of growth.
                            3.3-f	 Utility Rates. Continue to establish water and wastewater rates that are sufficient to
                                   operate, maintain, and upgrade (for current and future regulatory requirements) the
                                   City’s water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure.
                            3.3-g	 Development Impact Fees. Continue to equitably distribute costs associated with
                                   serving new development through the Development Impact Fee program.
                            3.3-h	 Meet State waste reduction goals. Reduce the generation of solid and hazardous
                                   waste and promote recycling in order to achieve the State’s solid waste management
                                   goals

                            3.3-i	 Water System Master Plan. As needed, update the City’s water master plan to
                                   estimate future water demands, identify an adequate supply of water to meet future
                                   demands, and identify how best to treat the water supply.
                            3.3-j	 Pursue Surface Water and Other Alternative Water Supply Sources. Continue to
                                   pursue the use of treated surface water as a long term supply for municipal use, and
                                   evaluate other future water supply alternatives, including verifying the future water
                                   demands and evaluating the water supply strategies and funding strategies discussed
                                   above. (See conclusions in the section: Conclusions - Supply and Demand, under
                                   Water Demands, Supplies, and Distribution.) The SWP or some other methods should
                                   supply about 17,000 to 22,000 acre-feet per year of the City’s estimated 2030 water
3-56 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

       demand of 30,200 acre-feet per year, and the ultimate General Plan buildout demand
       of 34,500 acre-feet per year. Surface water supplies (or other sources) will probably be
       needed by about the year 2020. Develop a new water supply project prior to construc-
       tion of new development that generates a City-wide water demand above 24,550 acre
       feet per year from City wells, estimated to be the sustainable yield from the aquifer.
3.3-k	 Rate and Fee Studies. Supplement the water system master plan with rate and fee
       studies to ensure adequate funds are collected through the City’s water rates and
       development impact fees. Implement rate and fee increases as needed.
3.3-l	 Infrastructure Construction. Design and construct water system infrastructure as
       needed to meet current and future water demands and system requirements.
3.3-m	 Conservation. Continue to implement the comprehensive water conservation
       program for both new development and existing residences and businesses. Revise
       and improve the program as needed. Continue water conservation efforts, including
       the watering schedule, monitoring by Municipal Services staff, and advisory notices to
       households and businesses in violation of water conservation standards. Continue to
       reduce per capita consumption through ongoing education and outreach efforts.
3.3-n	 Recycled Water. Continue and expand the use of recycled water from the Turlock
       Regional Water Quality Control Facility for non-potable purposes, including power
       plant cooling, landscape irrigation, agricultural irrigation, and other uses. Plan, design,
       and construct infrastructure needed to increase the use of recycled water.
3.3-o	 Optimize Groundwater Recharge. Establish requirements for appropriate BMPs in
       site planning of new development, so that natural drainage systems or groundwater
       recharge features are incorporated into developments. Participate in regional efforts
       to protect groundwater supplies and optimize groundwater recharge on a basin-wide
       basis.
3.3-p	 Groundwater Related Coordination. Support and cooperate with Regional (Turlock
       Groundwater Basin Management Association), County and State programs to protect
       valuable groundwater resources and facilitate groundwater recharge.
3.3-q	 Reuse of Stormwater. Continue to expand the use of storm water collected in
       detention basins for irrigation of public parks, street trees, and landscaping.

                                   future stormwater flows and plan for an adequate stormwater conveyance, storage,
                                   and disposal system. The stormwater master plan should include measures to
                                   eliminate and prevent flooding and to protect stormwater quality.
                            3.3-x	 Rate and Fee Studies. Supplement the stormwater master plan with rate and fee
                                   studies to ensure adequate funds are collected through the City’s stormwater rates
                                   and development impact fees. Implement rate and fee increases as needed.
                            3.3-y	 Infrastructure Construction. Design and construct stormwater system infrastruc-
                                   ture as needed to safely convey, detain, and dispose of current and future stormwater
                                   flows, protect water quality, and meet regulatory requirements.
                            3.3-z	 Detention Basin Locations. Develop new detention basins to be compatible with
                                   adopted land use plans, such as within agricultural buffer strips, parks, or in dedicated
                                   detention basin sites. Only a fraction (not over 25 to 30 percent) of any park should be
                                   used for detention basins.
3-58 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

3.3-aa	 Detention Basin to Serve New Growth. The land designated for the West Linwood
        Detention Basin, located south of the RWQCF and mapped as part of SE 3, shall be
        annexed and developed as a basin in conjunction with the annexation and master
        planning of the SE 3 area. This area is to be annexed and developed as a detention
        basin only and not for other public use.
3.3-ab	 Detention Basin Joint Uses. Where feasible, allow joint uses within the detention
        basins such as recreational open space, parks, and athletic fields.
3.3-ac	 TID Canals. Work toward the goal of eliminating discharge of stormwater into the TID
        canals.
3.3-ad	 Fencing around and near basins. Fencing is not to be used around basins in dual-use
        areas. Fencing may be used around equipment needed for basin operation, such as
        pumps. In these cases, it should be of a decorative material that also discourages
        graffiti (such as wrought iron), screened, and landscaped. In cases where fencing
        around basins is necessary (for basins where there is no dual use functionality, such as
        adjacent to the RWQCF), the fencing should be designed to ensure safety and enhance
        the overall aesthetic value of the detention basin site.
3.3-ae	 Low Impact Development (LID) and Water Quality Best Management Practices
        (WQBMPs). Require implementation of LID techniques and WQBMPs in new devel-
        opment projects and public works projects. Examples of these are use of porous
        pavement and pervious concrete, water quality swales, and rain gardens.
        Policies in Section 6.4, Sustainable Site Planning, provide more detail on the use of
        porous materials and other Low Impact Development Best Management Practices.
3.3-af	 Encourage Use of Less Toxic Agricultural Chemicals. In cooperation with the Stan-
        islaus County Agricultural Center, provide education and incentives to encourage the
        use of less toxic forms of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, or other chemical sub-
        stances by households and farmers.
3.3-ag	 Minimize Industrial Contamination. Work with the Regional Water Quality Control
        Board to ensure that all point source pollutants are adequately mitigated and
        monitored to ensure compliance with stormwater regulations.
                                                                                              NEW GROWTH AREAS AND INFRASTRUCTURE | 3-59
                            Waste Management and Recycling
                            3.3-ah	 Reduce Solid Waste. Maintain the City’s long-standing commitment to innovative
                                    solutions that reduce solid waste and increase diversion rates. Continue to expand
                                    diversion opportunities to ensure that the City, through participation in the Stanislaus
                                    County Regional Solid Waste Planning Agency, continues to surpass State targets for
                                    solid waste reduction.
                            3.3-ai	 Construction and Demolition Waste. Adopt a construction and demolition waste
                                    recycling ordinance which will require that, except in unusual circumstances, all con-
                                    struction, demolition and renovation projects meeting a certain size or dollar value,
                                    to divert from the waste stream 100% of all Portland cement concrete and asphalt
                                    concrete and an average of at least fifty percent of all remaining debris from construc-
                                    tion, demolition and renovation projects.
                            3.3-aj	 Implement Measures. Implement measures specified in the Source Reduction and
                                    Recycling Element.
                            3.3-ak	 Landfill capacity. Work with Stanislaus County to ensure the availability of adequate
                                    landfill capacity for Turlock’s solid waste.
                            3.3-al	 Green waste program. Continue to encourage the use of the City’s green waste
                                    program to reduce waste sent to landfills. Consider adding additional types of green
                                    waste products to the program, such as food waste, as it becomes feasible.

4	          Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities
This section of the Plan integrates text and policies about the provision of public facilities and
services in Turlock. The close relationship between schools, parks, and recreation is highlighted.
While State law does not require this Element, the Parks and Recreational Open Space section
fulfills requirements for addressing recreational open space, as described in the Open Space
section of Chapter 7, Conservation.
4.1	 Parks and Recreational Open Space
Some of the most visible physical features of a community are its public outdoor parks and
community recreation programs. These provide an important opportunity for residents to enjoy
recreational opportunities that enhance their physical health and well-being. In fact, public parks
and recreation programs contribute greatly towards establishing the community’s quality of life.
At the first community workshop for the General Plan update, many tables mentioned Turlock’s
neighborhood and community parks and sports complexes as important assets. At the second
workshop, a variety of approaches to expanding the park system inspired good discussions at the         Parks are anchors for neighborhoods and valuable
tables, as well as a sense that all these concepts could be supported by the community.                 community gathering spaces.
This section describes Turlock’s existing parks, and contains policies to guide the development
of future parks and recreational links and corridors. The policies and goals contained herein
shall be implemented through the Turlock Parks Master Plan, anticipated to be adopted shortly
following adoption of the General Plan.
The General Plan Diagram indicates the approximate size and location of park and recreation
facilities. The Parks and Recreation Facilities Diagram (Figure 4-1) distinguishes these as existing
or planned for future development as of 2010. Locations of proposed facilities are generalized.
Appropriate sites in the vicinity of the depicted locations may be approved without amending
the General Plan. Additional parks beyond those shown on in Figure 4-1 may be permitted in
residential districts upon approval of a Minor Discretionary Permit (MDP). Small, privately
maintained pocket parks may not be depicted on the Parks Diagram.
                                                                                                PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES | 4-1

                                                      In Turlock, parks and recreation facilities are administered by the Parks, Recreation and Public
                                                      Facilities Department. The Recreation Division administers all recreation programs sponsored
                                                      by the City, the renting of public buildings and the reservation of City parks.
                                                      Park Types and Existing INVENTORY
                                                      Turlock’s park system comprises community parks, neighborhood-serving city parks, neighbor-
                                                      hood school parks, and recreation corridors. Table 4-1 provides an inventory of existing parkland
                                                      as of 2010. The inventory, as well as the City’s population in 2010 according to the Census, is used
                                                      to establish a standard for parkland dedication in accordance to the Quimby Act.
                                                      Turlock has developed its storm drainage system to coincide with its parks system, providing
                                                      opportunities for dual use. With this General Plan, dual-use storm drainage basins are not
                                                      counted toward parks acreage.
                                                      Community Parks
                                                      Community parks serve all ages and may include facilities for low-intensity/passive recreation
                                                      use, lighted fields, courts, swimming pools, and areas and buildings for community festivals and
                                                      civic events, as well as for organized sport and athletic competitions. Generally restrooms and
                                                      some off-street parking are provided. While community parks serve larger areas of the City than
                                                      do neighborhood-serving city parks, they may also meet the recreation/open space needs of the
                                                      adjacent neighborhood. Turlock has three community parks, ranging in size from approximately
                                                      25 to 32 acres (not including ponds or storm drainage basins). Turlock’s 85 acres of community
                                                      park land represent one third of all park land in the City. See Table 4-1, Existing Parks and Rec-

Neighborhood-serving city parks provide a place for
play and passive enjoyment for area residents. Many
of Turlock’s neighborhood parks also serve as storm
drainage basins (bottom).
4-2 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood-Serving City Parks
This classification consists of parks devoted primarily to serving a small portion of the City. Park
facilities are usually oriented toward the recreational needs of children, but may also include vol-
leyball courts, half-size basketball courts, and picnic and play areas that serve all age groups. No
restrooms or off-street parking need be provided. Turlock’s 21 existing neighborhood-serving city
parks are as small as half an acre to as large as 7 acres in size (again, not including dual-use storm
drainage basins). (See Table 4-1.)
Five of Turlock’s neighborhood-serving parks are less than an acre in size, and may be consid-
ered “pocket parks.” These are not classified separately, but have a somewhat different character:
they are generally oriented to passive enjoyment or open play areas, and serve the immediate
neighborhood. They are appropriately located in higher-density areas of the City, or in areas not
well-served by neighborhood parks. New pocket parks may developed on the sites of small storm
drainage basins in existing neighborhoods, or as opportunities arise in and near downtown.                 Recreation corridors provide a network for walking
                                                                                                           and biking, add visual character to neighborhoods, and
Neighborhood School Parks                                                                                  in some places, as above, provide a clear edge to the
                                                                                                           City.
This classification consists of recreational parks or playgrounds built adjacent to educational
buildings and facilities. A school park provides for neighborhood recreation as well as the needs
of the adjacent schools. The City’s Public Facilities Division has a shared facility use agreement
with the Turlock Unified School District; therefore, the recreational grounds of Turlock’s public
schools are also included in the parks and open space inventory and are available for general
community use. Parks associated with elementary schools are between 4 and 6 acres in size, while
parks associated with middle and high schools are as large as 20 acres. There are currently 14
parks in this category.
Recreation Corridors (Greenway System)
The Parks Master Plan (1995) introduced the concept of a public greenway system for Turlock, to
be based on existing corridors along the Turlock Irrigation District (TID) canals and the Union
Pacific Railroad (UPRR), and a new perimeter greenbelt. The master-planned neighborhoods
developed in recent years in north and northeast Turlock feature recreation paths and greenbelts
at the City’s edge and verdant “paseos” in the neighborhood interior. As this park type is further
                                                                                                   PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES | 4-3

developed, it will help to give structure to the City and provide a protected and scenic network of
trails for biking and walking, serving both recreational and circulation needs. Linear parks may
also function as storm drainage swales.
For the purposes of acreage requirements discussed in the Standards section, Neighborhood-
Serving City Parks, Neighborhood School Parks, and Recreation Corridors are all included in
the Neighborhood Parks category. Altogether, Turlock has 164 acres of existing Neighborhood
Parks, representing two thirds of the City’s parkland.
STANDARDS
Park standards ensure that adequate open space for recreational use will be available as the City
grows. The General Plan establishes distribution standards for neighborhood and community
parks, and size and service area standards for community parks and each sub-class of neighbor-
hood parks.
With this new General Plan, dual-use storm drainage basins are not counted toward park
acreage. Dual-use storm drainage basins are considered open space, and policies requiring dual
use are included in the Open Space section of the Conservation Element (Chapter 7) of the
General Plan. New special recreation facilities will also not be counted toward park acreage, and
are treated separately in this chapter.
Park Distribution
Community Parks and Neighborhood Parks
The 1992-2012 General Plan established a citywide standard of 4.2 acres of public parks per 1,000
residents, to be split evenly between community parks and neighborhood and parks. For the
purpose of setting acreage requirements, neighborhood-serving city parks and neighborhood
school parks are both included in the neighborhood parks category. When the Plan was updated
in 2002, the ratio of neighborhood park acres and community park acres was adjusted to 2-to-1,
to reflect the ratio as calculated at that time.
At the time of this General Plan, the City’s actual park land ratio is 3.5 acres of park land per 1,000
residents, with 66 percent of this acreage in neighborhood parks and 34 percent in community
parks. This General Plan emphasizes development of linear parks, which are counted toward
                                                                                                    PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES | 4-7

                           neighborhood park land. The General Plan establishes a citywide standard of 3.5 acres of park
                           land per 1,000 residents, matching what is currently provided, and sets an upper level goal for a
                           3-to-1 (or 75%/25%) ratio of neighborhood to community parks. Because this will vary over time
                           as the park system develops, the General Plan provides acreage standards by park type in a range,
                           to be achieved on a citywide basis, as follows:
                            •	 Community Parks: 0.9 to 1.2 acres per 1,000 residents
                            •	 Neighborhood Parks: 2.3 to 2.6 acres per 1,000 residents
                            •	 Total: 3.5 acres per 1000 residents
                           The standards by park type are goals for citywide park land distribution. Individual development
                           or master plan areas may provide varying ratios of neighborhood and community park land,
                           following the Parks System diagram and more detailed master plans.
                           Park Size
                           The General Plan introduces size standards for new parks by type or sub-type, as follows:
                            •	 Community Parks: 25 acres or larger
                            •	 Neighborhood-Serving City Parks: 3-8 acres, varying based on service population
                            •	 Neighborhood School Parks: 4 to 5 acres park; 4 to 5 acres school activity fields (elementary or
                               middle); up to 20 acres school activity fields (high school)
                            •	 Pocket Parks: ¼ to 1 acre
                            •	 Recreation Corridors (Greenway System): N/A
                           Park Service Area
                           Service area is the territory within which recreational needs are served by a park. The General
                           Plan establishes a goal for all City residents to be within the service area for either a neighbor-
                           hood-serving city park or a neighborhood school park, or within ½ mile of a community park,
                           and within the service area of a community park.

 •	 Community Parks: Up to a 2 mile radius
 •	 Neighborhood-Serving City Parks: Up to 3/8 mile radius (approximately 2,000 feet)
 •	 Neighborhood School Parks: Up to ½ mile radius
 •	 Pocket Parks: Up to ¼ mile radius
 •	 Recreation Corridors (Greenway System): N/A
Park Access and Location
Each type of park has a different function within the City, and should relate differently to its sur-
roundings. The access and location characteristics of each park type are summarized in Table 4-2,
and reflected in the General Plan’s Land Use and Parks and Recreational Open Space Diagrams.
More detailed discussion of park configuration and character may be found in the Parks Master
Plan.
Improvement Standards for New Parks
The periodically-updated Park Improvement Nexus Fee Study bases its cost assumptions on a
set of buildout characteristics expected for new parks. While actual parks may or may not have
the specific elements assumed by the fee, they are expected to be improved to a comparable level.
The General Plan recognizes park improvements comparable to the buildout characteristics used
in the Fee Study as minimum standards for new parks. The General Plan provides the following
minimum improvement standards as a baseline:
 •	 Community parks. A 25-acre park with frontage improvements on all sides; a fully improved
    parking lot; play equipment; lighted tennis courts; a four-diamond ballfield complex; full bas-
    ketball courts; a bocce court; horseshoe pits with lights and arbor; a maintenance/concession
    building; rose garden; dog park; and restroom facilities.
 •	 Neighborhood parks. A four-acre park with frontage improvements on all four sides; a swing set;
    play equipment; and either a basketball half court, sand volleyball, horseshoe pits, bocce ball, or
    shuffleboard.
                                                                                                   PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES | 4-9

Standards for Special Use Facilities in Parks
Special facilities such as a public recreation center, general use sports fields, an amphitheater,
or botanical gardens can meet established desires expressed in community meetings and serve
as magnets for community parks. These facilities may be operated by non-profit organizations
through agreements with the City, and should be generally open to the public for a small user fee.
Special use facilities should not occupy more than 50 percent of a community park unless addi-
tional space is needed for the special facility to function.
The General Plan distinguishes between appropriate uses for parks, such as those above, and
facilities that are not generally available for public use. The basic rule will be this: if a special
use facility will be generally open for public use for free or for a small fee, it may be developed
within parks. If a facility will not generally be open for public use for free or a small fee, it
should not take place within park land that counts toward the City’s park acreage requirement.
A list of special use facilities expected to be generally available for public use and those that are
expected to be self-supporting and not generally open for public use follows. However, the actual
operating characteristics of a given facility (e.g., whether it will be generally open to the public)
will be the determining factor. More detailed guidance about the types of facilities appropriate
for community parks and their operating characteristics is provided in section 4.2, Community
Facilities.
Facilities Expected to Be Generally Open for Public Use and Appropriate for Parks
 Baseball Fields (Public and Non-League)                  Volleyball Courts
 Softball Fields (Public and Non-League)                  Gymnasiums

                            Additional Park Standards
                            The Parks Master Plan shall be updated following the General Plan Update, and will detail addi-
                            tional standards for each park type. Standards include:
                             •	 Site characteristics such as configuration, location, and its visual and experiential character;
                             •	 Basic requirements for outdoor sports facilities, passive recreation amenities, play areas, picnic
                                areas, and service amenities like parking and restrooms;
                             •	 Optional elements.
                            Future Need
                            The need for future neighborhood parks and community parks is determined by applying dis-
                            tribution standards to the projected buildout capacity of approximately 104,500. Deduction of
                            existing facilities from the overall future need provides the additional net acreage needed. The
                            build-out population accommodated by the General Plan would need an estimated 362 to 370
                            acres of park land in order to provide 3.5 acres of park land per 1,000 residents, not including
                            dual-use drainage basins. Subtracting existing parkland, there is a need for approximately 122
                            new acres of park land as part of development over the next 20 years. The General Plan’s parks
                            diagram proposes one approximately 25-acre new community park land and 97 acres of new
                            neighborhood park land, resulting in a 30/70 split between community and neighborhood park
                            land.
                            As part of new development areas, new parks should be designed and located so that they meet the
                            General Plan’s size, service area, and access and location standards, as well as the more detailed
                            guidance provided in the Parks Master Plan. Certain parts of existing neighborhoods are not
                            adequately served by parks, based on service area standards. Due to their small size requirements,
                            pocket parks are the best solution for areas currently lacking in nearby park space.

   2.6 acres per 1000 to 0.9 acres per 1000 but this will fluctuate over time.

Planned Improvements
The General Plan seeks to guide the development of a park system that meets the recreation
needs of a growing population. The envisioned system of parks and recreation corridors would
also connect neighborhoods and destinations to one another in a way that facilitates walking
and biking and structures the City’s form. Park system improvements are summarized here, and
represented in Figure 4-1. The diagram is conceptual; future park locations are not meant to be
specific. Illustrative diagrams for each Master Plan Area, including the relationship between
parks and other land uses, are in Chapter 3. Table 4-4 below identifies parks shown in Figure 4-1
by acreage.
Community Parks
The General Plan identifies one new community park of approximately 25 acres, plus a 12.5-acre
dual-use detention basin, to be developed as part of the Southeast 3 Master Plan Area. The park
should include a mix of recreational or special facilities (see section 4.2) and areas for passive rec-
reation and enjoyment. Specific elements have been proposed as priorities for a new community
park: horseshoes, skating, a dog park, sand volleyball, tennis courts (minimum six), two play-
grounds, parking, open space, and a large (200-person capacity) covered picnic area. These
elements may be reconsidered as planning for the park advances.

4-14 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood-Serving City Parks
Six new neighborhood-serving city parks would be created with development following the
General Plan. These parks are typically 4 to 5 acres in size, with three 2- or 3-acre parks in the
Montana-West and Southeast 1 areas, for a total of approximately 22 acres, in addition to 2 acres
of dual-use drainage basins. Two neighborhood parks would be included in the Southeast 1
Master Plan Area; two in Southeast 2; and two in the Montana-West area. General locations for
these parks are shown in Figure 4-1. In addition, the City would be a partner in facilitating new
pocket parks in existing neighborhoods with poor access to parks.
Neighborhood School Parks
Neighborhood school parks associated with six new schools (four elementary, one middle and
one high school) would be developed with General Plan buildout. These school park lands would
total about 33 acres, and would be available for public use after school hours, as part of the City’s
                                                                                                       Neighborhood parks will be integrated into each of
joint-use agreement with Turlock Unified School District. New elementary schools would be              Turlock’s future master plan areas.
located in the Southeast 1, 2, and 3 master plan areas, and one new elementary school is planned
for a site within City limits. A new high school and one middle school and their associated recre-
ational areas will be created with the Southeast 3 master plan area.
Recreation Corridors (Greenway System)
The new General Plan initiates a system of neighborhood greenways in the Southeast master plan
areas. Recreation corridors will provide local greenspace and pedestrian and bike routes in the
interior of new neighborhoods. The General Plan includes approximately 42 acres of recreation
corridors and greenway trails, with another 76 acres of dual-use storm drainage basins alongside
recreation corridors at the urban edge. New greenbelt parks a minimum of 60 feet wide will
define nearly the length of the eastern edge of the City, with linear storm basins broadening the
green corridor by up to 300 feet more.

                            Financing
                            Park Improvement Fee
                            To assist in the acquisition and development of City parks, the City requires dedication of
                            parkland or payment of in-lieu fees on all new residential, commercial, office, and industrial
                            development. According to Turlock’s Park Development and Acquisition Policy, adopted by
                            City Council in June 1999, Park Improvement Fees are deposited into accounts for each planned
                            neighborhood and community park. Funds may be loaned from one neighborhood park account
                            to another, but must stay within the same quadrant of the city. All new development pays funds
                            toward new community parks, which serve the entire City. Parkland may be acquired by dedica-
                            tion and/or purchased with park fees, at the City’s discretion.
                            The Park Improvement Fee is reviewed periodically and revised as necessary, in accordance with
                            the procedural guidelines established by AB 1600, codified in California Government Section
                            66000 et seq. These procedures require that “a reasonable relationship or nexus must exist
                            between a governmental exaction and the purpose of the condition.” Turlock’s Park Improve-
                            ment Fee must be reviewed and updated following adoption of the General Plan.
                            Park Improvements Serving Existing Neighborhoods
                            Revenues collected through Park Improvement Fees may not be used to pay for park improve-
                            ments serving already-developed areas, and may not be used for park maintenance or operations.
                            For improvements to existing parks and the development of new pocket parks in existing neigh-
                            borhoods, the City must rely on other funding sources.

Policies
Guiding Policies
4.1-a	 High-Quality Park System. Develop a high quality, diversified public park system that
       provides a variety of recreational opportunities for all City residents.
4.1-b	 Park Standards and Priorities. Review park standards and park improvement priorities
       periodically to ensure that needs are being met.
4.1-c	 Cooperation With School District. Continue cooperative efforts with the Turlock
       school district through joint use agreements for park and recreational facilities.
       Although school parks are not available for public use at all times and do not contain
       complete park facilities, substantial cost savings justify shared use.                       The City and neighborhoods should pursue opportuni-
                                                                                                    ties to create pocket parks at the sites of small deten-

       odically update to ensure equitable distribution of cost between existing and new
       residents, businesses, and property owners.
4.1-e	 Special User Groups. Identify the needs of special user groups, such as the disabled
       and elderly, and address these in the design and development of park and recreation
       facilities.
Implementing Policies
Master Planning
4.1-f	 Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan. Update the City’s Parks, Recre-
       ation, and Open Space Master Plan following the adoption of the General Plan, and
       implement its objectives.
       Development of a new Parks Master Plan should specify in greater detail park improve-
       ment standards and costs estimates, a facility prioritization plan, and a financing and
       acquisition schedule.
Planned Improvements by Park Type
4.1-g	 Community Parks. Acquire and develop one new 25-acre community park in the
       southeast (Southeast 3 Master Plan Area), concurrently with development. The new
                                                                                            PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES | 4-17

                                   community park should include recreational and other facilities, provided that these
                                   facilities are generally available for public use. Such facilities should not occupy more
                                   than 50 percent of park area. An additional community park must be part of any future
                                   development to the Northeast.
                            4.1-h	 Neighborhood-Serving City Parks. Acquire and develop six new neighborhood-serv-
                                   ing city parks, including two each in the Southeast 1 and Southeast 2 Master Plan
                                   Areas, and two in the Montana-West Master Plan Area. Place neighborhood parks at
                                   the core of new neighborhoods and co-locate neighborhood-serving city parks and
                                   neighborhood schoolparks wherever possible, as depicted on the Parks diagram.
                            4.1-i	 Neighborhood School Parks. Maintain joint-use relationship with Turlock Unified
                                   School District allowing public access to and use of school playfields during non-
                                   school hours. Coordinate with the School District in the location and design of school
                                   properties to facilitate flexible use of play fields.
                                   Generalized park locations have been selected to accommodate almost all new res-
                                   idences within 3/8-mile of a neighborhood-serving city park or one half mile of a
                                   neighborhood school park or community park. Neighborhood parks should generally
                                   not be smaller than the standards set forth in this section. Small parks are expensive to
                                   maintain and are unable to adequately support the full range of desired facilities.
                            4.1-j	 Pocket Parks. Work with neighborhood groups that wish to establish new pocket
                                   parks, in areas with a shortage of park space based on service area standards. The
                                   General Plan anticipates a structure whereby park land is purchased by local benefit
                                   assessment districts, while the City may agree to maintain new pocket parks. In the
                                   downtown core, pursue opportunities to acquire and develop small public spaces.
                            4.1-k	 Recreation Corridors and Greenways. Develop a system of linear corridors designed
                                   to provide pedestrian and bicycle linkages through and between neighborhoods, con-
                                   nections between major open spaces and recreational facilities and greenbelts at the
                                   City’s edge. In new development areas (see Chapter 3), these must be continuous, as
                                   shown on Figure 4-1.
                                   Neighborhood-serving city parks, neighborhood school parks, pocket parks, and rec-
                                   reation corridors are all counted as Neighborhood Parks for the purpose of acreage
                                   distribution standards.
4-18 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Distribution Standards
4.1-l	 Community and Neighborhood Parks. Provide 3.5 acres of park land per 1,000
       residents, aiming for a citywide ratio of between 2-to-1 and 3-to-1 for neighborhood
       and community park land. Neighborhood parks include public neighborhood-serving
       city parks, neighborhood school parks, and recreation corridors.
4.1-m	 Increase Level of Service and Update Standards. Following the decennial census,
       update park standards and dedication requirements to reflect the increased level of
       service if this has been achieved.
       The Quimby Act requires that dedication of parkland or collection of park fees shall be
       benchmarked on the latest federal census.
Location and Design Characteristics
4.1-n	 Park Location Criteria. Locate public parks in visible and accessible locations, in accor-
       dance with location criteria specified in this Element. Park locations may be adjusted
       within each master plan sub-area, but must remain within the boundaries of the
       sub-area.
4.1-o	 Minimum Park Buildout. All new parks must be developed to the minimum standards
       established in the Park Improvement Nexus Fee Study. These standards may be peri-
       odically updated.
4.1-p	 Design for Park Safety. Ensure safety of users and security of facilities through
       lighting, signage, fencing, and landscaping, as appropriate and feasible, following
       guidelines established in the Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan.
Park Development and Acquisition
4.1-q	 Park Improvement Fees. Following the specifications of the Park Improvement Nexus
       Fee Study, calculate park fees to enable purchase of acreage and provision of off-site
       park improvements for 3.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents added and require            The General Plan calls for the development a system
       payment of these fees and/or land deduction as a condition of all new residential devel-     of linear corridors designed to provide pedestrian and
       opment. This park land may not be used for dual-use storm drainage basins.                   bicycle linkages, connections between major open

       dedication or payment of in-lieu fees sufficient to buy and provide off-site improve-
       ments for a maximum of 3 acres per 1,000 new residents; if the amount of existing

                            4.1-s	 Land Acquisition Costs. Use available techniques to minimize acquisition costs. Tech-
                                   niques may include purchase of land at below appraised market value; dedication of
                                   land in lieu of fees; and acquisition of park sites promptly after collection of fees.
                                   The sale of land at prices below appraised market value (“bargain sale”) to a non-profit
                                   land trust that re-sells to the City can provide tax savings to the seller.
                                   Delay in acquisition diminishes the purchasing power of available funds and is not
                                   allowed. Non-availability of maintenance funds may not be a reason to delay park
                                   acquisitions.

        joint-use recreation facilities. Special facilities that are generally open for public use
        are appropriately located within neighborhood and community parks. Special facilities
        where public access is limited are encouraged to locate adjacent to city parks, where
        activities may be synergistic. See Section 4.2, Community Facilities.
        Through coordinated efforts with other recreation groups, such as Turlock Little
        League, the City can expand opportunities for new recreational facilities.
Planting
4.1-z	  Native Plants. Landscaping should use native trees, shrubs, and grasslands in order to
        preserve the visual integrity of the landscape, conserve water, and provide habitat.
4.1-aa	 Mature Trees. Mature trees should be retained to the greatest extent possible.
4.2	 Community Facilities
Community facilities are the public and private institutions that support the civic, social, and
recreational needs of the population. They offer a variety of athletic, artistic, and educational
programs and special events. The General Plan identifies needs and priorities for new facilities,
but typically does not identify specific locations. The following types of community facilities
are considered in this section: sports and recreational facilities; cultural facilities; community
centers; civic buildings; regional exhibition facilities; and social and community services. These
facilities are shown on Figure 4-2.
Sports and Recreational Facilities
The City strives to provide adequate athletic and recreational facilities for residents. These include
Little League baseball fields, softball fields for adults, bicycle paths and walking trails, gymna-
siums, and other facilities. Facilities serving citywide needs are most appropriately located in or
adjacent to community parks. Smaller facilities that can more easily be distributed throughout
the City, such as multi-use play fields and basketball courts, are typical features of neighbor-
hood parks. The City relies on its multi-use agreement with the School District for shared use
of swimming pools and gymnasiums at Turlock and Pitman High Schools, and for most of the
City’s youth baseball fields and tennis courts.

                                                         Future Needs
                                                         The Parks Master Plan, last updated in 2003, identified Turlock’s need for various special use facili-

                                                         baseball fields, and Pitman High School’s gymnasium and pool, which are available at certain hours
                                                         for community use, have met some of these needs. Turlock’s current inventory of selected recre-

                                                         National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) standards. These facility levels are not the deter-

                                                         The facilities are distinguished according to whether they are expected to be open for general public

                                                         The demand for specific facilities over the 20-year planning period should be recognized as
                                                         approximate. Turlock’s sports and recreational facility priorities as of 2010 follow. Again, they are
                                                         distinguished according to whether they are expected to be open for general public use.

4-24 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Appropriate Locations
As discussed in section 4.1, the General Plan introduces a new approach to siting sports and rec-
reational facilities. Two of the City’s existing community parks, Pedretti Park and the Regional
Sports Complex, are occupied primarily by sports facilities operated for League play and not
generally available for public use. During the phase of urban growth directed by this Plan, these
types of facilities will no longer be included in public parks. A golf course would not be an
appropriate use for community park space, and would be ideally located where it could be main-
tained with reused water from the Regional Water Quality Control Facility. Such potential
developments as a private Little League complex or a privately-operated aquatic center would
be highly-suited to sites adjacent to a community park, as both draw recreational users from
the entire City. The critical location criterion is public access: only facilities that are generally
available to the public for free use or use at a small fee belong in City parks.
Cultural Facilities
Arts Center
The Carnegie Arts Center, which was destroyed in an arson fire, has been rebuilt and expanded.
Completed in 2011, the 18,000-square foot facility serves as Turlock’s community art center as
well as a venue for special events, arts and cultural classes, private rentals, and small theatrical
productions.
Library
Turlock has one public library, which is part of the Stanislaus County library system. Member
libraries are integrated into a patron database that provides a common computer system platform
and technical support, and facilitates the sharing of resources within the system. Currently, the
Library’s primary funding source is a public facility fee program managed by the County, to
which development in the City contributes. The Stanislaus County Library provides 0.26 square
feet of library space per resident of the County. The Library’s Strategic Plan 2011-2015 identifies
the need for an additional 205,000 to 249,000 square feet of library space systemwide by 2030
to provide 0.4 to 0.45 square feet per capita, within the range of current library industry best
practice.

                                                       The Turlock branch library is located at 550 North Minaret Avenue, next to the Senior Center
                                                       (see Figure 4-2.) The library comprises 10,000 square feet, which translates to 0.12 square feet per
                                                       person in 2011, short of both the current system-wide ratio and the Library’s planning standard.
                                                       Turlock’s library is inadequate to serve the current population, a condition that will worsen as the
                                                       population grows. To meet the proportion of space per capita that the Library uses in its Strategic
                                                       Plan 2011-2015, and counting only residents of Turlock, the City would need between 31,800
                                                       and 37,000 square feet of new library space at General Plan buildout, in addition to the existing
                                                       library. The new library space would need to provide adquate shelf space for an expanded col-
                                                       lection, adequate seating space for quiet reading and individual study; group study and tutoring
                                                       rooms; community meeting space for 50 to 150 persons; and children’s space.
                                                       The Library intends to conduct a Facilities Master Plan to identify needs systemwide. It is likely
                                                       to pursue development of a smaller library in the range of 25,000 - 30,000 square feet in Turlock,
                                                       as soon as is feasible. Library expansion should take place in a way that meets the Library goal for
                                                       all residents to have convenient access to inviting, safe, and well-maintained library, while also

                                                       The CSUS Library comprises approximately 52,800 square feet of public use floor area on

                                                       students, faculty and staff at the University. However, it is open to the public, and community

                                                       The Parks Master Plan has identified the potential for an outdoor amphitheater in Turlock.
                                                       Botanical or demonstration gardens have also been considered. These or other facilities could

                                                       Many special-use facility needs have been identified over the years. With the opening of the

been achieved. Currently, the City is committed to supporting the rehabilitation and develop-
ment of the Carnegie Arts Center. Looking forward, the City on its own will likely not be able
to support development and operation of major facilities. It is helpful to summarize here a path
toward identifying, completing, and operating projects in the years to come.
The first step toward realizing a cultural or recreational project will often be to conduct a feasibil-
ity study. The study should evaluate community demand, potential partners in development and
operations, locations, and funding strategies. Next, if the study results in a finding that the City
can justify supporting development, and the project has community support, it should be added
to the City’s Capital Facilities Fee program. It is anticipated that public funds will only partially
cover the costs of new facilities, particularly facilities that have revenue-generating potential.
Third, most new facilities are likely to be operated by a non-profit or other organization, through
an agreement with the City. For example, the Carnegie Arts Center is being operated and main-
tained by the Carnegie Foundation. While the Recreation Department is able to manage a basic
program of arts and recreational classes, maintenance and operation of a golf course or a full-
scale aquatics center should be handled by a private-sector partner. A demonstration garden
and a Little League complex may be appropriately operated by local business and community
organizations.
Community Centers
These facilities are designed to meet the needs of the population for classes, civic meetings, social
gatherings, and cultural events. Some community centers are programmed for specific popula-
tions. The Recreation Division operates four community centers: the War Memorial, the Senior
Center, the Youth Center, and the Rube Boesch Center, as shown on Figure 4-2. In addition,
there is a community building in Columbia Park, known as the Marty Yerby Center, with
meeting rooms and a gymnasium.
The Recreation Division conducts numerous classes and activities, including art classes, sports
leagues for youth and adults, dance and exercise programs, aquatics classes, and after school
activities, and youth and teen programs. Most activities are hosted at the community centers,
and the buildings are also available to be rented for special events.

                                                   Future Needs and Locations
                                                   The Parks Master Plan, revised in 2003, cites the National Recreation and Park Association
                                                   standard for one meeting room per 7,500 persons. The City will need eight new meeting rooms
                                                   to meet this standard for the General Plan build-out population. The City of Turlock may meet
                                                   this need by providing facilities in the future community park; by adding a second Senior Center
                                                   to serve the northern part of the City; by opening a teen center; and by adapting and developing
                                                   facilities elsewhere. A teen center has been identified as a City priority.
                                                   Community centers are well-located in or adjacent to parks. General-use community centers
                                                   should be distributed throughout the City, to provide recreational and meeting space for neigh-

visitors. The Fairgrounds is also used during the year for events such as horse shows and craft
shows. Facilities and grounds are available for rent for picnics and meetings, and space is available
for RV camping. The Fairgrounds is on the former site of the Turlock Assembly Center, and
is listed on the National and State Register of Historic Places (see Chapter 7.) There may be
opportunities for greater use of Fairgrounds facilities for outdoor concerts or other events. The
Fairgrounds may be seeking expansion or relocation in the future, and should be encouraged to
find a site in Turlock west of Highway 99.
Health and Community Services
Social and community services are provided by the private and nonprofit sectors and by Stan-
islaus County. Stanislaus County’s Health Services Agency (HSA) operates a medical clinic at
800 Delbon Avenue adjacent to Emanual Medical Center. The clinic provides family medical
services, pregnancy care, and other health programs. The County’s Community Services Agency
(CSA) operates the welfare-to-work employment assistance program and provides aid to children
and families from two locations in Turlock: 101 Lander Avenue and 275 Third Street. Adjacent to
the Third Street facility, United Samaritans operates a lunch program serving some 28,000 meals
annually, while another emergency food bank, the Tything Place, is located at 800 Wayside
Drive.

                                   •	 Little League Complex with a minimum of four fields. A complex devoted to
                                      League play would not be appropriate for a City park. However, sites adjacent to
                                      community parks or recreation corridors should be prioritized.
                                      The 2003 Parks Master Plan update identified a need for 13 additional fields, and
                                      proposed a five-field complex to address this need. NRPA standards for one Little
                                      League field for every 5,000 residents would translate to a projected demand for 17
                                      new fields by 2030.
                                   •	 Indoor Recreation Center including a gymnasium, volleyball, indoor soccer, basket-
                                      ball, fitness/wellness programs and enrichment classes. The City should especially
                                      consider redevelopment or reuse of City-owned properties in central locations and
                                      adjacent to other community facilities or parks.
                                      A recreation center could serve as the anchor for a citywide recreational and social
                                      hub which could also include a teen center, offices for the Recreation Division, the
                                      Police Activities League, and new and existing outdoor spaces.
                                   •	 Indoor Recreation Facilities at Existing Parks
                                   •	 Aquatic Center, potentially combined with an indoor recreation center; operated as
                                      a joint venture; or developed as a private recreation facility.
                                   •	 Golf Course at an appropriate location in order to meet this community need, but
                                      not necessarily with public funds.
                                      Given National Recreation and Park Association standards that call for a nine-hole
                                      golf course for every 25,000 residents and an 18-hole golf course and driving range
                                      for every 50,000 residents, demand for at least one golf course is assured. Though
                                      there has been interest in developing a golf course for many years, the lack of
                                      start-up financing has prevented site acquisition.

4.2-e	 Plan, Develop and Operate New Facilities. Following an effective strategy identi-
       fied during the planning phase, develop new facilities and support their successful
       operations.
Cultural Facilities
4.2-f	 Carnegie Arts Center. Continue to support the operation of the Carnegie Arts Center,
       including multi-purpose rooms, classrooms, galleries, and office space. The Arts
       Center also includes an outdoor plaza.
4.2-g	 Library Expansion and Enhancement. Coordinate with the Stanislaus County Library
       to expand library facilities and enhance library services in Turlock, with the goal of
       having 0.4 to 0.45 square feet of library space per capita. New library space should
       accommodate an expanded collection and include adequate seating space for quiet
       reading and individual study; group study and tutoring rooms; community meeting
       room space for 50 to 150 persons; and children’s space. Expansion options may
       include, but are not limited to:
       •	 Expansion of the existing Library;
       •	 Addition of a new branch or branches;
       •	 A new Library for Turlock, located downtown;
       •	 Development of a joint-use community/school library at a new school site.
          Continue to work with the County to prioritize public facilities funding to construct
          Library expansion. There should be a minimum of a 25,000 square foot library
          during this planning period. See also policies in Section 4.3, Public Education
          Facilities.
4.2-h	 Joint Use School/Community Library. Work with Stanislaus County Library and
       Turlock Unified School District to explore including a joint use library as part of the
       new middle school or high school. A joint-use library should be designed for flexible
       community and school use that complements school operations. State grants may be
       available for this project.
4.2-i	 Cultural Activities. Pursue other opportunities to enhance cultural activity in Turlock,
       following the strategies outlined for Sports and Recreational Facilities. Successful
       development of new cultural facilities will likely involve working in partnership with
       non-profit organizations, the school districts, the University, and/or the private sector.

                                   conduct civic meetings, recreational programs, and social activities to meet the needs
                                   of residents. The City should aim to meet the standard of one meeting room per 7,500
                                   residents. Community centers should be distributed throughout the City, and should
                                   serve the needs of seniors; families with children; and teens. Locate new Community

                            Turlock’s population has grown at an average of almost 3 percent annually in the last two
                            decades, adding 28,000 residents between 1990 and 2008. Almost half of the City’s population
                            (42 percent) is between the ages of 25 and 55, while the young adult cohort (ages 18-24) had the
                            highest annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007. Turlock’s growth places added importance
                            on sound planning for educational facilities. The Turlock Unified School District (TUSD) has
                            built several new schools in the last decade to keep pace with growth; Turlock residents have
                            demonstrated their support by passing a bond measure to build Pitman High School, completed
                            in 2002. Turlock is also home to California State University, Stanislaus (CSUS). At the first
                            community workshop for this General Plan update, residents identified high-quality schools, as
                            well as the presence of CSUS, as among the best things about Turlock. TUSD is also the largest
                            employer in Turlock and plays a critical role in developing the city’s labor force.
4-32 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Primary and Secondary Education
School districts operate independently of local governmental control and regulatory mechanisms.
Proposed school sites have to be referred to local agencies for comment, and all non-classroom
facilities are subject to zoning and other land use control measures.
Pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education for most of the Study Area is provided
by TUSD. A small portion of the Study Area, in the northeast, is served by the Denair Unified
School District. Children in portions of the Study Area in the southwest and northwest attend
elementary and middle school in the Chatom and Keyes Union School Districts, but go on to
Turlock and Pitman High Schools, respectively. Currently, the portions of the Study Area in
the Chatom and Keyes districts are mainly rural, and have few school-aged children. Figure 4-3
shows the schools and school districts in the Study Area. No additional residential growth is
proposed within the jurisdictions of the Chatom or Keyes school districts.
In addition to the public schools, there are six private schools in Turlock, including one serving
elementary students, three serving elementary and middle school students, one serving middle
and high school students, and one serving grades 4 through 12.
Facilities and Enrollment
The Study Area is served by 13 elementary schools (ten in the Turlock USD, one each in Denair,
Chatom, and Keyes), five junior high schools, and three comprehensive high schools. There
are also four small alternative programs and a K-12 charter school. Some of these schools serve
students from within the Study Area as well as students from surrounding rural areas. . Table 4-6
lists 2008-2009 enrollment for all schools in the Turlock, Denair, and Chatom School Districts.
Chatom and Keyes schools serve fewer students in rural portions of the Study Area, and no
additional residential growth is proposed within their jurisdictions as part of the General Plan
update.                                                                                               Turlock Unified School District (TUSD) has added

                            and 2007. All are in the northern part of the city. As of 2009, TUSD reports that its schools
                            have capacity for approximately 1,300 more traditional students, as well as space in special-needs
                            classrooms. The District’s 2008 School Facilities Needs Analysis determined that when State
                            guidelines for counting classrooms were considered, its facilities in 2007 had the capacity to serve
                            12,313 students, a shortfall compared to current enrollment. Like TUSD, Denair Unified School
                            District’s most recent study using State standards found the district was over-enrolled.
                            Projections and Future Plans
                            School districts study the relationship between new housing and new students, in order to justify
                            the fees they charge to developers to help pay for new schools. This “student generation rate” is
                            calculated for categories of housing (single-family detached, single-family attached, and multi-
                            family.) When the most recent student generation rates for TUSD is applied to new housing
                            facilitated by this General Plan, a total of approximately 5,870 additional students are expected
                            to attend schools in the Turlock Planning Area. A majority (55 percent) would be in elementary
                            school.
                            As shown in Table 4-7, TUSD plans for elementary schools with 880 students, middle schools
                            with 1,100 students, and high schools with 2,100 students. The proposed new middle school
                            would be developed at half of the typical size during the planning period to match growth.

Four new elementary schools, one new junior high school, and one new high school are expected
to be developed to accommodate the projected buildout population. Three elementary schools
and new middle and high school would be developed in the Southeast master plan areas. Infill
development within the existing City limits would require one new elementary school. Current
projections indicate that there may be demand for only a small middle school during the planning
period. The approximate locations of future schools are shown on Figure 4–3.
School Funding
School facilities in Turlock are funded with a combination of General Obligation Bonds, fees
from the Mello-Roos and Redevelopment districts, the State Facility Fund, and development
fees.
                                                                                                  PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES | 4-37

                            State law allows school districts to levy development fees directly on new residential, commercial,
                            and industrial development (Government Code Section 65995). In 1998, the Governor signed
                            Senate Bill 50 (SB 50), which imposed the most significant school facility finance and developer
                            fee reform since the adoption of the 1986 School Facilities Act. The basic structure of the new law
                            is as follows: a 50/50 state and local school facilities funding match, hardship funds for school
                            districts that cannot achieve 50 percent locally, the ability for the school district to collect up to
                            50 percent from developers if the district can meet the 50 percent match threshold, and the ability
                            of school districts to collect up to 100 percent from the developers if the state fails to provide their
                            50 percent bond funding match. TUSD’s 2008 School Facilities Needs Analysis concludes that
                            Turlock meets the requirements for assessing both Level 1 development fees, subject to statewide
                            caps; and Level 2 or 3 development fees, as authorized by SB50. Currently, residential develop-
                            ment fees are $4.56 per square foot in TUSD and $2.97 in the Denair Unified School District.
                            Development fees for commercial and industrial development are set at the statewide cap of
                            $0.47 per square foot.
                            In addition to the use of developer fees that are applicable citywide, school districts may acquire
                            funds to provide school services in specific areas through the creation of a Community Facilities
                            or a Mello-Roos District. Such a district can be created with a two-thirds vote by area landown-
                            ers, and may include a special tax and the sale of bonds to meet service costs. Cities may also
                            seek public support to issue bonds to finance school construction. A General Obligation bond
                            approved by Turlock residents in 1997 was used to fund the construction of Pitman High School.
                            CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, STANISLAUS (CSUS)
                            California State University, Stanislaus (CSUS) provides local opportunities for undergraduate,
                            graduate and professional education. It is a major employer, and plays an important role in devel-
                            oping the City’s labor force and providing technical support to business. The University also
                            offers cultural and recreational opportunities for the entire community. Like the City and the
                            region, the University is expected to continue to grow throughout the planning period.
                            Facilities
                            CSUS was opened in temporary quarters in Turlock in 1960 with a continuing mandate to serve
                            six counties: Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Merced, Calaveras, Tuolumne, and Mariposa. The uni-
                            versity has occupied its 228-acre campus on the north side of Turlock since 1965. CSUS counted

6,713 full-time equivalent (FTE) students in 2008. Enrollment is projected to grow 3 percent
annually in the coming years, and to reach its designated capacity of 12,000 FTE students within
20 years. Enrollment is currently frozen due to state budget constraints.
Incremental growth has taken place in the context of the 1968 master plan, which established
a core academic area, a perimeter ring road, and gracious landscaping. These characteristics
and others are reaffirmed in the University’s 2009 Master Plan Update. The new master plan
determines that the current campus has enough space to accommodate projected growth. It
emphasizes that four- and five-story buildings should become the norm for new development of
academic space and student housing, and proposes that additional parking be provided in garages
rather than surface lots, in order to preserve the campus’s park-like setting. Future development
is to include a new academic quad in the southeast; four multi-level parking structures; housing
for approximately 2,300 additional students; and an enhanced outdoor physical education area in
the campus’ northeast.

        John H. Pitman High School opened in 2001, followed by Sandra Tovar Medeiros Ele-
        mentary (2006) and Walnut Education Center (2007). Turlock is justified in assessing

        with growth.

       campus ring road. This supports a campus environment but hinders a strong connec-
       tion with the City. The City and CSUS have a mutual interest in providing successful
       relationships between the campus and surrounding areas.
4.3-k	 Ongoing Communication. Confer with CSUS staff periodically to ensure the concur-
       rence of City and CSUS plans and actions.
4.3-l	 Joint Use of CSUS Facilities. Continue agreements with CSUS to maintain joint use
       of recreational facilities and make provisions to locate other mutually suitable recre-
       ational sites if existing facilities are no longer available due to CSUS growth. Explore
       additional partnership opportunities with CSUS to enhance community use of the uni-
       versity library.
4.3-m	 Traffic Circulation and Campus Access. To reduce the traffic impacts of campus
       activities, encourage CSUS to provide an additional campus access point from Christ-
       offerson Boulevard as identified in the 2009 Campus Master Plan.

5	           Circulation
The Circulation Element provides a framework to guide the growth of Turlock’s transporta-
tion-related infrastructure over the next 20 years. A safe and efficient transportation network
is an important contributor to a community’s quality of life and economic vitality. The circu-
lation system provides access to employment and educational opportunities, public services,
commercial and recreational centers, and regional destinations. It provides for travel by automo-
bile, transit, walking, and cycling; and it integrates the needs of railway and truck transport as
well as aviation.
State law recognizes the close relationship between transportation and land use and requires
that policies for the two topics are related and mutually beneficial. By integrating transporta-
tion policies with land use, the General Plan ensures that there will be sufficient roadway capacity
to accommodate traffic generated by future planned development. Additionally, by integrating
transportation and land use planning so that a greater percentage of short trips can be accom-
plished by walking, cycling, or transit, the city can also reduce the air quality impacts and
greenhouse gas emissions associated with automobile use.
                                                                                                       The Circulation Element guides the development of
Turlock’s Circulation Element also responds directly to the new State requirement of planning          ‘Complete Streets,’ which meet the travel needs of all
for “Complete Streets.” In response to Assembly Bill 1358, the California Complete Streets Act,        users.
all cities and counties are required to plan for the development of multimodal transportation
networks in their general plans beginning in January 2011. According to the guidelines, juris-
dictions must “plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs
of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is
suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.”1 The “users of streets, roads,
and highways” refers to bicyclists, pedestrians, children, motorists, persons with disabilities,
the elderly, users of public transportation, and commercial goods movers. This plan focuses on
strengthening Turlock’s multimodal roadway network in new growth areas as well as improving
mobility opportunities within existing areas of the city as well.

                           The transportation planning and policy set forth in the Circulation Element is a critical
                           component of Turlock’s responsibility toward meeting the requirements of SB 375, the Sustain-
                           able Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008. SB 375 requires that MPOs in California
                           prepare a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) for meeting their greenhouse gas reduction
                           targets, through coordinating planning for land use, transportation, and housing. While the
                           SCS is a regional plan, thoughtful land use and transportation planning in Turlock is essential to
                           the larger effort.
                           Similarly, fourteen cities and eight counties across the San Joaquin Valley have formed the Smart
                           Valley Places Partnership to address sustainable growth and development in the area. Each par-
                           ticipating jurisdiction is engaged in individual supporting planning projects to complement the
                           overall regional effort; in Turlock, that is the General Plan Update, Downtown Design Guide-
                           lines and Zoning Ordinance Update. The Circulation Element supports the HUD-EPA-DOT
                           Livability Principles, adopted by the Partnership. These principles are:
                            •	 Provide more transportation choices;
                            •	 Promote equitable, affordable housing;
                            •	 Enhance economic competitiveness;
                            •	 Support existing communities;
                            •	 Coordinate and leverage policies and investment; and
                            •	 Value communities and neighborhoods.
                           This Element sets forth a circulation plan that strengthens Turlock’s transportation network,
                           provides more choice of travel modes, identifies needed improvements in both new and existing
                           parts of the city, and works in tandem with land use changes.

5.1	 Travel Trends
The U.S. Census provides data on Journey to Work that indicates the travel mode to and from
work for Turlock residents and nonresident employees. These data, reported in the 1990 Census,
2000 Census, and 2006-2008 American Community Survey, show some shifts in commuting
behavior and travel choices.
Table 5-1 shows that currently around 80 percent of Turlock workers (aged 16 and over) drive
alone to work. This percentage has remained relatively constant since 1990. Just over 10 percent
carpool, over four percent work at home, fewer than three percent walk, 1.2 percent bicycle, and
less than one percent each take public transportation, taxicab or motorcycle. The most notable
change over time has been the percentage of workers who work from home. While these workers
make up only 4.2 percent of the working population in Turlock, their numbers have seen the
greatest growth over time: a 77 percent increase from 1990 to 2000, and a 109 percent increase
from 2000 to 2008.
                                                                                                                  The majority (80 percent) of workers in Turlock drive

                           Table 5-2 shows commute travel time survey results for 2008, 2000, and 1990. About 41 percent
                           of commuters currently travel less than 15 minutes to work, and about 72 percent of workers
                           commute under 30 minutes. Mean travel time to work increased by about three minutes from
                           1990 to 2000, but only increased by half a minute from 2000 to 2008. As discussed in the
                           Economic Development section, much of Turlock’s employment is in local services; relatively
                           short commute times are indicative of the dominance of local job centers. Commutes over 30
                           minutes likely indicate travel to regional employment hubs in Merced, Modesto, or Stockton.
                           Table 5-3 presents City of Turlock commuter choices and statistics against averages for the State
                           of California. City commuters chose to carpool slightly less, on average, than the State mean.
                           Public transportation use, however, is significantly lower than the State mean. Turlock’s tra-
                           ditionally low density land use pattern is largely responsible for limited transit use; however,
                           policies in this General Plan aim to move the city towards a more compact, transit-supportive
                           urban form. Travel times for commuters are also shorter on average than the State mean, despite
                           there being more workers commuting out of County for jobs than on a statewide basis.

5.2	 Roadway Network, Standards, and
Improvements
Generally, Turlock’s roadway network follows a cardinal grid system, with several notable excep-
tions. The oldest parts of town—Downtown and its immediate surroundings—have a tighter
grid pattern that is parallel and perpendicular to the railroad, which runs from the northwest
to the southeast. The railroad, Golden State Boulevard, and State Route 99 all run diagonally
through the city, disrupting or altering the gridded network at various points. Access to and/or
across these rights of way are limited, creating some barriers to cross-town connectivity. The tra-
ditional grid has also been modified in recent years in newer neighborhoods to the north and
east, where some suburban curvilinear and cul-de-sac streets predominate.
Functional Street Classifications
Turlock’s roadway system is based on a hierarchy of street types, known as functional classifi-
cations. These classifications are designed to provide access to current and future development,
and to maintain acceptable levels of service throughout the city. A route’s design, including the
number of lanes needed, is determined both by its classification as well as the projected traffic
level on the street generated by existing and new land uses. The classifications and their required
development and access standards are described below.
Freeways provide for intra- and inter-regional mobility, generally having four to six lanes in the
vicinity of the Study Area. Access is restricted primarily to arterials and expressways via inter-
changes. Crossings are grade-separated, and continuous medians separate lanes traveling in
opposite directions. Typical speeds exceed 55 miles per hour. State Route (SR) 99 is the only
freeway in the Study Area. No access is provided to adjacent land uses.
                                                                                                       CIRCULATION | 5-5

                                                     Expressways provide for movement of through traffic both within the city and to other nearby
                                                     regional locations. Parking is not permitted, and direct access is generally not provided to adjacent
                                                     land uses. In those rare circumstances where access to an adjacent land use is required, access
                                                     shall be by right turns only at prescribed intervals. In the Study Area, expressways generally range
                                                     from two to four lanes, with some six-lane segments near freeway interchanges where necessary
                                                     for operational purposes.
                                                     Arterials collect and distribute traffic from freeways and expressways to collector streets, and
                                                     vice versa. They also are designed to move traffic between adjacent jurisdictions. Major arterials
                                                     in Turlock are four lane facilities and minor arterials are two lane facilities. Limited direct access
                                                     may be provided to adjacent land uses, with a minimum driveway spacing of 300 feet.
                                                     Collectors provide a link between residential neighborhoods and arterials. Collectors typically
                                                     provide two travel lanes, on-street parking, and bike lanes. Collectors also provide access to
                                                     adjacent properties, so driveway access is not restricted but should be discouraged. Direct access
                                                     to adjacent land use is permitted, but, as these roadway classes are intended to funnel traffic from
                                                     local streets to arterials and expressways, or carry larger amounts of traffic between major desti-
                                                     nations within the City, driveways should be spaced at roughly 300 foot intervals in commercial
                                                     and industrial areas. In residential areas, driveways may be provided to each parcel facing onto
                                                     the collector.
                                                     Local Streets constitute the largest part of Turlock’s circulation system. They provide direct
                                                     access to adjacent properties and have no access restrictions. Local streets provide two travel
                                                     lanes, landscaped parkway strips, and sidewalks. While bike lanes are generally not required on
                                                     local streets because of their low traffic volume, it is assumed that every local street is designed to
                                                     be bike-friendly and may be informally treated as a Class III bike route.
                                                     Industrial Streets are roadways designed to accommodate trucks serving industrial areas, and

Roadway Elements and Dimensions
The typical street elements and widths of the functional classifications are shown in tables 5-4 and
5-5. Figure 5-1 illustrates the different components of the street right-of-way, which are referenced
in the two following tables. Table 5-4 shows residential streets, and Table 5-5 shows commer-
cial or industrial streets. However, the total rights of way for each classification are designed to
remain constant regardless of surrounding land uses. For example, a collector may traverse a res-
idential area as well as commercial or industrial area, and as long as its classification is defined as
a collector for that entire length, the overall right of way will not change. Even as the total right
of way remains the same, some elements of the roadway may change depending on the adjacent
land uses, namely to address the pedestrian experience. For instance, larger roads through resi-
dential areas have both parkway and landscape strips (in other words, landscaping on both sides
of the sidewalk) to provide a greater buffer for residential uses from the roadway and to create a
more protected pedestrian environment. In commercial areas, sidewalks are wider to accommo-
date higher volume pedestrian travel.

Roadway Spacing and Access Standards
Another important way in which the functional classifications’ hierarchy is established is through
spacing and access standards. The purpose of prescribing roadway spacing and access standards
is to create a regular grid system, which will improve overall traffic flow in the city. Table 5-6
describes the optimum spacing between roadway types and any limitations on access to each
type.

                                                      The City of Turlock roadway facilities were evaluated on a daily basis by use of 2007 and 2008
                                                      average daily traffic (ADT) counts. Intersection facilities were evaluated on an AM and PM
                                                      peak-hour basis by use of 2007 and 2008 peak-hour turning movement counts. Conditions were
                                                      identified by generating a level-of-service (LOS) determination.
                                                      Intersection LOS was calculated for all control types using the methods documented in the

                                                      Traffic operations have been quantified through the determination of LOS. LOS determina-

                                                      operating conditions and LOS “F” represents over-capacity conditions. For a signalized or all-way
                                                      stop-controlled (AWSC) intersection, an LOS determination is based on the calculated average
                                                      delay for all approaches and movements. For a two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) intersection,
                                                      an LOS determination is based upon the calculated average delay for all movements of the worst-

                                                      operate at above LOS C, under existing conditions. However, these are likely to change with the
                                                      implementation of improvements outlined in the General Plan. Where improvements cannot

                                                      However, it is important to note that LOS, especially peak-hour LOS, was not the ultimate

Existing roadway LOS was also determined on a daily basis with 24-hour volume counts taken
between 2007 and 2008. LOS was determined relative to average daily volume and facility
capacity. Citywide roadways were determined to operate at LOS C or better for the large majority
of roadways. However, the following roadway segments were determined to be operating unac-
ceptably according to the 1992 General Plan standard, based on being over or nearing full
capacity as currently designed. However, these are likely to change with the implementation of
improvements outlined in the General Plan.

Circulation Network Design and Performance
Prior to this General Plan, the City of Turlock used LOS as a standard for determining roadway
performance and planning improvements. However, in support of the new Complete Streets leg-
islation and SB 375, this General Plan moves away from the LOS standard as this measure has
a tendency to promote urban sprawl. Rather, roads will be constructed in accordance with the
designs specified in the Circulation Diagram in this section (Figure 5-2) and with the improve-
ments detailed in Table B-1, found in Appendix B (consistent with the access, spacing, and
intersection configurations described earlier). LOS will still be used as a trigger for preparing a
traffic analysis to determine when new improvements are to be made, but it will not be used as
the standard to which roads are to be built or improved. However, other mitigation measures
such as traffic calming, alternative modes, trip reduction strategies, and others will be used to
mitigate congested conditions if it is determined that other improvements are not feasible due to
right of way constraints or other factors.
The circulation network was determined by a number of factors, of which current LOS was
one. As described in the previous section, the existing conditions of the roadway network were
evaluated according to average daily LOS to determine the baseline conditions of the system.
Roadway segments and intersections that are known to already operate below LOS D are made
priorities for improvement. Where feasible mitigation is possible, improvements are described
                                                                                                    CIRCULATION | 5-13

                            in determining the desired General Plan circulation network at buildout. That measure was
                            balanced with what is feasible and prudent given other factors, such as current and future land
                            uses and physical constraints. In other words, in some cases, roadway segments may not be able
                            to be improved to ameliorate congestion. The overall network “right-sizes” roads to support the
                            current and planned land uses, and prescribes spacing and design that will facilitate efficient,
                            multimodal use of the street system.
                            LOS will still be evaluated and used as a basis for triggering improvements of the General Plan
                            roadways at the project level. However, the ultimate buildout of the circulation network shall
                            match the design specified in this plan; in other words, roads shall not be continually widened
                            to achieve a certain LOS. In these cases, traffic calming and other strategies to encourage the use
                            of alternatives to the automobile, will be deployed where insufficient right of way exists and it is
                            determined that the disruption of adjacent land uses would undermine business or residential
                            uses required to meet other General Plan goals.
                            Planned Improvements
                            The circulation network shown in Figure 5-2 identifies the functional classifications of key routes
                            at buildout. To achieve the spacing standards and capacity assumptions made in the circula-
                            tion diagram, as well as a balance between existing and future land use and roadway service,
                            improvements to the roadway network will be needed. New arterial and collector roads will
                            provide access to the residential, commercial, and industrial areas, connecting those areas with
                            the existing local and regional transportation system. New local roads in neighborhoods will
                            serve those residents. The new roadways will continue the grid network that currently charac-
                            terizes Turlock’s circulation network, following the spacing and access standards listed in this
                            chapter, and creating connections between new development areas and established neighbor-
                            hoods, job and shopping centers, and other destinations.
                            Major street improvements planned for Turlock are listed in Appendix B. Additionally, intersection
                            improvements will be required at major intersections along new roadways and improved roadways,
                            including but not limited to turn channelization, signalization, and/or construction of round-
                            abouts. The proposed street improvements include both the construction of new streets in master
                            plan areas as well as improvements to existing roadway segments within the current urbanized area.
5-14 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

The future circulation network is illustrated in Figure 5-2. No General Plan amendment is
required if the general location, anticipated level of service, and connections to the street network
are maintained.
Street designs for the proposed roads shall conform to the typical street widths and design
elements defined in tables 5-4 and 5-5. All street designs are subject to review and approval by the
Engineering Division of the Development Services Department and the City Engineer. Excep-
tions may be granted for special cases, but no street may be removed.
Future Traffic Conditions
The City traffic model predicts that by making the planned improvements and building out the
proposed circulation network and proposed land uses, development the Turlock Study Area will
generate approximately 2,955,000 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or 23 miles per person per day.
The traffic model also indicates the level of service at which the planned road segments would be
operating at plan buildout. Table C-1 in Appendix C lists the projected daily roadway segment
operations at 2030 buildout.                                                                          Implementation of the General Plan roadway network

Even when all possible planned improvements are made, some roadway segments are projected to          cars, and cyclists alike.
operate below daily LOS D. These segments are in the existing urbanized area, where improve-
ments would not be possible without impacting adjacent uses. Similarly, in keeping with the
Complete Streets concept, the bikeway system will not be compromised to accommodate more
vehicular traffic. It is understood that the buildout of the General Plan circulation network will
not lead to free-flowing traffic on all streets.

5-16 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN
       future development and roadway improvement plans against standards for the classi-
       fications as set forth in Tables 5-4, 5-5, and 5-6.
5.2-c	 Complete Streets. Maintain and update street standards that provide for the design,
       construction, and maintenance of “Complete Streets.” Turlock’s Complete Streets
       shall enable safe, comfortable, and attractive access for all users: pedestrians,
       motorists, bicyclists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities, in a form that is com-
       patible with and complementary to adjacent land uses, and promotes connectivity
       between uses and areas.
5.2-d	 Design for street improvements. The roadway facility classifications indicated on
       the General Plan circulation diagram (Figure 5-2) shall be the standard to which roads
       needing improvements are built. The circulation diagram depicts the facility types that
       are necessary to match the traffic generated by General Plan 2030 land use buildout,
       and therefore represent the maximum standards to which a road segment or inter-
       section shall be improved. LOS is not used as a standard for determining the ultimate
       design of roadway facilities.
5.2-e	 Use of existing facilities. Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities, and
       improve these facilities as necessary in accordance with the circulation diagram.
5.2-f	 Coordination of local and regional actions. Coordinate local actions with State and
       County agencies to ensure consistency between local and regional actions including
       but not limited to the Regional Transportation Plan, Regional Expressway Study,
       Regional Transit Plan, and Regional Bicycle Action Plan.
5.2-g	 Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled. Through layout of land uses, improved alternate
       modes, and provision of more direct routes, strive to reduce the total vehicle miles
       traveled.
5.2-h	 Circulation system enhancements. Maintain projected levels of service where
       possible, and ensure that future development and the circulation system are in
       balance. Improve the circulation system as necessary, in accordance with the circula-
       tion diagram and spacing/access standards, to support multimodal travel of all users
       and goods.
5.2-i	 Funding for improvements. Ensure that new development pays its fair share of the
       costs of transportation facilities. Require development in adjacent unincorporated
       areas to pay its fair share of impacts on city transportation infrastructure.
                                                                                                   CIRCULATION | 5-17

                            Implementing Policies
                            Regional Cooperation
                            5.2-j	 Work with Caltrans on freeway improvements. Continue to work with the California
                                   Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to achieve timely construction of pro-
                                   grammed freeway and interchange improvements.
                                   Caltrans does not currently fund local interchange improvements to accommodate
                                   increased traffic growth.
                            5.2-k	 Coordinate standards. Continue to coordinate the City’s design standards for regional
                                   roadways with the standards of other agencies.
                            5.2-l	 New southeast interchange. Continue to work with Caltrans, Stanislaus County,
                                   Merced County, and other partner entities to implement a new interchange on
                                   State Route 99 at Youngstown Road for the potential realignment of Highway 165 as
                                   approved in the Project Study Report (PSR).
                            5.2-m	 Amend Regional Expressway Study. Seek to amend Stanislaus County’s Regional
                                   Expressway Study (most recently updated in 2010) to add the Waring/Verduga
                                   expressway. The precise alignment shall be determined by the Roadway Circulation
                                   Study (see Policy 5.2-au).
                                   The General Plan process allowed a detailed examination and refinement of the
                                   Expressway Plan. Though the designation of some streets is different in the two
                                   plans, overall objectives are similar. These changes will result in consistency on major
                                   policies.
                            5.2-n	 Use of Congestion Management Process. Utilize the StanCOG Congestion Manage-
                                   ment Process (CMP) to determine the timing and degree of regional roadway facility
                                   improvements in accordance with regionwide plans.
                            5.2-o	 Off-Site roadway mitigation. If an annexed area will utilize County roads, developers
                                   shall be required to fund improvements of affected County roads that connect to the
                                   citywide system to meet County standards.
                            5.2-p	 Area of Influence fee. In order to ensure that all development affecting Turlock’s trans-
                                   portation infrastructure contributes to its expansion and maintenance, the City will
                                   work with County to expand the current SOI fee into adjacent unincorporated areas
5-18 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

        where nexus can be established. The SOI fee is to be maintained until the new Area of
        Influence (AOI) fee is in place.
5.2-q	 Regional fair-share fee program. Work with Caltrans, Stanislaus County, and other
        jurisdictions to establish a fair-share fee program for improvements to regional routes
        and state highways. This fee should reflect traffic generated by individual municipali-
        ties/unincorporated communities as well as pass-through traffic.
Street Network
In general, policies pertaining to the street network in this section and others (see also policies in Section
6.3: Street Design and Connectivity) promote the maintenance and development of a well-connected
circulation system that is integrated with adjacent land uses and facilitates reductions in vehicle miles
traveled.
5.2-r	  Follow circulation plan diagram. Locate freeways, expressways, and arterials
        according to the general alignment shown in the Circulation Plan Diagram. Slight
        variation from the depicted alignments for collectors will not require a General Plan
        amendment.
5.2-s	 Trigger for improvements. Require improvements to be constructed where adequate
        ROW is available and impacts to adjacent land uses can be avoided or adequately
        mitigated to General Plan standards when LOS is projected to drop below LOS D (on an
        average daily trips basis).
5.2-t	  Follow adopted City standards. Build freeways, expressways, arterials, and collector
        streets in accordance with adopted city standards. Where these standards deviate
        from those set forth in the General Plan, amend the city standards to be consistent
        with the General Plan.
5.2-u	 Roundabouts. Roundabouts may be used in place of signalized intersections on any
        roadway facility or intersection type. Roundabouts are particularly encouraged at the
        intersection of two collector streets.
5.2-v	 Maintain standards through ongoing improvements. Ensure improvements to the
        circulation system required to maintain standards as set forth in Section 5.2. Improve-
        ments shall take place in accord with the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
5.2-w	 Expressway access from private property. In general, access from individual private
        properties onto expressways is not permitted. An exception may be granted by the
                                                                                                               CIRCULATION | 5-19

        improvements in order to encourage infill development, the creation of a pedestrian
        friendly urban design character, and the densities and intensities of development
        necessary to support transit and local business development. Development decisions
        Downtown should be based on community design and livability goals, rather than
        traffic LOS. Downtown is defined by the Downtown designation on the Land Use
        Diagram (Figure 2-2).
Roadway Operations and Monitoring
5.2-ac	 Impacts of new development. No new development will be approved unless it can
        show that required service standards (accessibility, spacing and capacity in the circula-
        tion diagram and in Section 5.2) are provided on the affected roadways.
5.2-ad	 Traffic Calming. Traffic calming techniques may be employed to mitigate the traffic
        effects of new development.
        See policies in Section 6.3, Street Design and Connectivity, for design characteristics of
        traffic calming measures.
5.2-ae	 Traffic impact studies. Traffic impact studies are only required where there is a dem-
        onstrated change in background traffic or where proposed land uses generate traffic
        levels that vary substantially from assumed trip generation levels that were used to
        formulate the General Plan circulation network.
5.2-af	 Traffic and accident monitoring and reduction. Establish and implement programs to
        help maintain satisfactory roadway performance at intersections and along roadway
        segments. This may include the following:
        •	 Collect and analyze traffic volume data on a regular basis, and monitor current
           intersection and roadway segment LOS on a regular basis. This information may
           be used to update and refine the City’s travel forecasting model to continually
           improve estimates of future conditions.
        •	 Consider ways to shift travel demand away from the peak period using Transpor-
           tation Demand Management (TDM) strategies, especially in situations where peak
           traffic problems result from a few major generators (e.g. large retail developments
           in highway corridors). Strategies to consider include:
           –– Encouraging employer-sponsored incentives for transit, bike, or carpool use
           –– Providing shuttle service to major events and destinations
                                                                                                   CIRCULATION | 5-21

        return, the property owner is held responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the
        landscape frontage.
5.2-al	 Street Trees. Street trees in landscape strips and parkways strips must be placed near
        enough to the sidewalk to provide canopy. In commercial and industrial areas, street
        trees shall be located within public right-of-way behind the sidewalk. In residential
        areas, street trees shall be located within the parkway strip.
        See policies in Section 6.7, Urban Design, for location and placement of street trees.
5.2-am	 Medians. Medians shall be planted with street trees.
        Promote the use of drought-tolerant landscaping in medians.
5.2-an	 Raised medians. Medians shall be installed along newly constructed arterials and
        expressways that front new development. Raised medians shall also be installed along
        existing roadways (where medians exist or are added) as the City completes roadway
        rehabilitation projects, as deemed necessary by the City Engineer.
5.2-ao	 Landscaping and median maintenance. Work with property owners to develop and
        implement a funding strategy for maintenance of landscaping in medians and in other
        areas within the public right of way adjacent to existing developed properties. The
        City will also pursue the development of a manual for workers that explains how to
        maintain xeriscape/drought-tolerant landscaping.
Right-of-Way Acquisition and Preservation
5.2-ap	 Establish roadway alignments. Take appropriate action to establish precise align-
        ments based on the General Plan diagram and on standards delineated in Table 5-6,
        and on Caltrans local route requirements, for all existing and proposed freeways,
        expressways, arterial and collector streets in order to identify future right-of-way
        needs. Plan lines must be adopted by the City Council.
5.2-aq	 Plan Line Studies included in CFF. Plan Line Studies shall be included in CFF costs.
        Once plan lines are established, new cost estimates shall be prepared and the CFF
        updated to reflect the revised and finalized costs.
        Plan Line Studies to be included in the CFF are listed in Appendix B.

Parking
5.2-ay	 Improve Downtown parking opportunities, as demand grows in the future, using the
        following strategies:
        •	 Examine rear or vacant lots and other under-utilized areas for off-street parking;
        •	 Consider utilization of the existing parking district mechanism to finance
           Downtown parking and related street landscaping improvements suggested in the
           Downtown Master Plan; and
        •	 Develop a projection of future parking need in Downtown and identify potential

        Downtown parking facilities shall be included in the CFF update.
5.3	 Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation
Turlock’s flat topography and its mild rainfall are ideal for commuting and recreational bicycle
riding, and walking. However, the intense summer sun and minimally shaded streets in some
parts of town can be deterrents to both bicyclists and pedestrians.

5-26 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN
The Plan encourages the use of walking and bicycling and recognizes three classes of bikeways:
 •	 Bike Path (Class I Bikeway, including paseos and public greenways). Provides a completely sepa-
    rated right-of-way designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with cross flows by
    motorists minimized.
 •	 Bike Lane (Class II Bikeway). Provides a restricted right-of-way designated for the exclusive or
    semi-exclusive use of bicycles with through-travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited,
    but with vehicle parking and crossflows by pedestrians and motorists permitted.
 •	 Bike Route (Class III Bikeway). Provides right-of-way designated by signs or permanent mark-
    ings and shared with pedestrians and motorists.
Figure 5–3 depicts existing and future bikeways of all three classes. In addition, it is expected
that all local streets operate as Class III bike routes, connecting residents to the larger circulation
network, and do not need to be demarcated as such. Designs for all new collector and arterial
streets also include Class II bike lanes on almost all roadway facilities and sidewalks on every        Good neighborhood planning and roadway network
facility (see Tables 5-4 and 5-5).                                                                      design enables safe access to schools for local
                                                                                                        children.
Not only does the bicycle plan show bikeways on future roads, it also fills in some of the key
“missing links” of the city’s existing bicycle network, improving bicycle access and connectivity
in infill areas. Important missing links and troublesome segments or intersections to be improved
include:
 •	 Taylor Road at Geer Road (gap in Class I)
 •	 Taylor Road near Crowell Road Right of Way/Lutheran Church (gap in Class I)
 •	 Berkeley Avenue, especially at the Golden State Boulevard intersection (gap in circulation
    network; difficult crossing)
 •	 Canal Drive and East Main Street (difficult transition from Class I to Class II and III)
 •	 Tegner Road from Taylor Road to Christofferson Parkway; Golden State Boulevard from
    Christofferson Parkway to Monte Vista Avenue (indirect, heavy traffic, poor route-finding)

5-28 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN
These are priority improvement areas to the existing bikeway system, and are indicated as such
on Figure 5-4. Implementation of bikeway improvements on existing streets often presents chal-
lenges, as right of way width is limited, traffic patterns are established, and there may not be
adjacent new development projects from which funding can be collected.
This General Plan also introduces a new park type to Turlock’s park and recreation network, as
a subset of the Neighborhood Park category: greenways or recreation corridors (See Section 4.1).
These greenways are specifically intended to provide landscaped corridors, separate from streets,
with Class I paths that link neighborhoods to schools, parks, and other local destinations. The
incorporation of recreation corridors into new development areas will provide significant new
spaces for pedestrian and bicycle travel that is efficient and safe for all user groups.
Policies
Guiding Policies
5.3-a	 Promote walking and bicycling. Promote walking and bike riding for transportation,
       recreation, and improvement of public and environmental health.
5.3-b	 Meet the needs of all users. Recognize and meet the mobility needs of persons using
       wheelchairs and those with other mobility limitations.
5.3-c	 Develop a safe and efficient non-motorized circulation system. Provide safe and direct
       pedestrian routes and bikeways between places.
Implementing Policies
Complete Streets
5.3-d	 Integration of land use planning. Implement land use policies designed to create a
       pattern of activity that makes it easy to shop, play, visit friends, and conduct personal
       business without driving.
       The neighborhoods described in the Land Use and City Design elements are designed
       to promote non-motorized transportation and to make it easy for those people who
       cannot or choose not to drive to be independent.
5.3-e	 Provision of bicycle facilities. Facilities for bicycle travel (Class I bike/multiuse paths;
       Class II bike lanes, and Class III bike routes) shall be provided as shown on Figure 5-3.

       •	 Providing bicycle paths and lanes on bridges and overpasses;
       •	 Ensuring that all new and improved streets have bicycle-safe drainage grates and
          are free of hazards such as uneven pavement or gravel;
       •	 Providing adequate signage and markings warning vehicular traffic of the existence
          of merging or crossing bicycle traffic where bike routes and paths make transitions
          into or across roadways; and

5.4	 Public Transportation
Turlock’s relatively small size and rural surroundings has traditionally resulted in a small role for
public transportation. Less than one percent of Turlock’s workforce uses public transportation to
travel to work (see Table 5-1) Prior to the late 1990s, the City maintained only a demand-responsive
bus system due to the low demand. However, the City has since transitioned from its exclusively
demand-responsive operation to a fixed route system. This was the result of the Turlock service
area approaching the limits of what a demand responsive transit service could most efficiently
serve. The transit industry generally considers 50,000 to be the population threshold where the
transition from demand responsive to fixed route should occur, and the 1999 population was
approximately 57,000. The overall service area is approximately 21 square miles.
Turlock is also included in the planning for a new regional rail system currently being studied
by the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission. This new service would be an extension of the
Altamont Commuter Express (ACE), linking Turlock to employment destinations to the north
and west to the Bay Area. Additionally, Turlock is located along one of the potential routes for the
future California High Speed Rail (HSR) system. The regional rail system and HSR would share
the same right of way. Turlock is identified as a regional rail stop, but not a High Speed Rail stop.
Over the next 20 years, Turlock’s population is projected to reach between 115,000 and 127,000
people. Much of the new housing is planned to be more compact than that which was developed
in the last decade, which will help make Turlock’s public transportation increasingly viable.
Continuing to strengthen public transportation options in Turlock is a priority of this General
Plan—but is one that is only possible through supportive land use planning and accompanying
funding and implementation plans.

                            Fixed Route—BLAST
                            Since 1998, the Bus Line Service of Turlock (BLAST) has provided a local fixed route bus
                            system for Turlock and Denair residents and visitors. BLAST operates 4 separate routes, mostly
                            on the east side of SR 99, from Olive Avenue to Countryside Drive and from Christofferson
                            Parkway to Linwood Avenue. BLAST operates on Saturdays from 9:20 AM to 4:20 PM and
                            Mondays through Fridays 6:10 AM to 6:50 PM, holidays excluded. Buses run about every 35
                            minutes Monday through Friday and every 70 minutes on Saturdays. Figure 5-5 shows the areas
                            of coverage and access by the current BLAST system.
                            Demand Responsive—Dial-a-Ride Turlock
                            Since 1975, the City has operated Dial A Ride Turlock (DART). DART was the only local public
                            transportation until BLAST was started in 1998 to meet increasing demand. DART still operates
                            full-service for residents 65 or older and/or with disabilities but is restricted to trips outside the
                            BLAST system for other passengers. DART operates in Turlock on Saturdays from 9:20 AM to
                            4:15 PM and Mondays through Fridays 5:35 AM to 6:15 PM. In Denair, DART operates Mondays
                            through Saturdays 9:20 AM to 4:15 PM.
                            The biggest challenge facing Turlock’s provision of local transit is continuing shortfalls in funds
                            for operation. The funding that the city received for transit through the American Recovery
                            and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) were dedicated to capital improvements; meanwhile, the City
                            continues to struggle with operating costs.
                            Current regional systems
                            Both the counties of Stanislaus and Merced operate public transportation systems that provide
                            service to and from the Turlock area.
                            Stanislaus Regional Transit
                            Stanislaus Regional Transit (StaRT) provides a fixed route system, shuttle services, runabout
                            services, and dial-a-ride services. The Turlock/Modesto Shuttle service provides demand-respon-

                            Merced County Transit
                            THE BUS is a service provided by the Transit Joint Powers Authority for Merced County and
                            provides, as with StaRT, both fixed route and dial-a-ride services. THE BUS dial-a-ride service
                            is not available to and from the Turlock area, but the fixed routes provide service to Turlock via
                            Route 6 and Route 7. Route 6 links Turlock with the Hilmar community and travels along SR
                            165. Route 7 provides service to and from Merced and travels along SR 99. THE BUS Route 6
                            runs about every hour from 7:00 AM to 9:05 AM and from 1:00 PM to 4:45 PM. Route 7 runs
                            on irregular headways with buses leaving the station anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours apart. The
                            Saturday Red Route 7 is more limited, with only one bus running the Turlock to Merced and
                            back route. The bus arrives at the Merced terminus at 10:30 AM, 2:00 PM, and 6:45 PM. Figure

                            Inter-regional, statewide and nationwide bus transportation is provided to the Turlock area via
                            Greyhound. The Greyhound station is open Mondays through Fridays 8:00 AM to 5:30 PM and
                            Saturdays 9:00 AM to 11:59 AM, excluding holidays. The Greyhound depot is located centrally in
                            the Downtown Turlock area, at 243 Golden State Boulevard between Main Street and Marshall
                            Street. The station is identified in Figure 5-5.

Residents of the Turlock community are also served by Amtrak, which runs on the Santa Fe
Railroad tracks through Denair. The San Joaquin run offers short passenger trains that make
four stops daily, providing direct rail access to other communities in the San Joaquin Valley, with
connections to all other Amtrak routes and stations including national routes. There is a small
passenger kiosk in Denair.

planning period.
High Speed Rail
Since voter approval of Proposition 1A on the November 4th, 2008 statewide ballot providing $9
billion in bond funding, the California High-Speed Rail project is moving forward. Plans for
High Speed Rail entail electrically-powered trains running on over 800 miles of track, linking
San Francisco and Sacramento to Los Angeles and San Diego via the Central Valley. While the
system is not planned to stop in Turlock, there are stops planned in Modesto and Merced. This
section of the system (San Jose-Merced) is currently in the Alternatives Analysis stage, which will
help identify the alignment, precise station locations, and maintenance facilities. Turlock will
be able to benefit from the ultimate implementation of High Speed Rail by providing ancillary
transit services to nearby stations.
The alignment of the High Speed Rail through the Central Valley has yet to be determined, and
it will likely follow one of two existing railroad rights of way: the Union-Pacific Railroad (UPRR)
or the Burlington-Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF). The UPRR roughly parallels State Route 99
and Golden State Boulevard, while the BNSF runs northeast of Turlock, through Denair. Two
alignments through Turlock are under consideration for the UPRR option: the first through
Downtown, and the second on the west side. The ultimate alignment will have important impli-
cations for subsequent planning and rail service in Turlock. If the UPRR alignment through
Downtown is chosen, the City will have to undertake a new Downtown planning effort to
consider and plan for the impacts of the high speed train through central Turlock, as well as
                                                                                                                                   CIRCULATION | 5-37
                            for the land uses and urban design surrounding a potential station. If the BNSF alignment is
                            chosen, the impacts on Turlock will be minimal; however, the City may wish to implement new
                            transit connections between Turlock and the nearest station(s).
                            Commuter Rail
                            In early 2010, the City of Turlock approved a Memorandum of Understanding to work with
                            other regional entities from Sacramento to Merced County to explore the creation of a commuter
                            rail service for Central Valley cities. The working group is led by the San Joaquin Regional Rail
                            Commission, which owns and operates the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) train which
                            links communities in San Joaquin County to the Bay Area. The proposed Valley commuter rail
                            would link to the current ACE train. The group is working closely with the California High
                            Speed Rail Authority, and hopes to build commuter rail tracks along the same alignment as the
                            proposed high speed train in the near term so that regional service could commence earlier.
                            Policies
                            Guiding Policies
                            5.4-a	 Promote safe, efficient, and convenient public transportation. Promote the use of
                                    public transportation for daily trips, including to schools and workplaces, as well as
                                    other purposes.
                            5.4-b	 Work with multiple agencies and jurisdictions. Continue to cooperate with other
                                    agencies and jurisdictions to promote local and regional public transit serving Turlock.
                            Implementing Policies
                            Local Transit
                            5.4-c	 Improve local transit operations. Continue the present course of expanding its fixed
                                    route service and improving operations.
                            5.4-d	 Improvements to Demand-Responsive transit. Improve the City’s dial-a-ride system.
                                    Aggressively pursue transit grant funds in order to continue funding operations.
5-38 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

5.4-e	 Consistency with Stanislaus Congestion Management System. Monitor the
       frequency, routing and coordination of local transit services for consistency with the
       requirements of the Stanislaus County Congestion Management Plan (CMP).
       The County Congestion Management Plan includes minimum standards regarding
       these factors in an effort to enhance the coordination within the regional transporta-
       tion system.
5.4-f	 Transit stop spacing. Transit stops should be spaced no further than 1,000 feet apart,
       if spaced for continuous service on city streets. Spacing may be deviate from the
       general standard in the Westside Industrial Specific Plan area where individual busi-
       nesses occupy large parcels (greater than 20 acres) and where stops should serve
       employee entrances directly.
5.4-g	 New transit center location. Continue to pursue the development of the city’s
       new interim Transit Center (at Dels Lane and Golden State Boulevard) and future
       permanent center Downtown. Two options for the final transit center location are at
       Dels Lane and in Downtown The final location of the transit center shall coincide with
       the location of the regional commuter rail station, be addressed in the update of the
       Downtown Master Plan, and be reflected in the General Plan upon its completion.
5.4-h	 Funding for transit services. Continue to pursue federal and State funds to cover
       capital and operating costs associated with Turlock’s transit operation. (Currently,
       funding is sufficient to cover these costs.) If federal funds are reduced and capital
       needs are not being met, transit may be added to the Capital Facilities Fee (CFF)
       through a Nexus Study.
5.4-i	 Transit usability. Situate transit stops at locations that are convenient for transit users,
       and promote increased transit ridership through the provision of shelters, benches,
       bike racks on buses, and other amenities.
5.4-j	 Transit services marketing. Encourage ridership on public transit systems through
       marketing and promotional efforts. Provide information to residents and employees
       on transit services available for local and regional trips.
5.4-k	 Transit for seniors. Require new community care facilities and senior housing projects
       with over 25 beds to provide accessible transportation services for the convenience of
       residents.
                                                                                                    CIRCULATION | 5-39

                            5.4-l	 Development that supports transit. Ensure that new development is designed to make
                                   transit a viable transportation choice for residents. Design options include:
                                   •	 Have neighborhood centers or focal points with sheltered bus stops;
                                   •	 Locate medium and high density development on or near streets served by transit
                                      wherever feasible; and
                                   •	 Link neighborhoods to bus stops by continuous sidewalks or pedestrian paths.
                            Regional Transit and Coordination
                            5.4-m	 Regional transit to support SB 375 compliance. Coordinate with other relevant
                                   agencies to implement regional transit solutions as part of the SB 375 Sustainable
                                   Communities Strategy.
                            5.4-n	 Correspondence between local and regional transit. As Turlock’s local transit system
                                   continues to be developed, services should be oriented to link with potential future
                                   commuter and/or high-speed rail.
                            5.4-o	 Regional rail. Support regional efforts to provide regional passenger train services, via
                                   commuter rail and/or High Speed Rail. As necessary, engage in Station Area planning
                                   efforts to examine and coordinate land uses surrounding a future train station in
                                   Turlock.
                            5.4-p	 Support existing regional transit services. Continue to support the MT Stage service
                                   provided by Stanislaus County and THE BUS service provided by Merced County.

Turlock Municipal Airport
The City of Turlock owns a municipal airfield that is located approximately 8 miles east of the
City off of East Avenue and Newport Avenue. The airport is not only outside the incorporated
City limits but is also situated in the adjoining Merced County, outside of the Planning Area.
The airfield facility was originally constructed by the federal government as an overrun field for
Castle Air Force Base, located approximately twenty miles to the south in the community of
Atwater. The City acquired the 640-acre site in the late 1940s through a transfer from the federal
government under the Surplus War Property Act of 1944. Since that time the City has managed
and operated the Airport as a small general aviation facility.
In 1951 the City sold 307 acres that were not being utilized for airport operations to a private
landowner for an agricultural operation. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested into airport
operations and improvements. Approximately 250 acres of the remaining airport property are
now leased to a private operator for an agricultural operation.
Historically, the Turlock Municipal Airport has been operated under an airport lease or contract
management agreement. Currently, the City has a management contract with a fixed-base
operator that serves as an on-site manager for purposes of aircraft maintenance and fuel sales.
The City provides administrative support in the form of rental of tie-downs and hangar spaces
and the collection of monthly rental/lease fees. The City has also established an Airport Advisory
Committee that advises the Council on operational aspects of the airport facility.
The airport is open to the public and has repair facilities. The runway asphalt is listed as being
in good condition and the markings in fair condition. Use is limited to single wheel craft under
12,000 lbs. As of 2008, 57 aircraft are based at the airfield, including 52 single-engine planes,
three multi-engine planes, and two helicopters. Seventy-nine percent of traffic is local and 21
percent is itinerant.
In 1991 the City first completed and adopted an Airport Master Plan Study. The study was coor-
dinated with the City of Turlock, the Turlock Airport Advisory Committee, County of Merced,
                                                                                                   CIRCULATION | 5-41

5-42 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN
Merced County Airport Land Use Commission, Merced and Stanislaus Associations of Govern-
ments (COGS), Castle Air Force Base, the Federal Aviation Administration, CalTrans and other
federal, State and local agencies. The Master Plan identifies future airport levels of service, future
estimated general aviation demands, potential airport facility improvements, and possible man-
agement and organizational options to keep the facility active.
Historically, the City has maintained a general policy that the Turlock Municipal Airport will be
a self-supporting facility. In other words, funds derived from the agricultural lease, the tie-down/
hanger rentals, and a modest fuel flowage fee would be used to maintain and improve the facility.
As of 2001, the Turlock Airport was running as a self-supporting facility.
The State of California utilizes a model to assist local governments in determining the indirect
economic benefits that generally result from a local airport facility. This model is based upon three
general variables: the revenue derived from fixed base operation(s); the personal property taxes
assessed on the private aircraft based at the facility; and the “visitor dollars” that the community
received from transient aircraft frequenting the facility. In Turlock’s case, there is little to suggest
                                                                                                         The Union Pacific Railroad follows Golden State
a positive impact in any of these areas. First, historically very little income in excess of operational Boulevard through central Turlock and sees some 18
costs has been received from the fixed base operators. Second, since the facility and its fixed          freight trains per day.
base aircraft are located in Merced County, the City received virtually no share of the personal
property taxes paid by the aircraft owners. Third, since transient tie-down activity is virtually
non-existent, there would appear to be little “secondary spin-off” revenue that could be expected
from out-of-town visitors.
Turlock Airpark
Turlock Airpark is a private airstrip located just south of SR 99 within the City limits, owned by
Turlock Airpark Inc. Air traffic in and out of Turlock Airpark is light, the runway asphalt and
markings are listed as being in poor condition, and use is limited to single wheel craft under
4,000 lbs. 32 aircraft are based at the airfield, including 12 single-engine planes and 20 ultralight
craft. Sixty percent of traffic is local and 40 percent is itinerant.
The Airpark has generated complaints from neighboring residents. As the General Plan recog-
nizes the goal of discouraging the continuation of existing incompatible land uses throughout
the planning area, the City encourages the cessation of flight operations at the facility, and its
possible relocation to a more suitable site.
                                                                                                                                       CIRCULATION | 5-43

                            Railroad
                            Union-Pacific
                            The railroads within the City limits are owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR). These
                            railroads provide freight service in and out of the City, serving the industrial area west of SR 99
                            and the downtown area parallel to Golden State Boulevard. The main Union-Pacific line runs
                            parallel to Golden State Boulevard and connects the City to a vast statewide and interstate rail
                            network via the City of Modesto to the north and the City of Fresno to the south. The secondary
                            Union-Pacific line that serves primarily rural areas west of Turlock and the west side indus-
                            trial area runs a mile south of and parallel to Main Street from Golden State Boulevard out west
                            where it meets a north-south line headed to Modesto via Ceres. Figure 5-6 shows the railroads
                            and Amtrak station in the Turlock area.
                            Railroad activity includes approximately 18 freight train operations per day along the UPRR track
                            running parallel to Golden State Boulevard passing through some residential areas. A maximum
                            of two local freight trains operate per day on the local UPRR tracks, which run parallel to Castor
                            Street, formerly Tidewater Southern purchased by UPRR. This is an important short line service
                            to the TRIP.
                            BNSF
                            BNSF owns and operates a railroad line east of the City limits running through the unincor-
                            porated community of Denair. The BNSF line runs roughly parallel to the Union-Pacific line,
                            connecting to the Cities of Stockton and Modesto to the north and the City of Fresno to the
                            south. This railroad is about 4 miles northeast of the Union-Pacific railroad.
                            Truck Movement
                            Manufacturing is one of the largest single employment sectors for Turlock residents; together
                            with other industrial activities such as food processing and wholesale trade, it represents a signif-
                            icant part of Turlock’s expanding economic base. Efficient regional connections are prerequisite
                            to the expansion and continued operation of these industrial activities, as well as for the provision
                            of goods and supplies to the other sectors.
5-44 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

In recognition of the special design consideration for truck routes, and to minimize neighbor-
hood disruption, the City in 1984 adopted a resolution delineating special truck routes. Truck
routes are developed to minimize neighborhood disturbance in the City and consist primarily of
freeways, select expressways, and a few arterial and collector streets. SR 99 is a major statewide
truck route. Golden State Boulevard provides truck access through the core of Turlock. The only
truck routes that cross the Union-Pacific railroad tracks adjacent to Golden State Boulevard are
Monte Vista Avenue and Fulkerth Road. Other peripheral truck routes include paths to and
from the industrial development west of SR 99 and to regional destinations north and east of the
planning area via Geer Road and Monte Vista Avenue respectively. Harding Road and Wash-
ington Road provide routes around the southern and western edges of Turlock. Walnut Road,
Tegner Road, Linwood Avenue, Main Street, Fulkerth Road and Monte Vista Avenue provide
routes into and out of the industrial zones west of SR 99. Figure 5-6 shows existing and proposed
truck routes.

                                   Municipal Airport Master Plan including its implementation programs.
                                   The Master Plan addresses issues such as maintenance and upgrading of facilities and
                                   outlines the long-term objectives for the airport.
                            5.5-f	 Financing for airport improvements. Finance improvements to the Airport through
                                   user fees and state or federal funds earmarked for general aviation facilities.
                            5.5-g	 Airport management and operation. Continue to operate the Turlock Municipal Airport
                                   through a fixed base operator and airport management agreement with the goal of
                                   continually decreasing subsidy from the City’s General Fund.
                            5.5-h	 Closure and/or relocation of Turlock Airpark. Encourage cessation of flight operations
                                   at the private Turlock Airpark and assist the owners in its relocation.
                                   A small privately owned airpark is located in the southern part of the City and is subject
                                   to various use and size restrictions due to its proximity to Highway 99. This airpark
                                   is used only infrequently, primarily by ultra-light aircraft and radio-controlled model
                                   airplanes, and has generated complaints from neighboring residents. The Plan rec-
                                   ognizes the goal of discouraging the continuation of existing incompatible land uses
                                   throughout the planning area.
                            5.5-i	 Airpark removed from County Plan. Support the Stanislaus County Airport Land Use
                                   Commission in removing the Turlock Airpark from its Airport Land Use Commission

                            5.5-j	 Truck route identification. Continue to sign truck routes. Ensure that clear signage is
                                   provided from freeways to truck routes in Turlock.
                            5.5-k	 New truck route designation. All expressways, arterials, and industrial streets shall be
                                   designated truck routes.
                            5.5-l	 Truck route design. Incorporate provisions for trucks in the design of routes depicted
                                   for truck movement in Figure 5-6. Ensure that truck routes are designed according to
5-46 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

       Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) standards for intersections and turning
       movements.
5.5-m	 Location of industrial development. Continue industrial expansion in the TRIP so as to
       minimize the neighborhood impacts of truck movements.
       Areas designated for industrial expansion in the Plan are to the west of Highway 99,
       which will continue to serve as a buffer between residential and industrial areas.
5.5-n	 Secure truck parking. Encourage high-security off-street parking for tractor-trailer rigs
       in industrial designated areas.
       Locate parking in areas with demonstrated need and where police patrol can be
       provided. High visibility, including good lighting, should be provided.
5.5-o	 Financing for truck facilities. Explore possible funding sources, including user fees, to
       help finance truck routes, at least in part.
Railroad
5.5-p	 Railroad crossing safety. Continue the ongoing comprehensive program to improve
       the condition and safety of existing railroad crossings by upgrading surface conditions
       and installing signs and signals where warranted.
       Special consideration must be given to improving access to Downtown.
5.5-q	 New railroad crossings. Provide new grade-separated crossings across the Union
       Pacific Railroad (UPRR), as shown on Figure 5-6, in conjunction with the planned
       roadway improvements shown on Figure 5-2. New grade-separated crossings will be
       at Linwood Avenue and the new east side expressway.
5.5-r	 Financing for railroad crossing improvements. Establish a financing program for
       railroad crossing improvements through such mechanisms as a special assessment
       district (municipal revenue bonds) or tax-increment financing (redevelopment district).
                                                                                                 CIRCULATION | 5-47

                            Electricity service in Turlock is provided by the Turlock Irrigation District (TID). Natural gas is
                            provided by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). As of January 2009, TID operated 25,000 electric
                            meters, 20 miles of transmission lines, 25 miles of fiber optic backbone, 160 miles of underground
                            distribution lines, and 130 miles of overhead distribution lines in the Study Area. Several major
                            PG&E gas transmission pipelines extend through the Turlock Study Area: roughly following
                            Walnut Road from Bradbury Road to Golden State Boulevard; along Washington Road from
                            Bradbury Road to West Main Street; along Golden State Boulevard from Hawkeye Avenue
                            north; and along Geer Road from Canal Drive north. One refined oil product pipeline underlies
                            the Study Area, roughly following the path of Highway 99.
                            TID maintains a five-year plan for its electric facilities, which is reviewed annually; it is in the
                            process of adding power resources as part of its normal resource planning process, and expects
                            to be able to maintain a sufficient level of service for the Study Area throughout the planning
                            period. Chapter 8 provides additional information about electricity and gas usage in the Study
                            Area.
                            Rising demand associated with population and employment growth will necessitate additional
                            transmission facilities both for serving local needs for electricity, gas, oil, and telecommunications
                            and for transporting these services through the Study Area to reach other locations. Therefore,
                            it is important that these new facilities and services be provided in a manner that minimizes
                            impacts on the built and natural environments and on the health and safety of Turlock residents
                            and businesses.

5.6-d	 Consolidation of transmission facilities. Encourage consolidation of multiple trans-
       mission lines into common transmission corridors wherever possible. Secondary
       preferred locations are adjacent to freeway and railroad corridors, when feasible.
       In reviewing proposals for new transmission lines and/or capacity, the City should
       express a preference for upgrade of existing lines and use of existing corridors where
       feasible.
5.6-e	 Identify corridors in master plans. New transmission corridors should be identified to
       the extent feasible in all master plans created for new growth areas.
5.6-f	 Visual impact of substations. To minimize visual impacts, new bulk substations should
       be located in industrial and non-retail commercial areas when possible.
5.6-g	 Substations for residential areas. To the maximum extent possible, locate new distri-
       bution substations serving residential areas in adjacent commercial properties. When
       not feasible, these facilities should be designed in a manner to harmonize visually with
       the surrounding development.
5.6-h	 Minimize effects on resources. Locate and design public utility transmission, distri-
       bution, and maintenance facilities to minimize adverse effects on natural and scenic

6	         City Design
One of the main reasons a community commits an exceptional amount of time, energy and
dollars to planning is to create a more beautiful and desirable place to live. Turlock residents hold
their city to high standards of design aesthetics in both existing and new development.
While a City can establish specific building standards to enhance its attractiveness, the “visual
quality” and the physical well-being of a community is made up of much more than the specific
design of individual buildings. It requires the City to examine its geographical setting, recogniz-
ing those things that contribute to its visual interest, and develop strategies to encourage their
preservation and enhancement. It also includes a serious commitment by the City for public and
private improvements that will enhance the image of Turlock in the eyes of both residents and
visitors.
The City Design Element addresses the design, use and management of the physical elements
that shape Turlock. It seeks to promote visual quality and a fit between residents’ needs and city
form. While the focus is on issues of citywide concern, critical issues at a more local or area-spe-
cific scale are also examined.
6.1	 Overall City Form and Edge Conditions
Overall Form
Turlock’s form is compact. The City has steadily grown outward since its inception, but the edges
of growth have not reached neighboring communities, and will not do so under General Plan
policies. Growth has taken place in all parts of the City, though the thrust of recent expansion in
recent decades has been to the north and northeast. The Plan seeks to maintain Turlock, Keyes,
and Denair as free-standing communities, surrounded by farms and orchards, over the next 20
years.
                                                                                                      Turlock’s compact urban form has maintained a firm

                           have persisted, conscious efforts have been made to avoid a division. For example, sustained
                           community efforts in the early 1960s led to the present alignment of Highway 99 where it skirts
                           the City to the south, unlike in some other parts of the Valley where the Highway traverses
                           through many communities. Nonetheless, the Union Pacific Railroad, with its infrequent street
                           crossings, and the adjacent Golden State Boulevard continue to represent a barrier to closer inte-
                           gration of the north and southwest parts of the City.
                           CHARACTER AND MIX OF USES
                           Turlock’s historic areas are characterized by a diverse mix of uses within short distances. Smaller
                           shops, restaurants, offices, single-family residences, apartments, automobile dealers, repair shops
                           and civic offices can all be found within a one-quarter mile walking distance of the City’s center.
                           Small blocks limit development to a fine-grain, and a continuous street network with frequent
                           intersections keeps visual interest at a high level.
                           In contrast to this, a diversity of uses and housing types is the exception in most newer parts of
                           the City. Growth has led to increased distances between Downtown and new residential areas,
                           creating a need for convenience shopping and services closer to new residences. Strip-retail along
                           arterials emanating from Downtown (principally Golden State Boulevard and Geer Road and
                           Lander Avenue, but also West Main Street Street and East Avenue) and new freeway-oriented
                           regional commercial centers (Countryside Plaza at Freeway 99 and Fulkerth Road, and Monte
                           Vista Crossing at Freeway 99 and Monte Vista Avenue) somewhat fulfill this role. However, the
                           large distances between these retail areas and some recent residential developments points to the
                           need for alternative growth patterns. Particularly in the north, commercial development is con-
                           centrated along Geer Road. The predominance of “strip”-oriented retail and commercial uses
                           means that some residents must drive as far as two miles for everyday necessities.
                           URBAN-AGRICULTURAL EDGE
                           Turlock’s existing well-defined urban edge reinforces its image as a town close to the country,
                           a value cherished by many residents. But the proximity of agricultural operations to urban uses
                           also creates conflicts affecting both farmers and urban residents.
                           The impacts of urban encroachment on farm production include increased farmland theft
                           and vandalism, farmers’ liability for personal injury, spread of crop pests, restrictions on use of
6-2 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

pesticides, and noise, odor and burning restrictions. Although Stanislaus County has had a right-
to-farm ordinance since 1981, which was replaced by a new right-to-farm ordinance in 1992, State
and local restrictions and complaints by urban residents often compel modification of farming
practices. Increased costs and conflicts at the urban edge can make conversion of agricultural
land to urban uses not just an attractive proposition, but a necessity.
As with many cities surrounded by agriculture, some of these conflicts already exist in Turlock.
With growth, some of the established edges between agriculture and urban areas are likely
to change, increasing the number of new households in close proximity to farming activities,
though the Plan calls for maintaining a defined urban-agricultural edge.
Conflicts relating to farming at the urban-agriculture interface can be minimized by using
organic farming practices, or switching to crops that produce fewer conflicts, maintaining
on-farm buffer zones or by designing suitable edge conditions that transition well from urban to
rural development patterns. Also, a city form that minimizes the perimeter is likely to result in
fewer conflicts, while an enlarged perimeter would likely bring more residents into direct contact
                                                                                                     Greenbelt buffers between urban and agricultural

                                                                                                     and drainage areas.
In 1992, Stanislaus County adopted an Agricultural Element for the General Plan that calls for
buffers between agricultural and non-agricultural uses, with a standard minimum width of
150 feet. The width may extend to 300 feet or more when the adjacent use requires significant
drainage or involves “people-intensive outdoor activities,” such as playing fields. According to the
County, buffers must incorporate a solid wall as well as a vegetative screen. Permitted uses within
the buffer area include public roadways, utilities, drainage areas, landscaping, parking lots, and
walking and biking trails without rest areas (to discourage higher intensity use of the space).

                                  A square or a circular city form, with minimal jags, creates a shorter edge of potential
                                  conflict than other forms. Also, it prevents creation of finger-like protrusions of urban

                           6.1-k	 Agricultural Buffer Design. Implement an “agricultural – urban buffer design” to
                                  minimize the impact of urban development near active agricultural operations.
                                  Typically, roadways and irrigation canals are used to demarcate boundaries between
                                  urban and agricultural uses. Some general characteristics for the “agricultural – urban
                                  buffer design” are outlined below. These design characteristics of the urban edge
                                  are guidelines. The establishment of an urban edge that creates permanent buffers
                                  between residential and long-term agricultural uses shall be established in the master

6-6 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

6.2	 Neighborhood Form
Turlock has a rich variety of neighborhoods and housing types, ranging from older, established
ones with traditional layouts and mature landscapes, to emerging ones at the edge of the City.
EARLY NEIGHBORHOODS
Turlock’s older areas are close to Downtown. Most are within one-half mile or about 10 minutes
on foot. These areas are marked by a continuous fine-grained orthogonal street pattern, with
houses fronting on east-west streets.
Early residential development in the City is typified by the area between Berkeley Avenue, Canal
Drive, Minaret Avenue and East Avenue. Streets are lined with tall large-canopy trees providing
shade and a sense of enclosure. A typical block is about 400 feet x 320 feet, and the average lot
is narrow and long — 50-foot wide and 150-foot deep (about 7,500 square foot lots). Residen-
tial densities in the area generally range from 4 to 5.5 units per gross acre, with streets and public
rights-of-way accounting for about 12 percent of the total area. Parking access is provided from
the rear via alleys that run through the block, which effectively provide a pedestrian/bicycle con-
nection every 175 feet or so.
The overall block pattern in the older residential areas of the southwest part of the City is very
similar, but densities are somewhat higher. Variation in lot size and housing type is also greater.
CONTEMPORARY NEIGHBORHOODS
The historic pattern of continuous and shaded streets, mid-block alleys and rear-accessed garages
was gradually replaced, initially by “front-accessed” garages in the late 1950s and 1960s, and later
by developments in the 1970s that did without the alleys altogether. Townhomes and apartments
were first introduced around 1970; the two largest developments were built in the early 1990s.         Turlock’s early neighborhoods are characterized by
                                                                                                       mature trees, architectural variety, short blocks, and

unsuccessful in addressing the relationships between adjoining residences and of dwellings to
public spaces. Many have perimeters defined by sound walls or parking drives and introverted
streets terminating in cul-de-sacs. Streets, both internal and public, are often lined with garages
or parking, both in single-family and apartment developments. This pattern of development is
most evident in the areas north and east of the Emanuel Hospital, but can also be found in many

                                                     Drive. Streets lined with garages lack the visual engagement and security provided when living

                                                     tions are likely to discourage pedestrians and bicyclists.

                                                     duplexes, and small-lot single family homes) have been developed in recent years under the Low-

                                                     units per acre. Average gross density for recent apartment developments is about 22 units per acre.

                                                     for an examination of their relative benefits. This historic pattern offers distinct advantages over

6-8 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Gross residential densities achieved in the historic and contemporary subdivisions tend to be
quite comparable. However, the advantages of narrow lots, especially small ones, are quickly lost
if they are fronted by two- or three-car garages that occupy almost the entire street-frontage.
Figure 6-2 shows the age of Turlock’s housing stock. Homes built before 1960 are concentrated in
Downtown, and to the east, south, and west of Downtown. It is the City’s intention to preserve
the unique visual character and identity of its older neighborhoods, which are often compromised
when property owners, in making changes to their homes or redeveloping, must comply with
contemporary zoning requirements. In particular, parking and setback requirements written for
more contemporary subdivision patterns may result in lower aesthetic quality on smaller lots, or
may be physically impossible to comply with.
Two new policies in the Land Use element (2.5-l and 2.5-m) address these issues by calling for
changes in the zoning ordinance, establishing graduated density requirements and traditional
neighborhood overlay zones. The graduated density requirement acknowledges that in some older
parts of the city, narrow lots are designated for medium and high density development; however,
if these lots were to be individually developed at those densities—and according to today’s devel-
opment standards—the quality of design suffers and developments are less able to meet the needs
of residents and businesses. Therefore, the new standard would tie allowable residential density
to lot dimensions, ensuring that the maximum residential density is only permitted on single
lots over a certain minimum size, or on adjacent lots being developed as a single site. The Tradi-
tional Neighborhood overlay zones are to be established, using Figure 6-2 as a guide, to provide
exceptions to the modern standards for older neighborhoods where compliance would negatively
impact the historic quality and cohesiveness of the neighborhood.
NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT
The General Plan depicts residential growth in the form of neighborhoods, designed and
developed through the master planning process in new growth areas (see Chapter 3). The neigh-
borhoods are planned to contain a mix of uses and housing types and to provide convenient
access to commercial and service functions used on a frequent basis. They will be integrated with
the existing urban development and provide a continuity of street network, bicycle lanes, and
multi-use bike and pedestrian paths. Rather than establishing a “rubber stamp” for neighbor-
hood development, general parameters for land use mix, street design and connectivity, open/
public space, and other urban design principles are defined. By adhering to this policy direction,

new neighborhoods will achieve a high basic standard of design while still developing an individ-
ual character and identity.
Neighborhood Centers
Neighborhoods should have an identifiable center, characterized by a school, park, or similar
public use; and/or local-serving shops and services. Commercial development in neighborhood
centers may have a retail or an office focus. The centers will contain a mix of uses and intensi-
ties that will provide focus and a sense of community to the neighborhoods. They are designed
to encourage walking but are located to be easily accessible from arterial or major collector
streets. Development will be required to have a public orientation and facilitate pedestrian access,
with storefronts facing the street and parking visually minimized. A horizontal mix of uses is
permitted and a vertical mix is encouraged.
For larger neighborhoods (with at least 4,000 households), the neighborhood center may be a
true community commercial area, characterized by an average 10-acre (approximately 110,000
square feet of building area at 0.25 F.A.R.) size retail center will be anchored by a supermar-
ket and/or a drugstore and will contain a variety of other smaller tenants. Neighborhood service
functions may include medical, dental and real estate offices, and the like.
Smaller neighborhoods, or those that are developed in close proximity to an existing community
commercial area (with a grocery store), would not have a large retail development at their core.
Instead, these neighborhood centers would be anchored by a school and park, possibly with small
convenience shops as part of a horizontal mixed use development. Figure 6-3 shows a typical
neighborhood center design and land use distribution.                                                Easily accessible shops, parks, and other amenities
                                                                                                     are important components of new neighborhood

                            Policies
                            Guiding Policies
                            6.2-a	 Develop complete neighborhoods. Encourage new residential growth in the form of
                                   neighborhoods, characterized by a mix of housing types and a well-defined neighbor-
                                   hood center.
                                   The Plan proposes a major portion of residential growth in neighborhoods — areas
                                   that share a common identity — designed and developed through the master planning
                                   process, with a well-defined core or center.
                            6.2-b	 Promote housing type diversity and land use mix. Require diversity of housing types
                                   in each neighborhood and a mix of uses in the neighborhood centers.
                                   Figure 6-4, Illustrative Housing Types, illustrates the range of possible housing types
                                   for the different residential designations in the Plan. While the location, land uses, and
                                   size of centers is motivated by considerations of proximity and walking distances, the
                                   principal purpose is to provide focus and a sense of community to the neighborhoods.
                            6.2-c	 Preserve existing neighborhoods. Preserve the scale and character of established
                                   neighborhoods.
                                   With ample room for expansion, there is a need to preserve established neighbor-
                                   hoods that have historic value or contribute to the character of the City.
                            6.2-d	 Encourage community orientation. Improve the community orientation of new resi-
                                   dential developments.
                                   A community orientation calls for greater attention to the relationship between resi-
                                   dences and shared spaces and does not require sacrifice of privacy or amenities.
6-16 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Implementing Policies
6.2-e	 Master plans for mixed use neighborhoods. Through the process of master planning
       and project approval, ensure that a mix of uses, as described and illustrated in the
       Section 3.2: Land Use and Design of New Growth Areas, is maintained in the neighbor-
       hood centers. Development of a neighborhood center, or part thereof, consistent with
       the uses, mix and intensities described in the Plan, will be required as a condition of
       subdivision approval.
       The intent is to ensure both the provision of non-residential uses as well as phasing of
       uses.
       The illustrative diagrams represent a schematic arrangement of land uses in the neigh-
       borhood centers.
6.2-f	 Mixed use in neighborhood centers. Within neighborhood centers, permit a mix of
       uses on individual properties in the form of horizontal or vertical multi-use develop-
       ments as depicted on the Plan and described in Section 2.2 (Land Use Classifications).
6.2-g	 Use of specific plans/master plans. Require individuals or groups of property owners
       to develop detailed specific plans and master plans for the neighborhood centers to
       meet the objectives of the Plan.
       Detailed policies on the requirements and process of master planning are found in
       Chapter 3.
6.2-h	 Design Principles. Ensure that development in the new neighborhoods is in accor-
       dance with the design principles established in Section 6.8, the policies specific to
       each master plan area established in Section 3.3, and any subsequent guidelines that
       may be established.
6.2-i	 Development standards for housing types. Review the Zoning Ordinance to ensure
       that development standards in residential zones allow for all housing types of the
       appropriate densities to be constructed. For instance, standards in the R-M zone
       (medium density residential) should enable the design of both single family and multi-
       family housing types.
6.2-j	 Areas for Traditional Neighborhood overlay zones. Using Figure 6-2 as a guide to the
       age of housing stock, establish Traditional Neighborhood Overlay Zones in the zoning
       code, focusing on those built before 1950. These zones would demarcate and regulate
                                                                                                CITY DESIGN | 6-17

                                                       6.3	 Street Design and Connectivity
                                                       The grid pattern of streets and short blocks in the older parts of Turlock permit freedom of
                                                       movement, ease of access and a sharing of through-traffic between many routes. In contrast,
                                                       while the superblock and cul-de-sac nature of development in many newer parts of the city
                                                       creates quiet enclaves and smoother traffic flow along the arterials, it also creates inward-look-
                                                       ing neighborhoods, limits movement choice and results in increased traffic volumes on a limited
                                                       number of streets, requiring mitigation measures such as sound walls. Development is needed
                                                       that balances the efficiency and traffic flow capabilities found in the newer parts of the town with
                                                       the sense of proximity and ease of access that result from the older pattern.
                                                       Well-designed and landscaped streets are not only an aesthetic delight, but in a Valley town like
                                                       Turlock, they are essential to shade streets, sidewalks and yards during the hot summer periods.
                                                       Trees and shrubs can also help break winds, filter pollutants, buffer sidewalks and bikeways
                                                       form traffic, screen noise walls and parking, storage, and service areas, and reduce the perceived
                                                       intensity of development. Thoughtfully designed city entrances and gateway zones can help
                                                       evoke a sense of arrival for both residents and visitors.

        designed to maximize connectivity for automobiles, cyclists, and pedestrians.
        Maximum spacing between local streets, or intersections of local streets with larger
        roads, shall be 660 feet. The preferable, typical block size in a residential neighbor-
        hood is in the range of 200 by 600 feet. As a condition of project approval, require
        circulation patterns of all residential and neighborhood centers to conform to
        maximum spacing between through-streets (exclusive of alleys), as depicted in Figure
        6-5 and Section 5.2, unless access conditions and standards prevent their attainment.
        Cul-de-sacs are generally discouraged.
        The intent of these standards is to prevent development of introverted neighborhoods,
        provide flexibility in circulation, and promote access for bicyclists and pedestrians.
        Figure 6–5 illustrates typical and maximum block sizes, and preferred and discouraged
        street connectivity configurations.
Gateway Zones
6.3-f	  Implement the Turlock Beautification Master Plan as it pertains to the “Gateway
        Zones.” These entrances, including West Monte Vista Avenue, Golden State
        Boulevard, West Main Street, Fulkerth Road, and Lander Avenue, can provide
        important “gateway” functions as distinct visual entryways. The road segments
        should receive special landscape treatments to create impressionable and coordi-
        nated entries.

6.3-h	 Street Tree Master Plan. As part of the comprehensive tree-planting and maintenance
       program:
       •	 Periodically update the Street Tree Master Plan. (Resolution 88-130 of the City
          Council).
       See also energy conservation policies in Section 8.2.	
       The Master Plan should be reviewed and updated to include the new streets and
       improvements proposed by the General Plan. It should also consider planting along
       the median for all streets where medians are required. Planting plans should ensure
       adequate shade for bicyclists and pedestrians, especially during the summer months.
       •	 Prepare planting plans conforming to the Master Plan for all new streets and major
          improvements before undertaking construction.
       •	 Adopt a program to plant and maintain trees along streets that lack them.
       •	 Continue to implement the tree-preservation ordinance to allow removal of mature
          trees within public rights-of-way only when they become a safety hazard.
       •	 Establish maintenance districts for the upkeep of trees and landscape buffer areas
          required along public rights-of-way.
       •	 Prepare planting plans and implementation programs for designated “Gateway
          Zones.”
       •	 Use changes in tree species, scale, color and spacing to define neighborhoods
          and articulate the designated hierarchy of expressway, arterial, collector, and local
          streets.
6.3-i	 Improvements to Major Corridors. Prepare and implement a landscape and signage
       plan for major corridors through Turlock, including Golden State Boulevard and others
       recommended in the Beautification Master Plan, balancing design considerations with
       the need for these roads to be remain functional as major circulation routes.
       The design challenge will be to give the strip shade, character, and a sense of enclosure
       without sacrificing the ease of access.

                                   plants that are native to Turlock’s environment and are largely drought-tolerant. Land-
                                   scaping that requires low maintenance and upkeep is also preferred, to keep costs low.
                            6.3-l	 Create “Pedestrian Priority Areas.” Improve the experience of major commercial
                                   streets for pedestrians by designating Pedestrian Priority Areas. Areas to be included
                                   correspond to where vehicle trips may be reduced because of the orientation and
                                   relationship of land uses and street design, such as in Downtown, along existing
                                   pedestrian corridors, and in the mixed use centers of forthcoming master plan areas.
                                   They are shown on Figure 5-4: Properties located within Pedestrian Priority Areas will
                                   have lower Capital Facilities Fees in recognition of their lower contribution to vehicle
                                   trips and impacts on roadway infrastructure.
                                   The Pedestrian Priority Area shall extend approximately one-eighth of a mile (660 feet
                                   – one long block or two short blocks) on either side of the corridor, creating a quarter-
                                   mile-wide zone. These areas should have enhanced facilities to improve the pedestrian
                                   experience, such as:
                                   •	 Adequately wide sidewalks
                                   •	 Benches and shade structures and/or trees located at bus stops
                                   •	 Intersection “bump-outs” to reduce walking distances across streets that are four
                                      lanes or wider
                                   •	 Striped and lit crosswalks, signage, and walk signals at all signalized intersections
                                      and non-signalized intersections with high pedestrian activity
                                   •	 Pedestrian-scale street lighting along sidewalks (maximum height of streetlamps:
                                      12 feet)
                                   •	 Clearly demarcated pedestrian walkways through surface parking lots when these
                                      are located in between the sidewalk and store entrances
                                   •	 ADA-compliant curb ramps for universal access

site planning are touched on in other areas of the General Plan, but this section aims to bring
these concepts together and define a comprehensive approach to minimizing impact on the envi-
ronment during new construction. Policies related to energy and water conservation that can be
achieved through green building are found in sections 3.3 (Infrastructure) and 8.2 (Energy and
Climate Change).

       •	 Providing tree canopy and vegetation to shade a minimum of 50 percent of paved
          surface areas within 5 years
       •	 Utilizing high reflectance materials (materials with a Solar Reflective Index of at
          least 29) in roofs and hardscaped areas
6.4-h	 Solar orientation. When possible, buildings should be oriented such that the use of
       passive and active solar strategies is maximized, in order to promote energy efficiency.
       To achieve ideal solar orientation conditions, the long axis of the building should be
       oriented east-west, within 15 degrees (see Figure 6-6).
6.4-i	 Reduce water demand for landscaping in public and private areas. In order to reduce
       water demand, drought-tolerant, drought-resistant, and native plants, as well as arti-
       ficial turf, should be used for landscaping. Use of natural turf in public areas should be
       restricted to playfields and other high-activity locations.
6.4-j	 Bicycle and pedestrian network. Design sites to facilitate access to parks and other
       community facilities via non-automobile transportation (walking and biking).

                                                       6.5	 Art in Public Places
                                                       Art has outlined the progress, vision and values of cultures and communities through time. It is a
                                                       tangible record of people’s interaction with their surroundings.
                                                       Historically, Public Art gives identity and dimension, revitalizes communities both psychologi-
                                                       cally and economically, and makes cities more human. Providing for art in public places assures
                                                       that the city recognizes its commitment to the physical image of the community and the dignity
                                                       of life.
                                                       The realm of Public Art is broad and can cover the gamut from objects such as sculptures,
                                                       paintings and murals, to exterior treatment of walls or amendments to landscape design such as
                                                       fountains, benches or lights. Provision will be made for attention to already constructed sites in
                                                       need of qualitative improvements, and of support for the performing and musical arts.
                                                       The City establishes policies ensuring the provision and incorporation for art in all public
                                                       building plans. These programs are intended to enhance the environment, provide aesthetic
                                                       and creative solutions to spaces accessible to the public, and enrich the lives of Turlock citizens
                                                       through the stimulating ideas of contemporary artists.
Public art contributes to a city’s character, enlivens
public spaces, and contributes to a unique sense of
place.

                                                      With its roots as a small town that grew up with the Southern Pacific Railroad, Turlock is home
                                                      to a collection of historic structures. Most structures with historic significance are located in
                                                      Downtown, and many of these are residential. Three properties are listed on the National Register
                                                      of Historic Places and the California Register of Historic Places, while many more contribute to
                                                      Downtown’s unique architectural palette and general ambiance. Turlock’s historic resources are
                                                      documented, promoted, and celebrated by the Turlock Historical Society, a nonprofit organiza-
                                                      tion founded in the mid-1990s. In 1999, with the help of a property donation and a State grant,
                                                      the Turlock Museum was founded. While Turlock does not have a specially designated “historic
                                                      district” per se, the general location of the city’s historic structures is within the bounds of the
                                                      Downtown Master Plan area. Therefore, from a planning perspective, historic preservation is
                                                      best and most efficiently addressed through this document. The Downtown Master Plan directly
                                                      informs the Downtown Design Guidelines and Zoning Overlay, which may treat architecturally
                                                      notable historic structures as design inspiration for the surrounding area. It is also possible that as

6.7	 Urban Design
Thoughtful design, community orientation, and consideration of issues broader than the
immediate are essential to creating pleasant and successful communities. Shared objectives
and agreed-upon design principles can help direct individual efforts towards a larger whole —
public spaces and sidewalks that are delightful to be in, buildings that respect neighbors, streets
that are shaded and safe to use, and development integrated with the surroundings rather than
cut-off from them. Urban design principles and policies are interspersed throughout this and
several other elements; this section supplements them and provides an overall reference point for
project design and review. Policies outlined below also form the framework for the city’s Design
Guidelines.

6.7-b	 Community orientation. Provide a community and public orientation for all develop-
       ment to improve public safety.
6.7-c	 Universal access. Accommodate the needs of all pedestrians, bicyclists and mobility-
       challenged persons.
6.7-d	 Neighborhood centers. Establish new neighborhood centers as high-quality
       mixed-use pedestrian-friendly environments, without excluding the automobile.
       These will be required in new growth areas.
       Design emphasis should be on providing a fine-grained environment accommodating
       transit and pedestrian comfort and convenience.
6.7-e	 Pedestrian scale and neighborhood character. Require buildings and signs to be
       scaled to a neighborhood character and designed to encourage pedestrian activity and
       comfort.

                                                           •	 Project edges should be designed to facilitate integration with the surroundings.
                                                           •	 Sound walls should be used only along designated freeways, expressways and
                                                              arterials if needed, and should be completely screened from the outside by shrubs
                                                              and trees located within the project property. Alternatives to sound walls, such as
                                                              landscaped frontage roads, are encouraged where feasible.
                                                           •	 “Dead” uses, such as storage, parking lots, garages, and service areas should be
                                                              located away from public streets and off-site view. In commercial areas, alleys
                                                              should be used to access parking and service uses where feasible.
                                                           •	 Corner lots should locate access driveways on the street with the least traffic

       •	 Planning should anticipate and provide for future local and regional transit service
                                                                                                       Pedestrian/Bicycle Link
          even if the service is not feasible at the time of project plan preparation.
       •	 Development may not be at intensities below the density ranges stipulated in the
          General Plan.
       •	 Bikeways should be provided as designated in Figure 5-3.
       •	 Pedestrian and bicycle connections to through-streets should be provided at the
          end of cul-de-sacs. (See Figure 6-7.)
       •	 Trees and shrubs along streets should buffer sidewalks and bicycle lanes from
          automobiles and be selected and spaced to provide uninterrupted shade to pedes-
          trians and bicyclists.
       •	 Large-size projects in neighborhoods should be broken down by providing
          through-streets and designing smaller units to provide individuality and
          distinction.
6.7-k	 Design for public safety. Promote public safety and welfare through urban design.
       New development should be designed in such a way that emphasizes access and con-
       nectivity, minimizes dead-end streets, provides ample visibility and lighting in public
       spaces, and encourages social interactions.
Neighborhood Centers: Streets and Access
6.7-l	 Fine grain of development. Provide a fine-grained urban environment with streets and
       sidewalks sized and designed to promote outdoor use and walking.
       •	 Provide a network of closely spaced streets in neighborhood centers. Maximum
          spacing between local streets is 660 feet apart; in neighborhood centers, spacing
          closer to 400 feet is preferable. Intersections should be consistent with the access
          standards established in Table 5-6 of the Plan.
       •	 Provide sidewalks along all streets, public and private, except along alleys. Sidewalk
          width, including a curbside planting area for street trees, should be at least 15 feet
          along retail/professional office areas and 10 feet elsewhere in the neighborhood
          centers. Street trees should be planted at a maximum interval of 30 feet.
       •	 Keep the number of private driveways and curbcuts along principal streets to a
          minimum.
       •	 Cul-de-sacs, where connection to other streets is feasible, are not permitted.
       •	 No sound walls shall be used in the neighborhood centers.
                                                                                                                               CITY DESIGN | 6-31

                            Neighborhood Centers: Parking
                            6.7-m	 Design and placement of parking areas. Ensure that parking areas do not impede
                                   pedestrian access and are adequately shaded and screened.
                                   •	 Parking or service areas, screened or otherwise, should not be located between
                                      sidewalks and buildings. Pedestrians should not have to walk through or along
                                      a parking lot to access any building in a neighborhood center, but should be
                                      provided with independent sidewalk access.
                                   •	 Screen all off-street parking, surface or structured, from pedestrian view by trees
                                      and shrubs. Walls should not be used as screening devices.
                                   •	 Provide at least one large-canopy tree per five parking spaces and/or other paved
                                      area to shade cars, reduce glare and screen barren lots.
                                   •	 Provide bicycle parking in neighborhood center parking lots, at an approximate
                                      ratio of one bicycle parking space per 10 automobile parking spaces.
                            Neighborhood Centers: Retail Location
                            6.7-n	 Retail center location and design. Ensure that all retail in a neighborhood center
                                   is contiguous and along streets pedestrians can cross safely and without unduly
                                   impeding traffic.
                                   •	 Neighborhood retail, shown as Community Commercial (or Neighborhood Center
                                      in master plan areas) on the General Plan Diagram at the intersection of two
                                      principal streets, should be oriented to front along the street expected to carry the
                                      lesser amount of traffic.
                                   •	 When neighborhood retail abuts lands designated as Low Density Residential,
                                      special consideration should be given to techniques that properly buffer each use
                                      from the other.	
                            Neighborhood Centers: Design of Structures
                            6.7-o	 Building to street relationship. Require buildings to define street and sidewalk edges,
                                   provide scale to streets, engage pedestrians and promote active use of sidewalks and
                                   outdoor space.
                                   •	 All structures with non-residential uses at the ground level should be built to
                                      provide a continuous frontage along public rights-of-way.
                                   •	 Buildings should be set back from sidewalks only if a pedestrian plaza or patio, not
                                      separated from a sidewalk by a wall, fence, shrubs, etc., is provided.
6-32 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

       •	 Frequent entrances to buildings are desirable. Entrances to the rear of buildings
          from parking courts should not substitute for entrance(s) from a street.
       •	 Blank walls, reflective glass and other opaque surfaces at the ground level along
          street frontages should be avoided. Store interiors should be visible from the
          outside.
       •	 Overhangs, awnings or other devices to shade the sidewalks of building frontage
          are to be provided. Colonnaded walkways, where provided, should be at least 8-
          feet wide clear, and run the entire length of a block, or store front.
       •	 Buildings should be fine-grained and not appear to be large and monolithic. Indi-
          vidual buildings should generally be no larger than 50,000 square feet in size, both
          to provide a small-scale appearance and to prevent location of activities that would
          more appropriately belong in Downtown or elsewhere.
       •	 Diversity in scale, material, color and use is encouraged.
Neighborhood Centers: Uses and Intensities
6.7-p	 Neighborhood center uses. Ensure that uses in neighborhood centers provide for
       residents’ daily needs for goods and services, and are compatible with surrounding
       neighborhood uses, design, and scale. Examples of uses appropriate in neighborhood
       centers are found in Policy 3.2-h. Additionally:
       •	 Mixed-use (horizontal and vertical) developments are encouraged in neighborhood
          centers.
       •	 Automobile-oriented commercial facilities, such as drive-through restaurants and
          gas stations should not be located in neighborhood centers. However, limited
          drive-through facilities may be permitted for financial institutions, pharmacies,
          dry cleaners, and other similar personal service facilities. The appropriate location
          for automobile-oriented facilities is in areas designated Heavy Commercial on the
          General Plan Diagram, not in neighborhood centers.

                                                  6.7-r	 Housing fronting collector streets. To maximize public orientation of streets and
                                                         neighborhoods, housing is encouraged to front onto collector streets. The following
                                                         provisions shall apply:
                                                         •	 Driveway designs that allow for turn-around space (to minimize cars backing out
                                                            onto collector streets) are encouraged.
                                                         •	 Driveways shared by more than one residence are encouraged, to limit the number
                                                            of driveway entrances to the street.
                                                  6.7-s	 Street standard adherence. Ensure that streets are provided consistent with the provi-
                                                         sions of the Plan.
                                                         Arterial and collector streets are depicted on the General Plan Diagram. Local streets
                                                         should meet spacing requirements for through-streets stipulated in Section 6.3 and
                                                         Section 5.2. (See Table 5-6) Intersections design should be in accordance with access
                                                         standards established in Table 5.6. Requirements for dedicated through-streets apply
                                                         to all multifamily and single-family projects.
                                                  6.7-t	 Pedestrian linkages. Develop clear pedestrian linkages between and within
                                                         neighborhoods.
                                                         Each project application should demonstrate connections from the project to the

                                                       •	 Site planning and architectural design should ensure that developments provide
                                                          street frontages with interest for both pedestrians and neighboring residents.
6-36 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

       •	 Sites should not be fenced or walled off with a solid barrier; at least 50 percent
          shall have an open fencing design.
       •	 Buildings should be oriented to public streets and each dwelling must have direct
          visual access to either a public sidewalk, landscaped courtyard or a garden space.
       •	 Some dwellings on each site must front and face the adjoining public street and
          sidewalk.
       •	 If entrance to individual buildings or dwellings is through a courtyard, the
          courtyard should open directly to a public street or sidewalk.
Additional Design Principles for Medium and High Density Residential: Fine-grained
Development
6.7-y	 Visual variety. Promote fine-grained development that provides individuality and dis-
       tinction. Projects should be integrated with surroundings, not closed off from them.
       •	 Developments should generally be broken down into small clusters, independently
          accessible and integrated with the surroundings with direct circulation and visual
          connection between buildings, streets, sidewalks and open space. Superblock–
          style developments with large-scale internal circulation systems are discouraged.
       •	 The number of units sharing a directly accessible building entrance or stairway
          should be limited to eight, except for high density housing and assisted living
          facilities.
Business Park Design Principles
6.7-z	 High quality business park design. Ensure that the Business Park is developed to high
       architectural and landscape standards and limited to non-polluting uses consistent
       with a Business Park setting, as enumerated in the Westside Industrial Specific Plan
       (WISP).

Site Design Standards for Multifamily Attached Gated Communities
6.7-af	 Multifamily gated community location. Multifamily attached gated communities are
        discouraged along local and collector streets; arterial streets are more appropriate
        locations for these developments.
6.7-ag	 Pedestrian and bicycle access. Access for pedestrians and cyclists, separate from
        automobile access, shall be provided.
6.7-ah	 Use of walls. Solid perimeter walls are prohibited unless specifically required for noise
        mitigation by a noise study, prepared by a certified noise consultant under contract to
        the City of Turlock.
6.7-ai	 Edge conditions. In all multifamily developments, perimeter units shall front the
        adjoining local or collector street. Such units may only be separated from the public
        street by a wrought iron fence or similar open security barrier.
6.7-aj	 Barrier style. Perimeter housing may front onto a private frontage street which is
        separated from the public street by a wrought iron fence or similar open barrier (at
        least 50 percent open).
6.7-ak	 Gated community size. A multifamily attached residential gated community shall not
        be larger than one standard city block. Block size shall be determined by the classifica-
        tion of the adjoining through streets, in accordance with General Plan policy 6.4-e.
General Development Standard – Applicable to All Gated Communities
6.7-al	 Gated community location. Gated communities shall not be located where they
        would impede a current or future development of a collector, arterial, or expressway.
        Similarly, gated communities shall not be located where they disrupt an existing or
        future planned public pedestrian pathway, multiuse path or trail, or park.
6.7-am	 Parks and community facilities. No credit shall be given for provision of park space
        that is not accessible to the general public. The developer of the gated community
        shall pay an in-lieu fee for park provision, or provide park space that is accessible to
        the public.

7	          Conservation
The Conservation Element establishes policies for the conservation of natural resources in
Turlock. The Element addresses open space resources; agriculture and soil resources; hydrology
and water quality; biological resources; cultural and historic resources; and mineral resources.
Air quality and greenhouse gases are also highly important environmental issues for Turlock and
are addressed in Chapter 8.
7.1	 Open Space
State planning law (Government Code Section 65560) provides a structure for the preservation of
open space by identifying open space categories. An additional category is proposed for this Plan
to help define the urban edge. These are:
 •	 Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited to, areas that require special
    management or regulation due to hazardous or special conditions. These might include flood-
    prone areas, areas of unstable soil, watersheds, earthquake fault zones, areas of high wildland fire  As a city surrounded by productive, high-value
    risk, and areas required for the protection of water quality.                                         farmland, Turlock must balance resource conservation
                                                                                                          with development considerations.
 •	 Open space for the preservation of natural resources, including, but not limited to, natural veg-
    etation, fish and wildlife, and water resources. 	
 •	 Open space for resource management and production, including, but not limited to, agri-
    cultural and mineral resources, forests, rangeland, and areas required for the recharge of
    groundwater basins.
 •	 Open space for outdoor recreation, including, but not limited to, parks and recreational facili-
    ties, areas that serve as links between major recreation and open space reservations (such as trails,
    easements, and scenic roadways), and areas of outstanding scenic and cultural value.
 •	 Open space for the protection of Native American sites, including, but not limited to, places,
    features, and objects of historical, cultural, or sacred significance such as Native American sanc-
    tified cemeteries, places of worship, religious or ceremonial sites, or sacred shrines located on
    public property (further defined in California Public Resources Code Sections 5097.9 and
    5097.993).
                                                                                                                                      CONSERVATION | 7-1

                            •	 Open space to shape and limit urban form, including, but not limited to, greenbelts, storm
                               drainage swales, and open space corridors specifically established to implement community
                               design goals and objectives.
                           OPEN SPACE INVENTORY
                           Open Space for Public Health and Safety
                           According to the State Office of Planning and Research’s General Plan Guidelines, issues relating
                           to this category of open space include geology and seismicity, slope stability, cliff erosion, flood-
                           prone areas, and wild land fire risk. No open space lands in this category are designated on the
                           General Plan Diagram. The Study Area does not include any known geologic faults or areas of
                           significant known geologic instability. The extremely level topography of the area means that
                           risks associated with slopes are negligible. In addition, no parts of the Study Area have been
                           mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as within the 100-year flood
                           zone. A small portion of the Study Area is within the dam inundation area of the New Exchequer
                           Dam (see section 10.3). However, it is not necessary to set aside any open space lands exclusively
                           to protect public health and safety.
                           Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
                           The Land Use Diagram does not designate any lands specifically for the purpose of preserving
                           natural resources because no plant or animal species or areas of special concern have been located
                           in the Study Area (see discussion in Section 7.4). Pastures, vineyards, row crops, and orchards
                           that are classified as Open Space for Resource Management, however, may serve as habitats or
                           foraging areas for a variety of species.
                           Open Space for Resource Management
                           Resource management categories identified in the General Plan Guidelines include forest lands,
                           agricultural resources, soil resources, groundwater recharge areas, water bodies important for
                           commercial fisheries, and mineral resources. In the Study Area, lands in agricultural production
                           and with potential for agricultural production are by far the most important of these categories
                           of open space. Virtually all non-urbanized portions of the Study Area are in agricultural produc-
                           tion, with almonds; grain, hay and field crops; and truck and berry crops most prevalent. Most
7-2 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

of these lands have been designated as Prime Farmland by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Agricultural lands that are not planned for urban development within the planning period are
designated as “Urban Reserve” on the General Plan Diagram.
The Study Area is dependent on groundwater for water used for all non-irrigation purposes.
Groundwater recharge areas have not been definitively mapped, though the recharge areas
mapped by various sources are in general in the northern and eastern part of the Study Area,
overlapping to a considerable extent with lands designated for Agriculture by the General Plan
Land Use Diagram.
Agricultural open space and related policies are covered in section 7.2 below.
Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
The Land Use Diagram’s park and recreation classification includes existing and planned public
recreation sites (see Table 4-1 for existing parks as of 2010.) Section 4.1 describes the General Plan
program for public parks and recreation, including policies for linear recreation corridors. Facil-
ities for pedestrian and bicycle circulation, which often receive recreational use, are discussed in
Section 5.3. One category of recreational open space is discussed in this chapter: storm drainage
basins that serve a dual use for public recreation.
Dual-Use Storm Drainage Basins
Turlock’s parks system and storm drainage system are related, with dual-use playfields in several
of the City’s drainage basins. This arrangement adds to the City’s recreational open space,
and minimizes the extent to which storm drainage requirements disrupt neighborhoods with               Top: Agricultural land not planned for development

approach, calculating dual-use drainage basins separately from other park land, and providing
standards for each. Standards for parks are in Chapter 4, while standards for dual-use drainage
basins are here. It remains the City’s policy to plan the storm drainage system to maximize utility
of drainage basins for recreational use, and to require that drainage basins be designed and
improved as such to the greatest extent feasible.
                                                                                                                                     CONSERVATION | 7-3

                           Open Space for the Protection of Native American Sites
                           The Land Use Diagram does not designate any open space specifically for the purpose of protect-
                           ing Native American sites. A records search conducted by the Central California Information
                           Center of the California Historic Resources Information System at CSUS identified 38 prop-
                           erties in the Study Area included in the State’s Historic Property Data File. None of these were
                           associated with Native American sites or activities (see Section 7.5.)
                           Open Space to Shape and Limit Urban Form
                           While not defined by the State, the concept of open space to shape and limit urban form has
                           become increasingly important in Turlock. It has long been City policy to maintain Turlock as
                           a free-standing community, whose urban edges do not meet those of neighboring communi-
                           ties. Numerous land uses serve the role of open space shaping and limiting urban form—parks,
                           drainage basins, and in some cases the large rear setbacks associated with Rural or Very Low
                           Density Residential uses.
                           Open space to shape the urban edge is covered in the Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities
                           Element (Chapter 4) and the City Design Element (Chapter 6.)
                           OPEN SPACE PLAN AND ACTION PROGRAM
                           Every city and county in the State is required to prepare, adopt, and submit to the Secretary of
                           the Resources Agency a “local open-space plan for the comprehensive and long-range preserva-
                           tion and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction” (Government Code Section
                           65563). As shown in Table 7-1, components of the Open Space Plan are found in several General
                           Plan elements.
                           The open space plan must contain an “action program” consisting of specific programs which the
                           City intends to pursue (Government Code Section 65564). The action program policies are the
                           implementing policies found in each of the General Plan sections cited in Table 7-1 below.
                           A conservation element is required to address issues relating to the management of natural
                           resources to prevent waste, destruction, and neglect, often resulting in an overlap with the
                           requirements of an open space element. The Open Space and Conservation Element inte-
                           grates requirements of the two State-mandated elements. Topics related to agriculture, soils,

Policies
See also Chapter 4 for policies relating to recreational open space.
Guiding Policies
7.1-a	  Dual-Use Storm Drainage Basins. Continue to coordinate the storm drainage system
        and the park system in new master plan areas, and optimize the use of drainage basins
        as recreational open space.
Implementing Policies
7.1-b	  Requirements for Water Detention. Basins must function effectively for the detention
        (not the retention) of water, and include underground piping for quick removal of water
        following storm events.
7.1-c	  Open Space Character and Functionality. Design all dual-use drainage basins to suit
        a recreational purpose, such as a playing field, or an environmental amenity, such as
                                                                                                    CONSERVATION | 7-5

                                   a water feature. Basins should be varied in shape, and well-landscaped around the
                                   edges. Basins must not have slopes steeper than 1:6. Adequate parking along the
                                   adjacent street or on site shall be provided to accommodate recreational use of the
                                   drainage basin and to avoid impacts to adjacent uses.
                           7.1-d	  Landscaping. Drainage basins that serve a dual use for public recreation must be
                                   entirely landscaped with irrigated turf, with trees along the top of the basin following
                                   City spacing requirements.
                           7.1-e	  Screening of Buildings and Structures. Any pump stations or other utility structures
                                   associated with dual-use drainage basins shall be located and screened to minimize
                                   the visual impact to adjacent uses and from the public right-of-way and shall meet all
                                   other applicable development standards and design guidelines. Any fencing provided
                                   for utility structures shall be fully landscaped in accordance with the standards of
                                   the applicable zoning district, with a minimum three-foot wide landscaped area
                                   provided to support vines on all sides.
                           7.1-f	  Exception for Drainage Basin at Water Quality Control Facility. The storm drainage
                                   basin planned to be developed south of the Turlock Regional Water Quality Control
                                   Facility will have a location that is not suitable for public use or recreation. This basin
                                   may be excepted from the requirement for dual use standards.
                                   When development occurs in the Southwest, this basin would be converted to
                                   dual-use standards.
                           7.2	 Agriculture and Soil Resources
                           Commercial agriculture was established in the region by ranchers as early as the mid-1800s, with
                           cattle and then sheep. The next phase of the area’s agricultural evolution was experimentation
                           with grain, which heralded an extensive switch to cultivation. Farming was successively aided by
                           introduction of the railroad, formation of the Turlock Irrigation District, development of refrig-
                           erated shipping, and construction of the La Grange Dam on the Tuolumne River. Extensive
                           farming gave way to intensive methods, and the cultivation of vineyards, orchards, truck crops,
                           dairy products and poultry were introduced. These activities continue to be an integral part of
                           the region’s economic and social life.
7-6 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

While Turlock’s economic base has expanded substantially beyond farming, the city remains
a community physically and socially characterized by its agricultural past and current farming
activity. Many of Turlock’s major industries are food processors, thus directly tied to agricul-
ture. General Plan policies preserve the belt of agricultural land around city limits, maintaining
Turlock as a stand-alone community within an agricultural region. At the same time, necessary
urban expansion will result in conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. The General Plan
Land Use Diagram and Plan policies define the long-term edge between urban and agricultural
activities and support continuing agricultural production in the Study Area.
AGRICULTURE IN THE STUDY AREA
Agricultural Products
Figure 7-1 shows the crops produced on the farmland in and around the Study Area. Most of this
farmland produces almonds; truck and berry crops; and grain, hay, and field crops.1 Other nuts
and fruits, a category that includes apples, peaches, walnuts, and other orchard products, are also
grown in and around the Study Area. Dairies constitute the remaining predominant agricultural
use around Turlock.
Farmland Classification
The California Department of Conservation uses the Important Farmlands Inventory to classify
farmland into several categories based on soil type and current land use: Prime Farmland,
Farmland of Statewide Importance, Unique Farmland, Farmland of Local Importance, Grazing
Land, Urban and Built-up Land, and Other Land.
 •	 Prime Farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteris-
     tics for crop production. It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to
     produce sustained high yields of crops when managed (including water management) according
     to current farming methods. Prime Farmland must have been used for the production of crops
     within the last three years.
1	 Truck and berry crops include bush berries, tomatoes, melons, onions, peas, potatoes, spinach, flowers, asparagus, and other
   fruits and vegetables that are relatively perishable. Grain, hay, and field crops include barley, wheat, oats, dry beans, flax, corn,
   and safflower, among others. (State of California Department of Water Resources, 2009.)

 •	 Farmland of Statewide Importance is land other than Prime Farmland that has a good combina-
    tion of physical and chemical characteristics for crop production. It must have been used for crop
    production within the last three years.
 •	 Unique Farmland is that which does not meet the criteria for Prime Farmland or Farmland of
    Statewide Importance, but which is currently used for the production of specific high economic
    value crops (as listed in the last three years of California Agriculture, produced by the California
    Department of Food and Agriculture). It has the special combination of location, soil quality,
    growing season, and moisture supply to produce sustained high quality or high yields of a spe-
    cific crop when treated and managed according to current farming practices. Examples may
    include oranges, olives, avocados, rice, grapes, and cut flowers.
 •	 Farmland of Local Importance is either currently producing crops or has the capability to do so.
    It is land other than Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, or Unique Farmland,
    but it may be important to the local economy due to its productivity.
 •	 Grazing Land is that on which the existing vegetation, whether grown naturally or through
    management, is suitable for livestock grazing.
 •	 Urban and Built-up Land is occupied by structures with a building density of at least one unit to
    1.5 acres, or approximately six structures to a 10-acre parcel.
 •	 Other Land includes low-density rural developments; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian areas
    not suitable for livestock grazing, confined livestock, poultry or aquaculture facilities; strip
    mines; borrow pits; and water bodies smaller than forty acres; and vacant and nonagricultural
    land surrounded on all sides by urban development and greater than forty acres.
As shown on Figure 7-2, the majority of land encircling the urbanized area of Turlock is catego-
rized as Prime Farmland. The exception is to the south, where most of the land is Farmland of
Statewide Importance, with significant patches of Unique Farmland, especially in the southeast
quadrant of the Study Area. These classifications do not provide information about actual pro-
ductivity of the land, which is also affected by availability of irrigation water, and the use of
agricultural management techniques. Many valuable commodities (for example, milk) are
produced in areas with relatively poor soils.
                                                                                                         CONSERVATION | 7-9

                            Recognizing that agricultural preservation policies should not be based solely on soil classifica-
                            tion, Stanislaus County’s General Plan Agriculture Element (updated 2007) calls for a definition
                            of “most productive agricultural areas” that takes into account soil ratings as well as other factors.
                            Farmland Conservation
                            Williamson Act
                            The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, also known as the Williamson Act, aims to dis-
                            courage the unnecessary and premature conversion of productive agricultural land to other land
                            uses. Farmers with land under Williamson Act contracts agree not to develop their land for 10
                            years, and in exchange, they are taxed according to the land’s farm income-producing value, as
                            opposed to its “highest and best use.” Contracts are automatically renewed every year; cancella-
                            tion requires “extraordinary circumstances,” payment of a penalty of 12.5 percent of the land’s fair
                            market value, and a public hearing. Local governments receive an annual subvention of foregone
                            property taxes from the State, through the Open Space Subvention Act of 1971.
                            As of 2011, a total of 2,833 acres (35 percent of the total agricultural acreage in the Study Area)
                            were under Williamson Act contracts. Of this land, 467 acres (6 percent of the Study Area’s
                            farmland) were in non-renewal as of 2011, meaning that at the end of their 10-year period, they
                            will not renew their contracts (parcels whose contracts expired between 2006 and 2009 are not
                            counted). Williamson Act parcels are most prevalent in the Study Area’s southwest, which is not
                            planned for urban growth under the General Plan. A considerable amount of farmland in areas
                            designated for growth under the General Plan is also under contract. There are several expiring
                            Williamson Act parcels in the Turlock Regional Industrial Park.
                            Role of the General Plan
                            The General Plan plays an important role in the conservation of farm land, because the City’s
                            growth over the next 20 years will be guided by General Plan policies and the Land Use Diagram.
                            While the General Plan emphasizes infill development, projected growth in the Study Area will
                            also necessitate some conversion of agricultural land. If the General Plan were developed to its
                            full capacity, just over 1,000 acres of agricultural land would be replaced by urban development
                            (including parks and schools.) Land classified as “Prime Farmland” and “Farmland of Statewide
                            Importance” account for almost 90 percent of this land, or 570 and 332 acres, respectively. Much

                            of the farmland that is expected to be urbanized over the next 20 years is inside City limits, mainly
                            in the Turlock Regional Industrial Park, and was designated for development previous to this
                            General Plan. More than 6,400 acres within the Study Area would remain in agricultural use at
                            the end of the planning period. The percent of the Study Area composed of farm land by classifica-
                            tion is shown in Table 7-2, for the present and by the time of General Plan buildout.
                            Economic Impacts of Farmland Conversion
                            In 2011, the price of agricultural land was generally under $100,000 per acre, compared to up to
                            $200,000 per acre for industrial land and $300,000 to $500,000 per acre for centrally-located
                            commercial and residential land in parts of Turlock.2 This price differential, along with the
                            uncertainty of farm income, explains why farmland is vulnerable to conversion to urban uses.
                            Agriculture employed 8.9 percent of the labor force in Stanislaus County in 2007, and 6.5 percent
                            of the labor force in Turlock.3 Agriculture’s overall share of employment is expected to decline
                            over the coming years as non-farm employment in industries such as manufacturing, services,
                            education, and healthcare grows. In absolute terms agricultural employment levels are expected
                            to remain fairly stable, and agriculture will remain an important part of the regional economy.

7-12 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

The average production value from agricultural land was approximately $2,352 per acre in 2009.4
If secondary impacts were to be included, with a high multiplier5 of 5, loss of income associated
with agriculture would be about $11,760 per year for each acre of land converted to other uses. At
this rate, urbanization over the next 20 years of approximately 1,000 acres of agricultural land
contiguous to Turlock’s City limits, consistent with General Plan policies, will result in the loss
of $2.4 million annually, in current dollars, of direct agricultural income, and an estimated $12.2
million including secondary impacts. Economic losses would be offset by the value of urban
development and its multiplier effects, but agricultural productivity in the Study Area would be
diminished.
Soils and Soil Erosion
Soils in the Study Area
A region’s geology ultimately determines the types of soils that cover its surface, and soils have
implications for agricultural productivity, natural hazards, and development potential. Almost
all of the soils in the Study Area are sandy loam or loamy sand, meaning they have high sand
content, low clay content, and low to moderate silt content. According to soil survey information
obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS), three soil types, Dinuba sandy loam, Hilmar loamy sand, and Delhi loamy
sandy, account for two-thirds of the Study Area’s soil.6 Some 23 additional soil types are present
in relatively small amounts. For a more detailed discussion of soils, see the Environmental Impact
Report.
Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is a process by which soil materials are worn away and transported to another area,
either by wind or water. Rates of erosion can vary depending on the soil material and structure,
and the placement and level of human activity. Soil containing high amounts of silt can be easily
eroded, while sandy soils are less susceptible. Erosion is most likely to occur on sloped areas with

5	 The ratio of primary plus secondary economic impacts to primary impacts is termed a “multiplier.”
6	 Dinuba sandy loam, Hilmar loamy sand, and many other soils are further distinguished by additional characteristics, such as soil
   depth, drainage capacity, and salinity. The soil type designator (e.g., DrA) refers to the specific variant.

                                                       is little vegetation. Soil erosion matters for agricultural land because it causes the fertile topsoil to

                                                       Soil erosion potential or susceptibility is identified by the soil’s “K factor,” which indicates a soil’s
                                                       inherent susceptibility to erosion, absent slope and groundcover factors. Values of K range from
                                                       0.05 to 0.43; the higher the value, the more susceptible the soil is to sheet erosion by water.7 In

                                                       soils moderately susceptible to erosion. Good agricultural management is important in conserv-

7-14 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Implementing Policies
7.2-e	 Require Compact Development. Require development at densities higher than typical
       in recent years in order to limit conversion of agricultural land and minimize the urban/
       agricultural interface.
       Refer to Chapter 2: Land Use and Economic Development for more detail on historic
       and proposed development density.
7.2-f	 Annex Land As Needed. Annex land to the City only as it is needed for development
       of designated growth areas, consistent with policies in Chapter 3 and with the City’s
       Annexation Policy. Do not annex agricultural land unless urban development consis-
       tent with the General Plan has been approved.
       The Program specifies that City staff will reject as premature any application proposing
       prezoning and annexation of land that is not contiguous to the City’s existing urban
       limits or that is not within the City’sapproved Sphere of Influence.
7.2-g	 Participation in county-wide agricultural mitigation program. Continue to work
       collaboratively with Stanislaus County and jurisdictions within the county on the
       development of a countywide agricultural mitigation program, which would mitigate
       the loss of Important Farmland to urban development through the required purchase
       of agricultural easements or other similar measures.
7.2-h	 Allow Agricultural Uses to Continue. Where agriculture exists within City limits, allow
       uses to continue until urban development occurs on these properties, including the
       establishment of community gardens serving the immediate neighborhood.
7.2-i	  Support Participation in Williamson Act Program. Support participation in the Wil-
       liamson Act program by Study Area landowners.
       About half of the farmland in the Area is under Williamson Act contract; see discus-
       sion of Williamson Act above. Under the Williamson Act program, farmers agree not to
       develop their land for 10 years in exchange for a lower tax rate, whereby they are taxed
       on the land’s income-producing value, rather than its “highest and best use.”
                                                                                                 CONSERVATION | 7-15

                            7.2-j	 Support Right to Farm. Support the implementation of Stanislaus County’s Agricul-
                                   tural Element and Right-to-Farm ordinance.
                                   The County’s ordinance establishes a number of mechanisms designed to protect
                                   normal agricultural operations from pressures that can be created by urban neighbors.
                            7.2-k	 Create Buffer. Require a permanent buffer to be established between residential and
                                   agricultural activities along the long-term urban edge of Turlock.
                                   See policies in Chapter 6: City Design for buffer standards.
                            7.2-l	 Support Agricultural Industry. Support agricultural industry within the city, while dis-
                                   couraging industrial uses in the unincorporated portions of the Planning Area.
                                   Stanislaus County allows agricultural industry on land designated in its General
                                   Plan for Agriculture. If adjacent or near the city, such industrial activity would blur
                                   the city’s edge and could create demand for annexation and city services. Industrial
                                   development within the city is supported by the provision of industrially-zoned land.
                                   Furthermore, agricultural industries are supported through economic development
                                   programs, cost-of-business advantages, and other aspects addressed in Chapter 2:
                                   Land Use and Economic Development.
                            7.2-m	 Reduce Pollution. Participate in inter-jurisdictional efforts to improve agricultural
                                   practices in order to reduce pollution and health problems associated with particulate
                                   matter production and use of agricultural chemicals.
                                   Projects may be undertaken by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District,
                                   StanCOG, or other organizations.
                            7.2-n	 Minimize Soil Erosion. Require new development to implement measures to minimize
                                   soil erosion related to construction. Identify erosion-minimizing site preparation and
                                   grading techniques in the zoning code.

7.3	 Hydrology and Water Quality
There are no natural defined streams in the Planning Area. Three open irrigation canals, Turlock
Irrigation District (TID) Laterals 3, 4, and 5, pass through the Planning Area from east to west,
spaced two and a half miles apart. There are also several local detention basins distributed through-
out the City, which capture runoff during stormwater events and then discharge it to the canals.
Turlock is located in the Turlock Subbasin of the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin. All of the
City’s current potable water supply comes from a deep groundwater aquifer. The City also uses
shallow groundwater for irrigation of some landscape areas. The City of Turlock is evaluating
a Regional Surface Water Supply Project (RSWSP) that would supply treated Tuolumne River
water from the TID to provide an additional source of potable water.
Because the Planning Area does not have natural streams, and because both surface water and
groundwater in the Planning Area are closely related to the City’s urban water use and stormwa-
ter drainage systems, the General Plan discussion of hydrology and water quality is covered in
Section 3.3 Infrastructure.
Policies
See Section 3.3: Infrastructure for policies regarding protection of water quality, conservation of
groundwater, and development of the water, sewer, and stormwater systems.
7.4	 Biological Resources
Wildlife Habitats
Up until about 150 years ago, Turlock was a part of a larger grass- and marsh land where wild
animals roamed freely. However, Turlock’s eventual agricultural land use and urban develop-
ment have resulted in a general absence of native vegetation in the Study Area. In addition,
the lack of natural waterways and topography contribute to a dearth of habitat. However, agri-
cultural uses do not preclude the use of the land by some species, particularly birds and small
mammals. Orchards act as food sources and migratory corridors for some wildlife; livestock
pastures serve as habitat to rodents and snakes. Detention basins, when holding water, can act
as intermittent water sources and habitat for waterfowl. There are no riparian areas or vernal
                                                                                                      CONSERVATION | 7-17

                            pools in the Study Area—the only large surface-water bodies are irrigation canals and man-made
                            retention basins such as Donnelly Lake.
                            Special Status Species
                            Special-status species are plants and animals that, because of their documented rarity or vulner-
                            ability to various causes of habitat loss or population decline, are recognized by federal, state, or
                            other agencies. Some of these species receive specific protection that is defined by federal or state
                            endangered species legislation. Others have been designated as “sensitive” on the basis of adopted
                            policies and expertise of state resource agencies or organizations with acknowledged expertise, or
                            policies adopted by local government agencies to meet local conservation objectives.
                            According to the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB), two special-status species
                            are presumed to be present in the Study Area, as shown on Figure 7-3. Swainson’s hawk is listed
                            as Threatened in the state of California. Swainson’s hawk usually breeds in stands along riparian
                            areas, and forages in grasslands, pastures, hay and alfalfa fields, and row cropland.8 While the
                            Study Area does not contain land typical for the hawk’s breeding and nesting, it is presumed to
                            be present.
                            The Hoary bat roosts in trees, and hunts over open areas or lakes. It is migratory, and its North

                            be present along Monte Vista Avenue west of Highway 99 (see Figure 7-3). The Hoary bat is not
                            listed on Federal or State registers or identified by as a Species of Special Concern by the Califor-
                            nia Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), but it is monitored in the CNDDB.
                            Other species may occur within the Study Area, and are presumed to exist in the vicinity. Table
                            7-3 summarizes the sensitive plant or animal species that may occur in the Study Area, based on a
                            search of the CNDDB for the four USGS quadrangles encompassing the Study Area. Portions of
                            the study Area may provide potential habitat, and pastures, vineyards, row crops, and orchards in
                            the Study Area may provide foraging areas for some of these species.
                            The Valley elderberry longhorn beetle is native to riparian forests of the Central Valley, and is

federal Endangered Species Act. With its lack of suitable habitat, the species is not likely to be
present in the Study Area.
Five other animal species present in the vicinity of the Study Area do not have legal status but
are considered species of Special Concern. The hardhead is a fish, and lacks suitable habitat in
the Study Area. The silvery legless lizard lives in loose sandy soil or leaf litter, typically in dunes,
an environment not characteristic of the Study Area. The tricolored blackbird, the western pond
turtle, and the Suisun song sparrow rely on riparian, pond, or marsh habitats, which are present
in the region but not in the Study Area.
Two species of native vegetation, Merced Monardella and San Joaquin Valley Orcutt Grass, were
identified as potentially existing in the Study Area. The California Native Plant Society (CNPS)
presumes the Merced Monardella to be extinct; San Joaquin Valley Orcutt Grass is listed as
threatened by the federal government and endangered in California. Due to the prevalence of
urban and agricultural uses in the Study Area, it is more likely that this grass species is present in
the general region but not in the Study Area.
                                                                                                         Swainson’s hawk is one of two special-status species

Guiding Policies
7.4-a	 Increase Biological Diversity. Make efforts to enhance the diversity of Turlock’s flora
        and fauna, including street trees.
Implementing Policies
7.4-b	 Sensitive Site Planning. Protect mature trees and natural vegetation and features
        wherever feasible in new development areas.
7.4-c	 Urban Trees. Protect and expand Turlock’s urban forest through public education,
        sensitive maintenance practices, and a long-term financial commitment adequate
        to protect these resources. Continue to require the planting of appropriately-spaced
        street trees in new development areas.
7.4-d	 Special Review if New Information Becomes Available. Establish environmental
        review procedures, such as site reconnaissance and certification by a biologist, as
        part of the project development application process if new information to support
        existence of a Special Status species becomes available.

7-22 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

7.5	 Cultural and Historic Resources
One objective of the General Plan is to preserve community assets, which include sites with
cultural significance. These cultural resources include sites, buildings, structures, or objects
that may have archaeological, paleontological, historical, cultural, or scientific significance.
The Study Area has a rich history of human habitation, including primarily the Yocut tribe of
Native Americans. Related to more recent history, a substantial inventory of historically signifi-
cant buildings in Turlock has been developed, which contribute to the City’s visual interest and
unique sense of place. The existence of cultural resources of all varieties in Turlock underscores
the need for policies to protect the resources of which we are aware and to guide actions if and
when additional resources are discovered in the future.
Resource Identification
State laws (notably CEQA) protect archaeological and other cultural resources. In order to
preserve historic resources, the State has formed the State Historical Resources Committee that
conducts the State Historic Resource Inventory and maintains the California Register of Historic
Resources. This body also makes recommendations for the National Register of Historic Places.
Tribal Consultation
Passed in 2004, Senate Bill (SB) 18, now Government Code Section 65351 and 65352, establishes
a procedure to help tribes and jurisdictions define tribal cultural resources and sacred areas more
clearly and incorporate protection of these places earlier into the General Plan process. The SB 18
process mirrors the federal 106 Review process used by archaeologists as part of the environmen-
tal review conducted under NEPA. While not a component of CEQA review per se, the Lead
agency is required to request consultation with responsible and trustee agencies, such as NAHC
and neighboring tribes, during the initial study and EIR process.
In December 2008, a letter to the Native American Heritage Commission requested a review of
the sacred lands file applicable to the Study Area and a list of Native American contacts within
the region. The sacred lands file did not contain any known cultural resources information for
the immediate Study Area.

                                                        to qualify).
                                                        There are three properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the California
                                                        Register of Historic Places in Turlock. The oldest of these is the Turlock Carnegie Library, built

                                                        by fire. Also on the National and State Register is the Turlock High School Auditorium and
                                                        Gymnasium, a handsome example of the Mission-Spanish Revival style, from 1925. Third, the
                                                        site of the Turlock Assembly Center, at the Stanislaus County Fairgrounds, is a nationally- and
                                                        state-listed historic property and is also a California Historical Landmark. In the summer of
                                                        1942, the Fairgrounds was used as an “assembly center” where 3,699 Japanese-Americans were
                                                        imprisoned before being moved to longer-term relocation sites. Later, the site was used as a U.S.
                                                        Army Rehabilitation Center. While many of the Fairgrounds buildings from that time remain,
                                                        there is no evidence of Assembly Center structures, and no historical marker.

Turlock High School Auditorium and Gym, built in 1925,
are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Carnegie Library, gutted by fire in 2006, has been

                            The Study Area is underlain by two geologic units, the Modesto Formation and Riverbank
                            Formation. Both are comprised of alluvial fan deposits which include sand, gravel, silt, and clay.
                            The Modesto Formation is estimated to range in age from about 9,000 to less than 100,000 years
                            old, while the Riverbank Formation is estimated to range from about 130,000 to 450,000 years
                            old.
                            The Study Area does not include any known historic or current mining operations other than
                            minor excavations for fill material, which is not considered a significant resource. The only sig-
                            nificant mineral commodities that might be found in the two formations mentioned above are
                            sand and gravel for road and building construction. The sources of most sand and gravel used
                            in the road and construction industry in the Study Area are from mining operations along the
                            Tuolumne River and Merced River.

8	          Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases
Good air quality is essential for protecting public health and ensuring a high quality of life, and
a review of air pollution and strategies for improvement is an essential component of the General
Plan. This Element complies with AB 170 (an update to Government Code Section 65302.1) by
providing data on air quality attainment and standards for criteria air pollutants; local, district,
state, and federal programs and regulations; and a comprehensive set of guiding and implement-
ing policies.
The Element also describes climate change and its potential impacts on the city and region,
providing an overview of climate change regulations, Turlock’s energy use and efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hazardous air pollutants and GHGs are generated by many
of the same sources, and so efforts to reduce emissions of one type are also relevant to the other.
8.1	 Air Quality
Climate and Atmospheric Conditions
San Joaquin Valley Air Basin
Turlock is located in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB), a largely flat area bordered on
the east by the Sierra Nevada Mountains; on the west by the Coast Ranges; and to the south by
the Tehachapi Mountains. The SJVAB is approximately 250 miles long and an average of 35 miles
wide, making it the second-largest air basin in California. Marine air flows eastward through
gaps in the Coast Range at the Golden Gate and Carquinez Strait. The mountain ranges ringing         Air pollutants in the Central Valley come from a variety

highly susceptible to pollutant accumulation over time.1 Air quality in the Valley is compromised
both by pollutants transported eastward from the urbanized Bay Area and by local emissions.

                           Wind Conditions and Air Pollutants
                           During winter, low wind speeds contribute to high concentrations of certain air pollutants. In the
                           summer, winds usually originate from the north end of the basin and flow in a south-southeast-
                           erly direction through the valley, through the Tehachapi pass and into the neighboring Southeast
                           Desert Air Basin. Persistent summertime inversions – when a layer of cool, marine air is trapped
                           below a mass of warmer air above – prevent vertical dispersion of air pollutants.
                           Climate
                           The entire SJVAB has an “Inland Mediterranean” climate, characterized by hot, dry summers
                           and cooler winters. The region averages over 260 sunny days a year, and around 12 inches of
                           rainfall annually. High daily summer temperatures reach an average of 95 degrees Fahrenheit,
                           while average daily lows in winter are around 45 degrees. Average high temperatures in the winter
                           are in the 50s. In winter, temperatures are very rarely below freezing, but can be in the high 30s
                           and 40s on days with particularly heavy fog or low cloud cover.
                           High temperatures in the summer contribute to ozone formation. In addition, temperature
                           inversions in the valley air basin also affect pollutant dispersion. Vertical dispersion of pollut-
                           ants is limited by persistent temperature inversions. Temperature inversions occur when a layer of
                           warm air traps cooler air beneath it. Air above and below the inversion base does not mix because
                           of differences in air density; warm air above the inversion is less dense than the cool air below,
                           which prevents air exchange. Ozone and its precursors will mix and react to produce higher con-
                           centrations under an inversion, and inversions trap and hold directly emitted pollutants like
                           carbon mooxide (CO). Concentrations of particulates are also directly related to inversion layers
                           due to the limitation of mixing space. Temperature inversions are more persistent during the
                           winter months.2
                           Sources of Air Pollution
                           In general, air pollutants in the Valley are generated by motor vehicles, farming operations, indus-
                           trial activities, wood burning, and windblown dust. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control
                           District (SJVAPCD or the Air District) maintains an Emissions Inventory, which estimates the

total volume of air pollutants generated each day by approximately 100 “areawide” sources, point
sources such as factories, gas stations and power plants, and mobile sources (vehicles).
Cars and trucks are responsible for most of the smog-producing pollutants (nitrogen oxides and
reactive organic gases) in the air and two-thirds of the carbon monoxide. Farming is the major
source of organic gases, including reactive organic gases that contribute to smog. Other areawide
sources, especially dust from roads and construction, produce most of the particulate air pollut-
ants. Fuel combustion in factories, food processing plants, electric utilities, and similar sources
accounts for more than half of sulfur oxide production.
The following sections discuss the different types of air pollution, and the different types of mon-
itoring and regulations that apply. They include:
 •	 Criteria Air Pollutants
 •	 Toxic Air Pollutants
 •	 Regional Air Quality Management
 •	 Air Quality and Transportation Planning
 •	 Local Government Responsibilities
Criteria Air Pollutants
As required by the Federal Clean Air Act, US EPA has established National Ambient Air Quality
Standards for several “criteria pollutants” to protect public health and welfare. California has
adopted more stringent ambient air quality standards for most of the criteria air pollutants
(referred to as State Ambient Air Quality Standards or State standards) and regulates additional
pollutants as well.                                                                                  Cars and trucks are responsible for most of the smog-

                           California Air Resources Board and the California Clean Air Act
                           The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is responsible for establishing and reviewing Cali-
                           fornia ambient air quality standards, developing and managing the California SIP, and securing
                           approval of this plan from US EPA. The California Clean Air Act of 1988 focuses on attainment
                           of the state ambient air quality standards, which, for certain pollutants and averaging periods,
                           are more stringent than the comparable federal standards. In addition, California has established
                           State ambient air quality standards for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibility-

                           Attainment of Air Quality Standards
                           The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin is considered in attainment for Federal and state standards for
                           carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead. The region is designated a “severe
                           non-attainment” area for the state 1-hour standard for ozone. The valley is also in non-attainment
                           of the state 8-hour ozone standard, and is an “extreme nonattainment” area for the federal eight-
                           hour ozone standard. The Air Basin is in non-attainment of both state and federal standards for
                           fine particulate matter (PM2.5). It has recently achieved federal attainment status for respirable
                           particulate matter (PM10), but fails to attain California’s standards.
                           The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District operates a regional monitoring network
                           to measure ambient concentrations of the six criteria pollutants identified above. One of the Dis-
                           trict’s monitoring stations is located on South Minaret Avenue in Turlock, providing a good
                           gauge for air quality in the Study Area. Ozone levels in Turlock have exceeded state standards for
                           both the one-hour and eight-hour periods in each of the past five years. Turlock’s air also violated
                           state standards for respirable particulate matter (PM10) and surpassed contemporary standards
                           for PM2.5 in each of these years.
                           Table 8-2 shows the Study Area’s attainment status with respect to the national and State ambient
                           air quality standards for criteria pollutants. A table showing measured pollutant concentrations
                           from the Turlock monitoring station over the last five years and ambient air quality standards for
                           these criteria pollutants is found in the General Plan EIR.

                           Toxic Air Pollutants
                           The ambient background of toxic air contaminants (TACs) is the combined result of many
                           diverse human activities, including emissions from gasoline stations, automobiles, dry cleaners,
                           industrial operations, hospital sterilizers, and painting operations. Toxic pollutants are regulated
                           at the federal and State levels. The primary concern is risk of harm to public health.
                           Federal Clean Air Act
                           National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants developed by EPA in accordance
                           with Title III of the 1990 federal Clean Air Act Amendments regulate “major source” facilities
                           that emit large quantities of toxic air contaminants (TACs). These rules require that emissions be
                           reduced using the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT).

State Regulations
AB 1807 (Tanner Bill)
As directed by AB 1807, the Tanner Bill, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) identi-
fies the most important toxic pollutants by considering risk of harm to public health, amount or
potential amount of emissions, manner of usage of the substance, persistence in the atmosphere,
and concentration in the outdoor air. CARB regulates mobile emissions sources in Califor-
nia, such as construction equipment, trucks, and automobiles, and oversees the activities of air
quality management districts, which are organized at the county or regional level. Air districts
regulate toxic air contaminants from stationary sources through their permit processes. Mobile
sources of toxic air contaminants are regulated indirectly by the State and EPA through vehicle
emissions standards and fuel specifications.
Cities play a role in reducing public exposure to TACs by enforcing zoning ordinances and
ensuring proper buffer zones between stationary sources that emit toxic contaminants and
sensitive receptors located down wind.
AB 2588 (Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Act)
In 1987, the California State legislature enacted, through Assembly Bill 2588, the Air Toxics Hot
Spots Information and Assessment Act, which requires companies in California to provide infor-
mation to the public about emissions of toxic air contaminants and their possible impact on
public health. The Air District implements this act through the local Air Toxics “Hot Spots”
Program.
Hazardous Pollutants in the San Joaquin Valley
Both the Air District and the State monitor hazardous air pollutants and share emissions data
through the California Toxics Inventory (CTI). According to the District’s 2007 Annual Report
on the District’s Air Toxics Program, the toxic pollutants most prevalent in the Valley are diesel
particulate matter (averaging 7,695 tons per year); formaldehyde (4,396 tons); benzene (1,789
tons); and acetaldehyde (1,761 tons).
Over half (52 percent) of hazardous air pollutants are emitted from mobile sources (cars, trucks,
buses, farm and construction equipment). These sources are primarily regulated by the State and
EPA, though the Air District also has incentive programs to reduce mobile source emissions.
                                                                                                   AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES | 8-9

                            About 30 percent of hazardous pollutants come from “areawide” sources such as roads. About
                            one fifth of hazardous air pollutants come from point sources that are directly regulated by the
                            Air District.
                            The Air District keeps detailed information on emissions from about 200 “point sources” in
                            the San Joaquin Valley, including Turlock’s Walnut Energy Center; California Dairies; Purina
                            Mills; Associated Feed; Evergreen Beverage Packaging; Foster Farms; Varco Pruden Buildings;
                            West Coast Equipment; and Cargill. The District also estimates industry-wide emissions for
                            sectors characterized by many small facilities such as dry cleaning operations. Facilities that are
                            determined to pose a significant risk to the public are required to submit plans to bring emissions
                            below significant levels. The Air District reports that all sixteen facilities determined to pose a
                            health risk due to toxic emissions have reduced emissions so that risks to the public are no longer
                            considered significant.3
                            Airborne Toxics Control Measures
                            The State Air Resources Board and the SJVAPCD have both made major efforts in recent years to
                            reduce risks posed by air pollution by adopting control measures for airborne toxics. Since diesel
                            particulate matter has been found to pose the greatest risk, control measures for diesel engines
                            have been a major focus. State and District rules adopted since 2004 include requirements for Best
                            Available Control Technology (BACT) in new or replaced stationary diesel engines; stringent
                            standards for off-road diesel vehicles (tractors, construction equipment); stringent standards for
                            diesel vehicles that are part of public or utility fleets; and a measure to limit idling by commer-
                            cial diesel trucks.

                            would be more effective than management through each county within that basin. Most met-

districts. The SJVAPCD has jurisdiction over air quality matters in the eight counties that make
up the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin.
Air districts are responsible for monitoring the concentration of pollutants, regulating stationary
sources of pollution (industrial facilities), and developing air quality plans to demonstrate how
the Air Basin will meet air quality standards. These plans are expected to feature transportation
control measures (TCMs) and other programs to reduce mobile source emissions. As a result,
it is important for air districts to work closely with cities, counties, and regional transportation
planning agencies.
Senate Bill (SB) 709 - State of California
SB 709 amends the Health and Safety Code to give the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control
District more responsibility in terms of permitting, fee implementation, and agricultural assis-
tance. It gives the District the authority to require the use of best available control technology for
existing emissions sources, promote cleaner-burning alternative fuels, and encourage and facili-
tate ridesharing. The Billl also amends the Vehicle Code to allow the District to adopt a surcharge
on motor vehicle registration fees.
Regional Air Quality Plans
As noted above, if an air basin does not meet federal or state standards for a pollutant, the
Air District is required to prepare and adopt air quality attainment plans demonstrating how
standards will be attained. Attainment plans must be approved by CARB, and by the US EPA if
federal standards are involved.
Ozone
2007 Ozone Plan
The Air District adopted the 2007 Ozone Plan to address the Valley’s nonattainment of 8-hour
standards for ozone. This plan was approved by CARB in June of 2007. It aims to reduce nitrogen
oxides (NOx), precursors to both ozone and particulate matter (PM), by 75 percent by 2023 to
achieve the federal health-based standard for ozone. This would come on top of the 42 percent
reduction in NOx in the Valley between 1990 and 2005, largely attributable to effective District
rules.
                                                                                                       AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES | 8-11

                            The 2007 Ozone Plan relies on a combination of regulatory measures and incentives, to be
                            carried out by the Air District, the State, and local jurisdictions. The Plan commits to new rules
                            for stationary sources, which already face strict emissions regulations in the San Joaquin Valley.
                            Larger reductions must come from mobile sources, which are responsible for 80 percent of NOx
                            in the Valley air. Here, State and Federal controls are critical for the success of the Plan. These
                            include annual inspections for older vehicles and high-mileage vehicles, and cleaner heavy-duty
                            trucks. District incentives are expected to speed the turnover of the vehicle fleet and the presence
                            of vehicles built according to new, stringent tail-pipe standards.
                            Particulate Matter
                            2007 PM10 Plan
                            The Air District has produced a series of plans to bring the Valley into attainment of federal
                            standards for respirable particulate matter (PM10). In 2006 the District’s monitoring data showed
                            that the Valley had attained national standards for PM10, and the following year it submitted the
                            2007 Maintenance Plan and Request for Redesignation as an attainment area. EPA approved the
                            maintenance plan in September 2008, and redesignated the San Joaquin Valley as an attainment
                            area for PM10.
                            As part of the 2003 PM10 Plan, the eight metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the
                            San Joaquin Valley adopted a set of Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) to reduce
                            emissions from vehicles. These measures remain in effect in the State Implementation Plan (SIP),
                            because analysis of RACM for subsequent plans has determined that additional control measures
                            would not substantially advance attainment of air quality standards.
                            2008 PM2.5 Plan
                            Also in 2008, the District adopted the 2008 PM2.5 Plan and submitted it to EPA. The Plan sets
                            a course for the Air Basin to achieve both federal and state standards for fine particulate matter
                            (2.5 micron diameter or smaller.) It builds on the strategy and control measures developed for the
                            2007 Ozone Plan, placing a similar emphasis on reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. The Plan
                            notes that fine particulate matter emissions in the Valley have been decreasing due to success-
                            ful regulatory efforts, and concludes that the Valley can attain the national standard for annual
                            PM2.5 exposure by 2014.

Federal Regulations
Federal Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act outlines requirements for ensuring that federal transportation plans,
programs, and projects conform to the State Implementation Plan’s purpose of eliminating or
reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air quality standards.
Transportation planning agencies must demonstrate that Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs)
conform with air quality plans, and RTPs and Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs)
that require federal funding or approval must be included in the SIP emissions budget.
Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users
(SAFETEA-LU)
SAFETEA-LU, building on previous federal transportation funding acts, has guided federal
transportation investment since 2005. SAFETEA-LU incorporates the Congestion Mitiga-
tion and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program, which provides funding to State and
local governments for projects and programs that support air quality improvements. Funds are
targeted to areas that are or have been in nonattainment of federal air quality standards. SAF-
ETEA-LU also continues funding for the Transportation Enhancements (TE) program, which
provides a funding source for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure and other non-traditional
roadway improvements which may advance air quality goals.
State Regulations
Assembly Bill (AB) 32: California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006
AB 32 requires the reduction of statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by the

                            SB 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, requires regional
                            transportation planning agencies to develop a Sustainable Communities Strategy to reduce
                            vehicle miles travelled and to achieve greenhouse gas reduction targets for cars and light trucks.
                            By reducing vehicle-miles travelled, the Sustainable Communities Strategy also affects a major

                            planning for the Study Area. The 2011 Regional Transportation Plan, adopted in July 2010,
                            guides the allocation of Federal and State funds to transportation projects in Stanislaus County.
                            The RTP is a long-term strategy for accommodating growth with transportation investments.
                            The Plan is required to evaluate regional environmental effects, and to demonstrate conformity
                            with the transportation emissions “budgets” in San Joaquin Valley air quality plans. Since 1992,
                            the eight regional transportation agencies in the San Joaquin Valley have had a memorandum of
                            understanding (MOU) with the Air District which is meant to ensure a coordinated approach
                            throughout the Valley, and to help comply with State and federal Clean Air Acts.
                            The 2011 RTP observes the guiding principles established for the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint in
                            its selection of Tier I projects, and places increased emphasis on alternate transportation modes.
                            With the passage of SB 375 (see above), the next RTP also must include a “Sustainable Communi-
                            ties Strategy” that would allow the region to meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

                            The San Joaquin Valley Blueprint Plan is a region-wide effort to develop a land use and trans-
                            portation plan based on “smart growth” principles. Funded by the State of California and the
                            San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, the process brings together eight metropoli-
                            tan planning organizations (MPOs) to develop a comprehensive growth management strategy
                            meant to guide local jurisdictions as they update their general plans.

Local Government Responsibilities
As discussed above, air quality management districts are responsible for regulating stationary
emissions sources at facilities within their geographic areas, monitoring ambient air quality, and
preparing the air quality plans required under the Federal Clean Air Act and California Clean
Air Act. Implementation of many of the Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) and other
strategies in these plans is the responsibility of cities, counties, and Councils of Government.
Local government responsibilities for air quality include:
 •	 Land Use Planning: carrying out policies in this General Plan that support air quality improve-
    ment, including higher housing densities and mixed uses
 •	 Environmental Review: reviewing and mitigating the environmental impacts of development
    projects
 •	 Transportation: developing and maintaining the transportation infrastructure in the commu-
    nity, including transit systems and bicycle and pedestrian networks
 •	 Local Programs: implementing local air quality programs such as commute-based trip reduc-
    tion, ridesharing, and promotion of fuel-efficient vehicles
Land Use Planning
Local governments have jurisdiction over local land use, and are required to prepare general
plans that set forth long-range goals for development, infrastructure investment, resource protec-
tion, and other subjects. The success of the sustainable regional planning efforts will depend on
land use planning that supports shorter vehicle trips and alternative travel modes. Reducing air
pollutants from vehicles will require that cities undertake more compact development patterns.
Among the primary goals of this General Plan is to establish a compact land use pattern and
walkable new neighborhoods.

                            The General Plan Update is funded in part by Smart Valley Places, a program of the Califor-
                            nia Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley. The program brings together 14 cities, 4 non-profit
                            organizations, CSU-Fresno, and the San Joaquin Valley Policy Council to implement the smart
                            growth principles of the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint.
                            Smart Valley Places was awarded a competitive Sustainable Communities Regional Planning
                            Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Grants are spe-
                            cifically targeted to support regional planning efforts that take on the interrelated challenges of
                            economic competitiveness; access to opportunity; energy use and climate change; and public
                            health and environmental impact.
                            The grants are part of an initiative, the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, that brings
                            together the three agencies whose programs most directly impact the physical form of commu-
                            nities—HUD, the Department of Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It
                            recognizes the following “Livability Principles:”

                             •	 Value communities and neighborhoods
                            This General Plan update intends to establish a compact land use pattern and walkable new
                            neighborhoods, while reinforcing downtown and facilitating economic development. As rec-
                            ognized by the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, there are critical linkages between
                            compact and walkable land use patterns; a transportation system that enables short trips and
                            travel by other means; and improved air quality.

Assembly Bill (AB) 170 - State of California
In 2003, the State adopted Assembly Bill (AB) 170, which requires cities and counties in the San
Joaquin Valley to address air quality in their general plans. Specifically, general plans should
describe local air quality conditions and attainment status; summarize applicable air quality reg-
ulations; and include policies and implementation measures to achieve air quality improvements.
This General Plan is intended to fulfill the requirements of AB 170.
Environmental Review
The Air District has prepared guidance documents to aid local governments in performing envi-
ronmental reviews, including:
 •	 Air Quality Guidelines for General Plans
 •	 Guideline for Assessing and Mitigating Air Quality Impacts
 •	 Environmental Review Guidelines
Transportation Infrastructure
Regional transportation plans are required to conform to the air quality goals of the State Imple-
mentation Plan (SIP). It is the responsibility of regional transportation planning agencies to
make this conformity finding. Local governments in turn must ensure that their own invest-

8.1-f	 Plant and Maintain Trees in Streets and Parks. Adopt a comprehensive tree-plant-
       ing and maintenance program that recognizes the effect of air pollutants on trees and
       the role trees can play in removing particulate matter and gaseous pollutants. Provide
       a viable financing program, particularly in older neighborhoods that are not in a
       landscape and lighting assessment district.
       See also policies in Sections 5.2: Roadway Network, Standards and Improvements and
       6.3: Street Design and Connectivity relating to street trees.
       Studies have shown that immediately adjacent to arterial streets, the lead content of
       air can be about 15 times as high as “normal.” Hardy trees, or those adapted to such
       conditions, are likely to do much better over time with less care than trees that are
       unsuited.
       Rows of trees planted close together and selected and spaced to provide a buffer
       between the streets and the surrounding areas (such as by a combination of low and
       high branching trees planted in alternate rows) can be effective in filtering fumes and
       particulate matter.
                                                                                                    Street trees filter fumes and particulate matter, and

       standards between trees. Spacing standards vary from 40 to 60 feet for all streets on
       the list; in older areas, such as along Sycamore Street, tall trees are planted as close as
       20 feet apart.
       Shade trees also reduce radiation heating (the “heat island effect,”) helping to cool the
       urban environment and reduce peak energy use, and consequently reduce both ozone
       formation and greenhouse gas production.
8.1-g	 Reduce Roadway Dust. Improve City roads to reduce dust to the greatest extent
       feasible by planting shoulders and medians. Dust from roadways contributes to PM10
       pollution.
8.1-h	  Protect Sensitive Receptors from Toxic Air Emissions. For all new development,
       maintain a minimum 300-foot overlay zone on either side of Highway 99 within the
       Study Area to protect sensitive receptors from toxic air emissions, with the goal of
       providing a 500-foot buffer. Within this overlay, avoid approval of new sensitive land
       uses, and for those projects permitted, require site-specific project design improve-
       ments (such as higher-performance windows and HVAC systems) in order to reduce
       public health risks associated with poor air quality in these locations.
                                                                                                   AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES | 8-19

                                     Sensitive receptors are those segments of the population most susceptible to poor
                                     air quality, such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing serious health
                                     problems affected by air quality. Land uses where sensitive receptors are most likely
                                     to spend time include, but are not limited to, hospitals and other medical facilities,
                                     schools and school yards, senior centers, child care centers, parks and playgrounds,
                                     and residential communities. In traffic related studies, additional non-cancer health
                                     risk attributable to proximity was seen within 1,000 feet and was strongest within
                                     300 feet. California freeway studies show about a 70 percent drop-off in particulate
                                     pollution levels at 500 feet.4
                            8.1-i	   Protect Residential Uses from Noxious Odors. Continue the present policy of not per-
                                     mitting any residential uses within a one-half mile radius of the Turlock Regional Water
                                     Quality Control Facility. Require that any new potential odor source locating within
                                     project screening trigger levels of sensitive receptors, as established by the SJVAPCD,
                                     undertake a detailed odor analysis.

                            8.1-j	   Support Indirect Source Review Program. Support the San Joaquin Valley Air
                                     Pollution Control District in implementing its indirect source review program to reduce
                                     emissions of NOx and PM10 from new development projects. Under ISR, projects will
                                     be required to estimate off-site emissions and to pay a fee to the District to mitigate
                                     these emissions. Other General Plan policies encourage or require new development
                                     to have qualities that mitigate air quality impacts and consequently lower Indirect
                                     Source fees. These include bicycle lanes, mixed uses, cleaner construction vehicles,
                                     and superior energy efficiency.
                                     City Staff reviews new development projects for air quality impacts and refers projects
                                     to the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for comments.
                            8.1-k	 Air Quality Improvement Fee. In the Capital Facilities Fee (CFF) program, establish a
                                     fund to collect a fee to be paid by all new development to assist in the funding of local
                                     projects that contribute to the enhancement of air quality.
                                     The City of Turlock’s Air Quality Trust Fund, adopted in 1993, was applied to the

8.1-l	 Use Air District Guidance in Environmental Review. Continue to use the San Joaquin
       Valley Air Pollution Control District’s Guide for Assessing and Mitigating Air Quality
       Impacts for determining and mitigating project air quality impacts and related thresh-
       olds of significance for use in environmental documents. Coordinate with the Air
       District, project applicants, and other interested parties, during pre-development con-
       sultation and negotiation over CEQA preparation.
8.1-m	 Minimize Roadway Dust. Require all access roads, driveways, and parking areas
       serving new development to be constructed with materials that minimize particulate
       emissions and are appropriate to the scale and intensity of use. To balance the goals of
       dust reduction and water infiltration, encourage the use of permeable paving or well-
       maintained gravel for parking spaces.
8.1-n	 Construction-Related Air Emissions Impacts. Continue to require mitigation measures
       as a condition of obtaining permits to minimize dust and air emissions impacts from
       construction. Require contractors to implement dust suppression measures during
       excavation, grading, and site preparation activities. Techniques may include, but are
       not limited to:
       •	 Site watering or application of dust suppressants;
       •	 Phasing or extension of grading operations;
       •	 Covering of stockpiles;
       •	 Suspension of grading activities during high wind periods (typically winds greater
          than 25 miles per hour); and
       •	 Revegetation of graded areas.
Public Facilities and Operations
8.1-o	 Reduce Trips by City Government. Take the lead in implementing a trip-reduction
       program for City employees. The program may include carpooling and ridesharing;
       reimbursement of transit costs; encouragement of flexible work schedules, telecom-
       muting, and teleconferencing.
8.1-p	 Transition to Clean City Fleet. Ensure through its long-range capital expenditure plans
       that the City deploys cutting-edge technologies and available incentives to minimize
       emissions from the City’s fleet.
8.1-q	 Institute Green Contracting. Using the Air District’s model ordinance as a guide,
       establish and follow a “green contracting” rule, awarding points in the bidding process
       to companies that use low-emission vehicles and equipment.
                                                                                                AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES | 8-21

                            8.1-r	 Promote Public Awareness. Support the Air District’s efforts to promote public
                                   awareness about air pollution and its relationship to land use and transportation.
                            8.1-s	 Expand Spare-the-Air Efforts. Be an active partner with the Air District in its “Spare
                                   the Air” program. Encourage businesses and residents to avoid pollution-producing
                                   activities such as the use of fireplaces and wood stoves, charcoal lighter fluid, pesti-
                                   cides, aerosol products, oil-based paints, and automobiles and other gasoline engines
                                   on days when high ozone levels are expected, and promote low-emission vehicles and
                                   alternatives to driving.
                            8.1-t	 Implement REMOVE II Program. Support the Air District in implementing its REMOVE
                                   II incentive program to reduce mobile source emissions. Seek funding for City
                                   projects, publicize the availability of incentive funding, and identify potentially eligible
                                   projects. As defined by the Air District, the following projects may be eligible:
                                   •	 Public transportation and commuter vanpool passenger subsidies;
                                   •	 Telecommunications, including videoconferencing, distance learning, and internet-
                                       based business transactions;
                                   •	 Bike path construction;
                                   •	 Alternative-fuel mechanic training.
                            8.1-u	  Support Employer-Based Trip Reduction. Support the Air District’s requirement that
                                   companies and organizations with 100 or more employees establish ride-sharing
                                   programs, and provide incentives to companies with 25 to 100 employees that do the
                                   same. Ridesharing programs may include market-based incentives such as cash for
                                   ridesharing, preferential parking for carpools, transit subsidies, cash allowances in lieu
                                   of parking spaces, telecommuting and flexible work schedules.

8.2	 Energy and Climate Change
Global Climate Change
Global climate change is currently one of the most important and widely debated scientific,
economic, and political issues in the United States. The term refers to a change in the average
climate of the earth that may be measured by wind patterns, storms, precipitation, and tem-
perature. The baseline by which these changes are measured originates in historical records
identifying temperature changes that have occurred in the distant past, such as during previous
ice ages. The rate of temperature change has typically been incremental, with warming and
cooling occurring over the course of thousands of years. In the past 10,000 years the earth has
experienced incremental warming as glaciers retreated across the globe. However, scientists have
observed an unprecedented increase in the rate of warming over the past 150 years, roughly coin-
ciding with the industrial revolution.
Potential Impacts in California
According to the California Climate Action Team (CCAT), accelerating global climate change
has the potential to cause a number of adverse impacts in California, including:
 •	 A shrinking Sierra snowpack that would threaten the state’s water supply;
 •	 Public health threats caused by higher temperatures and more smog;
 •	 Damage to agriculture and forests due to reduced water storage capacity, rising temperatures,
    increasing salt water intrusion, flooding, and pest infestations;
 •	 Critical habitat modification and destruction;
 •	 Eroding coastlines; and
 •	 Increased wildfire risk; and increased electricity demand.5
These impacts have and will continue to have considerable costs associated with them.

                            Greenhouse Gases
                            Gases that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere are called greenhouse gases (GHGs). These gases
                            play a critical role in determining the Earth’s surface temperature. Some GHGs occur naturally
                            and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes and human activities, while others
                            are created and emitted solely through human activities. The six primary GHGs are:
                             •	 Carbon dioxide (CO2), emitted as a result of fossil fuel combustion, with contributions from
                                cement manufacture;
                             •	 Methane (CH4), produced through the anaerobic decomposition of waste in landfills, animal
                                digestion, decomposition of animal wastes, production and distribution of natural gas and
                                petroleum, coal production, and incomplete fossil fuel combustion;
                             •	 Nitrous oxide (N2O), typically generated as a result of soil cultivation practices, particularly the
                                use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and
                                biomass burning;
                             •	 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), primarily used as refrigerants;
                             •	 Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), originally introduced as alternatives to ozone depleting substances
                                and typically emitted as by-products of industrial and manufacturing processes; and
                             •	 Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), primarily used in electrical transmission and distribution systems.
                            Greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global climate change are attributable in large part to
                            human activities associated with the industrial/manufacturing, utility, transportation, residen-
                            tial, and agricultural sectors. Major sources in California include fossil fuel consumption from
                            transportation (38 percent), industry (20 percent), electricity production (25 percent), residential
                            (6 percent), and agricultural (6 percent) sectors.6

8-24 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Counteracting Climate Change
These trends call for significant changes over the coming five, ten, and twenty years in the way
we produce and consume energy. The City of Turlock can do its part by shifting to renewable
energy use and energy conservation in its municipal operations, and by promoting and incentiv-
izing smart energy choices by Turlock residents and businesses. Such actions as installing solar
panels and shifting to fuel-efficient vehicles make economic as well as environmental sense. This
economic angle must not be overlooked.
Regulatory Context
Federal and State regulations have established a framework for responding to climate change,
and a context for local planning. Some key regulations are described below by theme. A compre-
hensive listing of climate change measures is provided in the Environmental Impact Report.
Federal Role in Regulating Greenhouse Gases
In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Massachusetts v. EPA, finding that the EPA has a
statutory authority to formulate standards and regulations to address greenhouse gases, which it
historically has not done. In 2009, the EPA officially found that the six greenhouse gases identi-
fied above threaten the public health and welfare, and that the combined emissions of these gases
from motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution.
The EPA acted on this mandate in 2010, updating the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE)
standards. The new “Clean Car Rule” standards require passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and
medium-duty passenger vehicles, to meet an estimated combined average emissions level of 250
grams of CO2 per mile and 34.1 miles per gallon in model year 2016.7
Statewide Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goal
Assembly Bill (AB) 32: California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006
In 2006, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, requiring the reduction of statewide GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. This is equivalent to an estimated 29 percent reduction
7	 U.S. EPA, 2010 (c)
                                                                                                   AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES | 8-25

                            from “business as usual” levels, in absolute terms, and an even larger reduction per capita, when
                            growth is considered. This change will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide cap
                            on GHG emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. AB 32 directs CARB to develop and
                            implement regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions from stationary sources and address
                            GHG emissions from vehicles.
                            CARB’s Scoping Plan outlines the combination of policies, programs, and measures necessary
                            to reduce statewide GHG emissions to achieve AB 32’s statewide reduction goals. Many of the
                            measures would, when implemented, contribute to emission reductions statewide as well as in
                            local communities. CARB continues to adopt measures outlined in the Scoping Plan and is in
                            the process of preparing rules to implement these measures. Turlock’s General Plan responds to
                            CARB’s implementation strategy as it pertains to cities’ general planning efforts.
                            Executive Order S-3-05 (Gov. Schwarzenegger, June 2005)
                            This Order recognizes California’s vulnerability to climate change, and set greenhouse gas
                            reduction targets for California. It calls on the State to reduce GHG emissions to 2000 levels by
                            2010; to 1990 levels by 2020; and by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
                            Regional GHG Reduction Targets and Plans
                            Senate Bill (SB) 375: Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008
                            SB 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, promotes better inte-
                            gration of transportation and land use planning throughout California. The statute was intended
                            to complement efforts under AB 32 by requiring CARB to develop regional GHG emissions
                            reduction targets. CARB was tasked with establishing targets for the years 2020 and 2035 for
                            each region covered by the state’s 18 federally-designated metropolitan planning organizations
                            (MPOs), which in turn would be required to meet that target by considering the impacts of
                            land use and transportation on GHG emissions. Based on targets adopted in September 2010,
                            StanCOG is expected to achieve a 5 percent reduction in per capita CO2 emissions due to
                            passenger vehicles by 2020, and a 10 percent reduction by 2035.
                            Second, SB 375 requires each MPO to develop a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS)
                            outlining how the region will meet its GHG reduction target by integrating land use planning,
                            transportation planning and funding, and housing needs. The SCS will be incorporated into
8-26 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

the Regional Transportation Plan, typically prepared by each MPO every 4 to 5 years. CARB is
required to review each SCS to determine whether it would achieve the necessary GHG emission
reduction for each region.
Regional Transportation Plan
Stanislaus Council of Governments (StanCOG) is responsible for regional transportation
planning for the Study Area. Pursuant to SB 375, the next RTP also must include a Sustain-
able Communities Strategy (see above) that would enable the region to meet its greenhouse gas
emission reduction targets. See Section 8.1 for more detail on the RTP.
Regional Climate Change Action Plan
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District adopted a Climate Change Action Plan
(CCAP) in August 2008. The Plan directs the Air District to develop guidance to assist District
staff, valley businesses, land-use agencies, and others in addressing GHG emissions as part of the
CEQA process. The Air District has since published Best Performance Standards (BPS) for sta-
tionary sources and development projects, and guidance for valley land-use agencies.
State Green Building Standards Code
The California Building Code (Title 24 of the State Code of Regulations) includes the country’s
first Green Building Standards. The Green Building Standards were introduced in 2008 as a set
of voluntary measures. With the 2010 update of the Building Code, parts of the Green Building
Standards became mandatory as of January 2011. Among these are requirements to reduce water
consumption, divert construction waste from landfills, and install low pollutant-emitting finish
materials. Requirements vary for residential and nonresidential buildings.
The Green Building Standards are a key part of the State’s efforts to achieve the AB 32 goal
of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Future updates are expected to
continue to strengthen environmentally responsible building requirements as these practices
become mainstream. Local jurisdictions are responsible for ensuring that State standards are
met, at a minimum. The 2010 Green Building Standards Code also establishes a system designed
to give cities and counties the option of adopting local codes that go beyond the minimum
standards.8

                            Sources of Greenhouse Gases in the Study Area
                            Greenhouse gases in the Study Area are generated by residential, commercial, and industrial
                            energy use from both natural gas and electricity; by vehicle emissions; by industrial sources;

Stationary Source Emissions
Turlock Irrigation District (TID), the publicly-owned supplier of electricity in the Study Area,
operates two natural gas-fired power plants in Turlock: the 250-megawatt-capacity Walnut
Energy Center and the adjacent 49-megawatt-capacity Walnut plant used only for peak period
use or emergencies. According to TID estimates, these plants produced 696,000 metric tons of
CO2 in 2008, contributing almost all of the natural gas-generated power generated by the utility.
Because these plants supply customers not only in the Study Area but also in other parts of TID’s
service area and beyond, it is more appropriate to consider the impact of indirect emissions due
to energy used in the Study Area. CARB is responsible for regulating GHG emissions from these
and other stationary sources under AB 32.
Electricity and Natural Gas Use in Buildings
Electricity and natural gas consumption in buildings are the Study Area’s principal source of
greenhouse gas emissions. TID estimates that its approximately 29,000 retail customers in
Turlock used 733 million kilowatt-hours (kwh) of energy in 2008.9 PG&E provides natural gas to
customers in the Study Area, and estimates that approximately 25 million therms of natural gas
were used in the latest year data were available.10 Applying California Climate Action Registry
(CCAR) emission rate factors, energy to light, power, heat and cool buildings, machinery,
swimming pools, and other parts of the built environment currently produces about 376,000
metric tons of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases annually in the Study Area.
If per capita emissions are adjusted for State-mandated energy efficiency improvements, GHG
emissions from energy use in buildings would rise to approximately 525,000 metric tons at
General Plan buildout, an increase of 39 percent over current levels.
Transportation Energy
Transportation represents the next largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Study Area.
According to the General Plan’s traffic model, the Study Area now experiences an estimated
1,330,000 daily vehicle-miles travelled, using approximately 76,000 gallons of fuel, assuming 17.5

                                                           (CCAR), approximately 264,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions are released annually
                                                           in the Study Area from vehicles.

                                                           over current emissions, but a 23 percent reduction per capita.12 The California Air Resources

                                                           by 2030.

not calculated due to the relatively small amount of land (27 acres) used for raising livestock in
the Study Area. GHG emissions from agriculture are projected to fall as some agricultural land is
converted to urban uses.
Clean Energy and Energy Conservation
Energy use in buildings and energy used for transportation are by far the largest sources of heat-
trapping gases in the Study Area. The greatest potential greenhouse gas reductions can be made
by lowering the carbon content of energy, and by lowering per-capita energy use. Current efforts
and potential programs are outlined below.
Renewable Energy
Turlock Irrigation District (TID) operates eight hydroelectric power plants, as well as three
natural gas-fired power plants, including the 250-megawatt Walnut Energy Center completed in
2006 in Turlock’s TRIP. The District sells a portion of the power it generates and buys from other
sources a portion of the power it sells to its customers.
TID is investing in renewable energy production, including a 136-megawatt wind energy facility
and a geothermal plant, as well as increasing its purchasing of renewable energy. The utility aims
to achieve compliance with the State Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) for 33 percent of
power deliveries to be from renewable sources by 2020. The City can support a shift toward
renewable energy through its own purchasing decisions; by facilitating distributed energy pro-
duction such as small rooftop solar arrays; and other means outlined in the Policies section.
Meanwhile gasoline refiners selling in Caifornia will be required to achieve the State’s Low
Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), reducing the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 10
percent by 2020, as well as the federal Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) requiring 36 billion
gallons of biofuels to be sold annually in the U.S. by 2022, a fivefold increase from 2007.
Energy Conservation
It is possible to improve energy efficiency associated with transportation, industrial buildings,
and homes and still maintain a high standard of living and a competitive local economy. By
reducing the amount of energy consumed across land uses and transportation choices, as well
as using more renewable sources of energy, residents and businesses in Turlock can see many
                                                                                                   AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES | 8-31

                                                         cost of infrastructure and energy delivery.
                                                         Energy Efficiency in Buildings

                                                         above, the California Building Code includes Green Building Standards, some of which became
                                                         mandatory in January 2011. These standards are intended to help the State achieve the AB 32 goal
                                                         of reducing GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Local jurisdictions have the option of adopting
                                                         procedures by ordinance to improve the level of construction beyond this minimum standard,
                                                         and may base their building codes on CalGreen Tier 1 or Tier 2 thresholds.13 This General Plan
                                                         sets targets for new development in Master Plan Areas to achieve or surpass the CalGreen Tier 1
                                                         standards, with incentives for performance above the State’s minimum requirements.
                                                         At the same time, the energy efficiency of existing buildings can be significantly improved.
                                                         Subsidized energy audits can identify needed improvements, which in many cases can be done

                                                         Energy efficiency can also be achieved through good urban design. Compact and mixed use

Turlock’s General Plan plays an integral role in establishing land use and development patterns
that support walking, biking, the use of public transportation, and the ability to satisfy many
needs with short trips. At the same time it lays out a future circulation system that is func-
tional for all modes of travel. Policies related to reducing overall and per capita energy use in
this Element and in the Land Use, City Design, and Transportation elements combine to help

                                      and PG&E) for energy efficient appliances and weatherization tools.
                                   •	 Require Energy Star electrical appliances when replacing appliances in City-funded
                                      Home Rehabilitation projects.
                                   A sizable portion of the residential structures in Turlock were constructed before
                                   energy efficiency standards were established, and should be improved.
                            8.2-r	 Encourage Greater Energy Efficiency in New Development. For new Master Plan
                                   Areas, seek to expedite permit processing for new buildings that meet or exceed the

9	         Noise
Noises are undesirable or unwanted sounds that vary widely in their scope, source, and volume.
They range from individual occurrences such as a leaf blower or holiday firecrackers, to regular
though intermittent disturbance by aircraft flying overhead, or an infrequent train going through
town, to the fairly constant noise generated by traffic on freeways.
This chapter identifies the noise sources that exist within the study Area, describes noise impacts
that may result from the General Plan, and establishes policies to mitigate potential impacts
through both preventative and responsive actions. The regulation of noise sources such as traffic,
railroad operations and aircraft operations is overseen by state and federal agencies; therefore, this
element has a direct correlation with the land use, circulation, and housing elements. It guides
the location of industrial land uses and transportation facilities, since they are common sources
of excessive noise levels. This element also guides the location of particularly noise–sensitive uses,
such as residences, schools, churches, and hospitals, so that they may be less affected by noise.
9.1	 NOISE CHARACTERISTICS and MEASUREMENT                                                                Roadway traffic is a common source of noise in urban
                                                                                                          environments.
Noise Measurement
Three aspects of noise are used in assessing the community noise environment:
 •	 Level is the magnitude or loudness of sound. Sound levels are measured and expressed in deci-
    bels (dB) with 10 dB roughly equal to the threshold of hearing. The accompanying graphic shows
    the decibel levels associated with different common sounds.
 •	 Frequency is the composition or spectrum of the sound. Frequency is a measure of the pressure
    fluctuations per second.
 •	 Variation is sound level over time. Most community noise is produced by many distant noise
    sources that change gradually throughout the day and result in steady background noise with no
    identifiable source. Identifiable events of brief duration, such as aircraft flyovers, cause the com-
    munity noise level to vary from instant to instant. A single number called the equivalent sound
    level (Leq) describes the average noise exposure level over a period of time. Transient noise events
                                                                                                                                                  NOISE 9-1

 Figure 9-1:	 Typical Sound Levels     may be described by their maximum noise level (Lmax), measured in decibels “A-weighted” to
                                       correct for the frequency response of the human ear (dBA).
                                   Reporting Noise Levels
                                   Measuring and reporting noise levels involves accounting for variations in sensitivity to noise
                                   during the daytime versus nighttime hours. Noise descriptors used for analysis need to account
                                   for human sensitivity to nighttime noise; background noise levels are generally lower than in the
                                   daytime and outside noise intrusions are more noticeable. The Community Noise Equivalent
                                   Level (CNEL) is an indicator that reflects noise exposure over an average day with weighting to
                                   reflect the increased sensitivity to noise at night.
                                   Knowledge of the following relationships is helpful in understanding how changes in noise and
                                   noise exposure are perceived:
                                    •	 Except under special conditions, a change in sound level of 1 dB cannot be perceived;
                                    •	 A 3 dB change is considered a just noticeable difference;
                                    •	 A 5 dB change is required before any noticeable change in community response would be
                                       expected. A 5 dB increase is often considered a significant impact; and
                                    •	 A 10 dB increase is subjectively heard as an approximate doubling in loudness and almost always
                                       causes an adverse community response.
                                   In establishing noise contours for land use planning, it is customary to ignore noise attenuation
                                   afforded by buildings, roadway elevations, and depressions, and to minimize the barrier effect of
                                   natural terrain features. The result is a worst-case estimate of the existing and future (projected)
                                   noise environment. The purpose of noise contours is to identify the potential need for more
                                   detailed acoustical studies, not to predict with certainty the noise level throughout the City.
                                   The assumption is that it is desirable to overestimate the potential noise at a future noisesensitive
                                   development site than to underestimate the noise environment and allow for potentially incom-
                                   patible land use development.
9-2 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

9.2	 NOISE Generation in Turlock
The major noise sources in Turlock are related to roadways and vehicle traffic. Other noise
sources include aircraft, rail transportation, industry, and equipment. Figure 9-2 maps existing
noise contours. Figure 9-3 maps future noise contours, associated with full buildout of the
General Plan. According to common practice, maximum noise levels of 60 dB are considered
“normally acceptable” for unshielded residential development. Noise levels from 60 dB to 70 dB
fall within the “conditionally unacceptable” range, and those in the 70 to 75 dB range are consid-
ered “normally unacceptable.”
Traffic
Motor vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, and motorcycles, are the most pervasive
source of noise in the Planning Area. The level of vehicle-generated noise is related to the volume
of vehicles, the speed of traffic, and the number trucks in the flow of traffic. Vehicle noise is
a combination of the noises produced by the engine, exhaust, tires, and wind generated by
taller vehicles. Other factors that affect the perception of traffic noise include distance from the
highway, terrain, vegetation, and natural and structural obstacles. While tire noise from autos
is generally located at ground level, truck noise sources can be located as high as ten to fifteen
feet above the roadbed due to tall exhaust stacks and higher engines. Noise exposure contours
for Turlock’s major roadways were modeled by applying the Federal Highway Administration’s
noise modeling procedure. These noise contours are conservative, meaning that the contours are
modeled with minimal noise attenuation by natural barriers and buildings.
The highest noise levels are along Highway 99, resulting in noise levels above 70 dB (normally
unacceptable) in certain residential areas close to the highway. Noise levels above 65 dB are typical
of residential areas somewhat further from Highway 99 and along the Golden State Boulevard
corridor, as well as along stretches of several arterial or collector roads, including Monte Vista
Avenue, Geer Road, Christoffersen Parkway, Fulkerth Road, Hawkeye Avenue, West Main
Street, and Lander Avenue. Much of the City between Highway 99 and Golden State Boulevard,
as well as parts of neighborhoods east of Golden State Boulevard and near arterial roads, have
noise levels above 60 dB. These noise conditions may create impacts to sensitive receptors such as
residences, schools, churches, and hospitals in many parts of Turlock.
                                                                                                      NOISE 9-3

                           Railroad
                           Railroad activity includes approximately 18 freight train operations per day along the Union
                           Pacific Railroad (UPRR) track running northwest-southeast through the Planning Area parallel
                           to Golden State Boulevard. A maximum of two local freight trains operate per day on the UPRR
                           spur, which run parallel to Castor Street.
                           Several factors combine to produce railroad noises, including grade, type of track, length and
                           speed of trains, number of engines, and number of trips. Because the railroad is directly parallel
                           to Golden State Boulevard through most of the Planning Area and Highway 99 in the far north,
                           noise from the railroad is mixed with traffic noise. Two long-term noise measurements were
                           collected along the rail line. Both measurements, taken between Golf Road and F Street and just
                           south of Pedras Road, respectively, found a DNL of 79 dB. Noise levels are assumed to attenuate
                           at a rate of 3 dBA for every doubling of distance from the railroad. Because train noise only lasts a
                           few minutes each time, it is considered less severe than traffic noise from high-volume roadways.
                           Airport Noise
                           There are no airports within the Study Area. Turlock Municipal Airport, approximately six miles
                           east of the eastern edge of the Study Area, is a public General Aviation airport with a single
                           runway and currently no commercial flights. Modesto City-County Airport, approximately
                           seven miles northwest of the northern boundary of the Planning Area, is a primary commercial
                           service airport with two runways.
                           The greatest potential for noise intrusion from airports occurs when aircraft land, take off, or run
                           their engines while on the ground. Noise contours developed for these two airports (not shown)
                           show noise levels elevated above 65 dB only in close proximity to the airports.
                           Industrial Activity
                           Industrial uses are another source of noise that can have a varying impact on adjacent uses. A
                           variety of mechanical equipment, generators, and vehicles all contribute to noise levels at indus-
                           trial sites. The greatest potential for problems created by industrial noise arises when residential
                           areas are affected. Most industrial expansion during the General Plan period will take place in
                           the Westside Industrial Specific Plan area, which is separated from residences and other sensitive
9-4 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN
noise receptors. However, industrial activities south of Downtown and in the South Golden State
Boulevard corridor have the potential to affect some residential areas. Evening and nighttime
operations at a number of industrial plants can make the problem worse.
Construction
Construction can be another substantial, though short-term, source of noise. Construction is
most disruptive when it takes place near sensitive land uses, or occurs at night or in early morning
hours. The dominant construction equipment noise source is usually a diesel engine without
sufficient muffling. In a few cases, however, such as impact pile driving or pavement breaking,
process noise dominates.
Other Equipment
Other portable or small-scale pieces of equipment may also produce noise. Mechanical equipment
such as pumps and fans may produce low noise levels, but continuously and for substantial
distances. Rooftop or otherwise exposed mechanical equipment can also produce constant and
disturbing noises. Portable power equipment, such as leaf blowers and drills, can produce very
high noise levels at the location of the work. Other amplified sounds such as automotive audio
equipment or loudspeakers also create noise exposure.
Existing and future noise levels along arterial roadways in Turlock were calculated using the
FHWA’s Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model and traffic volume data collected for the
General Plan. Future noise contours are illustrated in Figure 9-3. Future development within the
Study Area will result in increased noise levels due primarily to automobile traffic. Generally, an
increase of three decibels (dB) is barely perceptible. Noise increases along many Turlock roadways
are expected to be perceptible, but relatively low:
 •	 Noise along Highway 99 is projected to increase by 2 dB to 4 dB, as is noise along Hawkeye
    Avenue east of Berkeley Avenue;
 •	 Noise along Golden State Boulevard, West Main Street, South Tegner Road, Countryside
    Drive, Olive Avenue, and Monte Vista Avenue east of Olive is projected to increase by 3 dB;
                                                                                                     NOISE 9-5

                                                        •	 Noise along Berkeley Avenue south of Canal Drive is projected to increase by 3 dB to 5 dB, along
                                                           Daubenberger Road by 4 dB, and along Linwood Avenue east of South Tegner Road by 4 dB to
                                                           5 dB.
                                                        •	 Along Washington Road, Walnut Road, East Avenue, Fulkerth Road west of Highway 99, and

                                                       The most pronounced noise increases are projected along certain roadways, primarily those
                                                       serving the new growth areas:
                                                        •	 Noise along portions of Golf Road may increase by up to 8 dB
                                                        •	 Along portions of Canal Drive, noise is projected to increase by between 4 and 10 dB
                                                        •	 Along Christofferson Parkway east of Olive, noise may increase by up to 11 dB
                                                        •	 Data for existing conditions along Verduga Road are not available. In the future, traffic noise
                                                           along Verduga Road is projected to be DNL 71 dB to DNL 74 dB at a distance of 50 feet from
                                                           the roadway centerline
                                                       The traffic model found a reduction in noise of between 1 and 5 dB along most of Taylor Road
                                                       east of Highway 99, as more traffic is directed onto other roadways.
                                                       The actual level of impact will depend on the presence and location of existing or proposed land
                                                       uses or barriers in relation to the noise source. The General Plan seeks to reduce noise levels at the
                                                       source through mitigation policies and reduce the impact on sensitive receptors.
Noises are produced by a variety of sources, including
industrial activities and equipment.

9.3	 Noise Exposure Standards
State standards, and City standards established in this General Plan, are designed to protect
community members and sensitive receptors from noise hazards and establish criteria to mitigate
development accordingly.
State Regulations
Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, the Building Standards Administrative Code,
contains the State Noise Insulation Standards, which specify interior noise standards for new
hotels, motels, apartment houses, and dwellings other than single-family homes. Such new struc-
tures must be designed to reduce outdoor noise to an interior level of no more than 45 dB in any
habitable room. They require an acoustical analysis demonstrating how dwelling units have been
designed to meet this interior standard where such units are proposed in areas subject to noise
levels greater than 60 dB. Title 24 standards are enforced through the building permit applica-
tion process.
Noise Standards
General Plan noise standards are shown in Table 9-1 and Table 9-2.
Community Noise Exposure
Table 9-1 presents the community noise exposure matrix, establishing criteria the City can use
to evaluate land use compatibility based on noise levels. This matrix is adapted from guidelines
provided by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services. The State
indicates that locating housing in areas where exterior ambient noise levels exceed 65 dBA is
undesirable.
                                                                                                 NOISE 9-7
                           Table 9–1:	 Land Use Classifications and Density – Minimums and Maximums
                           				Normally Acceptable			Normally Unacceptable

9-8 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Noise exposure levels are classified as being “normally acceptable”, “conditionally acceptable,”
“normally unacceptable,” or “clearly unacceptable” for different land use types.
Normally Acceptable
 •	 Indoor Uses: Either the activities associated with the land use are inherently noisy or standard
    construction methods will sufficiently attenuate exterior noise to an acceptable level; for land use
    types that are compatible because of inherent noise levels, sound attenuation must be provided
    for associated office, retail, and other noise-sensitive indoor spaces sufficient to reduce exterior
    noise to an interior maximum of 50 dB CNEL.
 •	 Outdoor Uses: Outdoor activities associated with the land use may be carried out with minimal
    interference.
Conditionally Acceptable
 •	 Indoor Uses: Noise reduction measures must be incorporated into the design of the project to
    attenuate exterior noise to the indoor noise levels listed in Table 9-2.
 •	 Outdoor Uses: Noise reduction measures must be incorporated into the design of the project to
    attenuate exterior noise to the outdoor noise levels listed in Table 9-2. Acceptability is dependent
    upon characteristics of the specific use.
Normally Unacceptable
 •	 Indoor Uses: Extensive mitigation techniques are required to make the indoor environment
    acceptable for indoor activities. Noise level reductions necessary to attenuate exterior noise to the
    indoor noise levels listed in Table 9-2 are difficult to achieve and may not be feasible.
 •	 Outdoor Uses: Severe noise interference makes the outdoor environment unacceptable for
    outdoor activities. Noise level reductions necessary to attenuate exterior noise to the outdoor
    noise levels listed in Table 9-2 are difficult to achieve and may not be feasible.
Clearly Unacceptable
New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

                                 property line of the receiving use.
                              2 Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to the allowable maximum, levels up to 5 dB
                                 higher may be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been im-ple-
                                 mented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.

                            The General Plan also provides standards for exposure to non-transportation noise sources such
                            as industrial facilities, automotive servicing, or equipment yards, in Table 9-3. These standards
                            apply to the noise sources themselves, as well as to proposed development that may be affected by
                            existing noise sources.

Policies
Guiding Policies
9.4-a	 Land Use Compatibility. Ensure that new development is compatible with the noise
        environment, by continuing to use potential noise exposure as a criterion in land use
        planning.
9.4-b	 Prevent Degradation of Noise Environment. Protect public health and welfare by elim-
        inating existing noise problems where feasible, maintaining an acceptable indoor and
        outdoor acoustic environment, and preventing significant degradation of the acoustic
        environment.
        Decreasing noise magnitude at the source and limiting the times certain types and
        volumes of noise can occur are two of the approaches to noise attenuation taken in the
        City’s Noise Control Ordinance.
9.4-c	 Protect Residential Areas and Sensitive Uses. Minimize excessive noise exposure in
        residential areas and in the vicinity of such uses as schools, hospitals, and senior care
        facilities.

The most pronounced noise increases are projected              •	 Include a representative, on-site day and night sound level measurement;
to be along roadways serving the new growth areas.             •	 Include a delineation of current (measured) and projected (10 years) noise contours
The General Plan seeks to make land use compatible                with and without the proposed project, ranging from 55 to 75 dBA (Ldn) within the
with the noise environment, reduce noise levels at the            proposed development site; and

       Building measures may include:
       •	 Facades constructed substantial weight and insulation;
       •	 Sound-rated windows and doors;
       •	 Active cancellation;
       •	 Acoustic baffling of vents for chimneys, fans, and gable ends;
       •	 Ventilation system affording comfort under closed-window conditions;
       •	 Double doors and heavy roofs with ceilings of two layers of gypsum board on
          resilient channels.
9.4-f	 Vibration Reduction. Require that new development near railroad tracks is limited as
       follows to avoid impact from excessive noise vibration:
       •	 No new buildings where low ambient vibration is essential for interior operations
          may be located within 225 feet of railroad tracks. These uses may include, but are
          not limited to, vibration-sensitive research and manufacturing; hospital research
          areas; concert halls; and TV/recording studios.
       •	 No new residences or other buildings where people sleep may be located within
          100 feet of railroad tracks. These include multi-family dwellings, houses, hospital
          patient rooms, and hotels.
       •	 No schools, churches, or commercial offices may be located within 70 feet of
          railroad tracks.
9.4-g	 Noise-Sensitive Uses—Required Mitigation. Do not allow new development of noise-
       sensitive uses where the noise level due to non-transportation noise sources will
       exceed the noise level standards of Table 9-3, as measured immediately within the
       property line of the new development, unless effective noise mitigation measures
       have been incorporated into the development design to achieve the standards
       specified in the table.
9.4-h	 Non-Transportation Noise Sources—Required Mitigation. Require mitigation of noise
       created by new proposed non-transportation noise sources so that it does not exceed
       the noise level standards of Table 9-3 as measured immediately within the property
       line of lands designated for noise-sensitive uses. Appropriate mitigation measures
       include:
       •	 Dampen or actively cancel noise sources;
       •	 Increase setbacks for noise sources from adjacent dwellings;
                                                                                              NOISE 9-15

                                   •	 Use soundproofing materials and double-glazed windows;
                                   •	 Screen and control noise sources, such as parking and loading facilities, outdoor
                                      activities, and mechanical equipment;
                                   •	 Use open space, building orientation and design, landscaping and running water to
                                      mask sounds; and
                                   •	 Control hours of operation, including deliveries and trash pickup.
                                   This policy does not apply to noise sources associated with agricultural operations on
                                   lands zoned for agricultural uses.
                            9.4-i	 Noise Ordinance. Continue to enforce the City Noise Control Ordinance and update as
                                   necessary.
                                   The City’s ordinance addresses a wide range of noise-generating activities, establish-
                                   ing community standards and providing a basis for enforcement.

                                   measures when undertaking improvements, extensions, or design changes to City
                                   streets. Measures may involve some combination of setbacks, earth berms, solid noise
                                   walls, placement of non-occupancy accessory structures or windowless building sites
                                   towards the noise source, and building insulation techniques.
                                   Mitigation through the design and construction of a noise barrier (wall, berm, or com-
                                   bination wall/berm) is the most common way of alleviating traffic noise impacts. Noise
                                   barriers often have the disadvantage of unsightliness; however, properly landscaped
                                   berms or walls shielded with climbing vines can, over time, become visual assets. The
                                   use of noise barriers should be minimized.

The Safety Element identifies the natural and manmade hazards that exist within the city and
seeks to mitigate their potential impacts through both preventative and response measures. This
Element addresses potentially hazardous materials and operations; seismic and geologic hazards;
flooding and drainage; fire hazards; and emergency management. Potential health hazards
related to air quality are addressed in Chapter 8: Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases. Storm drain
infrastructure related to flooding and drainage is discussed in Chapter 3, New Growth Areas and

health threats. Historic or current activities, most often associated with industrial or commercial
uses (including gas stations, car washes, etc.) may result in the release, leak, or disposal of toxic
substances on or below the ground surface, where they can then contaminate soil and ground
water. Furthermore, disturbance of the ground through grading or excavation can result in
exposure of these chemicals to the public. Improper handling of contaminated sites may result
in further exposure via airborne dust, surface water runoff, or vapors. However, proper waste
management and disposal practices can minimize public concern over toxicity and the contami-
nation of soils, water, and the air.
Laws AND Regulations
Federal and State laws require detailed planning to ensure that hazardous materials are properly
handled, used, stored, transported and disposed of, and in the event that such materials are acci-
dentally released, to prevent or mitigate injury to health or the environment. The primary Federal
agencies with responsibility for hazardous materials management include the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).

                            incidents can lead to human injury or death as well as causing various environmental impacts.
                            The Federal Railroad Administration regulates railroad safety and provides oversight to the use
                            of railroads.
                            The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) corridor traverses the Study Area from northwest to
                            southeast parallel to Golden State Boulevard, and carries an average of 18 trains per day. A
                            maximum of two trains operate per day on the UPRR spur, which runs parallel to Castor Street.
                            Utility Corridors
                            One of the primary causes of disruption to underground natural gas pipelines, which are present
                            in the Study Area, is external force damage that occurs during excavation activities. Such
                            damage can create pipeline leaks or ruptures and lead to hazardous health and safety condi-
                            tions. However, a national program is in place to prevent accidental pipeline damage caused
                            by excavation. For areas adjacent to an underground utility pipeline, the U.S. Department of
                            Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety requires that individuals contact the state “One-Call”
                            center prior to beginning excavation. Advanced planning, effective use of these one-call systems,
                            accurate locating and marking of underground facilities, and the use of safe-digging practices can
                            all be effective in reducing underground facility damage and potentially hazardous conditions.
                            POLICIES
                            Guiding Policies
                            10.1-a	 Protect Lives and Property. Prevent loss of lives, injury, illness, and property damage
                                    due to hazardous materials and wastes.
                            10.1-b	 Protect Natural Resources. Protect soils, surface water, and groundwater from con-
                                    tamination from hazardous materials.
10-6 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

10.1-c	 Coordinate Efforts to Minimize Risks. Cooperate with State agencies and the Stan-
        islaus County Environmental Resources Department efforts to identify hazardous
        materials users, implement hazardous materials plans, provide safe waste disposal
        sites, and minimize risks associated with hazardous cargoes, agricultural spraying, and
        electromagnetic fields.
10.1-d	 Incorporate Safety Considerations Into Land Use Policies. Coordinate land use
        policies with concerns about potential hazards.
        Policies calling for buffers between urban and agricultural activities will reduce the risk
        of exposure of urban residents to agricultural chemicals. Concentration of industrial
        activity west of the highway away from housing reduces the risk from accidents that
        might occur at industrial sites, and also helps to separate industrial vehicle traffic from
        other traffic on local streets.
Implementing Policies
10.1-e	 Implement Countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan. Implement measures
        specified in the Household Hazardous Waste Element of the Countywide Integrated
        Waste Management Plan (CIWMP).
10.1-f	 Reduce Hazardous Waste Disposal. Continue to reduce per capita disposal of
        hazardous waste by promoting reuse and recycling of materials as appropriate, by
        providing information to the public, operating waste collection facilities, and other
        means.
10.1-g	 Raise Public Awareness of Appropriate Hazardous Waste Disposal. Provide informa-
        tion and conduct outreach to educate the public about proper disposal methods for
        household hazardous waste.
10.1-h	 Maintain Inventory of Contaminated Sites. Maintain for public review an up-to-date
        inventory of identified hazardous waste sites in the City based on State databases. This
        information should be identified and addressed if needed as part of Turlock’s review
        and analysis of each discretionary development proposal.
        All currently identified contaminated sites are listed in the Environmental Impact
        Report (EIR).
                                                                                                    SAFETY | 10-7

                            10.1-i	 Support Cleanup Efforts. Work with the Stanislaus County Environmental Resources
                                    Department, other agencies, and landowners to enable clean-up of contaminated
                                    sites.
                                    The City should not approve a use change or any development project on a con-
                                    taminated site until such time as the site is cleaned to a level where it is no longer
                                    hazardous for the proposed use.
                            10.1-j	 Evaluate Safety of Railroad Crossings. In close cooperation with the railroads,
                                    evaluate the safety characteristics of existing at-grade railroad crossings, and promote
                                    improvements to the extent feasible and as necessary to reduce potential for mishaps
                                    involving hazardous cargo. Support grade-separated railroad crossings where
                                    feasible.
                            10.1-k	 Locate Buildings With High-Public-Occupancy at Safe Distance from Railroad and
                                    Highway. To the extent feasible, locate new buildings of high public occupancy — par-
                                    ticularly schools, hospitals, civic and institutional uses at least 100 feet from main
                                    railroad alignments and the highway, to minimize risks to life and property in the event
                                    of a hazardous cargo accident.
                            10.1-l	 Maintain Land Use Separation Between Hazardous Waste Handling Sites and Incom-
                                    patible Uses. Ensure compatibility between hazardous material users and surrounding
                                    land use through the development review process. Separate hazardous waste facili-
                                    ties from incompatible uses including, but not limited to, schools, daycares, hospitals,
                                    public gathering areas, and high-density residential housing through development
                                    standards and the review process.
                            10.1-m	 Require Hazardous Materials Studies When Appropriate. Ensure that the propo-
                                    nents of new development projects address applicable hazardous materials concerns
                                    through the preparation of Phase I or Phase II hazardous materials studies, as
                                    necessary, for each identified site as part of the design phase for each project. Require
                                    projects to implement federal or State cleanup standards outlined in the studies during
                                    construction.
                            10.1-n	 Require Safe Design and Construction of Storage Tanks. Require that all fuel and
                                    chemical storage tanks are appropriately constructed; include spill containment
                                    areas to prevent seismic damage, leakage, fire and explosion; and are structurally or
                                    spatially separated from sensitive land uses.

10.2	 Seismic and Geologic Hazards
Geologic and soils hazards include steep slopes and landslides, subsidence, expansive soils, and
soil erosion. Seismic hazards related to earthquakes include groundshaking and ground failures
such as liquefaction and landslides. In general, geologic and seismic hazards do not pose a sub-
stantial risk to development or to overall public safety in Turlock.
Seismicity
Regional Faults
There are no known active faults in the Study Area or in the valley portion of Stanislaus County.
Nearest are the Bear Mountain and Melones faults in the eastern part of Stanislaus County,
which have been inactive for the last 150 million years1, and the Tesla Ortigalita fault in the
Diablo Range. Two potentially active faults have been identified in the San Joaquin Valley. The
San Joaquin Fault, lying close to Interstate 5 about 18 miles west of Turlock, is a Late Quaternary
fault that shows displacement during the last 700,000 years. The Vernalis Fault, lying about 20
miles northwest of Turlock, is thought to belong to the Quaternary Period with displacement
sometime during the past 1,600,000 years.
The Study Area could be impacted by earthquakes along faults in other parts of the region and
elsewhere in California. However, impacts resulting from such an event are not likely to be
severe. Figure 10-2 identifies active and potentially active faults in the larger region.
Seismic Structural Safety
Because there are no known active faults within or near the Study Area, the greatest seismic
hazard in Turlock is the structural danger posed by groundshaking from earthquakes originating
outside of the area. A maximum-intensity earthquake would be capable of causing considerable
damage in ordinary structures, and in turn, risk of injuries, loss of life, and property damage.
Damage from ground shaking is a combined function of the structural integrity of the buildings
before the earthquake, and the quality of soils or bedrock underlying the buildings. A foun-
dation of rock or very firm material can intensify short-period motions, which affect low-rise

buildings more than tall, flexible ones. A deep layer of saturated alluvium can cushion low-rise
buildings, but it can also accentuate the motion in tall buildings.
Older structures generally were not built to withstand the lateral stress imposed by the
groundshaking of a major earthquake. This applies particularly to buildings having walls of non-
reinforced brick held together by sand-lime mortar, and in general to all multistoried buildings
that do not have steel reinforcements. Other potentially dangerous conditions include architec-
tural features that are not firmly anchored, such as parapets and cornices; roadways, including
column and pile bents and abutments for bridges and overcrossings; and above-ground storage
tanks and their mounting devices.
Most masonry structures in Turlock’s Downtown were built in the 1920s, well before the
adoption of stricter building requirements imposed in 1933. However, these structures, many of
which have unoccupied second floors, have withstood the test of time defined by the Historical
Building Code, and no action is planned to bring them up to code.
Geologic Hazards
Geologic hazards that may exist within the Study Area include soil erosion, expansive soils, set-
tlement and subsidence. The Study Area is primarily flat, and so the risk of unstable soils or
landslides is considered low and not discussed further.
Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is a process by which soil materials are worn away and transported to another area,
either by wind or water. Rates of erosion can vary depending on the soil material and structure,
and the placement and level of human activity. Soil containing high amounts of silt can be easily
eroded, while sandy soils are less susceptible. Erosion is most likely to occur on sloped areas with
exposed soil, especially where unnatural slopes are created by cut-and-fill activities.
Not accounting for slope and groundcover factors, soils high in clay have low susceptibility
to erosion because they are resistant to detachment. Coarse textured soils, such as sandy soils,
also have low erosion potential despite their easy detachment, because of low runoff. Medium
textured soils, such as the silt loam soils, are moderately susceptible to erosion, while soils with a
high silt content are the most susceptible.2

                             Just over half of the Study Area is underlain by soils that are moderately or highly susceptible to
                             erosion, with K values greater than 0.25 (K values range from 0.05 to 0.43, with higher values cor-
                             responding to greater susceptibility to erosion.) Soils covering 647 acres have K values of 0.41 to
                             0.43, indicating high susceptibility for erosion. These soils are located in the far west of the Study
                             Area, primarily underlying land designated for agricultural use through the planning period.
                             Since the Study Area is primarily flat and has no natural waterways, the risk of soil erosion due
                             to water is relatively low. However, if stormwater is not managed well, especially during con-
                             struction, drainage can be a significant cause of soil erosion. Excessive soil erosion can eventually
                             damage building foundations and roadways.
                             Expansive Soils
                             Expansive soils possess a “shrink-swell” characteristic. Shrink-swell is the change in volume
                             (expansion and contraction) that occurs in fine-grained clay sediments from the process of
                             wetting and drying. Structural damage may occur over a long period of time, usually the result of
                             inadequate soil and foundation engineering, or the placement of structures directly on expansive
                             soils.
                             Soils covering 99 percent of the Study Area are considered to have a low shrink-swell potential.
                             The two moderate shrink swell soils, Madera sandy loam (MdA) and Snelling sandy loam (SnA),
                             are found only in small areas on the eastern edge of the Study Area and at the southwest corner
                             of the WISP.
                             Erosion and shrink-swell potential in the Study Area are shown in Figure 10-3.
                             Settlement
                             Settlement is the depression of the bearing soil when a load, such as that of a building or new
                             fill material, is placed upon it. Soils tend to settle at different rates and by varying amounts
                             depending on the load weight, which is referred to as differential settlement. Differential set-
                             tlement can be a greater hazard than total settlement if there are variations in the thickness of
                             previous and new fills or natural variations in the thickness and compressibility of soils across an
                             area. Settlement commonly occurs as a result of building construction or other large projects that
                             require soil stockpiles. If these areas are comprised of soil stockpiles or other areas of unconsoli-
                             dated fill materials, they have the potential to respond more adversely to additional load weights
                             as compared to adjacent native soils.

                             Subsidence
                             Subsidence occurs when a large portion of land is displaced vertically, usually due to the with-
                             drawal of groundwater, oil, or natural gas. Soils that are particularly subject to subsidence include
                             those with high silt or clay content. Given the falling water table in the vicinity of Turlock (see
                             Chapter 7), subsidence is a possibility, particularly in areas with high clay content soils.

                                     The California Building Code, which has been adopted by Turlock, Stanislaus County
                                     and the other cities in the County, is intended to ensure that buildings resist major
                                     earthquakes of the intensity or severity of the strongest experienced in California,
                                     without collapse, but with some structural as well as nonstructural damage. In most
                                     structures, it is expected that structural damage could be limited to repairable damage,
                                     even in a major earthquake.

10.2-f	 Require Geotechnical Investigations for Proposed Critical Structures. Require that
        geotechnical investigations be prepared for all proposed critical structures before
        construction or approval of building permits, if deemed necessary. Critical struc-
        tures include police stations, fire stations, emergency equipment storage buildings,
        water towers, wastewater lift stations, electrical substations, fuel storage facilities,
        large public assembly buildings, designated emergency shelters, buildings three or
        more stories high, and any others deemed at the time of application. The investiga-
        tion shall include estimation of the maximum credible earthquake, maximum ground
        acceleration, duration, and the potential for ground failure because of liquefaction or
        differential settling.
10.2-g	 Require Investigations for All Development On Sites Where Soils Pose Risk. Require
        soils reports for new development projects where soils pose a potential geologic risk,
        and use the information to determine appropriate permitting requirements, if deemed
        necessary.
10.2-h	 Require Erosion Control Plans. Require new development to include grading and
        erosion control plans prepared by a qualified engineer or land surveyor.
10.3	 Flooding and Drainage
Flood Zones
Flood risk is a consequence of rainfall characteristics, topography, water features, vegetation and
soil coverage, impermeable surfaces, and urban stormwater management infrastructure. Turlock
has an extremely low risk of a major flood event. While there are rivers in the vicinity of the
Turlock, the Study Area’s only water features are irrigation canals, stormwater detention ponds,
and a few small freshwater ponds. No part of the Study Area is within either the FEMA-desig-
nated 100-year or 500-year flood plain.
Due to its flat terrain, Turlock can occasionally experience shallow flooding after heavy rainfall
in the winter months. Although major flooding is not anticipated, as agricultural and open space
lands are converted to urban uses, there will be an increase in stormwater runoff from addi-
tional impervious surfaces. To minimize those impacts, General Plan policies seek to manage
                                                                                                    SAFETY | 10-15

                             stormwater runoff, through the permitting process, good stormwater management practices, and
                             the construction of drainage basins. See also Section 3.3, Infrastructure.
                             Dam Safety and Inundation Hazard
                             The previous General Plan reported that the New Don Pedro Dam presented a potential flooding
                             hazard to the Study Area in the case of maximum water releases. Current dam inundation hazard
                             mapping by the California Emergency Management Agency shows the Turlock Study Area to be
                             entirely outside the Dam Inundation Area for New San Pedro Dam.
                             As shown on Figure 10-3, Geologic and Flooding Hazards, an area in the far southwest of the
                             Study Area falls within the Dam Inundation Area for New Exchequer Dam, located on the
                             Merced River in Mariposa County. This dam, completed in 1967, holds back just over one
                             million acre-feet of water in Lake McClure. Large-scale inundation could be called by dam
                             failure resulting from extreme storm, earthquake, or erosion of the embankment and foundation.
                             Stanislaus County and its cities have prepared a Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan.
                             The Plan, updated in 2010, identifies actions that will be taken to respond to flood-related emer-
                             gencies in the event that flooding occurs.

                             Fire and Emergency Services
                             Facilities and Staffing
                             The Turlock City Fire Department is an all risk department that provides fire and emergency
                             response within the city limits. Areas outside city limits but within the Study Area are served by
                             the Turlock Rural Fire District, the Keyes Fire Department, and the Denair Fire Department.
                             Urban growth according to the General Plan requires annexation, and new development will be
                             served by the City’s Fire Department.
                             The Turlock Fire Department operates four fire stations located in districts that are designed to
                             maximize efficiency and help reduce response times. There is one staffed fire engine at each of the
                             four fire stations with three firefighters on each engine. The current total staffing level is 13 line
                             personnel each day. The Department also operates a 110-foot aerial ladder truck (Truck 71) that is
                             used for suppression activities, air support, technical rescue, and light support. The truck is cross-
                             staffed by personnel at Fire Station No. 1. As of 2011, the Department had 45 line personnel and
                             four administrative staff. In addition to responding to fire and medical emergencies, Department
                             personnel also train and respond to Hazardous Materials and Technical Rescue calls, investigate
                             fire causes, conduct plan review and fire safety inspection, and provide CPR training and public
                             education, among other services.
                             As the City of Turlock plans for future growth, fire station location will be an important consid-
                             eration to meet demand for emergency calls and minimize the response times. The General Plan
                             anticipates that one new fire station will be developed with expansion into the Southeast master
                             plan areas. Existing and proposed fire stations are shown in Figure 10-4. The precise location of
                             future stations may change. A feasibility study should be conducted to analyze the impacts of the
                             City’s growth on the Fire Department.
                             Fire Threats
                             Turlock Fire Department responds to commercial and residential structure fires, vehicle fires,
                             rubbish fires, and vegetation fires. Grass fires occur in the urban interface area; on May 22, 2008,
                             a wind-driven grass fire burned about 100 acres and threatened several buildings.
10-18 | TURLOCK GENERAL PLAN

Wildland fire threats are greatest in mountain and foothill areas, where steep slopes, volatile veg-
etation, and windy conditions increase fire risk. Since the Study Area is almost all flat urbanized
or agricultural land, fire risk is low.
The characteristics of the urban environment in Turlock do not make it a high risk area for urban
fires—the building stock is in generally good condition and the City Fire Department provides
adequate service to the area. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has des-
ignated the entire Study Area as a Low Risk Area (LRA). Small areas at the northwest corner,
near Keyes, are designated as being moderately threatened (see Figure 10-4).
ISO Rating
The City of Turlock has an Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating of Class 3. A Class 3 ISO rating
indicates that the Fire Department has adequate facilities, personnel, equipment, and expertise
to serve the current population. As the City grows, the Department’s service capacity will need to
continue to increase in order to maintain this rating.
Emergency Response
Turlock adopted the Stanislaus County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, updated
in 2010. The plan identifies measures to reduce the impacts of natural and manmade hazards
and to facilitate the recovery and repair of structures if damage should occur from hazardous
events. Adoption of the plan ensures that Turlock is eligible for certain federal and State funds for
disaster recovery in case of such an event.
 Fire response time is typically measured as an average for the entire department, as well as for
each engine company. The Fire Department has maintained an average response time standard
of five minutes. The General Plan calls for the Fire Department to strive to achieve a standard of
a six-minute response time on average for all calls citywide.Training facilities are essential for the Water fire-flow capability must be regularly monitored

POLICE SERVICES
Facilities and Infrastructure
Police services within city limits are provided by the Turlock Police Department, while unincor-
porated parts of the Study Area are served by the Stanislaus County Sheriff and/or the California
Highway Patrol. As with fire protection, the Turlock Police Department will serve new growth
areas.
As of 2011, the Turlock Police Department has a staff of 125, 81 of whom are sworn patrol officers.
A 2007 Space Needs Assessment confirmed that existing facilities and staffing are not adequate
to maintain a sufficient level of service for future population growth. To address this concern, the
City is in the process of developing a new public safety facility for police and fire administration.
The new facility, to be located at 244 North Broadway, is to accommodate a projected staff of 262
by 2030, as calculated in the Needs Assessment.
While initially both the Police and Fire Departments will be housed in the new facility, the
Needs Assessment views the Fire Department space serving as the expansion area for the Police
Department over the long term (10 to 20 years), at which point the Fire Department would move
to an addition or to a new facility. In the meantime, housing the two departments together is
anticipated to improve response time, increase communication and teamwork between the two
departments, and allow efficient sharing of space.
At the same time, staff has emphasized the importance of recognizing the connection between
the location of new growth and policing needs. As soon as a new development project breaks
ground, officers are needed for general oversight and vandalism prevention. Development areas
that are noncontiguous and physically separated from the existing urbanized area can strain
existing police resources, as they require additional beats and expanded radio coverage. This
General Plan’s careful sequencing of growth areas, with priority given to areas in the Southeast
contiguous to existing neighborhoods, reduces the impact on the Police Department.
A critical element of police services is radio communication. The Turlock Police Department
Communications Center currently serves as a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and
provides primary dispatching services for four emergency service agencies including the Turlock
Police Department, the Turlock Fire Department, California State University – Stanislaus Police
Department (during certain days/hours) and the Gustine Police Department.
                                                                                                      SAFETY | 10-21

                             The infrastructure of the Turlock Police Communications Center also provides other depart-
                             ments and agencies inside and outside the City of Turlock with communication abilities. As
                             development continues in the City of Turlock, additional infrastructure may be necessary to
                             ensure adequate communication capacity. This includes but is not limited to a minimum radio
                             coverage ratio and minimum signal strength in and out of structures.
                             Community Oriented Policing
                             The City is interested in expanding its focus on Community Oriented Policing. Community
                             Oriented Policing is comprised of three key components including community partnerships,
                             organizational transformation, and problem solving. Community partnerships involve collab-
                             orative relationships between the law enforcement agency and the individuals and organizations
                             to develop solutions to problems and increase public trust. Organizational transformation aligns
                             management, structure, personnel, and information systems to support community partnerships
                             and problem-solving efforts. Problem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and sys-
                             tematic examination of issues to develop and evaluate effective responses.
                             The Police Department is focused on continually improving its operations and effectiveness.
                             Some of the Department’s strategic goals are summarized below.
                             Organizational Transformation
                             The Department aims to improve its climate and culture by reinforcing a commitment to the
                             community policing philosophy and the strategic plan, being proactive, and being transparent.
                             Leadership, labor unions, and front-line officers all have a responsibility to work as partners.

                             The Department’s relationship to the community should be enhanced, by encouraging officers
                             to take a team approach to problem solving; devoting enough human and financial resources to
                             community policing; and considering geographic deployment plans to enhance customer service
                             and facilitate more contact between police and citizens.
                             Problem Solving
                             Problem-solving involves a series of steps, from scanning to analysis to response and assessment.
                             Effective scanning involves a careful examination of basic problems and their scope. Analysis

requires an undstanding of the dynamics of the problem and the limits of current responses,
toward identification of an effective and appropriate response. Response strategies should then be
continually assessed.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a crime prevention philosophy
that proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in fear and
incidents of crime and an improved quality of life. The goal of CPTED is to reduce opportunities
for crime that may be inherent in the design of structures or neighborhoods. CPTED evaluates
environmental conditions and utilizes intervention methods to control human / criminal
behavior and reduce fear of crime.
The Turlock Police Department recognizes the value of CPTED and intends to evaluate the fea-
sibility of implementing a comprehensive CPTED program. See Section 6.7, Urban Design for
related policies.
Part One Crime Ratio
Uniform crime reporting is a collective effort on the part of city, county, state, tribal, and federal
law enforcement agencies to present a nationwide view of crime. Agencies throughout the
country participating in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program provide summarized
reports on eight Part I offenses known to law enforcement and reports on persons arrested. The
Turlock Police Department submits crime reports monthly to a centralized crime records facility
in California. The California UCR Program then forwards the data, using uniform offense def-
initions, to the FBI’s national UCR Program. The FBI compiles, publishes, and distributes the
data to participating agencies, state UCR Programs and others interested in the Nation’s crime
data.
UCR requires crimes to be categorized in one of two classifications, Part I or Part II. Part I
crimes are the more serious and include criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, larceny – theft (except motor vehicle), motor vehicle theft, and arson. Figure
10-5 depicts the Part I crime ratio in the City of Turlock over the last ten years.
Over the last several years, the Turlock Police Department has significantly reduced the Part I
crime rate thereby creating a more desirable degree of safety and quality of life throughout the
                                                                                                       SAFETY | 10-23

                                  community. As the city expands through development a key consideration will be the potential
                                  impact to the crime rate. The police department will require the facilities, equipment, resources,
                                  partnerships, and staffing to ensure the crime rate does not increase as a result of development.

                                  Response Times and Available Time
                                  Response times are measured from the time a call for service is received until the time a police
                                  employee arrives. Response times are categorized by priority. Priority 1 is the most urgent call
                                  for service while Priority 3 poses no immediate, ongoing risk to the public. The following table
                                  represents the average response times for Priority 1, Priority 2, and Priority 3 calls for the last
                                  ten years. The Turlock Police Department has standardized Priority 1 response times of 6.5
                                  minutes. The impact additional development may have on standardized response time should be
                                  a consideration.

The amount of time a police officer has to engage in proactive activities in known as “Available
Time.” The Turlock Police Department recognizes the value of proactive policing strategies. This
includes education, enforcement, community relations, quality of life concerns, and community
oriented policing activities. Adequate staffing levels are directly related to the percentage of
officer available time.
Public Employees per 1,000 Residents
The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) produces
a report compiled from a representative sample of law enforcement agencies nationwide.
According to the December 2010 report, for communities of 50,000 to 99,999 residents, the
nationwide average number of sworn police officers is 1.8 per 1,000 residents. In 2010, the number
of sworn officers per capita in the City of Turlock was 1.2, up from 0. 8 in 2006. While this ratio
should not be used as the sole gauge for adequate police staffing, it is an important tool for long
term staffing trend analysis and its correlation to the crime index. As development continues in
Turlock it will be necessary to ensure that police service adjusts to an increased population.

Implementing Policies
Fire Service
10.4-i	 Meet Response Time Standard Throughout Study Area. Adequately distribute fire-
        fighting equipment and personnel throughout the Sphere of Influence to ensure quick
        response time (strive to achieve 5 minute response time to all calls within the primary
        service area of each fire station, 90% of the time). Critical factors that affect response
        times are station locations and road circulation patterns.
10.4-j	 Coordinate Facilities Planning With Urban Expansion. As part of master planning
        for areas outside current City limits, determine an appropriate location for new fire
        stations/facilities, based on the configuration and phasing of new development and
        urban expansion. Ease of access and efficient service areas should be major determi-
        nants. When preparing master plans, assess the ability of the Fire Department to meet
        established service standards, and identify strategies to mitigate potential service
        impacts. Ensure that the Capital Facility Fee program, the Community Facilities District
        #2 and any other funding mechanisms are updated to provide adequate funding of
        required facilities, equipment, apparatus and services.
10.4-k	 Maintain Mutual Aid Agreements. Maintain mutual aid agreements with other fire and
        emergency service departments in Stanislaus County.
10.4-l	 Monitor Water Capacity. Continue to monitor water fire-flow capability throughout the
        City and improve water availability if any locations have flows considered inadequate
        for fire protection.
10.4-m	 Maintain Appropriate Urban Design Standards. Roadways shall be developed in
        accordance with General Plan standards contained in Chapter 5 of the General Plan.
        Deviations from roadway standards shall not be granted unless it is determined by the
        Fire Department and the City Engineer that is shall have no impact on the delivery of
        fire services to the affected area.
10.4-n	 Enforce Fire Safety Codes. Continue enforcement of all aspects of Chapter 4-3 of the
        Municipal Code, Fire Codes and Administration.
10.4-o	 Maintain ISO Rating. Strive to maintain the City’s Class 3 ISO rating, or better, for fire
        protection. As necessary, identify and implement additional financing mechanisms.
10.4-p	 Training Facilities. Ensure that training facilities are maintained and upgraded as
        needed.
                                                                                                   SAFETY | 10-27

                                     necessary the Police Department’s beat system to provide high quality and efficient
                                     crime deterrence, ensure a minimal response time, and optimize police available time
                                     throughout the City as it grows.
                                     The Police Department strives to achieve a 6.5-minute response time to all Priority 1
                                     calls, and will consider developing a performance indicator for police available time.
                             10.4-r	 Community Crime Prevention Programs. Continue and encourage existing community
                                     crime prevention programs such as Neighborhood Watch, PAL, DARE, and gang
                                     awareness, to help deter crime throughout the City.
                             10.4-s	 Emphasize Community-Oriented Policing. Maintain the commitment to the
                                     Community Oriented Policing philosophy implemented in 1993. Implement the
                                     Community Oriented Policing Program through cooperative staff efforts and
                                     necessary funding.

                                     ships that develop responsible ownership for public safety in Turlock. The policy is
                                     accomplished as follows:
                                     •	 Educate the public in how they can improve their personal safety;
                                     •	 Use a proactive and preventative approach that is issue-oriented;
                                     •	 Support innovative approaches to problem-solving;
                                     •	 Establish mutual trust and communication among Police Services staff and the
                                        community;
                                     •	 Provide positive role models and values through activities in the neighborhoods
                                        and community as a whole.
                                     •	 Utilize an ongoing evaluative and flexible approach to community safety.
                                     •	 Apply professional service and equitable application of the law.

Islands, including the largest one, comprising approximately 50 acres. Low density residential
development is the predominant land use, with a significant number of vacant and/or underuti-
lized parcels.
The lot sizes, development density, and parcel pattern within the County Islands create a signif-
icant opportunity for introduction of new streets and parcel subdivisions on a lot-by-lot basis.
The illustrative plan shown here would provide an attractive neighborhood street network,
adding value and allowing owners to subdivide. The new streets would allow the area to avoid
an overabundance of “flag lots” and overuse of existing, substandard streets, while creating a
new neighborhood feel. Subdivision of large lots would create opportunities for a denser, more
connected neighborhood while retaining the area’s single family character. Improvements to the
street and infrastructure system would be financed by the subdivision process. Overall, approx-
imately 200 new single family lots could be created in the County Islands in the Montana-West
Master Plan Area.
This lotting plan is meant as an illustrative example that would retain the predominantly single-
family character of the area. A strategic plan as described in Chapter 3 should be done to evaluate
whether development at this density would support infrastructure improvements meeting City
standards. Medium and high-density development may be an appropriate alternative for some
sites.

Appendix B: Capital Facilities Fee Update
Roadway Improvements
Table B-1 lists the roadway improvements to be incorporated in to the Capital Facilities Fee
(CFF) update. The facilities are illustrated in Figure 5-2, the General Plan Circulation Diagram
at buildout. New local streets and collectors in master plan areas will be funded by the master
plan fees for those respective areas; however, some new collectors are shown in this table to illus-
trate their relationship to the overall circulation network.

1   Introduction
1.1   Purpose and Scope of the Housing Element
The Housing Element, a component of the City of Turlock’s General Plan, presents a comprehen-
sive set of housing policies and actions for the years 2015-2023. It builds on an assessment of Tur-
lock’s housing needs (including the Regional Housing Needs Allocation distributed by the State
through the Stanislaus Council of Governments) and an evaluation of existing housing programs,
available land, and constraints on housing production.
Major programs being continued include the City’s First-Time Homebuyers, Mobile Home Rent-
al Assistance, and Housing Rehabilitation Loan programs; City financial assistance for affordable
housing and service providers; and initiatives that facilitate ongoing provision of affordable and
market-rate housing in the city, including the acquisition and rehabilitation of foreclosed homes;
targeted reinvestment programs; County island incorporation; an RFP process to facilitate non-
profits’ access to City housing funds; and coordination with low-wage employers to provide hous-
ing assistance information. One new program is being added to support the commencement of
Phase II of the Avena Bella development, which will provide 60 new one and two bedroom units
for extremely low-, very low- and low-income households.
Typically, the State requires an update of a jurisdiction’s Housing Element every eight years. The
time period covered by the current Regional Housing Needs Allocation extends from January 1,
2014, to September 30, 2023.
This Housing Element is organized to address all of the topics required by State law. Specifically,
the Element describes:
     •   A review the accomplishments over the last Housing Element cycle (Chapter 2),
     •   Population and employment trends (Chapter 3),
     •   Households characteristics and housing stock characteristics (Chapter 3),
     •   Special housing needs (Chapter 3),
     •   Opportunities for energy conservation (Chapter 3),
     •   Existing assisted housing and potential risk of conversion to market rates (Chapter 3),
     •   A detailed site inventory addressing availability and suitability for affordable housing de-
         velopment (Chapter 4),
                                                                                                  1-1

Turlock Housing Element
     •   Quantified objectives that estimate the maximum number of units, by income level, to be
         constructed, rehabilitated or conserved over the planning period of the element (Chapter
         4),
     •   Governmental and non-governmental constraints (Chapter 5), and
     •   A new five-year housing program with goals, policies, and implementation programs
         (Chapter 6) (Government Code Section 65583).
Please see Appendix B for a complete summary of State law requirements and where these re-
quirements are addressed in this Housing Element.
1.2   Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Turlock Housing Element was last comprehensively updated, certified, and adopted in 2012.
The Housing Element must be consistent with the other elements in a city’s general plan. Tur-
lock’s current General Plan was adopted in 1993, partially revised in 2002, and comprehensively
updated in 2012. This Housing Element is consistent with the current General Plan; as the Gen-
eral Plan is updated, the City will ensure continued consistency with the Housing Element.
1.3   Information Sources
The information for this Housing Element Update came from a variety of sources. Sources used
include, but are not limited to: the U.S. Census (Censuses 2000 and 2010), the 2013 American
Community Survey, the Stanislaus County Housing Authority, the California Economic Devel-
opment Department, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Turlock city
staff.
1.4   Public Participation and Outreach
An important source of guidance in the development of this Housing Element was the wider Tur-
lock community. Public outreach conducted as part of this Housing Element update included:
     •   Housing Stakeholders/Community Forum. On April 23, 2015, the City of Turlock held a
         forum for community members and stakeholders in the Turlock Housing Element. The
         forum took place at City Hall in from 3:00 pm until 4:30 pm. An invitation was extended
         by postal mail and/or email to 189 individuals representing local non-profit organiza-
         tions, religious groups, and city and/or county agencies. As a result of this effort, three
         members of the community attended the forum.
     •   City Council/Planning Commission Study Sessions. As a follow-up to the community fo-
         rum and policy workshop, study sessions on the Housing Element for the Planning
         Commission and City Council were conducted on May 7, 2015, and September 3, 2015,
         respectively. At these sessions, the Council and Commission were briefed on the Housing
         Element update process, recent housing trends, and stakeholders’ concerns. Members
         were asked for their feedback and able to discuss the major issues and policies proposed.

    •   City Council/Planning Commission Hearings. The Planning Commission Public Hearing
         regarding the adoption of the Draft Housing Element occurred on September 3, 2015.
         The City Council’s Public Hearing regarding the adoption of the Draft Housing Element
         occurred on October 27, 2015.
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK
Stakeholders/Community Forum
The results of the Stakeholder/Community Forum were compiled for City staff. Participants dis-
cussed the following questions:
    1.   What do you see as the current trends in housing development in Turlock? What are the
         city’s greatest housing needs? Consider:
              a.   Pros and cons of current housing trends
              b.   Major housing challenges
              c.   Preferred types of housing
              d.   Greatest unmet housing needs
              e.   Housing needs of special needs groups
    2.   What are key constraints to meeting Turlock’s housing needs? What can the City do to
         remove these constraints?
    3.   How can the City better address the housing needs of special populations? Groups to con-
         sider include:
              a.   Seniors
              b.   Youth
              c.   Large families
              d.   Single parents
              e.   Extremely low income households
              f.   Homeless
              g.   Farm workers
              h.   Persons with disabilities (mental, physical, developmental, etc.)
              i.   Other?
    4.   What are the housing programs or services that you or your target groups utilize? What
         works well, and what does not? What additional policies and programs should the City
         consider for inclusion in the Housing Element?
                                                                                                   1-3

Turlock Housing Element
Forum attendees included representatives from United Samaritans Foundation (USF) and WeC-
are Turlock, as well as an advocate for the homeless. The discussion covered the above questions,
and focused on identifying needs and constraints in the community.
Participants named several key housing needs in Turlock. These included emergency shelter and
transitional housing for the homeless and safe, affordable rental units for low-income households.
In particular, participants expressed a need for smaller units (studio or one bedroom apartments),
especially for those transitioning out of homelessness. Concerns were also raised about the im-
pacts of the recent economic recession on residents’ ability to purchase housing, noting that many
households that lost their homes due to foreclosures are now in rental units, thus increasing the
demand for affordable rental properties. While the neediest groups mentioned included the disa-
bled and chronically homeless (including homeless youth), emphasis was placed on the general
need for affordable housing for low-income individuals and families (independent of any other
condition) who were currently falling on hard times. They pointed out that large families in this
situation often end up doubling up in housing units, leading to overcrowded conditions. Regard-
ing the homeless population, those familiar with the situation called attention to the need for a
range of housing and support services for this population—emergency, supportive, and transi-
tional housing—in order to help residents break the cycle of homelessness.
Many of the constraints discussed during the forum focused on issues related to homelessness.
Participants agreed that the City’s cap of 200 total shelter beds per zone, which does not distin-
guish between permanent and seasonal beds, places greater limitations on the amount of emer-
gency shelter the City can provide than is required by State law (SB 2). In addition, it was noted
that while the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) makes it easier for homeless
providers to track the number of individuals served, there is still some amount of mistrust and
fear of being tracked, so not every individual participates. This creates a barrier to accurate re-
porting and service provision that is difficult to overcome. Finally, it was suggested that the City
consider including a legislative platform in the Housing Element that lists the ways that housing is
restricted by governmental constraints (i.e. those imposed by the State and/or federal law) that are
outside of the City’s direct control.
Comments on Public Review Draft
In response to the Turlock Housing Element Public Review Draft, one letter was received from
Self-Help Enterprises (SHE), a nonprofit developer of affordable housing in Central California.
SHE reported having a generally positive experience working with the City of Turlock to provide
affordable housing. However, SHE expressed concern about the burden that development and
impact fees place on the construction of new housing in Turlock. To alleviate this burden for de-
velopments that include affordable units, SHE would like the City to consider the establishment
of a fee deferral program for units that are serving low-income households. Fee deferrals should
be long term (up to 30 years), though fees would be due and payable if the unit was sold, re-
financed, or no longer occupied by the owner.
The suggestions from the community forum, comments received, and other public input were
used to identify Housing Element priorities and new programs, as well as to tailor existing pro-
grams to better serve the community.

2          Program Accomplishments
The California Department of Housing and Community Development requires jurisdictions to
review their existing Housing Elements in order to evaluate:
1. “The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals
     and objectives,”
2. “The progress of the City, County, or City and County in implementation of the Housing
     Element,” and
3. “The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the
     attainment of the state housing goal.” (Government Code Section 65588(a))
The following sections address these State requirements.
2.1 Effectiveness of Previous Housing Element
This section discusses the City of Turlock’s successes in implementing the quantified objectives of
the previous Housing Element. Table 2.1-1 summarizes the City’s effectiveness in each of the
areas outlined in the Housing Element: new construction, preservation, rehabilitation, and family
assistance. Each topic is discussed in greater detail below.

Turlock Housing Element
NEW CONSTRUCTION AND PERMITTING
The State’s housing goal is met by an assignment of allocations of housing unit goals to regional
governments, which in turn allocate the housing unit goals to counties and cities. The document
produced by regional governments that allocates housing unit goals is referred to as the “Regional
Housing Needs Assessment” (RHNA). The RHNA for Turlock’s existing Housing Element
covered the years 2007 through 2014.
During the last Housing Element cycle, the City of Turlock was able to designate adequate sites
for meeting its RHNA requirement and did not have to zone any land to do so. Moreover, the
City saw the construction of 1,031 new housing units during the planning period, amounting to
36 percent of its RHNA objective. Many uncontrollable factors influenced the City’s effectiveness.
Over the seven-year Housing Element period, various factors such as market fluctuations,
available programs, willing lenders, qualified developers and the political climate, all combined to
influence the amount of new housing built in the city. Table 2.1-2 shows the breakdown of
housing units permitted or constructed in each income group in Turlock during the last planning
period.

Construction activity declined significantly in Turlock during the previous planning period,
especially for the very low- and above moderate-income units, in concert with the national
housing market.
PRESERVATION
There were no publicly-assisted housing development identified at risk of converting to market
rate rents during the previous planning period.
REHABILITATION
Program 4-2-1a of the 2007-2014 Housing Element stated that it was the City’s goal to rehabilitate
10 units per year during the planning period through rehabilitation grants and loans. The City
continued marketing the rehabilitation program to qualifying low and moderate income
households, but only awarded one $7500 forgivable rehabilitation grant to one household.
HOUSEHOLD ASSISTANCE
The 2007-2014 Housing Element did not quantify its objectives for aiding households. However,
the City did act upon numerous programs that prescribe strategies for assisting Low and

Moderate income households. For instance, approximately 144 extremely low-, very low-, and
low-income households received down payment assistance through the City’s First Time
Homebuyer Program. The City funded and implemented curb, gutter, and sidewalk
improvements benefiting nine households on N. Soderquist Road. Four families received
relocation assistance to mitigate the impacts of having to move while publicly-funded housing
was rehabilitated.

2.3 Appropriateness of Goals, Objectives, and Policies
The City of Turlock has been generally effective in accomplishing the goals laid out in the 2007-
2014 Housing Element. The City successfully sought and was awarded approximately $18 million
in federal and State funding for assisting low and moderate income families. Some of this funding
was used to continue the City’s successful First Time Homebuyers Program and the
Rehabilitation Program, as well as for necessary public infrastructure improvements in designated
neighborhoods. Information about these programs, the new comprehensive Community
Resource Handbook, and a list of affordable housing developments are all now available on the
City’s website.
Numerous affordable housing developments serving diverse population groups were built and
permitted during this period as well. For example, the 80-unit first phase of the Avena Bella
affordable housing project was completed, serving larger extremely low-, very low-, and low-
income households with two and three bedroom units. The City also permitted and/or
constructed 30 percent of the housing units allocated to it by the RHNA, including roughly 70
percent of its allocated low- and moderate-income units.
The goals, objectives, and policies established for the 2007-2014 Housing Element were
appropriate for the City of Turlock and serve as the basis for the policies in the 2015-2023
Housing Element. City staff has carefully reviewed the effectiveness and appropriateness of the
existing policies; successful ones are kept, and less successful and/or obsolete policies are
amended or removed. In addition, new policies have been introduced that respond to community
and stakeholder concerns, major identified needs and constraints, and the current economic
climate. The policies in this Housing Element have also been updated to comply with recent
changes in relevant legislation.
                                                                                             2-36

3        Housing Needs Assessment
The purpose of this chapter is to summarize and analyze the existing population, employment,
and housing conditions and identify specific housing needs in the City of Turlock. It consists of
six major sections: population and employment trends, household trends, housing stock
characteristics, special housing needs analysis, energy conservation opportunities, and projected
housing needs.
3.1 Population and Employment Trends
It is important to analyze demographic variables, such as population, employment, and
households, in order to assess the present and future housing needs of the City of Turlock. This
section utilizes sources, such as the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census Reports, the 2013 American
Community Survey, State Department of Finance (Demographic Research Unit), Bureau of Labor
Statistics, and Stanislaus County Council Governments (StanCOG).
POPULATION TRENDS
County Population Growth Trends
The City of Turlock is part of the Stanislaus Council of Governments (StanCOG). StanCOG is
comprised of nine cities and Stanislaus County. Between 2000 and 2010, Stanislaus County
population increased by 67,456 persons at an average annual growth rate of 1.5 percent. However,
population growth slowed in the following years due to the lingering effects of the 2008 recession.
Between 2010 and 2013, the County grew by 3,868 persons at an average annual rate of 0.3
percent. In 2013, Stanislaus County had an estimated population of 518,321. Five counties
surround Stanislaus County: San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Merced, Tuolumne, and Calaveras. As
shown in Table 3.1-1, of these counties, Stanislaus County had the third highest percentage
growth between 2000 and 2010 and the fourth highest between 2010 and 2013. Stanislaus County
is the third most populated county in the region, behind Santa Clara and San Joaquin.
                                                                                                3-1

Public and private entities that project population cite a variety of factors driving the recent
growth in the Central Valley in general and Stanislaus County in particular. According to the
Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), over half of the growth in the Central Valley has been
due to migration. Job growth, affordable housing, and strong family relationships are the primary
reasons for migrating to the Central Valley. Although most of the migration comes from coastal
California where housing is less affordable, an additional component is also generated from
outside the U.S. (e.g. Latin America, Asia). Additionally, the Central Valley’s newest residents are
more likely than those who move away from the region to be married and have children.
According to the Stanislaus County of Governments (StanCOG), another factor driving
population growth in the County is a significant growth in interregional commuters. Specifically,
the County is expected to expand its role as a “bedroom community” for residents who commute
to their jobs in areas such as the Bay Area or Sacramento. StanCOG projects that the Stanislaus
region will add 250,000 people between 2010 and 2040 at an average annual growth rate of 1.6
percent. During this period, the employment growth rate is not expected to keep pace with
population, increasing at a lower annual rate of 1.2 percent. This discrepancy indicates that the
County’s number of interregional commuters will likely continue to increase over the next few
decades. However, more localized data suggest that this trend may be driven by Modesto, the
County’s largest city, given its closer proximity to employment centers outside the County. It
appears less applicable to Turlock.
City Population Growth Trends
Turlock, with an estimated population of 69,185 in 2013, is the second most populated city in the
region behind Modesto, with 202,629 people. The City of Turlock added 12,739 people from 2000
to 2010, at an average annual growth rate of 2.3 percent. By contrast, Modesto grew by less than
one percent per year over the same period. However, Turlock’s population growth slowed
significantly between 2010 and 2013, increasing by less than a third of a percent annually during
this period. Nonetheless, growth in Turlock accounts for 19 percent of the growth within
Stanislaus County between 2000 and 2013. Table 3.1-2 compares Turlock’s growth to that of its
neighboring cities.

Projected Population Growth
As demonstrated in Table 3.1-3, Turlock’s annual percentage growth has dropped significantly in
recent years as a result of the recent economic downturn.

It is important to note that recent economic conditions placed a strain on the Central Valley that
may require a longer recovery period than other areas of the State. The Central Valley’s relatively
high growth rates over the last twenty-five years is largely attributable to its role in providing low-
cost housing and employment opportunities that are particularly attractive to immigrant
populations, primarily related to agriculture and food processing. Following the economic
downturn, many Central Valley towns experienced unemployment rates three to four times the
national average with some of the highest foreclosure rates in the Country.
These conditions are exacerbated by drought issues. As California's drought enters its fourth year
in 2015, an ongoing lack of water continues to prevent farmers from planting crops and has
created even more job losses.1 Until these conditions stabilize, growth will likely continue to occur
at a substantially slower rate in the short-term. Assuming that water issues can be overcome—
which is a large assumption—growth rates will probably increase in the medium and long term.
The Turlock General Plan projects a population of 104,500 in 2030.

Turlock Housing Element
Age
The age group showing the most growth from 2000 to 2013 was ages 45 to 64, representing
members of the baby boom generation. The 15 to 24 age group and the senior population, age 65
and over, grew steadily over this time period, while the 0 to 14 and 25 to 44 age groups dropped in
overall percentage. Table 3.1-4 shows the breakdown of Turlock’s population by age in 2000, 2010
and 2013.

Between 2000 and 2010, the median age in Turlock increased from 30.9 to 32.5 years of age,
which implies a slowly aging population. The median age in 2013 is estimated at 33.3. The City
and County median age has been consistently slightly lower than that of the State. In 2010, when
the State median age was 35.2 years, while the City and County median ages were 32.5 years and
32.9 years, respectively. Over the next three years, the median age in the County and the State
stayed nearly constant, while the City median age increased by nearly one year to 33.3, as shown
below in Chart 3.1-1.

Historical employment growth reflects the lingering effects of the recent economic downturn.
Overall, Stanislaus County saw a loss of 4,192 jobs between 2010 and 2013, 1,369 of which were in
Turlock. As a result of the foreclosure crisis, the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing industry and
Construction industry showed significant decreases both regionally and locally. However, some
industries showed growth during this period, including Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and
Hunting, which grew by 9.7 percent in the County and 18.9 percent in Turlock. This is
particularly notable given the financial hardship experienced by the farming community as a
result of the ongoing California drought discussed earlier. Unless water conditions stabilize in the
Central Valley, this industry will likely experience decline in the coming years. Table 3.1-8 shows
change in share of employment by industry sector in Stanislaus County and Turlock from 2010 to
2013.

 Labor Force Trends
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were approximately 33,500 persons in the
 Turlock labor force in 2014. Recently, the unemployment rate is slowly beginning to fall from its
 ten-year high of 13.3 percent in 2010, though as Table 3.1-9 demonstrates, it has been hovering
 around 10 percent for the past couple of years. Given that the City experienced its lowest periods
 of unemployment, generally around six percent, in 2005-2007, Turlock has yet to return to pre-
 recession levels of employment.

3.2 Household Trends
The change in the number and types of households in a city is one of the prime determinants of
the demand for housing. Households can form and change even in periods of static population
growth through adult children leaving home, divorce, and with the aging of the population.
HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND FORMATION
Total Households
Annual household growth in Turlock was fairly strong between 1990 and 2010, showing an
average annual growth rate of approximately 2.5 percent over that period. This was roughly one
percent higher than the average annual household growth Stanislaus County experienced during
the same time.
Between 2010 and 2013, growth slowed significantly in both the City and the County, as it did in
the entire region following the economic downturn. During this time frame, the number of
households in Turlock increased by 0.8 percent per year, approximately a half percent greater
than population growth, which was 0.3 percent per year. By contrast, annual household growth in
Stanislaus County was 0.3 percent per year, which mirrored population growth in these years.
Table 3.2-1 shows household formation trends in Turlock and Stanislaus County since 1990.

Household Size
Along with the persons-per-household figures, household size helps to determine the size of
housing units needed within a jurisdiction. In the City of Turlock, “large” households containing
five or more persons represented 14 percent of all households in 2013, whereas 52 percent were
“small” households with one or two persons. According to the 2013 American Community
Survey, the number of large households decreased between 2010 and 2013, from 17 percent in
2010 to 14 percent in 2013. The number of small households increased from 49 percent to 52
percent of the total, while three- and four-person households remained relatively constant. The

feedback from service providers at the April 23 community/stakeholders housing forum confirms
that there is a greater need for smaller rental units than larger ones.
Household sizes in Stanislaus County vary only slightly from those in the City of Turlock.
Roughly 49 percent of the households in the County were “small” in 2013. While “large”
households made up a somewhat larger share of the total in Stanislaus County than in Turlock
(18 percent versus 14 percent), this share also decreased since 2010. Table 3.2-2 shows household
size trends in Turlock and Stanislaus County.

Persons per Household
The number of persons per household ratio is an important indicator of the relationship between
population growth and household formation. For example, if the number of persons per
household is decreasing, then households are forming at a faster rate than population growth.
Conversely, if population is growing faster than households, then the persons per household
would be increasing.
As shown in Table 3.2-3, between 1990 and 2013, the number of persons per household has
remained relatively constant for the City of Turlock and Stanislaus County. Specifically, the City
of Turlock rose from 2.9 persons per household in 1990 to 3.0 persons per household in 2000,
before dropping back down to 2.9 persons per household in 2013. This indicates that population
growth has closely mirrored household formation over this time period. In Stanislaus County, the
number of persons per household rose slightly between 1990 and 2000, but has remained constant
ever since.

HOUSING TENURE
Tenure, or the number of homeowner and renter households, can be affected by many factors,
including housing cost (influenced by interest rates, economics, land supply, and development
constraints), housing type, housing availability, job availability, public agencies and consumer
preference.
During the period 1990 to 2000, the proportion of renter households declined from 48 percent of
the households to 44 percent of the City of Turlock. However, between 2010 and 2013 the
percentage of renter households increased, reaching 47 percent in 2013. This recent increase in
renter households can be primarily attributed to the foreclosure crisis that resulted from the 2008
recession.
Stanislaus County has consistently had a lower proportion of renter households than the City of
Turlock. Table 3.2-4 compares household tenure of Turlock and Stanislaus County. Renter
households accounted for approximately 39 percent of the total between 1990 and 2010,
increasing to 42 percent in 2013. Traditionally, college students attending California State
University, Stanislaus account for Turlock’s higher proportion of renter households.

$35,000 decreased slightly from 26 percent to 24 percent. Table 3.2-6 shows household income by
cohort.

INCOME COHORTS
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the California Department
of Housing and Community Development (HCD) estimate Area Median Incomes (AMI)
annually for each county or metropolitan area. In turn, these AMIs are used to create qualifying
criteria in many housing programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG),
HOME Investment Partnerships, and Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). HCD defined
the 2014 AMI for a family of four in Stanislaus County as $62,000, while HUD defined Median
Family Income (MFI) for the Modesto MSA (Stanislaus County) as $52,700. The higher HCD
median reflects that incomes and the cost of living are somewhat higher in California than they
are nationwide. However, income categories based on HUD’s MFI might apply in certain
situations, such as when federal funds are used to support specific programs.
In addition to estimated annual income, HCD has established standard income groups. They are
defined as: (1) Extremely Low Income, which are households earning less than 30 percent of AMI;
(2) Very Low Income, which are households earning between 30 and 50 percent of the AMI; (3)
Low Income, for households earning between 50 percent and 80 percent of the AMI; (4)
Moderate Income, for households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the AMI, and;
(5) Above Moderate Income are households earning over 120 percent of the AMI. Generally,
these categories are used to determine household eligibility for federal and local programs.
Table 3.2-7 shows the income ranges for each income category based on the fiscal year 2014
Stanislaus County AMI for a four-person household, which is $62,000. This table also shows the
estimated distribution of all Turlock households by these income categories for 2000 and 2010.
However, it is important to note that not every household in each income category has four
people. For instance, while in 2013 2,772 households in Turlock had annual incomes less than
$18,600, some of those are households of only one or two people, while others are households of
three, four, or more people. The category descriptor “Extremely Low” in this case only applies to
those households making $18,600 or less and that also have four or more people.

Due to the limitations of this income data, we supplement it with some general estimates of the
distribution of households in 2007-2011 by HUD income categories, this time from a different
source (Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy, or CHAS, data). These are reflected in
Table 3.2-8 below.

Comparing Tables 3.2-7 and 3.2-8, we see that the two data sources and time periods show
relatively similar breakdowns of Turlock households by income category. Both sources consider
all household sizes, rather than just four-person households; therefore, they both likely
overestimate the number of larger households in the Extremely Low and Very Low income
cohorts. In line with this data, Turlock expects the share of households with Extremely Low
incomes to remain about the same in the future as measured in 2013: around 10 percent of all
households.
CHAS data also provides information on the tenure of Extremely Low income households. From
2007-2011, 83 percent of Extremely Low income households were renters, and 17 percent were
owners.
OVERPAYMENT
Overpayment is an important measure of the affordability of housing in the City of Turlock.
Overpayment for housing considers the total shelter cost for a household compared to their
ability to pay. Specifically, overpayment is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent
of a household's income. According to the Census, shelter cost is the monthly owner costs
(mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes,
insurance on the property, and utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average
monthly cost of utilities).
                                                                                                                  3-15

HUD’s State of the Cities Data System tracks housing cost burden through its Comprehensive
Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, the most recent of which is based off of the 2007-
2011 American Community Survey. Table 3.2-9 shows renter and owner households in Turlock
grouped into income categories.
Over 70 percent of Extremely Low and Very Low income owner households paid more than 30
percent of their incomes in housing costs; and about 50 percent experienced a housing cost
burden of over 50 percent. Over 85 percent of Extremely Low and Very Low income renter
households paid more than 30 percent of their incomes in housing costs, and the majority in both
categories experienced a housing cost burden greater than 50 percent. Most Low income owners
and renters paid more than 30 percent of their incomes in housing costs, and a significant portion
paid more than 50 percent of their income (33 percent for owners, 18 percent for renters). The
number of cost-burdened households drops as income increases, though renters were consistently
more cost-burdened than owners. Overall, 2011, 36 percent of owners and 54 percent of renters
had a cost burden of over 30 percent.

More recent data on overpayment is available for renter and owner households in Stanislaus
County through the 2013 American Community Survey. As Table 3.2-10 indicates, approximately
38 percent of all owner households and 59 percent of all renter households in the county were
overpaying in 2013. These values are close to the city-level percentages.

FORECLOSURES
In the aftermath of the economic recession, many communities are still battling the effects of
home foreclosures and vacancy. California experienced one of the highest rates of foreclosure in
the country, and the Central Valley was no exception. In Stanislaus County, an estimated 12,851
homes were foreclosed over an 18 month period from January 2007 to June 2008, reaching an 11
percent foreclosure rate. The City of Modesto experienced a nearly 11 percent foreclosure rate
during that time period, and the City of Turlock’s foreclosure rate was 9.6 percent. While other
communities were hit hard in the percentage of foreclosures, the City of Turlock reported in May
2009 that it continued to have numerous foreclosure filings. In addition, it identified that unlike
other cities hit by the foreclosure crisis, foreclosures in Turlock were not contained within a
specific neighborhood; every socio-economic group has been affected. While the low-income
neighborhoods were hit the hardest, no neighborhoods avoided the issue.
Based on an extensive citizen participation process, the City of Turlock and Stanislaus County
HOME Consortium 2010-2015 Strategic Plan determined that the primary community priority in
housing was abandoned and vacant units in neighborhoods, followed closely by foreclosure
prevention and rental assistance. The City was proactive in developing policies and programs to
help residents avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes. It secured $1.5 million in Neighborhood
Stabilization Program (NSP) funds, HUD’s emergency assistance program that helps state and
local governments acquire foreclosed properties that might otherwise become sources of blight. In
the HOME Consortium Annual Action Plan for the fiscal year 2013-2014, the City reported that it
had spent the entirety of the $1.5 million NSP grant. The program was concluded in July 2013.
Through the program, the City purchases nineteen foreclosed homes, rehabilitated them and sold
eighteen. Two of the units that were purchased and rehabbed were done to accommodate persons
with disabilities. In the latest HOME Consortium Annual Action Plan (2014-2015), the City of
Turlock indicated that it will contribute $10,000 toward the provision of fair housing services,
which includes foreclosure counseling and prevention.
The City has numerous resources for helping households facing foreclosure, which are published
on the Housing Program Services website and available at City Hall. Additionally, residents may
                                                                                                  3-17

HOUSING UNITS
According to the 2013 American Community Survey, Turlock had a total of occupied 23,394
housing units. Of these units, 12,430 were owner occupied and 10,864 were renter occupied. The
highest percentage of both owners and renters lived in single-family residences. Over 90 percent
of owner households lived in single-family detached homes. In renter households, 41 percent
lived in single-family detached homes, 12 percent lived in single-family attached homes, and 8
percent lived in 3-4 unit buildings. Table 3.3-1 displays housing type for owners and renters in

OVERCROWDING
Overcrowding is defined by the Census as more than one person per room living in a housing
unit (excluding kitchens, hallways, and porches). Generally, a room is defined as living room,
dining room, bedroom(s) and finished recreation room.
Table 3.3-3 compares overcrowding in 2000, 2007, and 2013. In 2000, 14.1 percent of the
households in the City were considered overcrowded. The 2007 American Community Survey
reports only 637 (2.8 percent) Turlock housing units as overcrowded, which is possibly due to the
homebuilding boom of the late 1990s to 2007. However, by 2013, that percentage had increased to
6.6 percent, which is likely correlated with the housing crisis. A much greater number of
overcrowded households were renter-occupied (78 percent) than owner-occupied (22 percent).
Table 3.3-4 displays overcrowding by tenure.

HOUSING CONDITIONS
Housing Age and Value
Turlock is still recovering from the economic recession, as shown by its current housing prices.
Tables 3.3-5 and 3.3-6 compare median housing values and monthly rents in Turlock in 2007 and
in 2013. In 2007, the American Community Survey estimated that the median value of homes
built between 1990 and 1999 was $385,200. In 2013, the median value for homes of this same
decade had dropped to $196,600, which is close to a 50 percent decrease. Similarly, in 2007, the
median value for houses built between 2000 and 2004 was $439,200, and $661,100 for houses built
between 2005 and 2007. This increase reflects the strong housing market at the time prior to the
housing bubble burst, characterized by escalating prices and the proliferation of large single-
family homes. In 2013, the American Community Survey estimated that houses built between
2000 and 2009 had a median current value of $250,000, a dramatic decline from 2007 sale
numbers. In addition, while Turlock currently has 3,467 houses that were built between 2000 and
2009, only 29 units have been built since 2010, indicating sluggish growth as a lingering result of
the economic downturn. The American Community Survey did not provide median value data
for houses built after 2010. As of 2009, the median value of an owner-occupied home was
$196,400, versus $363,400 in 2007.
In contrast, rents have gone up slightly in 2013 compared to 2007 median monthly rents. This
could be due to the fact that as demand for housing ownership went down and properties were
foreclosed, more households have been seeking rentals. In addition, little renter-occupied housing
has been built since 2010, meaning that the rental housing supply is staying constant while
demand is increasing. As of 2013, the median monthly rent was $960, versus $888 in 2007.

Housing Units in Need of Rehabilitation or Replacement
In 2003, Laurin Associates conducted a citywide survey of residential property to assess general
housing conditions. Units were evaluated by an exterior survey of quality, condition, and
improvement action. Survey results showed that 99.8 percent of housing units in Turlock were
either in sound condition or in need of minor repairs, such as patching paint or replacing a
window or roof patch. The City administers a rehabilitation loan program through its Housing
Division for households earning 80 percent of AMI or below, and it has been successful at
maintaining the city’s housing stock.
No similar survey of the city’s housing stock has been conducted since 2003. The closest
approximation for more recent data is from the 2013 American Community Survey, which tracks
the number of housing units with incomplete plumbing and kitchen facilities. According to the
Survey, less than one percent of units in Turlock had incomplete plumbing facilities in 2013, and
five percent had incomplete kitchen facilities. Data on incomplete plumbing and/or kitchen
facilities are shown in Table 3.3-7.

Current Housing Prices
While American Community Survey did not provide housing value data for houses built after
2010, data is available through other sources. DQ News, an online real estate data and
information source, reports that in February 2015, the median sales price of homes in Turlock
was $270,000, which represents a 20 percent increase from January 2014, when the median sales
price of homes was $224,750. From 2009 to 2014, the median sales price of homes increased by 14
percent, from $196,400 to $224,750. While median housing prices have not been restored to their
pre-recession value, these numbers show that Turlock’s recovery was initially slow, but has picked
up in the last year.
The real estate market overview from Trulia Real Estate Search (www.trulia.com) reported that
the median sales price of homes sold in Turlock for December 2014 to March 2015 was $255,000 .
This represents a 9 percent increase compared to the prior. As of March 4, 2015, 124 homes were
currently listed for sale in Turlock in Trulia’s database, with an average listing price of $341,472.

Additionally, Trulia listed 57 homes in the pre-foreclosure, bank-owned, or auction stage of the
foreclosure process in zip code 95380, and 54 in zip code 95382.
Assuming a 10 percent down payment, a 30 year term, and a 3.5 percent interest rate, monthly
payments on a $255,000 home (the median sales price in Turlock for December 2014 through
March 2015) would be approximately $1,037. Property taxes, private mortgage insurance
(typically required for borrowers with a down payment of less than 20 percent) and homeowners’
insurance would add approximately $435 per month, resulting in a monthly payment of
approximately $1,472. The gross annual income required to afford such a home, assuming that no
more than 30 percent of gross income is spent on total housing costs, would be $58,880. The
household would also need $25,500 in cash for the 10 percent down payment. In Turlock, the
cutoff between “low” and “moderate” income for a four-person household is $49,600, and the
cutoff between “moderate” and “above moderate” income is $74,400. Therefore, a four-person
household in Turlock would need to have a “moderate” income (per HUD/HCD definition) in
order to afford a house at current market prices. According to the 2013 American Community
Survey, in 2013, approximately 53 percent of households earned $50,000 annually or greater.
Therefore, it can be estimated that less than half of Turlock’s households earned at least $58,800
and would be able to afford to purchase the average house in Turlock as of March 2015.
Current Rental Rates
A survey of apartment listings in March 2015 on www.craigslist.org for the City of Turlock
showed average rents ranging from around $690 per month for a studio apartment to
approximately $1,680 for a four-bedroom apartment or house. The majority of listings were for
two- and three-bedroom units. Every fiscal year, HUD defines Fair Market Rents (FMR) for
metropolitan area in order to determine standard payment amounts for its Housing Choice
Voucher program (formerly Section 8). While program participants are able to use their vouchers
for any housing, some properties tend to have a high concentration of housing voucher recipients,
such as Alpha-Bothum Manor in Turlock.
HUD FMR for the Modesto MSA/Stanislaus County, of which Turlock is a part, were $583 for a
studio, $720 for a one-bedroom unit, $923 for a two-bedroom unit, $1,360 for a three-bedroom
unit, and $1,578 for a four-bedroom unit. Market rents in Turlock are within a 100 dollar range of
the HUD FMR. While studio, 1-bedroom, and 4-bedroom prices are greater than the HUD FMR,
2-bedroom and 3-bedroom prices are below the HUD FMR. However, HUD’s FMR estimates are
for gross rent, including utilities, whereas most rental listings do not include all utilities in the
monthly price. If we assume an average monthly utility payment of $75 for renters, the actual
gross cost of rent for the market listings is higher than the FMR established for the County, except
for 3-bedroom units, as shown in Table 3.3-8.
                                                                                                 3-23

Assuming that a household did not spend more than 30 percent of its gross income on rent plus
utilities, an income of approximately $44,744 is needed to afford an apartment at the March 2015
average gross rent of $1,119. This value falls roughly in the middle of the HUD/HCD-designated
Low income bracket for Turlock, meaning that Extremely Low, Very Low, and some Low Income
households would not be able to afford the average rent for a two- or three-bedroom apartment.
According to the 2013 American Community Survey, in 2013, 52 percent of households earned
$50,000 annually or greater; therefore, all of these households would be able to afford the average
apartment in Turlock as of March 2015. In addition, some of the households in the $35,000 to
$49,999 bracket would be able to afford the average apartment as well.
Housing Affordability by Household Size
In order to avoid overcrowding and overpayment, households must have access to affordable
housing that is appropriate for their household size. In other words, one cannot assume that the
housing needs of a three-person household are adequately served if they are only capable of
affording the average apartment rent for a one-bedroom unit.
Table 3.3-9 shows the affordable home price and monthly rental rate for individuals, small
families, and large families of different income levels. Based on this matrix, singles, small families,
and large families with Extremely Low and Very Low incomes would not be able to afford the
average rental unit appropriate to their family size in Turlock. Appropriately-sized rental units are
affordable to families with Low and Moderate incomes. Current average pricing of homes for sale
in Turlock is not available by number of bedrooms, but the average-priced home would be
affordable to, at minimum, a Low income large family.

AFFORDABLE UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
HCD defines assisted housing as multifamily rental developments that receive governmental
assistance under one of a number of programs, including project-based assistance under Section
8, supportive housing for the elderly under Section 202, federal and state tax credits, and others.
Localities must verify that none of the assisted housing developments in their jurisdictions are at
risk of being converted to market-rate units in the 10 year period following the Housing
Element’s adoption.
Table 3.3-10 lists assisted housing developments in Turlock, the status of their affordability
covenants or restrictions, and their presumed level of risk of conversion. There are nine assisted
housing developments in Turlock, five of which specifically serve seniors. Two of these
developments (Villas at Parkwood and Parkwood Apartments) are at risk of conversion to market
rate during this planning period.

Cost of Preservation versus Replacement
Preservation Strategies
There are many options for the preservation of at-risk units: providing financial incentives to
project owners to extend low-income use restrictions; purchase of affordable housing units by or
for a non-profit or public agency; or providing local subsidies to offset the difference between the
affordable and market rates. Scenarios for preservation will depend on the type of project at-risk.
Local Rental Subsidy
One strategy for preservation of units at-risk during the planning period is to provide a local rent
subsidy to residents. Rent subsidies can provide assistance to residents when their affordable units
convert to market rate. To determine the subsidy needed, Fair Market Rent was compared to
market rate rent. As shown in Table 3.3-11, there is a gap of approximately $19 per unit per
month between Fair Market Rent and actual market rent in Turlock. Hence, for the 280 at-risk
units, the average monthly gap is $5,320. If the property owners were willing to enter into a rental
subsidy agreement with the City or some other entity that would subsidize the rents on behalf of

the lower income renters, this would require an ongoing annual payment of approximately
$63,840.

Replacement Cost
As an alternative to providing ongoing monthly rent subsidies, the City or another entity could
attempt to purchase or develop replacement housing units that could be rented to the displaced
lower-income households at similar rents. In order to make this possible, it would be necessary to
provide a subsidy for the purchase or construction of the replacement units that would be the
equivalent of $63,840 per year in current dollars. The initial investment in existing or new
housing units that would be necessary to allow a $63,840 reduction in annual rent can be
estimated by calculating the net present value of mortgage payments equal to $5,320 per month,
on the theory that if the owner (e.g., a non-profit housing organization) can reduce its required
mortgage payments by $5,320 per month, it could reduce the rents that it needs to charge its
tenants by a similar amount. Based on a 30-year mortgage term at 5 percent interest rate, it would
take an initial investment of approximately $991,000 to reduce the monthly debt service by $5,320
per month.
Resources for Preservation
A variety of programs exist to assist cities in acquiring, replacing, or subsidizing at-risk affordable
housing units. The following summarizes Federal and State financial resources available to the
City of Turlock:
         Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) – CDBG funds are awarded to cities on
          a formula basis for housing activities. The primary objective of the CDBG program is the
          development of viable communities through the provision of decent housing, a suitable
          living environment, and economic opportunity for principally low- and moderate-
          income persons. Funds can be used for housing acquisition, rehabilitation, economic
          development and public services.
         HOME Investment Partnership – HOME funds are granted by a formula basis from
          HUD to increase the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing to lower
                                                                                                                    3-27

Turlock Housing Element
        income households. Eligible activities include new construction, acquisition, rental
        assistance and rehabilitation.
       Housing Choice Voucher Program – This program provides financial assistance to low-
        income families, the elderly, and the disabled for decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the
        private market. Participants are free to choose any housing that meets the requirements
        of the program, and are not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects.
       Section 811/202 Program (Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities/Elderly)
        – Non-profit and consumer cooperatives can receive no interest capital advances from
        HUD under the Section 202 program for the construction of very-low income rental
        housing for seniors and persons with disabilities. These funds can be used in conjunction
        with Section 811, which can be used to develop group homes, independent living facilities
        and immediate care facilities. Section 811 funds are now also able to provide project
        rental assistance to state housing agencies. Eligible activities include acquisition,
        rehabilitation, new construction and rental assistance.
       California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) Multifamily Programs – CalHFA’s
        Multifamily Programs provide permanent financing for the acquisition, rehabilitation,
        and preservation or new construction of rental housing that includes affordable rents for
        low and moderate-income families and individuals. One of the programs is the
        Preservation Acquisition Finance Program that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of
        at-risk affordable housing developments and provide low-cost funding to preserve
        affordability.
       Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) – This program provides tax credits to
        individuals and corporations that invest in low-income rental housing. The LIHTC
        program creates affordable housing opportunities when the developer of a project “sells”
        the tax credits to an investor or investors who contribute equity to the development in
        exchange for an ownership position in the project.
       California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC) – The California
        Community Reinvestment Corporation is a multifamily affordable housing lender whose
        mission is to increase the availability of affordable housing for low-income families,
        seniors and residents with special needs by facilitating private capital flow from its
        investors for debt and equity to developers of affordable housing. Eligible activities
        include new construction, rehabilitation and acquisition of properties.
Qualified Entities to Preserve At-Risk Units
A number of Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs) and other non-profit
organizations currently working in Turlock or in Stanislaus County have the experience and
capacity to assist in preserving at-risk units. These organizations include:
       Stanislaus County Affordable Housing Corporation (StanCO)
       Central Valley Coalition for Affordable Housing (CVCAH)
       Habitat for Humanity
       EAH, Inc.

3.4 Special Housing Needs Analysis
As noted in Government Code Section 65583(a)(6), there are segments of the population that
require special consideration within the overall housing needs assessment. These are generally
low income people who have less access to housing choices. These special housing needs groups
include the elderly, disabled, female heads of households, large families, farm workers, and the
homeless.
ELDERLY
Many elderly households live in housing that costs more than 30 percent of their income or live in
housing that does not accommodate specific needs for assistance. Due to various circumstances,
an elderly household may have difficulties staying in their home community or near family. The
purpose of this section is to determine the housing needs for all characteristics of the elderly
community, defined as persons over the age of 65 years.
As the numbers of seniors and senior households increase, so do their collective needs. In 1990,
there were 5,333 seniors in Turlock, which represented approximately 13 percent of the total
population in the City. Between 1990 and 2000, the senior population increased by 2.4 percent
annually. From 2000 to 2010, the senior population increased by an additional 21.3percent
to8,012. The 2013 American Community Survey showed a slow increase in the number of seniors
between 2010 and 2013, resulting in an estimated 8,303 seniors in 2013, or twelve percent of the
City’s population. Table 3.4-1 summarizes senior population trends in Turlock.
The number of households that include one or more seniors increased by about 50 percent
between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010, this number has steadied. New senior households can be
created by an elderly relative moving in with the younger family household, for example. In 2013,
there were 5,702 senior households estimated in the City of Turlock. While the senior population
only represents twelve percent of the total population, senior households represent approximately
one fourth of the City’s total households.

In 2000, 31 percent of the senior households in Turlock were renters. In the State, 25 percent of
senior households were renters and 25 percent were renters in Stanislaus County. Change in the
proportion of senior renters is dependent on the quantity of housing options. In 2010, the
proportion of the City’s senior renters had increased to 36 percent; this is partly due to the
increased renter opportunities created by Crane Terrace, an affordable apartment complex for
seniors completed in 2006. By 2013, the number of senior renter households had decreased by
                                                                                                    3-29

In the 2013 American Community Survey, a majority of the senior population, 63 percent, lived
with at least one other person. About 60 percent lived in family households, which are defined as
a householder living with one or more persons related by birth, marriage or adoption. Thirty-
seven percent of seniors lived alone. The American Community Survey did not report the
percentage of the population living in group quarters for the City of Turlock in 2013, though the
2010 Census reported that 7 percent of the senior households in Turlock were living in group
quarters. Table 3.4-3 shows Turlock seniors’ household status in 2013.

   Table 3.4-4 compares senior household income in 2000, 2010, and 2013. In 2000, 22 percent of all
   senior citizen households had incomes below $15,000. According to the American Community
   Survey, this segment has decreased to 18 percent in 2013. Over 38 percent have an income below
   $25,000. The greatest gain was in the income cohort greater than $100,000, where the percentage
   of senior households earning that amount increased from 3 percent to 13 percent. The income
   cohort of $25,000 to $35,500 also increased significantly, from 11 percent to 16 percent.

   Eligibility for federal programs is based on the median income of the county or statistical area in
   which the project or program is located. In this case, eligibility will be based on the 2014 HCD
   Median Income of $49,600 for a two person household in Stanislaus County. Using that as the
   basis, Table 3.4-5 shows the breakdown of senior households by HCD income category. The
   largest percentage of senior households, approximately one fourth, is considered Above
   Moderate. However, about 18 percent of senior households earn less than 50 percent of AMI and
   are therefore considered Extremely Low Income. These households are generally in the greatest
   need of housing assistance. Over half of senior households are Low, Very Low, or Extremely Low
   Income.
                                                                                                           3-31

Overpayment by senior households must also be considered, especially because many seniors live
on fixed incomes. Overpayment is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent of a
household’s gross income.
According to the 2000 Census, 70 percent of the senior renter households in Turlock were in
overpayment situations and 24 percent of senior owner households were overpaying for shelter.
In California, 64 percent of the senior renters and 18 percent of senior owner households
overpaid for shelter. In Stanislaus County, 64 percent of the senior renters and 26 percent of the
senior owners overpaid for shelter.
In 2010, the American Community Survey estimated that 72 percent of the senior renter
households in Turlock and 33 percent of senior owner households were overpaying for shelter. In
2013, the Survey estimated that 1,030 senior renter households were overpaying, or 66 percent.
This indicates that the majority of senior renter households are cost burdened by their housing
and would greatly benefit from public assistance for housing and/or other services. Tables 3.4-6a
through 3.4-6c show shelter payment for all senior households in 2000, 2010, and 2013.

According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 46 percent of the senior population in
Turlock has a disability. About a third of seniors have an ambulatory difficulty, and fourteen
percent have a self-care difficulty. Disability type is important to consider in a housing needs
assessment because new housing built for seniors in particular may have to have a high
percentage of accessibility features and/or personal care and support. Table 3.4-7 shows seniors’
disability types.

DISABLED PERSONS
Three types of disabled persons are considered as having special housing needs: Physically,
Mentally, and Developmentally Disabled. Each type is unique and requires specific attention in
terms of access to housing, employment, social services, medical services and accessibility within
housing.
As shown in Table 3.4-8, in 2013, a total of 8,112 persons in the City of Turlock had some type of
disability, which represents 12 percent of the City’s population. Of these, 5 percent or 408 persons
were under the age of 18, 4,058 persons (50 percent were between the ages of 18 and 64 and the
remaining 3,646 (45 percent) were 65 years of age or older.

According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 35 percent of persons with a disability were
employed. In Stanislaus County, there are several organizations that offer employment services
such as the Disability Resource Agency for Independent Living and the Howard Training Center.
With no means to support daily living, those disabled persons who are not employed may be in
need of housing assistance. Table 3.4-9 shows the employment status of Turlock’s working-aged
disabled population.

Of the disabled working-age population (those aged 18-64 years), the most common limitation
types are ambulatory difficulties (47 percent) and cognitive difficulties (40 percent). Those with
physical disabilities are most likely to require housing with accessible features. Residents with

Developmentally Disabled Persons
According to Section 4512 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code, a “developmental
disability” is a disability that originates before an individual reaches adulthood (18 years old),
continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for
that individual. This includes intellectual disabilities (characterized by significantly sub-average
general intellectual functioning), cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
disabling conditions that are closely related to other intellectual disabilities or that require
treatment (i.e., care and management) similar to that required by individuals with intellectual
disabilities, however it does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) supports approximately 216,000
children and adults with developmental disabilities and 29,000 infants at risk of developmental
delay or disability throughout the state. Services are provided through state-operated
developmental centers and community facilities, as well as through contracts with 21 non-profit
agencies called regional centers. The regional center is a private, non-profit community agency
that contracts with local business to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families. The Valley Mountain Regional Center in Stockton

provides services to individuals with developmental disabilities in Stanislaus, Amador, Calaveras,
San Joaquin and Tuolomne counties.
Table 3.4-11 summarizes the number of persons with development disabilities in Turlock and
their place of residence in 2014. The majority of the people with developmental disabilities
resided with a parent, other family member or guardian.

Turlock Housing Element
There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development disability:
rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing,
Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The
design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the
availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are
important in serving the needs of this group. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multi-
family housing (as required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important
to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be
given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
LARGE FAMILIES
For the purposes of this Housing Element, a large family is defined as a household consisting of
five or more persons. In some cases, the needs of larger families are not targeted in the housing
market, especially in the multifamily market. This sub-section explores the availability of larger
housing units in Turlock.
According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 14 percent or 3,325 of the households in the
City of Turlock consisted of five or more persons. At the same time, 34 percent of Stanislaus
County households and 30 percent of State households were considered large. Chart 3.4-2
compares the percent of large families in Turlock, Stanislaus County, and California.

Both the City’s ownership and rental housing stock includes units that may be acceptable for large
families. As Table 3.4-13 shows, of the owner-occupied housing, 79.1percent has three or four
bedrooms, and 8.7 percent has five or more bedrooms. Approximately 35 percent of the renter-
occupied housing has three or four bedrooms (which is a relatively high percentage), and 1.8
percent has five or more bedrooms.

According to the 2013 American Community Survey, there were 3,325 large households in the
City and 14,867 housing units of three or more bedrooms, indicating that Turlock has an
adequate number of larger housing units. Around 4,000 of these housing units are rentals, and
there were approximately 1,500 five- or six-person renter households in Turlock in 2013. (Table
3.4-14 shows household size by tenure.) Therefore, provision of rental housing for large families is
not perceived to be a significant unmet need in Turlock.

The 2013 American Community Survey indicates that the number of large families has decreased
in Turlock since 2010. However, adequate provision of appropriately-sized dwelling units for
these families is still important, for both owner and renter households. In the City of Turlock, six
multifamily complexes have units with three or more bedrooms. The Cherry Tree Apartments is a
                                                                                                          3-39

Turlock Housing Element
Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) project where 41 percent of the units are targeted
toward large families. Avena Bella is another LIHTC project where 31 percent of the units have
three bedrooms.
Provision of appropriately-sized owner-occupied housing is also important for large families.
While single family homes intended for owner-occupancy made up the majority of the new
construction in Turlock over the last Housing Element cycle, the largest of these homes were
generally too expensive for low income large households. Indeed, Table 3.3-4 above shows that 22
percent of overcrowded households in Turlock are owner occupied. Feedback from housing and
service providers at the Housing Community/Stakeholders Forum held in April 2015 confirmed
that families have been increasingly doubling up in single family homes in order to cut costs.
FARM WORKERS
Estimating farm workers and those households associated with farm work within the State is
extremely difficult. Generally, the farm worker population contains two segments of farm
workers: permanent and migratory (seasonal) farm workers. The permanent population consists
of farm workers who have settled in the region and maintain local residence and who are
employed most of the year. The migratory farm worker population consists of those farm workers
who typically migrate to the region during seasonal periods in search of farm labor employment.
Traditional sources of population estimates, including the 2010 Census, have tended to
significantly underestimate farm worker population. Moreover, different employment estimation
techniques result in diverse estimates of local agricultural employment. Nonetheless, a range of
estimates of farm workers in the State can be derived. The 2012 USDA Census of Agriculture
indicates there are 14,657 farmworkers within Stanislaus County. While the City of Turlock’s
primary industries are services and manufacturing, the City is located in the heart of the San
Joaquin Valley, which is prime agricultural land. Stanislaus County is a leading producer of
almonds, apricots, boysenberries, chickens, cling peaches, dry beans, peas, dairy, walnuts and
fruit, nut and grape nursery products.
According to the 2013 American Community Survey, there were 1,584 persons employed in the
Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting industry in the City of Turlock in 2013, which is an
increase of around 250 persons since the 2010 Census, as shown in Table 3.4-15. There are no
fishing or forestry industries in the City and therefore it is assumed that all 1,584 persons were
employed as farm workers. This equals 5.5 percent of all employed persons in the City.

The City of Turlock has no particular zoning designation for farm worker housing. Rather, it
welcomes the development of farm worker housing in any zone that permits the type of housing
being built (i.e., multifamily or single family) without any special conditions. If the housing were
to be built in the form of a labor camp, or group quarters, it would be subject to the zoning
regulations for these housing types. A labor camp is allowed with a Conditional Use Permit
(CUP) in the General Industrial zoning district. Group quarters are allowed with a Minor
Discretionary Permit (MDP) in medium and high density residential zones and with a CUP in
low density residential zones. In the Agricultural and Commercial Office Districts, small group
quarters are allowed by right, while large group quarters require an MDP.
Pursuant to Section 17021.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, the Turlock Municipal
Code establishes that accommodations for six or fewer employees are considered to be single
family structures and are permitted in the same manner as other single family dwellings in all
zones that allow this housing type. Section 9-3-102 of the Turlock Municipal Code, Use
Classifications for the Agricultural District, specifically states: “Employee, supportive, and
transitional housing serving six (6) or fewer people is permitted by right. Transitional housing
and supportive housing shall be considered a residential use of property, and shall be subject only
to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.”
Single-family dwellings are permitted in the Agricultural and all Residential districts.
Consistent with Section 17021.6 of the California Health and Safety Code, the same section of the
Ordinance also states “Any employee housing consisting of no more than thirty-six (36) beds in a
group quarters or twelve (12) units or spaces designed for use by a single family or household
shall be deemed an agricultural use and subject to the same permitting requirements.”
Agricultural uses are only permitted in the Agricultural District.
These regulations comply with the requirements of the Employee Housing Act, and generally
simplify the permitting process for the development of employee housing.
Because the percent of the City’s farm worker population is small, the housing needs of this group
are addressed through its standard affordable housing strategies. While there is no housing
designated for farm workers within the City of Turlock, farm worker housing can be found in the
nearby unincorporated communities of Westley and Empire. Table 3.4-16 is a list of the migrant
and permanent farm worker designated housing in Stanislaus County.

SINGLE-PARENT HOUSEHOLDS
Single-parent households have special housing needs due to the need for reasonable day care,
health care, and affordable housing. The most significant portion of this group is the female-
headed households. Female-headed households with children often have lower incomes, limiting
their access to available housing. Many housing experts believe these households are especially at
risk of housing cost burden or homelessness.
The 2013 American Community Survey counted 16,886 family households with children 18 years
old and under in the City of Turlock. Of these households, 3,312, or 19.6 percent, are headed by
females (Table 3.4-17).

As Table 3.4-18 shows, in 2013, approximately 2,108 families, or 12.5 percent of the total family
households in the City of Turlock, had incomes in the last year below the poverty level. Half of
these households were married couple families. About 41 percent (866 households) were female-
headed households and the majority of those (704 households) had related children under 18
years old.

PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS
Due to their transient nature, it is difficult to count the homeless in any one area. It should also be
noted that there are generally two types of homeless - the "permanent homeless" who are the
transient and most visible homeless population and the "temporary homeless" who are homeless
usually due to eviction and may stay with friends, family, or in a shelter or motel until they can be
assisted with finding a more permanent residence.
Homeless Population Trends
Data on the homeless population in Stanislaus County is available beginning in 2005. The
censuses are now conducted every year. From 2005 to 2010, the county’s homeless population
increased by close to 200 individuals, peaking at 1,800 individuals. From 2010 to 2015, the
number decreased to 1,408. Each year, approximately half of the individuals counted also
completed a survey about their condition. While the survey does not record the location in which
each person was identified, it does ask what city the person was from originally. The percentage of
respondents stating that they were originally from Turlock remains around eight percent of
respondents. Table 3.4-19 shows trends in the homeless population in Stanislaus County since
2005.

Homeless Population Estimates
Stanislaus County
The most recent point-in-time unduplicated count of homeless persons was conducted on
January 29, 2015, by the Turlock/Modesto/Stanislaus County Continuum of Care (CoC). At that
time, the survey counted 1,408 homeless individuals in 1,172 households in Stanislaus County. Of
                                                                                                   3-43

these individuals, 725 were sheltered, either in emergency or transitional housing, and 683 were
unsheltered. Of the total households, 78 were households with dependent children. The survey
also counted 15 unaccompanied youth under the age of 18, three of whom were unsheltered.

City of Turlock
The 2015 point-in-time count identified 186 homeless individuals in the City of Turlock. This
accounts for 13 percent of the County’s homeless population. Examining the number of
unduplicated individuals that homeless shelters have served also provides some information on
the homeless population; however, it does not account for the unsheltered population. Table 3.4-
22 shows the number of unduplicated individuals served by the emergency shelter in Turlock
from 2002 through 2014. For Fiscal Years 02-03 through 07-08, the city’s shelter served both men
and women; from 08-09 through 2013-2014, it served only men.

Housing Assistance and Shelters
Stanislaus County
Generally, services for the homeless are provided on a County or regional basis. As a result, the
information for homeless facilities and shelters is collected and reported for the County as a
whole. Table 3.4-23 summarizes all of the emergency shelters, transitional housing, and
permanent supportive housing in Stanislaus County, as surveyed by the Turlock/Modesto/
Stanislaus County CoC in 2007. As of that date, there were 330 year-round and 203 seasonal beds
in emergency shelters, 279 year-round beds in transitional housing, and 391 full-time beds in
supportive housing, for a total of 1,000 year-round beds and 203 seasonal beds in the County.
None of the facilities reported an overflow population or voucher use. However, the CoC January
2015 homeless survey counted a total of 1,408 homeless individuals. With a total of 1,000 year-
                                                                                                      3-45

City of Turlock
The City of Turlock recognizes its need for shelters and homeless services. Until recently,
homeless, emergency and transitional shelters were allowed in all residential zones, and in the
commercial zones C-O and C-C, with a conditional use permit but not by right. In order to
comply with SB 2, enacted in 2007, the City of Turlock amended its zoning ordinance in 2011
with Chapter 9-4, Article 2 to provide a nondiscretionary permitting process to allow year-round
emergency homeless shelters within a zoning district. Nondiscretionary emergency shelters must
be located within the emergency zoning overlay district and located within a Heavy Commercial
(CH), Community Commercial (CC), Industrial (I), Downtown Industrial Residential (IR), or
Downtown Transitional Commercial (TC) zoning district. The zoning ordinance places a cap on
the number of beds permitted, which varies by base zoning district.
Currently, all shelter facilities operating in the City are run by non-profit organizations. Through
the Housing Program Services Division, non-profits historically applied for up to $20,000 of
CDBG funds to provide homeless assistance. In 2009-2010, the program was modified to reduce
3-46

                                                                 Chapter 3: Housing Needs Assessment
the maximum award to $10,000 to allow more nonprofit organizations to participate in funding.
For the fiscal year 2015-2016, approximately $50,000 will be allocated citywide to fund public
services programs.
The We Care program, a Turlock-based non-profit organization, runs a cold-weather shelter for
men aged 18 and older in a building owned by the United Samaritan Foundation at 219 South
Broadway. The facility has 49 beds, is open seven days a week from 6:30pm to 8:00am, and serves
dinner every night. The shelter also provides drug counseling, AA meetings, and life skills
training. For the 2014-2015 cold-weather season, it operated from November 2014 through April
2015. Its funding consists of $10,000 from the City of Turlock’s CDBG funds, another $20,000
from Stanislaus County CDBG, $15,000 from the federal Emergency Food and Shelter Program,
and donations.
From winter 2004 through spring 2008, the cold-weather shelter was housed at a nearby city-
owned facility at 400 B Street that housed 65 to 70 people, both male and female. It also received
up to $100,000 from Turlock Redevelopment Agency funds per year over several years. When the
City decided to discontinue operating the shelter at that location, the shelter services were shifted
to nonprofit and faith-based organizations. Please refer to Table 3.4-20 above for the number of
homeless individuals served over the past twelve years.
Emergency shelter for women and children, and men are provided by different organizations. In
2013-2013, We Care provided winter shelter services to approximately 227 men. Women and
children were offered shelter by the coalition of faith-based organizations spearheaded by the
Turlock Gospel Mission. Up until now, this shelter did not have a permanent location and instead
moved from church to church on a weekly basis. Capacity was generally seven to 10 women,
depending on location. Construction of a permanent shelter began in 2014, which will provide 34
beds for men and 22 for women and children upon completion. The $1.8 million project will
constitute Turlock’s first year-round shelter. As of November 2014, construction stalled due to
lack of funds. Turlock Gospel Mission’s new goal is to complete Phase I (dorms, restrooms,
showers, and office facilities) by 2016. Fundraising efforts are underway.
The Children’s Crisis Center of Stanislaus County operates four emergency shelters for children
in crisis. Their goal is to serve high risk children and intervene with emergency shelter to prevent
children from experiencing harm. In addition to housing children in need, the shelters also
extend supportive services to abusive parents, helping them to overcome family risk and alleviate
environmental factors that threaten the well-being of their children. The Children’s Crisis Center
operates an eight bed shelter in Turlock called Verda’s House.
There are two providers of transitional housing in Turlock, both of which serve those suffering
from substance abuse. Men and women are served in numerous separate small facilities across the
city, and services include counseling and self-help programs. Table 3.4-24 summarizes all
emergency shelters and transitional housing facilities in Turlock.

Taking the 2015 point in time homeless count of 186 individuals experiencing homelessness in
the City, and a total of approximately 51 year-round beds and 79 seasonal beds in shelter facilities,
we conclude that there is still unmet need for shelter facilities for the homeless population in
Turlock. The need is particularly great for year round emergency shelter beds. Additionally, given
that substance abuse is the third most common cause of homelessness in the county, we can
reasonably conclude that the services and shelter provided for these individuals in supportive and
transitional housing are also in high demand. The feedback from service providers at the April 23
community/stakeholders housing forum confirms this needs assessment—participants mentioned
year-round emergency shelter, transitional housing, and supportive services as some of Turlock’s
most pressing needs.
Other Homeless Services
There are other services besides shelter provided to the homeless in both the City of Turlock and
in Stanislaus County. In Turlock, the United Samaritans Foundation offers emergency food
boxes, washers and dryers, showers, and a temporary address for homeless persons. Daily Bread

Ministries delivers lunches to the homeless in Turlock in 12 locations. Community Housing and
Shelter Services offers the Home Base Program which places homeless families in private rental
housing and provides services to the families.
UNICORPORATED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES
Enacted in 2011, SB 244 requires cities to address the infrastructure needs of disadvantaged
unincorporated island or fringe communities located within or near their boundaries. For cities, a
“disadvantaged unincorporated community” is defined as a fringe or island community in which
the median household income is 80 percent or less than the statewide median household income.
The law states that on or before its next housing element adoption, each city must review and
update the land use element of its general plan, based on available data about its island and fringe
communities. The updated land use element must:
         Identify and describe every “island community” or “fringe community” located within
          that city’s sphere of influence that is considered to be a disadvantaged unincorporated
          community;
         Include an analysis of water, wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire
          protection needs or deficiencies for each of the identified communities; and
         Include an analysis of potential funding mechanisms that could make the extension of
          services and facilities to identified communities financially feasible.
According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the median household income in California
is $61,094. Thus, for an unincorporated island or fringe community to be considered
disadvantaged, its median household income must be $48,878 (80 percent of the statewide
median) or less. As shown in Table 3.4-25, Turlock has four census tracts with unincorporated
island and fringe communities that meet this criteria. While each of these tracts also includes
households that are part of incorporated Turlock, it is reasonable to assume that the household
income of households within the unincorporated areas are below the target of $48,878 and that
the communities qualify as “disadvantaged unincorporated communities” per SB 244.

The Turlock General Plan identifies disadvantaged County Islands and fringe communities in its
New Growth Areas and Infrastructure Element. Policy 3.1-m speaks to developing a financing
strategy for infrastructure improvements to the County Islands. However, in order to comply
with SB 244, the New Growth Areas and Infrastructure Element will need to be updated
concurrently with this Housing Element to include an analysis of the infrastructure needs or
                                                                                                    3-49

3.5 Energy Conservation Opportunities
Conservation of energy is an important issue in housing development today not only due to the
cost of energy, which can be a substantial portion of monthly housing costs for both owners and
renters, but also due to an emerging interest in sustainable development, energy independence,
and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in line with legislation such as the Global Warming
Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32).
Conservation can be accomplished by reducing the use of energy-consuming items, or by
physically modifying existing structures and land uses, and by designing buildings to be more
energy efficient. The California Energy Commission first adopted energy conservation standards
for new construction in 1978. These standards, contained in Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code, contain specifications relating to insulation, glazing, heating and cooling
systems, water heaters, swimming pool heaters, and several other items. Specific design provisions
differ throughout the State depending upon local temperature conditions. Title 24 energy
requirements are consistently reviewed in all building applications processed in the City.
Although the energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they do not
ensure that all available conservation features are incorporated into building design. Additional
measures may further reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads, and overall energy
consumption. While it is not suggested that all possible conservation features be included in every
development, there are often a number of economically feasible measures that may result in
savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
While construction of energy efficient buildings does not lower the purchase price of housing,
housing with energy conservation features should result in reduced monthly occupancy costs as
consumption of water and energy is decreased. Similarly, retrofitting existing structures with
energy-conserving features can result in a reduction in utility costs. Examples of energy
conservation opportunities include weatherization programs and home energy audits; installation
of insulation; installation or retrofitting of more efficient appliances, and mechanical or solar
energy systems; and building design and orientation that incorporates energy conservation
considerations. Rebate programs run by the local and State utilities are described below.
INTEGRATING LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
The City of Turlock also seeks to minimize energy consumption through integrating land use and
transportation planning in its General Plan policies. Infill development, mixed uses, and higher
density development enable residents to access goods and services without a car, or in shorter and
fewer car trips; dense, pedestrian-oriented areas encourage walking and cycling. High density
residential projects also use less energy per unit for heating and cooling than single family homes.
Policies in the Land Use, Transportation, and City Design Elements of the current General Plan
encourage development that, by nature of its design, reduces energy consumption.
3-50
                                                                Chapter 3: Housing Needs Assessment
By virtue of its location, compact development pattern, and by the presence of several large local
employers, residents of Turlock tend to work locally as compared with many other Central Valley
cities. Almost half of the city’s employed residents work in Turlock, and 78 percent work in
Stanislaus County. Additionally, approximately 74 percent of residents commute less than 30
minutes to work. Under the current General Plan, new neighborhoods have been developed with
local-serving retail and a mix of housing types, including small-lot single family and multifamily
developments. Turlock’s most recent General Plan Update (adopted in 2012) builds on these
successes with policies that strengthen the bicycle network, create mixed use neighborhoods, and
promote an even greater jobs/housing balance.
BUILDING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
In January 2011, California enacted the first statewide mandatory green building code in the
country. Known as CALGreen, the California Green Building Standards Code is Part 11 of the
California Building Standards Code. CALGreen requires that new development reduce its
negative impact on the environment through sustainable construction practices in several
categories, including planning and design, energy efficiency, water efficiency and conservation,
material conservation and resource efficiency, and environmental quality.
Many modern design methods used to reduce residential energy consumption are based on
proven techniques that have been known to humans since the earliest of days of collective
settlement. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out
     during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven
     building techniques in this category include:
        Locating windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain
         in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
        Use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
         absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
        “Burying” part of the home in a hillside or berm to reduce solar exposure or to insulate
         the home against extremes of temperature;
        Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange
         between the interior of a home and the exterior;
        Locating openings and using ventilating devices to take advantage of natural air flow; and
        Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during
         the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
2. Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
     Examples include:
        North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
        Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces in hot climates; and
        Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
                                                                                                3-51

Turlock Housing Element
3. Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
        Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
        Use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
        Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to natural techniques that have been used for millennia, a number of modern
methods of energy conservation have been developed or advanced during the present century.
These include:
        Use of solar energy to heat water;
        Window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
        Weather-stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss; and
        Use of energy-efficient home appliances.
Turlock’s abundant sunshine provides an opportunity to use solar energy techniques to generate
electricity, heat water, and provide space heating during colder months, as well. Natural space
heating can be substantially increased through the proper location of windows and thermal mass.
City Policies
Within the City of Turlock’s current General Plan, the City outlines several goals and policies
pertaining to energy conservation. The City Design Element includes policies aimed at conserving
energy and water, optimizing solar orientation, and reducing water demand for landscaping. The
Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases Element contains policies aimed at facilitating energy-efficient
buildings, promoting energy conservation, encouraging greater energy efficiency in new
development, requiring energy efficiency for projects receiving public assistance, and encouraging
the use of renewable energy systems.
As part of the residential design review process, all developments must be evaluated against the
Energy Conservation Guidelines. These guidelines include that all residential developments
should be oriented to be within 22.5 degrees of the east-west axis to maximize south-wall and
minimize west-wall exposure, roof overhangs, wood trellises and other sunshade devices should
be provided to shape the east and west building surfaces and windows, deciduous tree cover
should be provided to shade streets and parking areas and to reduce summer heat radiation, use
of solar collectors of water, space and swimming pool heating should be encouraged, and
construction material conservation is to be encouraged.
REBATE PROGRAMS
The City also has a policy to support Turlock Irrigation District (TID) and Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E) programs to encourage retrofit measures such as weather-stripping and
insulation. PG&E provides gas, and TID provides electric service to Turlock residents. These
companies offer company a variety of energy conservation programs and information services
that are available to residents.

PG&E Rebates
Weatherization. If homes and apartments are not sealed tightly, energy used for heating and
cooling can be wasted. Weatherization helps to decrease energy costs and increase comfort.
Weatherization services may include attic insulation, weather stripping and caulking around areas
where air leakage occurs, exhaust fan dampers, air duct repair, water heater blankets, and low-
flow showerheads. Approved low income residences may be eligible for free weatherization
services.
Energy Incentive Packages. While upgrading a single aspect of a home is valuable, homeowners
can have a greater impact by evaluating their homes as a complete system. PG&E provides
customers with various Home Upgrade package options. Improvements for the basic Home
Upgrade bundles may include attic, wall and floor insulation, duct sealing, and furnace and AC
replacements, leading to rebates of up to $2,500. The Advanced Home Upgrade goes beyond the
building shell and involves more complex, deep improvements. Rebates can be as much as $6,500.
Home Appliance Rebate Program. PG&E offers rebates on the purchase of ENERGY STAR
and other high efficiency home appliances. Customers of PG&E are eligible for rebates on clothes
washers ($50/unit), refrigerators ($75/unit), gas storage water heathers ($200/unit), heat pump
water heaters ($500/unit), and pool filtration pumps ($100/unit).
Multifamily Program. PG&E’s Multifamily Properties Program is for property owners and
managers of existing residential dwellings or mobile home parks that contain two or more units.
The program encourages the installation of qualifying energy efficient products in individual
tenant units, and for common areas of residential apartments, mobile home parks and
condominium complexes.
Funding for the program is limited and rebates are offered on a first-come, first-served basis.
Some products may require installation by an appropriately licensed contractor. The following is
a partial list of qualifying products and their rebates, based on category:

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
Solar energy is a viable alternate energy source for the City of Turlock. There are two basic types
of solar systems: active and passive.
Active Solar Systems
Active solar systems typically collect and store energy in panels attached to the exterior of a house.
This type of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool air, while heated
water can flow directly into a home’s hot water system. Solar cells absorb the sun’s rays to
generate electricity and can substantially reduce electric bills. Technological improvements have
made the cells increasingly efficient and reduced their cost.

TID Tools and Solar Rebates
Photovoltaic (PV) systems can cost around $30,000 to install, but numerous state and local
incentive programs are in place to help offset the expenses and lower the payback period.
Additionally, by leaving the residence “on the grid,” the resident can potentially sell power back to
the utility company. TID’s Solar Electric Rebate Program is part of a comprehensive statewide
solar program create by Senate Bill 1 and aims to promote the installation of PV panels on
residences by helping to offset the purchase cost.
For systems under 30kW, the incentive is a one-time payment based on expected performance,
known as Expected Performance Based Incentives (EPBI). Incentive levels decline when a specific
cumulative MW volume of reservations, in terms of total-program capacity, has been reached.
While residential incentives started at $4 per megawatt, the incentive is currently at $0.57 per
megawatt. For systems over 30kW, a Performance Based Incentive (PBI) is paid monthly over a 5
year period based on actual monthly kilowatt hour (kWh) production. The amount to be paid per
kWh over the entire payment term is set once the reservation has been confirmed; incentive
declines occurring after a system has been reserved do not apply to reserved systems. Currently,
the incentive is at $0.07 per kWh.
TID has a comprehensive online tool, the Performance Based Buydown (EPBB) Incentive
Calculator, which helps residents calculate expected incentive using site and PV system
specifications.
Passive Solar Systems
In passive solar systems, the structure itself is designed to collect the sun’s energy, then store and
circulate the resulting heat similar to a greenhouse. Passive buildings are typically designed with a
southerly orientation to maximize solar exposure, and are constructed with dense material such
as concrete or adobe to better absorb heat. Properly placed windows, overhanging eaves, and
landscaping can all be designed to keep a house cool. Although passive solar systems generally
maximize use of the sun’s energy and are less costly to install, active systems have greater
potential application to cool and heat a house and to provide it with hot water and electricity.
This may mean lower energy costs for Turlock residents.
3.6 Projected Housing Need
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
For each Housing Element statutory planning period, the Stanislaus Council of Governments
(StanCOG) prepares a Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) that is a minimum
projection of the number of housing units each jurisdiction must provide to accommodate its
share of regional growth. The RHNA is distributed across all income categories to ensure that
growth in each income level is accounted for. For the planning period of January 2014 through
September 2023, StanCOG estimates that at total of 21,330 housing units will need to be provided
across all jurisdictions. The City of Turlock is responsible for identifying sites with capacity for
3,618 units, or 17.0 percent of the County total. Table 3.6-1 shows Turlock’s RHNA allocation
broken down into income categories.
                                                                                                  3-55

Note: The Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) also asks
jurisdictions to consider “Extremely Low” income households, which are those
earning 30 percent or less of AMI. While a precise allocation number is not specified
in the RHNA for this group, it is often estimated that half of Very Low income
households qualify as Extremely Low income. Using this metric, there is a need for
approximately 438 housing units for Extremely Low income households in Turlock.

The following chapter will provide a detailed analysis of Turlock’s housing sites inventory and
development capacity.

4! Sites Inventory and Analysis
This chapter identifies sites that have the adequate capacity to accommodate the City of Turlock’s
Regional Housing Need Allocation. It includes a discussion of zoning districts that allow
residential development of appropriate densities, the vacant land inventory, environmental and
infrastructure constraints, and consideration of housing for special needs groups.
4.1! City of Turlock Zoning Regulations
BASE RESIDENTIAL ZONES
The City of Turlock’s Zoning Ordinance, most recently updated in June 2015, allows for a broad
array of residential types and densities by right, ranging from 0.2 to 30 dwelling units per acre.
Second dwellings are permitted in every residential zone, as are small family home day cares,
group homes, and small residential care facilities. Table 4.1-1 summarizes the allowable density in
each of the residential zones.
Table 4.1-1: Allowable Densities in Base Residential Zones
Residential Zone                                  Allowable Density (dwelling units per acre)
Estate Residential (R-E)                                                            0.2 – 3.0
Low Density Residential (R-L)                                                       3.0 – 7.0
Low Density Residential 4.5 (R-L4.5)                                              5.0 – 10.0
Medium Density Residential (R-M)                                                  7.0 – 15.0
High Density Residential (R-H)                                                  15.0 – 30.0

Residential Estate (R-E) - The purpose of this district is to provide living areas that combine
advantages of urban and rural locations and to provide transition or buffer areas between intense
urban uses and agricultural preserves. Single family dwellings, small family home day care, second
dwellings, small residential care facilities, home occupations, manufactured homes, and group
homes are permitted in this designation. Large residential care facilities are permitted with a
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and large family home day care is allowed with Minor
Administrative Approval (MAA). Multifamily dwellings, group quarters, emergency shelters and
mobile home parks are not permitted. Allowable densities range from 0.2 to three dwelling units
per acre.

Turlock Housing Element
Low Density Residential (R-L & R-L4.5) - The purpose of these districts is to provide
appropriately located areas for single family dwellings; provide adequate light, air, privacy, and
open space for each dwelling unit; and achieve design compatibility through the use of site
development standards. Group homes, manufactured homes, small family home day care, small
residential care facilities, second dwellings, home occupations, and single family dwellings are
permitted in this designation. Group quarters, emergency shelters, mobile home parks, and large
residential care facilities are permitted with a CUP. Large family home day care is permitted with
MAA. Multifamily dwellings are not permitted. Allowable densities range from three to seven
dwelling units per acre for R-L and five to ten dwelling units per acre for R-L4.5.
Medium Density Residential (R-M) - The purpose of this district is to limit the expansion of
the City by maintaining a compact urban form in order to preserve agricultural lands; provide
appropriately located areas for single family and medium density multifamily dwelling units;
provide adequate light, air, privacy, and open space for each dwelling unit; and achieve design
compatibility with adjacent uses through the use of site development standards. Small family
home day care, group homes, home occupations, small residential care facilities, second
dwellings, and single-family dwellings are permitted within this designation. Emergency shelters,
mobile home parks, and large residential care facilities are permitted with a CUP. Group quarters,
manufactured housing, and multifamily development are permitted with a Minor Discretionary
Permit (MDP). Large family home day care is permitted with MAA. Allowable densities range
from seven to 15 dwelling units per acre.
High Density Residential (R-H) - The purpose of this district is to provide appropriately
located areas for high density multiple family dwellings units; provide affordable housing for all
economic segments of the community while maintain a compact urban form; provide adequate
light, air, privacy and open space for each dwelling unit; and achieve design compatibility through
the use of site development standards. Small family home day care, group homes, home
occupations, small residential care facilities, second dwellings, and single-family dwellings are
permitted within this designation. Emergency shelters, manufactured housing, mobile home
parks, and large residential care facilities are permitted with a CUP. Group quarters and
multifamily dwellings are permitted with a MDP. Large family home day care is permitted with
MAA. Allowable densities range from 15 to 30 dwelling units per acre.
Planned Development (PD) – Planned Development zoning districts allow for the use of
special design criteria for maximum utility of the site and maximum design flexibility within
density limitations. Their purpose is to encourage variety and avoid monotony in developments
through the use of alternative development standards. They also provide a mechanism through
which the City can authorize developments consistent with the General Plan. Conditions of
approval are ultimately determined by the City Council using adopted planning practices and
standards. Within these project areas, special residential development strategies such as clustering
and density transfers are encouraged. Development regulations follow the baseline standards of
the General Plan; thus, for the purpose of the Housing Element, available sites that are zoned PD
assume the allowable density of the underlying General Plan land use designation.

DOWNTOWN OVERLAY REGULATIONS
The Downtown Overlay Regulations, which apply to the downtown area as defined by the
Downtown Design Guidelines and Zoning Regulations document, exist to maintain and promote
Turlock’s downtown as a pedestrian-oriented, economically sound “heart” of the city while
preserving its historic architecture and character. Residential development is encouraged
downtown, as it helps businesses and allows residents to live in a convenient, central location. In
many cases, allowable density is expressed in terms of Floor Area Ratio (FAR) rather than
dwelling units per acre. In these cases, assumed residential density is specified based on likely
development configuration and actual density of existing residential developments in each zone.
Table 4.1-2 summarizes the zones in the Downtown Overlay Regulations and the residential
densities assumed.

Downtown Core (DC) – The Downtown Core is Turlock’s historic center, and the DC overlay
zone aims to encourage an urban feel with a mix of residential, commercial, and office uses.
Residential units are permitted on the second story of buildings and higher. Density is expressed
in Floor Area Ratio (FAR), specifying FAR 3.0 for mixed use development. Building heights can
extend to 60 feet, with 100 percent lot coverage. Residential development built as part of a mixed
use project in the DC zone is estimated at a maximum of approximately 40 dwelling units per acre
(before affordable housing density bonuses). Densities could be higher depending on unit size
and lot size.
Downtown Core Transition (DCT) – The goal of the Downtown Core Transition zone,
located northeast of the Downtown Core along the East Main corridor, is to preserve the area’s
low intensity residential scale while providing a gateway and transition to the more urban
downtown area. Single and multifamily residential uses and small family home day care are
permitted. Large group quarters are permitted with a CUP and large family home day care is
permitted with MAA. Zoning regulations specify a typical FAR of 1.0, which is estimated to
correspond to 15 dwelling units per acre.
Transitional Commercial (TC) – The Transitional Commercial zones lie to the north, west,
and south of the Downtown Core, and while their purpose is to contain office and commercial
                                                                                                            4-3

uses that serve the auto-oriented consumer, single and multifamily residential uses and small
family home day care are permitted. Emergency shelters and large group quarters require a CUP
and large family home day care requires MAA. Zoning regulations specify a typical FAR of 1.5,
which is estimated to correspond to 25 dwelling units per acre.
Industrial Residential (IR) – This zone lies southwest of the Downtown Core, and its purpose
is to encourage economically viable reuse of agricultural and industrial buildings while avoiding
land use conflicts. Single and multifamily residential uses, small family home day care, and small
group quarters are permitted by right. Emergency shelters and large group quarters are permitted
with a CUP. Large family home day care requires MAA. Zoning regulations specify a typical FAR
of 1.5 for residential uses, which is estimated to correspond to 20 dwelling units per acre.
Office Residential (OR) – The Office Residential zone allows a lower density mix of uses in the
areas northeast and east of the Downtown Core that will preserve the character of the traditional
residential neighborhoods while providing for the orderly and logical conversion or transition to
compatible office uses as the market allows. Single and multifamily residential uses, small family
home day care, and small group quarters are permitted by right. Emergency shelters and large
group quarters are permitted with a CUP. Large family home day care requires MAA. Permitted
FAR ranges from 0.6 for residential uses to 0.8 for mixed use development, which is estimated to
correspond to 10 dwelling units per acre.
ZONING AND AFFORDABILITY
Default Density for Very Low and Low Income Units
HCD defines default densities for Very Low and Low Income housing based on a jurisdiction’s
population, type of urban development pattern, and location in the state. In other words, if
housing is built to the specified density, it is assumed to be affordable to Very Low and Low
Income households. For cities of Turlock’s size in Stanislaus County, the default density for Very
Low and Low Income units is 20 dwelling units per acre. In Turlock, the only base residential
zone where density of 20 dwelling units per acre is allowed by right is High Density Residential
(R-H), which allows densities between 15 and 30 units per acre. The Commercial Office/High
Density Residential (CORH) designation also allows development at this density. Properties
zoned CORH may be developed either with office or with high density residential uses. In
addition, densities of up to 40 units per acre are permitted in the Downtown Overlay Zone, and
the DC, TC and IR districts each have estimated densities of 20 units per acre or higher.
Likely Density for Moderate Income Units
HCD does not define minimum default densities for Moderate and Above Moderate Income
units. Instead, in order to determine which vacant sites are likely to produce housing affordable
to Moderate-income households, an analysis of the sale prices and densities of recently sold
properties was conducted. Using HCD’s definition of the annual income limits for Moderate-
income households in Turlock ($49,600 to $74,400), and assuming these households spend 30
percent of their income on housing costs, the affordable moderate-income home price in Turlock
is between $213,000 and $326,000. As of August 2015, a large inventory of single family homes

                                                                      Chapter 4: Sites Inventory and Analysis
were selling in this price range.1 These units are on 5,000 to 7,000 square foot lots, corresponding
to a gross residential density of around five to six units per acre. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that homes built in zones that allow five units per acre or greater will be affordable to
Moderate income households in Turlock. This density corresponds with the base residential
zones of Medium Density Residential (R-M) and Low Density Residential 4.5 (R-L4.5), where
development is allowed at 7-15 units per acre and 5-10 units per acre, respectively. All of the
Downtown Overlay zones also permit residential development as low as seven units per acre.
4.2! Site Inventory and Development Capacity
This section describes the inventory of land available for new housing and analyzes its capacity for
development of units of different income groups based on zoning and/or General Plan land use
designation.
SITES ON VACANT, PROPERLY-ZONED CITY LAND
Determining the initial set of sites appropriate for new housing development was based upon sites
identified from the city’s Vacant Land Map and by City Staff. From this set, those whose zoning
allows residential development (R-E, R-L, R-L4.5, R-M, R-H, DC, DCT, TC, OR, IR, CORL,
CORM, CORH, CCRH, and RLRM) were selected. Sites zoned PD were also included if the
underlying General Plan designation allowed residential uses.
There are also some underutilized sites within city limits that may be redeveloped with new
housing projects. Underutilized sites are those that are not entirely vacant, but where the existing
structure is in significant disrepair, disuse, or substantially undersized for the size of the lot,
relative to what the parcel’s zoning would allow. A common methodology for identifying
underutilized sites is by comparing the value of the structure to the value of the land, using
County Assessor’s data. This “assessed value” ratio (AV ratio) was used to identify underutilized
land in Turlock. Parcels with an AV ratio of 0.75 or less, where the value of the building is less
than three-quarters of the value of the land, were assumed to be potential sites where new
development is most likely to occur. Because assessor’s data can often be outdated, a combination
of aerial mapping and windshield reconnaissance was used to check the sites identified with the
AV ratio methodology as well as to determine additional underutilized parcels within the
Downtown and Montana-West areas, as the City highly prioritizes development in both of these
areas. The City has good reason to believe that these properties are likely candidates for
redevelopment within the planning period based on numerous examples of redevelopment of
similar underutilized properties in the same zoning districts prior to the recent recession.
Underutilized sites that are not likely to redevelop have not been included.
In order to assess the development capacity of underutilized sites, a similar methodology is used
as for vacant sites. The average allowable density for the zoning district is assumed, and
multiplied by the acreage of the site. Then, in order to make the conservative assumption that any
existing residential uses would remain on the property, the number of current units on the site is

subtracted from the overall potential to arrive at the net new number of units that the site could
accommodate.
The vast majority of underutilized sites identified in the Sites Inventory currently have low and
medium density residential existing land uses, most typically in the form of single family homes.
The City of Turlock has seen multiple instances of redevelopment of these lower density uses to
multifamily properties in recent years and anticipates that this trend is likely to continue to occur
in the future. To provide an understanding of the extent to which existing uses may impede
additional residential development, a representative sample of individual underutilized sites is
discussed further in Appendix A. In some cases, the existing structure has been entirely removed
and replaced; in others, additional units have been built on the lot without removing the current
structure.
Altogether, 302 parcels totaling 455 acres were identified. Table 4.2-1 and Figure 4-1 show the
breakdown of vacant sites within city limits by zoning. Appendix A provides a list of all of the
parcels individually and indicates their APN, zoning, and existing land use.

As discussed in the Needs Assessment chapter, Turlock has a need for 3,618 new housing units
through 2023: 877 Very Low, 562 Low, 627 Moderate, and 1,552 Above Moderate income units.
The City must demonstrate that the sites it has identified can accommodate its projected housing
need.
HCD requires a parcel-specific inventory of sites available for future residential development that
are capable of accommodating the city’s RHNA. Table 4.2-2 summarizes the sites’ development
capacity by zoning district, and Appendix A contains a full list of the 302 sites identified. Table
4.2-2 also sums the unit capacity of the zones that correspond to each income level. Sites with
zoning appropriate for Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low income housing have the realistic
capacity for 2,814 dwelling units. Sites with zoning appropriate for Moderate income housing can
support 1,245 dwelling units. Sites with zoning appropriate for Above Moderate income housing
can accommodate 697 units. Figure 4-1 maps the location of the identified sites.
Realistic Development Capacity
The realistic development capacity of the opportunity sites is generally assumed to be the average
allowable density for each zoning district. For sites within the Downtown Overlay Zone, realistic
development capacity is assumed to be the estimated densities for each Downtown district based
on typical FAR, as shown in Table 4.1-2. Due to new General Plan policies supporting increased
residential density and infill, the realistic development capacity of sites located in the area just
west of Downtown is estimated to be toward the higher end of the allowable density range, rather
                                                                                                                     4-9

than the average. General Plan Policy 2.5-i specifically encourages residential development
Downtown on infill sites and in existing buildings by creating incentives such as providing public
subsidies for the development of affordable housing and reducing on-site parking requirements.
In addition, the City’s revised Capital Facilities Fee program establishes lower impact fees for
development located on infill sites in Pedestrian Priority Areas, which include the downtown
districts and several other infill neighborhoods..
These assumptions are validated by the actual densities of several recently permitted and built
residential projects that are representative of the range of residential zoning districts.
Summerfield, an 81-lot single family subdivision on 11.35 acres in the Northeast Turlock Master
Plan area, includes both low density and medium density residential homes. The low density
residential portion was built at six units per acre (average allowable density is five units per acre).
The medium density portion was built at nine units per acre (average allowable density is 10 units
per acre). Sierra Oaks is a recently completed high density residential development in the
Northwest Triangle Specific Plan area. The average allowable density in this zoning district is 22.5
dwelling units per acre, and Sierra Oaks was built at 22 dwelling units per acre. The development
also received a height exemption, allowing portions of the project to be built to 45 feet instead of
the standard allowable 35 feet. Numerous other high density residential projects have received a
similar exemption, including Balboa Park condominiums and the Park Villas mixed use
development. Balboa Park was built at 18 dwelling units per acre, and Park Villas (which is
permitted but not yet constructed) is approved for 20 units per acre and a commercial center at
0.27 FAR.

Turlock Housing Element
Vacant and Underutilized Land for Extremely Low, Very Low and Low Income
Units
Turlock is obligated to identify sites that can accommodate 877 units of Very Low Income
housing and 562 units of Low Income housing (1,439 units of Very Low and Low combined) at a
density of at least 20 units per acre. As described above, the R-H, DC, TC, IR, CCRH and CORH
zones allow densities at or above this default density. Within city limits, 43 vacant and
underutilized sites have these zoning designations, totaling 113 acres. If these sites were to be built
out at their estimated densities, they could reasonably accommodate 2,814 units of Extremely
Low, Very Low and Low Income housing. Therefore, the amount of vacant land and
underutilized land that is zoned R-H, DC, TC, IR, CCRH and CORH is sufficient to
accommodate the 1,439 units of Very Low and Low income housing that Turlock must show that
it can provide. Table 4.2-3 shows the surplus.
The City must also demonstrate that the sites identified for high density, low income housing
have characteristics that make it reasonable to expect that affordable units could feasibly be
developed upon them. Developers experience economies of scale, and the more units that a site
can support, the more likely it is that they can be sold or rented at below-market rates. Therefore,
larger sites provide greater certainty of affordable housing development than smaller ones. Of the
27 available sites zoned R-H, 18 are greater than one acre in size, and two of these are greater than
10 acres in size. If developed at the average allowable density of 22.5 units per acre, the smallest of
these could accommodate 40 units and the largest could accommodate 269. Together, the three
largest vacant RH sites (one is used for agriculture) along with the parcels designated for high
density residential use within the Morgan Ranch Master Plan Area and the proposed Vista
Student Housing Complex could be reasonably developed with just over 1,650 units. This alone is
more than enough to fulfill the City’s need for Extremely Low, Very Low and Low income units.
A significant site of 9.7 acres, located just south of CSU-Stanislaus along Monte Vista Avenue, has
a pending proposal for a General Plan Amendment and rezoning to High Density Residential in
order to construct a 600 bed student housing complex. The Vista Student Housing Complex will
have a total of 180 multi-bedroom suites as part of this development, at a density of 18.6 suites per
acre. Given that each of the three to four bedrooms per suite will be rented out individually, each
bedroom is more closely equivalent to a dwelling unit than a whole suite is. This gives the project
a density of over twenty dwelling units per acre, providing a prime housing opportunity for very
low- and low-income students.
Smaller sites zoned for high density residential development also show feasible development
potential. Several of the smallest R-H and CORH sites are located directly adjacent to one
another. This offers the opportunity of assemblage to create larger sites that are better able to
accommodate multifamily housing projects.
Underutilized Land
Twelve of the sites identified for Extremely Low-, Very Low- and Low-income housing are
underutilized, meaning that while they are not vacant, the value of the structure on the property is
less than the value of the land on which it sits. All of these underutilized sites are already zoned
for residential uses. The majority of the sites have low or medium density residential existing land
uses, with relatively few units on larger sites, though some have commercial uses. The City has

                                                              Chapter 4: Sites Inventory and Analysis
good reason to believe that these properties are likely candidates for redevelopment within the
planning period based on numerous examples of redevelopment of similar underutilized
properties prior to the recent recession. Underutilized sites not likely to redevelop have not been
included.
Extremely Low Income Housing Provision
It is estimated that approximately 2,800 households in Turlock qualify as Extremely Low income,
with annual household incomes less than $18,600 for a family of four. Some of the RHNA
requirement for Very Low income housing must fulfill the needs of the Extremely Low income
group. Many of these residents are seniors, disabled individuals, or others living on fixed incomes.
The City of Turlock has traditionally addressed the needs of this population through provision of
housing with affordability covenants or property-based Section 8 status, such as at the Denair
Manor Apartments. Additionally, some of the individuals qualifying as Extremely Low income in
Turlock have no income at all and/or are homeless. Housing for this segment of the population
would be provided through supportive and transitional housing with services available to help
residents move into more permanent living situations.
It is also feasible that through a combination of financial subsidy and appropriate project design,
housing for Extremely Low income households can be provided on the vacant and underutilized
properties zoned for high density development in Turlock. For instance, many studio and one-
bedroom apartments at The Palms, a 100-unit redevelopment of an old motel, are affordable to
Very Low income households even with no affordability covenants. With an additional subsidy
and affordability covenants, units at a development similar to The Palms could be affordable to
Extremely Low income households.
Vacant and Underutilized Land for Moderate Income Units
As discussed above, market analysis shows that housing developed at a density of five units per
acre or greater is likely to be affordable to Moderate income households in Turlock, which
corresponds to the R-M, R-L4.5, and OR zones. Table 4.2-2 shows that 162 acres of land with
these zoning designations are currently vacant or underutilized and likely redevelopment
candidates. The vast majority of the 45 underutilized sites have low and medium density
residential existing land uses. These vacant and underutilized sites could reasonably be expected
to accommodate 1,245 housing units. Therefore, opportunity sites zoned R-M and OR are
sufficient to meet the requirements of the RHNA for Moderate income housing, as Turlock is
required to identify land to accommodate 627 units at this income level. Table 4.2-3 shows the
sites’ capacity compared to the RHNA, and the surplus.
While many of the sites zoned R-M are less than one acre in size, they are generally clustered,
allowing assemblage. For example, six parcels along Stanislaus and Almond Streets, just behind
several community commercial properties on the east side of Geer Road, are adjacent to each
other and comprise 1.6 acres. Built at the average allowable density of 11 units per acre, these sites
could hold 18 units (or a maximum of 24 if built at 15 units per acre). Several more clusters of
small parcels zoned R-M are found in the area just west of Downtown. Centrally located and
proximate to local services, they provide viable opportunities for Moderate income housing
despite their size.
                                                                                                 4-13

Turlock Housing Element
As the home price analysis indicated, because Turlock is a relatively inexpensive housing market
compared to many other parts of the state, many modest single family homes are likely to be
affordable to Moderate income households. Therefore, assembling large parcels that can
accommodate many multifamily dwellings is not as critical for the development of this type of
housing. Stand-alone parcels of half an acre or less can viably be developed with affordable
duplexes, four-plexes, or a small number of townhouses. Moreover, the City of Turlock has seen a
considerable amount of that type of housing being built on infill parcels in the area south of
Downtown and in the Westside neighborhood. The majority of this development has occurred on
individual parcels zoned R-L4.5, OR, and IR. Many sites identified as appropriate for Moderate
income housing are located in these same areas, and it is reasonable to expect that the same type
of housing can and will be built there.
As stated above, Turlock has seen an increasing number of underutilized properties developed
with housing projects that are of the appropriate (higher) density allowed on the property. In
some cases, the existing structure was torn down, and in others, it remained. The following are
several examples of these types of redevelopment projects that occurred prior to the recent
recession and housing market decline; the City anticipates seeing more of these types of projects
as the economy continues to gain strength.
     •! 1130 Pioneer - Construction of a triplex on an existing single family lot (completed 2010)
     •! 937 Vermont - Construction of 13 attached residential units on an existing single family
         lot (completed January 2009)
     •! 837 E. Glenwood - Construction of 13 single family residential units, existing house
         remained (completed in 2005)
     •! 3237, 3315, 3331 Colorado - Construction of 20 single family lots, 3 existing homes
         remained (completed 2006)
A significant amount of the R-M zoned land identified in the Sites Inventory is located within the
Morgan Ranch Master Plan Area. Recently adopted by the City Council in June 2015, the Morgan
Ranch Master Plan’s overall density of roughly 9.3 dwelling units per acre on lands designated for
residential uses is higher than the current City density as a whole. This is in keeping with General
Plan policies to increase the amount of medium and higher density housing types in the city.
Vacant and Underutilized Land for Above Moderate Income Units
Above Moderate housing is likely to occur at the lowest densities. The City of Turlock has a
number of large development sites, many over 10 acres, zoned R-L, CORL, and R-E. Some of
these parcels are already entitled parts of existing master plans in the northeast and eastern parts
of the city, where development slowed during the recent economic downturn. It is anticipated
that as the housing market continues to rebound in the next several years, development of these
parcels will proceed as planned. For instance, entitled undeveloped parcels in the East Tuolumne
Master Plan can accommodate around 200 units.
Numerous other large parcels zoned for low density residential development, a few of which are
over 15 acres, are scattered throughout the city. These parcels are located outside of existing

master plans—some near Monte Vista Crossings, others near Linwood Avenue in the southern
end of town—but represent good opportunities for new residential development given their size
and location. Altogether, the vacant and underutilized sites on sites zoned R-E, R-L and CORL
could reasonably support 697 units of Above Moderate income housing. (Nearly all of the sixteen
underutilized sites have low and medium density residential existing land uses.) While, this is less
than the 1,552 units specified in Turlock’s RHNA, it is important to remember that Above
Moderate housing can be developed in any residential zoning district. It is likely that some higher
density developments, such as new units Downtown and in Morgan Ranch, will also be attractive
to Above Moderate income households.
4.3! Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
In addition to examining the regulations on standard development types in the Zoning
Ordinance, it is important to consider the extent to which the City’s zoning allows for a greater
variety of housing types that may be more typical of affordable developments than to market rate
developments. Government Code Section 65583 requires the Housing Element to identify
adequate sites for a variety of housing types including multifamily rental housing, factory-built
housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, supportive housing, single-room
occupancy units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. This section clarifies where the
aforementioned housing types are allowed in Turlock’s zoning districts, which correspond with
the housing opportunity sites identified above.
MULTIFAMILY RENTAL HOUSING
Multifamily rental housing is probably the most typical form of affordable housing provided in
Turlock. Multifamily dwellings of any tenure are not permitted in the R-E, R-L, and R-L4.5
districts. They are permitted with a minor discretionary permit in the R-M and R-H districts,
where allowable densities (seven to 15 units per acre and 15 to 30 units per acre, respectively) are
high enough to support the development of multifamily housing. Multifamily rental housing is
often affordable to Very Low and Low income households. Section 4.2 above describes the zoning
and capacity of sites in Turlock that can accommodate this type of development.
EMERGENCY SHELTERS, TRANSITIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo), in Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007, revises Housing Element law to ensure
zoning encourages and facilitates emergency shelters, and transitional and supportive housing
under the Housing Accountability Law. The law now requires that all jurisdictions have at least
one zone which permits at least one year-round emergency shelter without a conditional use
permit or any discretionary permit requirements. If such zoning does not exist, a local
government is required to designate zoning within one year of the adoption of the Housing
Element. Alternatively, the local government can enter into a multi-jurisdictional agreement with
no more than two adjacent jurisdictions, in which the communities’ shelter needs are addressed
collectively. In the multi-jurisdictional agreement, a site(s) must be designated and a shelter(s)
built within two years of the Element’s adoption that can adequately serve the combined
jurisdictions’ shelter requirements.
                                                                                                4-15

Turlock Housing Element
In addition, emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing must be considered
a residential use of property, and be subject only to those restrictions that apply to other
residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone. If these conditions do not currently
apply, a programmatic action must be taken within one year of the adoption of this Housing
Element to address the constraint. As appropriate, efforts to remove governmental constraints,
especially relating to single-room occupancy units, supportive housing, transitional housing, and
emergency shelters should be included. Multifamily dwellings as defined by the Turlock
Municipal Code include dwellings that are constructed for the purposes of providing supportive
and transitional housing. Multifamily dwellings are permitted by right in the Downtown Overlay
districts, and in the R-M and R-H districts with a MDP. “Emergency shelters” are regulated as a
separate land use category, and are permitted in the R-L, R-L4.5, R-M, R-H, TC, IR, and OR
districts with a CUP. In addition, a recent amendment to the Zoning Ordinance established an
overlay district that allows year-round emergency shelters by a nondiscretionary permit and
meets the requirements of SB 2. Within this overlay district, there are 15 opportunity sites that
cover approximately 13 acres, providing the potential for nearly 1,400 additional emergency beds.
However, approval of an application for an emergency shelter cannot result in the district-wide or
property-specific caps on emergency shelter beds to be exceeded, and the application must
comply with the conditions specified in Section 9-4-205 of the Turlock Municipal Code.
The district-wide cap on emergency shelter beds is currently 200. This figure was originally
established based on shelter bed occupancy and input from homeless service providers,
specifically through a review of the usage statistics gathered during the operation of the Turlock
cold-weather shelter from 2004 to 2008 and by reviewing the demand for homeless shelter
provided by nonprofit organizations at the time that the ordinance was developed. From winter
2004 through spring 2008, the cold-weather shelter was housed at a nearby city-owned facility at
400 B Street. Based on the attendance logs collected by the shelter operator (We Care), this facility
served an average nightly population of 59 people, both male and female. The maximum number
housed during this period was 73 people per night, and the minimum was 43. After closure of the
cold-weather facility, a homeless facility for men operated by the We Care program
accommodated up to 34 men and a sheltering program operated by faith-based organizations
reported that approximately seven to 10 women and children are placed in overnight facilities
under their program, nightly. In testimony given during the adoption of the zoning ordinance
amendment to respond to Senate Bill 2, these organizations reported that the nightly demand for
emergency homeless shelter could be as high as 100 to 125 beds per night. The district-wide cap of
200 was thus established as a conservative limit (representing nearly twice the estimated nightly
bed need), and the cap is reviewed annually by the City Council at a formal public hearing to
determine whether it needs to be increased to address the City’s homeless sheltering needs.
The City will continue to commit assistance to local nonprofit agencies in order to produce
additional short-term beds, as well as supportive and transitional housing that will help
individuals exit the cycle of homelessness.
SINGLE-ROOM OCCUPANCY
The Turlock Municipal Code defines Group Quarters as “shared living quarters without separate
kitchen or bathroom facilities for each room or unit. This classification includes boardinghouses,
dormitories, fraternities, sororities, employee housing and private residential clubs.” Under this
4-16

                                                               Chapter 4: Sites Inventory and Analysis
definition, single-room occupancy (SRO) housing may be defined as Group Quarters or a group
home. SROs can fill an important role in the provision of affordable housing, as they can
generally serve Extremely Low and Very Low Income residents and are often constructed through
the rehabilitation of older buildings such as hotels. Group quarters are permitted with a CUP in
R-L and R-L4.5 and with a MDP in R-M and R-H. Large group quarters for 7 to 12 occupants are
permitted with a CUP in all Downtown Overlay districts and with a MDP in the C-O and A
districts. Small group quarters for six or fewer occupants are permitted by right in the C-O and A
districts. In addition, State-licensed group homes, regardless of the number of occupants, are
permitted by right in all residential zoning districts, pursuant to State and Federal law.
If an SRO is built such that it has individual kitchen and bathroom facilities, then it would be
considered a multifamily development like any other and permitted in the appropriate zone based
on its density (likely R-H).
HOUSING FOR AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES (PERMANENT AND
SEASONAL)
Farm worker housing may take many forms. It may be built as standard single family or
multifamily housing, in which case it would be permitted in the appropriate residential zoning
district based on its density. Farm worker housing is typically considered “employee housing,”
making it fall into the Group Quarters use category. As stated above, Group Quarters are
permitted with a CUP in R-L and R-L4.5 and with a MDP in R-M and R-H. Large group quarters
for 7 to 12 occupants are permitted with a CUP in all Downtown Overlay districts and with a
MDP in the C-O and A districts. Small group quarters for six or fewer occupants are permitted by
right in the C-O and A districts. In addition, if the farm worker housing were built in such a way
that it would be classified as a group home, it would be permitted in all residential districts by
right.
MOBILE HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOUSING
Government Code Section 65852.3(a) requires that with the exception of architectural
requirements, local governments shall only subject manufactured housing to the same
development standards to which a conventional single-family residential dwelling on the same lot
would be subject. Manufactured housing is permitted by right in the R-E, R-L, and R-L4.5 zones,
permitted with an MDP in the R-M zone, and permitted with a CUP in the R-H zone. No
additional development standards apply that are not also applicable to conventional housing in
these zones.
Furthermore, mobile home parks are allowed by CUP in every base residential district except for
Residential Estate. The City recognizes mobile homes and manufactured housing as an important
source of affordable housing in Turlock. The City is continuing a successful program that
provides assistance to mobile home owners who have difficulty meeting the rent payments for the
mobile home park land on which their dwelling sits (see Policy 1-2-2).
                                                                                                 4-17

Turlock Housing Element
4.4! Second Units
Assembly Bill 1866 (Wright) amended Section 65583.1(a) of the Government Code to allow local
governments to meet a portion of their adequate sites requirement through the provision of
second dwelling units. The Housing Element must then estimate the development potential of
second units over the planning period based on trends over the previous planning period, realistic
capacity, and resources available that would encourage their development.
Second dwelling units are permitted by right in all residential zoning districts, as described above,
as long as they meet the standards laid out in Section 9-2-119 of the Turlock Zoning Ordinance.
Because the City of Turlock is able to meet its adequate sites requirement through identification
of vacant and underutilized residentially-zoned land, it is not relying on development of second
units as a means of meeting its RHNA. However, the City encourages the development of second
dwelling units as appropriate. Policy 2-1-3 encourages developers to design for and accommodate
second units in their projects. The action program under this policy also includes working with
developers during the pre-application process to determine how second units could be added to
residential development projects.
4.5! Adequate Sites Alternative
According to Government Code Section 65583(c)(1), local governments may meet up to 25
percent of their adequate sites requirement through making available affordable units through
conversion, rehabilitation, or preservation of existing housing. The City of Turlock is able to
identify enough vacant or underutilized residentially-zoned land to meet its requirement, so it
does not require the alternative adequate sites methodology.
However, the City still expects that its supply of affordable, high quality housing will be
maintained through rehabilitation and preservation. To facilitate the maintenance of these
properties, the City is continuing its successful Home Rehabilitation Loan program (Policy 1-3-4)
and will target rehabilitation and reinvestment funding towards lower income neighborhoods and
census tracts (Policy 4-1-3).
4.6! Environmental Constraints
As an agricultural community in California’s Central Valley, there are virtually no environmental
constraints on development. It is not located in a floodplain or in a seismically active area and is
not in a wildfire hazard zone. None of the housing sites are known to contain special status
wildlife species or their habitat.
Turlock’s greatest environmental resource is its soil; most of the soil in the planning area is
categorized as Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide Importance. If additional housing
development is to occur outside of the already urbanized area, it will come at the expense of high
quality farmland and may be subject to mitigation measures by Stanislaus County. However, the
majority of the housing sites identified are infill parcels within the existing city limits, where
4-18

                                                                          Chapter 4: Sites Inventory and Analysis
development will occur in a more compact manner and preserve the surrounding farmland.
Additionally, redevelopment of infill sites at medium and high densities promotes reduced
automobile travel, and, consequently, reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
4.7! Adequate Infrastructure
Turlock’s water and sewer infrastructure extends to all of the housing opportunity sites that are
located within city limits. (Infrastructure is not extended to the unincorporated County “islands”
located within city boundaries.) All of the properties identified in the inventory of adequate sites
in this chapter are located within Turlock city limits. The majority are infill parcels served by all
of the City’s utility providers. Developers of new housing development in areas where
infrastructure is not yet extended, and for subdivisions of larger parcels within city limits, are
required to provide improvements such as water and sewer infrastructure, utility connections,
drainage, landscaping, sidewalks, curb/gutter and streets (where necessary) as standard
conditions of approval.
Pursuant to SB 1087 (Florez), the City of Turlock will deliver the adopted Housing Element to the
water and sewer providers within one month after the Element’s adoption, and request that the
service providers grant priority for service allocations to developments that include affordable
housing.
POTABLE WATER CAPACITY
The City of Turlock is located within the Turlock groundwater basin. All of the City’s current
potable water supply comes from groundwater. The City has 24 potable water wells that produce
a maximum water supply of about 53 million gallons per day (mgd)2. These wells draw water from
a deep aquifer, and have casing depths of about 200 to 580 feet. These wells have capacities of 650
to 2,800 gallons per minute (gpm)3. The use of groundwater by the City and for adjacent
agricultural purposes has resulted in periods of lowered groundwater levels near the City. Since
the mid 1990s, the groundwater levels near the City have fallen by about 15 feet.4
The City is evaluating a Surface Water Project (SWP) that would supply treated Tuolumne River
water from the Turlock Irrigation District (TID). This SWP would initially provide up to 10
million gallons per day (mgd), but is expected to increase to a supply of 15 mgd by the year 20205
(11,200 to 16,800 acre feet per year). The SWP facilities would include a surface water treatment
plant and water transmission mains. This potential water supply represents about 35 to 45 percent
of the City’s future water needs.

Turlock Housing Element
In the past, the City has pumped as much groundwater as needed by its residents and businesses;
consequently the City’s available supply has matched its demands. As noted above, the
groundwater levels have fallen about 15 feet in the last 10 to 15 years. The decline in groundwater
levels has raised concerns about the sustainability of the groundwater resource to meet future
water demands. With SWP, the City will still use groundwater, but at a lower rate. Thus, the City’s
use of both surface and groundwater supplies will be able to meet the anticipated demands. With
the SWP, the City will have a sufficient, reliable, high quality water supply that can meet is future
water needs. Conversely, without the SWP, it is unclear how the City will provide water for it
future growth.
The City’s water is distributed through over 250 miles of water pipelines ranging in size from 6 to
16 inches in diameter. The City currently has plans for expansion of the distribution system for
the growth of the City both with and without the SWP.Wastewater Treatment Capacity
The wastewater collection system generally flows from the northeast to the southwest to the
Turlock Regional Water Quality Control Facility (TRWQFC), where it is treated and then
discharged to the Harding Drain. The sanitary sewer collection system consists of about 220 miles
of sewer pipes ranging in size from six inches to 48 inches, and 20 pump stations.
The sanitary sewer system serving the north part of Turlock was sized for only the current area of
the City and does not have capacity for any growth north of Taylor Road6. None of the housing
opportunity sites identified in this document are located north of Taylor Road, and the City
intends to keep Taylor Road as the northern boundary of future development through 2030. City
staff conducted a flow observation study in the Zeering Road trunk sewer and concluded that this
sewer is flowing near its full capacity. This sewer includes the flow from Denair and will include
flow from future development beyond the northeast corner of the City. To accommodate this
future flow, the flow from Denair will likely be redirected south and into an existing sewer system
in Hawkeye Avenue7.
A study of the Monte Vista Avenue and Tully Road trunk sewer showed that many segments of
the this sewer are currently flowing at or above their design capacity8. To eliminate this problem,
the City will construct a new 48-inch sewer for about 2,100 feet upstream of the TRWQCF and a
new influent pump station to lift the wastewater from the sewers up into the TRWQCF.
The current average dry weather flow to the TRWQCF is about 13 million gallons per day (mgd).
This includes flow from Turlock, Keyes and Denair. The TRWQCF also treats 1 mgd of partially
treated wastewater from Ceres, and the flow from Ceres is expected to increase to 2 mgd in the
future. With the construction of planned improvements, the TRWQCF could treat a flow of about
20 mgd from Turlock, Keyes and Denair and about 2 mgd of partially treated flow from Ceres.

Thus, the proposed improvements would provide capacity for about a 50 percent increase in the
flow to the plant, and the flow is expected reach 23 mgd near the year 2030.
The current and planned treatment facilities will only occupy about 60 acres of the 140 acre site.
Consequently, there is room for the plant to expand well beyond a capacity of 23 mgd, thus
allowing for growth of the City beyond the year 2030, and sewage treatment is not expected to be
a constraint on new residential development on the opportunity sites in Turlock.
Turlock currently has sufficient water and sewer capacity to support all new development, and the
city is projected to continue to have capacity well beyond the eight year planning period of this
Housing Element. However, if insufficient capacity becomes an issue in the future, priority will be
given to proposed developments that include housing units affordable to lower-income
households, as is required by State law.

5   Constraints
The purpose of this chapter is to analyze potential and actual governmental and non-
governmental constraints on the maintenance, improvement and development of housing in the
City of Turlock. A discussion of Turlock’s efforts to remove constraints is included.
5.1   Governmental Constraints
STATE AND FEDERAL POLICY
Actions or policies of governmental agencies, whether involved directly or indirectly in the
housing market, can impact the ability of the development community to provide adequate
housing to meet consumer demands. For example, the impact of federal monetary policies and
the budgeting and funding policies of a variety of departments can either stimulate or depress
various aspects of the housing industry. Local or state government compliance or the enactment
of sanctions (sewer connection or growth moratoriums) for noncompliance with the federal
Clean Air and Water Pollution Control Acts can impact all types of development.
State agencies and local government compliance with state statutes can complicate the
development of housing. Statutes such as the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
sections of the Government Code relating to rezoning and General Plan amendment procedures
can also act to prolong the review and approval of development proposals by local governments.
In many instances, compliance with these mandates establishes time constraints that cannot be
altered by local governments.
LOCAL LAND USE CONTROLS
Local governments exercise a number of regulatory and approval powers which directly impact
residential development within their respective jurisdictional boundaries. These powers establish
the location, intensity, and type of units that may or may not be developed. The City's General
Plan, zoning regulations, project review and approval procedures, development and processing
fees, utility infrastructure, public service capabilities, and development attitudes all play
important roles in determining the cost and availability of housing opportunities in Turlock.
The General Plan is the primary land use control document. This policy document not only
establishes the location and amount of land that will be allocated to residential development, but
also establishes the intensity of development (in terms of unit densities and total number of units)
that will be permitted. While nearly all components or elements of the General Plan contain goals
and policies that influence residential development, it is the Land Use Element that has the most
direct influence.
                                                                                                5-1

Turlock Housing Element
The current General Plan Land Use and Economic Development Element defines five land use
classifications that are exclusively residential (Very Low Density, Low Density, Low-Medium
Density, Medium Density, and High Density Residential), as well as others that allow residential
uses. The residential classifications allow densities ranging from 0.2 units per acre to 40 units per
acre, exclusive of second units and density bonuses for affordable housing. As discussed in
Chapter 4, there are currently adequate sites for new housing in each of the land use categories.
Therefore, the residential land use regulations in the General Plan are not viewed as a constraint.
The current General Plan is implemented through the Zoning Code. The City of Turlock
development standards contained in the Zoning Code do not contain any unduly restrictive
provisions. Building height, setbacks, lot areas, and parking are generally within the range of
other similar sized cities in the state. Table 5.1-1 summarizes the density, size, and parking
requirements of the residential zoning districts.
Compliance with numerous governmental laws or regulations can also add to the cost of housing.
Requirements that relate to site coverage, parking, and open space within developments can
indirectly increase costs by limiting the number of dwelling units which can occupy a given piece
of land. This is especially true with larger units when the bulk of the buildings and increased
parking requirements occupy an increasing share of the site. In some instances, developers must
decide whether or not to build smaller units at the maximum allowable density or fewer larger
units at a density less than the maximum. Either solution can have different impacts on the
housing market. Building a higher number of smaller units can reduce costs and provide
additional housing opportunities for smaller households but does not necessarily accommodate
the needs of larger families. Larger units can be made available to families, but because of their
size and lower density, the cost of these units is higher.

Turlock Housing Element
Landscaping
Landscaping is required for all zoning districts. Residential districts require 30 percent of the site
to be landscaped. Such landscaping would include, but not be limited to, shrubbery, trees, grass
and decorative masonry walls. Landscaping contributes to a cooler and more aesthetic
environment in the city by providing relief from developed and paved areas. It also improves
water quality by filtering surface water runoff. All landscaping is installed by the developer and
must be approved prior to occupancy of any building. Additionally, subdivisions must, to the
extent possible, promote energy conservation through passive/natural heating and cooling.
Landscaping that provides shade helps achieve that design consideration.
Parking
As Table 5.1-1 demonstrates, no more than two off-street parking spaces per unit are required in
low density residential districts, and no more than 1.5 spaces per unit are required for medium
and high density residential districts (though guest parking may be required based on the number
of units in a development). Residential development in the Downtown Core (DC) and transition
areas is facilitated by reduced parking requirements. In the DC zone, no off-street parking
provision is required; in the Downtown Core Transitional (DCT) zone, parking requirements are
half of what the base residential zones require.
Height and Bulk Limits
In all residential districts in Turlock, building heights of up to 35 feet (generally three stories) are
allowed, and in the Downtown Core and Downtown Core Transition areas, heights up to 60 feet
and 45 feet, respectively, are allowed. In the Downtown Overlay districts, lot size is not specified,
and density is expressed in FAR. Allowable FAR ranges from 1.5 in the Transitional Commercial
(TC) zone to 3.0 in the DC zone. In addition, numerous high density residential development
projects (Sierra Oaks, Balboa Park, and Park Villas) have applied for and received exceptions to
the standard height limitation, thus allowing structures to reach 45 feet instead of 35 feet. Height
and bulk restrictions do not pose constraints on the development of multifamily housing in
Turlock.
Constraints Removal Efforts: Allowable Density
The City provides cost reductions to developers through its adopted Density Bonus Ordinance
when low and very low income housing units are proposed. The City updated its Density Bonus
Ordinance pursuant to Policy 2-1-4 of the 2007-2014 Housing Element to allow greater bonuses
and more flexibility, in compliance with SB 1818. Further cost reductions occur in the form of
increased densities and concessions such as flexibility in site development standards and zoning
code requirements, deferment of development fees, and/or accelerated plan check.
Cost reductions occur through the more efficient use of land in mixed use zones and the Planned
Development (PD) program. For example, the PD residential districts of the zoning code allow
design flexibility through, but not limited to, small lots, zero lot line, cluster developments, mixed
unit types, and high-rise apartments. Second units are also already permitted by right in all
residential zones.

GROWTH CONTROLS
Following the City’s rapid growth in the 1980s, the City of Turlock implemented several strategies
for controlling the type, pace, and location of urban development. A growth management
program was adopted in the early 1990s, which was replaced in 1998 with a Residential
Annexation Policy that focuses annexations and growth to one quadrant of the city at a time.
Residential development in the northwest and northeast quadrants has proceeded since the 1990s
via several Master and Specific Plan processes. This is in accordance with policies put in place in
the 1993 General Plan and continued in the current General Plan (adopted in 2012) that require
that unincorporated areas for new development be pre-zoned prior to city annexation, that
adequacy of public facilities be established, and that new development be contiguous to existing
development.
The City does not have a limit on the number of building permits that can be issued in a given
year. Research informing the 2008-2011 General Plan update showed ample vacant land for
residential development within the City’s study area boundary to accommodate projected future
population and employment growth over the next 20 years (see details in Chapter 4). Therefore,
growth controls do not pose constraints on housing development in Turlock.
Additionally, the City has adhered to the provisions of AB 2292, which prevent the down-zoning
of a residential property without the concomitant up-zoning of a comparable property. The City
has not engaged in any systematic down-zoning of residential property, and keeps a record of all
rezones, including some that were approved prior to the legislation. Down-zoning has not been
permitted without documentation that the loss of dwelling units can be recaptured elsewhere in
the city. Records of the City’s “no net loss” efforts are reported in the Housing Element Annual
Reports.
DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS, FEES, AND EXACTIONS
Part of the cost associated with developing residential units is related to the fees or other exactions
required of developers. The development review process includes required permits needed to
obtain project approval and the time required to conduct project review and issue land use
entitlements. Developers often contend that lengthy review periods increase financial and
carrying costs, and that fees and exactions increase expenses. These costs are in part passed onto
the prospective homebuyer in the form of higher purchase prices or rents, and can therefore affect
affordability. However, it is the City’s policy that all development “pay its own way,” and not be
subsidized by the General Fund. Impact fees have been established in order to provide adequate
public facilities and services to support new development. The City of Turlock has numerous
provisions by which the burden of fees can be eased for affordable housing developments.
Processing and Permit Procedures
The time allowed for project review and approval is consistent with that provided by State law.
Depending on the conformity of a project application with the General Plan and the Zoning
Ordinance, and magnitude and complexity of a development proposal, the time required to
process a project varies greatly from one project to another. Factors which can affect the length of
development review on a proposed project include a rezoning or General Plan amendment
                                                                                                    5-5

requirement, public meetings required for Planning Commission or City Council review, or a
required Negative Declaration or Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
Table 5.1-2 identifies the most common steps in the entitlement process. It should be noted that
each project does not necessarily have to complete every step in the process (i.e., small scale
projects consistent with General Plan and zoning designations do not generally require
Environmental Impact Reports, General Plan Amendments, Rezones, or Variances). A residential
project on an appropriately-zoned parcel would only require a Minor Discretionary Permit (staff-
level review) and potentially Design Review.
Design Review is required of all residential development proposals (with the exception of single-
family homes on infill lots and interior remodels or tenant improvements). The review is
conducted by the Planning Services Director or other staff, for the purpose of ensuring that the
project will not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of existing or future
neighboring development; will not result in pedestrian or vehicular hazards; and is architecturally
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Evaluation is based upon the adopted City of
Turlock Design Guidelines, or, if the project is located downtown, the Downtown Design
Guidelines. No additional fee is charged for Design Review. Neither the City of Turlock Design
Guidelines nor the Downtown Design Guidelines represent a constraint to development; the
documents do not impose unreasonable restrictions on housing developers, and the neighboring
jurisdictions of Modesto, Ceres, Patterson, and Hughson have design guidelines for residential
development and/or a design review process as well.
Certain review and approval procedures may run concurrently. Since the majority of
Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs) are prepared in response to a General Plan Amendment
request, these two actions are typically processed simultaneously. The City encourages the joint
processing of related applications for a single project. For example, a rezone petition may be
reviewed in conjunction with the required site plan, a tentative tract map, and any necessary
variances. Such procedures save time, money, and effort for both the public and private sector.
However, it is important to note that processing timelines, comply with the Permit Streamlining
Act, and could not be made much shorter, if at all, without violating State laws, particularly as
they relate to public noticing, compliance with CEQA, etc. Typical processing time is
approximately two to three months for a single family project and three to four months for a
multifamily project.

 Pre-Application Review
 When developers have a project proposal, the City invites them to a Predevelopment Meeting.
 These meetings, held each week free of charge, provide developers with an opportunity to meet
 with various City staff representing numerous City departments (e.g. planning, building, housing,
 redevelopment, engineering, fire, etc.) to strategize about project design, City standards, necessary
 public improvements, and funding opportunities (where appropriate).
 Application Fees
 A brief survey shows that the City of Turlock charges somewhat above-average planning
 application fees when compared to its neighboring jurisdictions. For example, Turlock requires a
 deposit of $11,600 for a General Plan amendment, while Modesto, Stanislaus County, Ceres, and
 Patterson fees are all less. In Turlock, the average cost for a 20-lot subdivision would be between
 $7,190 and $10,075, while in Modesto, Patterson, Ceres, and Stanislaus County, the total cost can
 be thousands of dollars less. Turlock’s fees are, however, designed to recover costs for all City
 departments, rather than just the Planning Division’s costs of reviewing the application. Table
 5.1-3 details the planning application fees of Turlock and its neighboring jurisdictions.
 It is important to point out that Turlock has enough vacant and underutilized residentially-zoned
 land to accommodate its housing needs, and it is unlikely that a General Plan amendment or a
 zoning change would be necessary for most new housing development built in the city. The
 majority of housing built on the opportunity sites identified in the Sites Inventory chapter would
 only need a Minor Discretionary Permit (MDP) and Design Review, with no review by the City
 Council or Planning Commission. Therefore, it is more relevant to consider the fees and
 processing procedure for a properly-zoned parcel. The processing time is approximately two to
 three months, and the fee for a medium-sized project is $4,760.

Impact Fees
Impact fees, land dedications, or improvements are also required in most instances to provide an
adequate supply of public parkland and to provide necessary infrastructure (streets, sewers, and
storm drains) to support new development. While such costs are charged to the developer, most,
if not all, additional costs are passed to the ultimate product consumer in the form of higher
home prices or rents.
The significance of the necessary infrastructure improvements in determining final costs varies
greatly from project to project. The improvements are dependent on the amount of existing
improvements and nature of the project. A Capital Facility Development Fee to offset the cost of
transportation, police, general government, and fire protection is assessed to each new housing
unit constructed in the city. The amount of the fee is determined by the land use type and the area
of the city in which the project is located. On average, the per-unit fee cost is $12,219for single
family residential and $8,792 for multifamily residential. This fee can be deferred for projects
with affordable units if it can be clearly demonstrated that the fee (alone) will increase the cost of
the housing so that it is no longer affordable to low income households.
Table 5.1-4 lists the development impact fees charged for a representative single family unit (at 6
dwelling units per acre and with a unit size of 2,000 square feet) and multifamily unit (at 20
dwelling units per acre and with a unit size of 1,000 square feet). Due to some efficiencies
associated with developing multifamily housing, the total fee amount for the multifamily unit is
approximately $13,300 lower than the single family unit ($33,100 versus $46,400).

Additionally, there are development impact fees associated with the Master and Specific Plan
areas, where much of the city’s new residential development occurs. These fees generally cover
additional sewer, storm drainage, transportation, and water infrastructure above the standard
development impact fees levied by the City, to reflect the cost of extending services to newly
developed residential areas. These fees can range from $760 per dwelling unit for a high density
residential development in the Northwest Triangle Specific Plan Area (covers additional costs for
sewer and water facilities) to over $45,000 per dwelling unit for a very low density residential
development in the Northeast Area Master Plan Area (covers additional costs for transportation,
sewer, water and storm drainage facilities). New development occurring on vacant parcels in these
areas would be subject to these additional fees; however, the housing sites identified in this
document for affordable housing are located outside of the existing Master Plan Area in the
northeast.
School districts that serve the City of Turlock include the Turlock Unified School District
(TUSD), the Denair Unified School District (DUSD), and Chatom Union School District. These
school districts require impact fees on new development, assessed by attendance area. For new
residential development located in both a Turlock elementary school and Turlock high school
attendance area, the fee equals $5.16 per square foot. In some cases, development in city limits
may occur in the Chatom Union elementary school attendance area and a Turlock high school
attendance area; fees in this situation would equal $3.80 per square foot ($2.13 for Chatom Union
and $1.67 for TUSD). For DUSD, the impact fee in is $3.36 per square foot. These amounts are
current as of April 2015. These fees can add significantly to the cost of development, but they are
consistent with the amount established by California Government Code Section 65995 et seq.
Senior housing is exempt from school fees because it does not impact the demand for schools.
Fees as a Percentage of Development Costs
The following table (5.1-5) illustrates the total development costs for typical single family and
multifamily units in Turlock, taking the sample units used in Table 5.1-4 above as an example
(2,000 square foot single family home built at a density of six units per acre compared to a 1,000
square foot multifamily unit built at a density of twenty units per acre). The analysis assumes the
single family unit is part of a 50-lot subdivision and the multifamily unit is part of a 80 unit
apartment building. Both are assumed to be located in a master plan area with average impact
fees. As the table shows, total fees make up almost 16 percent of the total development cost for a
typical single family and multifamily units in Turlock.
                                                                                              5-11

Constraints Removal Efforts: Fees
The City of Turlock has instituted actions aimed at reducing the impact of the public sector role
in housing costs. The City's processing policies regarding concurrent review of related
applications for a single project also reduce overall time and costs. Policy 2-1-1 continues this
practice. The City has also developed a predevelopment “tip sheet” to help guide applicants
through the permitting process.
Although the City's processing and development fee structure accounts for only a fraction of the
final costs, cost implications for developers of below market-rate housing can be significant when
any increase inhibits the ability to provide units affordable to their clients. To offset developer’s
costs, the City has been able to defer payments of the development fees and underwrite a portion
of the Capital Facility Development fees for affordable housing developments using CDBG funds
(for example, in the previous planning period, the City underwrote these fees for The Palms, a
104-unit multifamily complex affordable to Low income families). However, the program of
waiving or underwriting development fees is being discontinued for lack of funds. At the same
time, it should be noted that the City’s Capital Facility Development fees are significantly less for
multifamily projects than for single family projects, averaging $8,800 per unit versus $12,200 per

                                                                                Chapter 5: Constraints
unit, respectively, which stands to benefit developers of affordable housing (which is more likely
to be multifamily). The City will also continue to explore the feasibility of various incentive
methods to encourage the development of affordable housing, including the possibility of creating
a fee deferral program for developments that include a significant amount of affordable units
and/or are at a density of 20 units per acre or higher, as funds are available (see Policy 2-1-2).
BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
The City of Turlock has adopted the 2013 California Building Standards Code (CBC). When a
project is plan checked, it is reviewed for minimum compliance with the CBC. This includes
Electrical, Plumbing, Mechanical (heating & cooling), Structural, Energy Compliance, Non-
Structural (building exits, interior environment, etc.) and Disabled Access (commercial
buildings). Adherence to the CBC ensures the structural integrity of buildings and facilitates the
City’s efforts to maintain a safe housing supply.
OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
Developers of residential subdivisions are required to provide each lot with connections to the
City sanitary sewer system, the City domestic water supply, and gas, electric, telephone, and cable
television services. Subdivisions must also be provided with storm drainage facilities, or pay a fee,
in accordance with the City’s adopted Storm Drain Master Plan. Subdivisions must also include
sidewalks (in most cases, except where very low density zoning permits their exclusion), paved
streets, and street trees. Such improvements are required as a condition of the subdivision map,
or, if there is no required map, improvements are required as part of the building permit. These
on- and off-site improvements promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
Curbs, gutters, and drainage facilities direct storm and runoff water out of residential
developments. City roadways are required to be paved. Pavement creates an all-weather roadway,
facilitates roadway drainage, and reduces dust. It also produces a high speed circulation system
and facilitates relatively safe traffic movement. Roadways are classified by the City according to
traffic needs. They are as follows:
     •   Arterial - Six lanes, 100-110 feet right-of-way, with left turn median
     •   Major Collector- Four lanes, 94 feet right-of-way, with two bicycle lanes
     •   Collector – Two lanes, with a 60 foot right-of-way
     •   Local - Two lanes, 50-54 foot right-of-way
Arterials and collectors are designated on the General Plan according to existing and projected
needs. Developers are responsible for the development of roadways associated with the residential
project and also participate in regional transportation system improvements through payment of
the Capital Facility Development fee (see table 5.1-4 above).
                                                                                                   5-13

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Zoning and Reasonable Accommodations Procedure
Compliance with SB 520 (Article 10) is met by permitting supportive multifamily or single family
housing for the disabled in any residential zone that permits non-designated single or multifamily
housing. One assisted housing development, Denair Manor, houses the elderly as well as disabled
adults of any age. In addition, as part of the Home Rehabilitation Loan program, the City
provides rehabilitation grants to disabled persons to improve access and mobility in their homes.
The City of Turlock offices are handicapped accessible. Disabled applicants are treated with the
same courtesy as all applicants. They are provided one-on-one assistance to complete the forms
for zoning, permits, or other building applications. The City will accommodate any specific verbal
or written request for assistance. Applications for retrofit are processed over-the-counter in the
same process as for improvements to any single family home.
The City of Turlock continually reviews its ordinances, policies, and practices for compliance
with fair housing laws. The City’s broadened definition of “family” includes State and federal
definitions relating to unrelated adults living together as a household unit.
Constraints Removal Efforts: Reasonable Accommodations
The City implemented the policy added to its 2007-2014 Housing Element to bring the City into
compliance with federal law that requires reasonable accommodation to be provided for persons
with disabilities in zoning and land use decisions and procedures regulating the siting, funding,
development or use of housing, including housing related services or facilities. An example of
such an accommodation might include allowing physical access improvements to structures for
disabled persons, even if these requests (such as a covered wheelchair ramp extending into a
setback alongside a single-family house) violate the City’s zoning ordinance. The City is in full
compliance with State law pertaining to Reasonable Accommodations; program 1-3-5a states that
the City will continue to implement the ordinance and revise it as necessary.
Parking Requirements
All multifamily complexes are required to provide handicapped parking at a rate of two percent of
all assigned spaces and five percent of all unassigned spaces. One parking space is provided for
each dwelling unit designed for people with disabilities. The City works with the developers of
special needs housing and will reduce parking requirements if the applicant can demonstrate a
reduced need for parking.
Group Homes
State-licensed group homes are permitted by right in all residential districts. This allows
proponents to locate these facilities in any area they can afford without additional development or
permit costs. In addition, group homes could also be located in the agricultural and commercial
office districts with a conditional use permit. There are no regulations relating to the siting of
special needs housing in terms of the relationship between the distance or location of one special
needs home and another.

                                                                                Chapter 5: Constraints
The City of Turlock holds public hearings for every change or amendment to any ordinance,
policy, program, procedure, funding, or other similar action. There is no public comment
requirement for the establishment of a state-licensed group home, regardless of size. The zoning
ordinance (last amended in 2011) states (in part) that State licensed group homes, foster homes,
residential care facilities, and similar state-licensed facilities, regardless of the number of
occupants, are deemed permitted by right in a residential zoning district, pursuant to state and
federal law.
There are no special conditions for group homes that also provide services, such as counseling, if
there will be six persons or fewer in residence, or if the larger facility is located in a commercial
zone or civic center. However, if the larger facility is planned in a residential zone, the service
component will become a part of the Use Permit process outlined above.
HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS
In 2007, the State passed SB 2, requiring that all jurisdictions have at least one zone, where
residential uses are allowed, in which at least one year-round emergency shelter is permitted by
right. The City of Turlock has established an Emergency Shelter Overlay Zone, where emergency
shelters may be permitted by right through a nondiscretionary permit process. To qualify for a
nondiscretionary permit, the proposed shelter should be located in the Emergency Shelter
Overlay Zone and within a Heavy Commercial (HC), Community Commercial (CC), Industrial
(I), Downtown Industrial Residential (IR), or Downtown Transitional Commercial (TC) zoning
district. In addition, emergency shelters are permitted by conditional use permit in four out of
five residential districts (they are not permitted in the RE district) and in the CO, CC, and CH
commercial districts.
Supportive and transitional housing is included in the definitions for both single family and
multifamily housing in Turlock’s Zoning Ordinance, and is considered a residential use of
property. Thus, supportive and transitional housing of any occupancy level is subject only to
those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in a given zone.
Similarly, in agricultural districts, supportive and transitional housing is permitted by right in
second dwelling units, and is subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential
dwellings of the same type in that zone.
Constraints Removal Efforts: Emergency, Supportive, and Transitional Housing
The City of Turlock recognizes the need to address ongoing constraints to the establishment of
emergency, supportive, and transitional housing in the City. Through the Public Services grants
administered by its Housing Program Services Division, the City provides financial assistance to
local nonprofit agencies. These funds may be granted for a number of public service activities,
including emergency shelter and supportive and transitional housing services.
The City of Turlock amended its zoning ordinance to comply with SB 2 in 2012. Programs under
Policy 1-3-2 describe the City’s continuing commitment to implement and review its Emergency
Shelter Overlay zone (described above), as well as providing financial assistance (when available)
and other support to nonprofit agencies for the establishment of emergency, supportive, and
transitional housing. Please see Section 4.3 and Policy 1-3-2 (in Chapter 6) for more details on the
City’s policies to provide housing for individuals experiencing homelessness.

5.2 Non-Governmental Constraints
The ability to address the underserved needs of the citizens of the City of Turlock is challenging,
especially since so many of the impediments to providing services are beyond the scope of
municipal governments. The responsibility for identifying, responding to, and mitigating these
needs rests with the variety of agencies providing services. Funding limitations exist at all levels.
The private market influences the selling and rental prices of all types of housing, which includes
existing and new dwelling units. While actions within the public sector play important parts in
determining the cost of housing, the private sector affects the residential markets through such
mechanisms as supply costs (i.e., land, construction, financing) and value of consumer preference.
CURRENT HOUSING MARKET
Since 2012, Turlock has seen a gradual increase in new housing production following a significant
decline associated with the nationwide weak housing market and economic recession. From 2000
to 2005, the City was issuing an average of about 700 building permits per year, which dropped to
around 250 permits per year between 2006 and 2008. Between 2009 and 2014, the City issued an
average of 52 residential building permits per year, with a low of 28 permits in 2011; since 2011,
the number of permits issued each year has increased to 95 residential building permits in 2014.
This trend suggests that the residential development market is recovering, though it is unclear if
or when rate of housing production will return to early-2000 levels.
The housing market is also subject to the cyclical nature of the housing industry. Housing
production can vary widely from year to year with periods of above-average production followed
by periods of below-average production. Fluctuations are common in most industries, but appear
to be more dramatic in the homebuilding sector because of the susceptibility of the industry to
changes in federal fiscal and monetary policies. Turlock has had a relatively stable housing market
in the past despite interest rate fluctuations. Between 1980 and 2008, building permits for new
residential units have averaged 466 units per year; although, as noted above, economic conditions
of the past decade have contributed to a decline in permit issuances recently.
AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
One of the significant components to overall housing cost is financing. After decades of slight
fluctuations in the prime rate, the 1980s saw a rise in interest rates, which peaked at
approximately 18.8 percent in 1982. As the decade closed and the economy weakened, the
prevailing interest rate was around 10 percent. The 1990s saw interest rates drop dramatically,
fluctuating between 6 and 8 percent, and through 2008, the rates on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage
varied between just below 6 percent and 8 percent. The 2000s saw some mortgage rates fall below
6 percent for the first time since the 1960s. Between 2004 and 2006, many Americans were able to
utilize very low and adjustable interest rates to purchase homes otherwise out of their price range.
Through mid-2008, home mortgage financing was readily available to residents of Turlock and
California at large, but economic conditions at that time saw housing prices drop precipitously
and it became significantly more difficult to obtain a home purchase loan. In particular, in
response to the contribution of mortgage-backed securities to the financial crisis, people with

                                                                                     Chapter 5: Constraints
short credit history, lower incomes, self-employment incomes, or other unusual circumstances
have had trouble qualifying for loans or have been charged higher rates.
Interest rates continued to decrease from 2008 through 2012, when the average annual rate
reached 3.66 percent, the lowest in decades. Each year since 2012, the average annual rate has
increased slightly, and in 2014, the average annual interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
was 4.17 percent.
As discussed in the Housing Needs Assessment chapter, the median sale price for a single family
home in Turlock during the period from December 2014 to March 2015 was $255,000. Table 5.2-
1 shows how housing affordability varies with interest rates. Assuming a 10 percent down
payment and a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, the Principal-Interest-Taxes-Insurance (PITI)
payment can be estimated between $1,418 for a 4 percent interest rate and $2,169 for a 9 percent
interest rate. These monthly payments are affordable for households with incomes between
$56,700 and $87,000. In 2013, an estimated 53 percent of Turlock households had incomes of
$50,000 or greater, so it can be estimated that less than half of households would be able to afford
the typical single family home at a four percent interest rate or higher. Thirty-four percent of
households had incomes of $75,000 or greater, meaning that about a third or fewer of Turlock’s
households could afford a typical single family home at a higher interest rate of 9 percent.

First Time Homebuyers Program
The need to assist low income entry-level homebuyers has always been an aspect of a
comprehensive housing program, and the City of Turlock has established its First Time
Homebuyers Program (FTHB) for this purpose. These homebuyers could be caught between
increasing rents and the difficulty of saving money for a down payment, while preferring an
opportunity to own a home and accumulate equity. Such households generally are willing to pay
up to 35 percent of their income in order to own their own home. With housing prices slowly
increasing in Turlock, the continuation of the FTHB program is a high priority for the City, and
Policy 1-2-1 continues the program.
                                                                                                       5-17

Turlock Housing Element
The FTHB program helps eligible households purchase a home with loans of 40% of the sales
price of the home to assist with the down payment. Loans are provided at a fixed 3 percent
interest rate for a period of 30 years, and no monthly payments are required. Households must
have incomes at or below 80 percent of the Stanislaus County area median income (AMI). For a
typical four-person household this income limit is $45,500 based on Fiscal Year 2015 Income
Limits from the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD). For those with incomes
below 60 percent of AMI ($34,140 for a four-person household), an additional $10,000 is
available. Funding for this program comes from the HOME program. The applicant must
contribute a minimum of $3,000 to the down payment, which must be available at the time of
application.
In addition to the income requirements, applicants must have good credit, must be able to qualify
for a new current market rate first mortgage, must not have owned a home within the last three
years, and must occupy the purchased home as the primary residence.
COST OF CONSTRUCTION
The costs of labor and materials have a direct impact on the price of housing and are the main
components of housing cost. Residential construction costs vary greatly depending upon the
quality, size, and the materials being used. Estimates for a basic two-story wood frame single
family unit using standard materials can range from $75 per square foot for a 2,200 square foot
home to $84 per square foot for a 1,600 square foot home.1 These “hard” construction costs do no
include costs associated with permits and fees, land acquisition, site work, and lot improvement,
design, marketing, or administrative overhead (“soft” costs). Soft costs can account for about 20
percent of overall construction costs.2
Construction Financing
Limited construction financing may have contributed to the decline in new construction during
the previous planning period. In the current market, construction loans for new housing have
been difficult to secure. In the past, lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new
construction (loan to value ratio). In recent years, due to market conditions and government
regulations, banks have required larger investment by the builder. Complicated projects such as
mixed-use developments have been among the more difficult to finance.
COST OF LAND
The cost of raw, developable land has a direct impact on the cost of a new home and is therefore a
potential non-governmental constraint. The higher the raw land costs, the higher the price of a
new home. Normally, developers will seek to obtain city approvals for the largest number of lots
possible on a given parcel of raw land. This allows the developer to spread the costs for off-site
improvements (i.e., streets, water lines, etc.) over the maximum number of units.

As of April 2015, land on a number of online real estate listing services3 ranges from an average of
$418,000 for residentially zoned land to an average of $383,000 per acre for land zoned for
planned developments where multi-lot developments may be possible.
The average price of raw land in Turlock overall (zoned for all land uses) is around $593,000 per
acre4. These are prices for land located within Turlock’s current city limits. Average prices drop
substantially outside of the city limits, as evidenced by parcels south of city limits listed from
$37,000 to $70,000 per acre.
As the availability of vacant residential land becomes scarcer over time, the cost of vacant land in
the City will increase. However, there is currently a large supply of vacant residentially-zoned
land within the city limits. As a general rule, if the land cost component in the City of Turlock
remains within 35 percent of development costs, then the availability of land should not pose a
significant constraint on the development of housing for all income groups. Assuming a 1,600
square foot home with hard construction costs of $84 per square foot, plus an additional 20
percent (of the total construction cost) for soft costs, the total construction costs for the house
would be approximately $168,000. Then, taking the current average residential land price in
Turlock of $418,000 per acre, and assuming that the home is built on property zoned for seven
units per acre, the land cost for the lot would be approximately $59,700. Therefore, in this typical
case, the land cost is 36 percent of the construction cost, and just 26 percent of the total
development costs, which indicates that land costs are within a reasonable range and should not
pose a constraint.
Constraints Removal Efforts: Cost of Real Estate
Often, the purchase price of land or existing properties is a substantial constraint to affordable
housing development, especially for nonprofit organizations. During the previous planning
period, the City of Turlock sought to take advantage of the economic downturn, drop in prices,
and Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funding to purchase land and foreclosed homes
at a reduced cost in order to increase the supply of real estate available and accessible for
affordable housing provision. The City successfully acquired and rehabilitated eight homes with
NSP funding; however, the City has not received any additional NSP funding since 2013. If
additional funding were to become available for these activities, the City would look to repeat this
successful program if the need existed.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
While many cities in California confront significant environmental constraints on housing
development, Turlock is located such that environmental hazards are essentially nonexistent. The
city is not near any active faults; its flat terrain precludes the danger of landslides; and its
agricultural soils are not subject to shrink-swell or subsidence. The topography and nature of
urban and agricultural development makes the risk of wildfires very low. There are no areas in
floodplains and virtually no wetlands aside from those in existing parks or on farms or pastures
outside the city limits. While the flat terrain may occasionally lead to minor flooding on

impervious areas during large storm events, this is not considered to be a constraint to housing
development as City infrastructure is capable of handling the stormwater runoff. Section 4.6
provides additional information on the environmental constraints of the opportunity sites as well
as the City’s capacity to provide adequate infrastructure.

6   Housing Programs
The purpose of this chapter is to formulate a housing program that will guide the City of Turlock
and all of its housing stakeholders toward the preservation, improvement and development of
housing for all economic levels. It is the City’s intent to create a municipal climate that
encourages quality, varied, affordable housing development by both the public and private
sectors. The following chapter includes goals, objectives, policies, and programs that will form the
foundation for specific activities.
HOUSING PROGRAMS FUNDING SOURCES AND IMPLEMENTATION
Where appropriate, the list of policies includes funding sources for each program. However, the
Housing Element does not determine the precise amount and allocation of funds for each
program; rather, this is determined through specific annual or five-year plans associated with
each funding source.
The HOME Consortium receives funding of about $800,000 annually. As the lead agency, the City
of Turlock can choose where to direct those funds.
The City of Turlock, through the Housing Division, must prepare a five-year Consolidated Plan
to describe the types of projects the City is proposing. Each year, a specific Annual Action Plan is
required to further refine the goals and projects originally proposed in the Consolidated Plan.
The HOME consortium member agencies (Newman, Ceres, Oakdale, Patterson, Waterford,
Stanislaus County, and Turlock) develop a plan detailing the projects proposed for funding under
this program. This plan is also included in the five-year Consolidated Plan. Therefore, all projects
proposed for funding with HOME consortium funds must be consistent with five-year plan as
well as the Annual Action Plan. HOME consortium funds are also allocated to the City on an
annual basis, and they are required to be used for affordable housing and supportive service
projects.
                                                                                                 6-1

Note:
* Average Density is used for determining realistic capacity. For the parcels zoned other than PD, Allowable Density for
   that particular zone is used.
For anything zoned PD, the average density is determined using the underlying General Plan Designation.
** Realistic Unit Capacity is determined by multiplying average density with total acres of the site. In case of mixed
   uses/mixed zones (eg. RHCC, CORH etc), only the half of the site is assumed residential and units calculated likewise.

A.2 Underutilized Sites Description
The following tables and photographs provide additional detail on a representative sample of sites
within the inventory identified as “underutilized” (rather than “vacant” or “agriculture”). The vast
majority of underutilized sites listed in the Sites Inventory Table currently have low or medium
density residential existing land uses, most typically in the form of single family homes. For this
reason, most of the examples shown in this section are underutilized sites with existing single
family homes.
317 Linwood
APN 050019019000
Zoned R-M
Redevelopment Potential:
There is one existing single family dwelling, built in 1920, on this 1.2 acre site. Since the home is situated
on the southeast corner of the property, the site can be easily designed to accommodate
10-12 additional dwelling units.
                                                                       303

100 Pedras
APN 071015009000
Zoned R-H
Redevelopment Potential:
There are two single family homes on this 1.8 acre property. The home situated on the rear portion of
this site is in disrepair and has no paved access to a public street. The second single family home, in
relatively good condition, is situated near Pedras, in the northwest corner of the subject site, and could be
maintained with the potential addition of 25 to 38 dwelling units to the property.

Section 65583(a)(1)). [Section 3.6]
B.4 Sites Inventory and Analysis
Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development. Government Code Section
65583(a)(3) requires local governments to prepare an inventory of land suitable for residential
development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment, and an
analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites. The inventory
of land suitable for residential development shall be used to identify sites that can be developed
for housing within the planning period (Section 65583.2). [Section 4.2, Appendix A]
Environmental Constraints and Adequate Infrastructure Capacity. Government Code Section
65583.2(b)(4) requires a general description of any environmental constraints to the development

Realistic Development Capacity. Government Code Section 65583.2(c) requires, as part of the
analysis of available sites, a local government to demonstrate the projected residential
development capacity of the sites identified in the housing element can realistically be achieved.
Based on the information provided in subdivision (b), a city or county shall determine whether
each site in the inventory can accommodate some portion of its share of the regional housing
need by income level during the planning period, as determined pursuant to Section 65584. The
number of units calculated shall be adjusted as necessary, based on the land use controls and site
improvements requirement identified in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583.
[Section 4.2, Appendix A]

                             Appendix B: California Housing Element Requirements and Where Addressed
Analysis of Non-Vacant and Underutilized Sites. The inventory sites that have potential for
residential developed can include non-vacant and underutilized sites (Section 65583.2(b)(3)). The
element must include an explanation of the methodology for determining the realistic buildout
potential of these sites within the planning period (Section 65583.2(g)). [Section 4.2, Appendix A]
Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate the Development of Housing Affordable to Lower-
Income Households. The densities of sites identified in the inventory must be sufficient to
encourage and facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-income households

element to shall identify adequate sites for a variety of housing types including multifamily rental
housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, supportive
housing, single-room occupancy units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. [Sections 4.3
and 5.1]
Second Units. Government Code Section 65583.1(a) allows a city or county to identify sites for
second units based on the number of second units developed in the prior housing element
planning period whether or not the units are permitted by right, the need for these units in the
community, the resources or incentives available for their development, and any other relevant
factors, as determined by the department. [Section 4.4, Policy 2-1-3]
Adequate Sites Alternative. Government Code Section 65583.1 (a) and (c) allows second units
and, under prescribed conditions, units that are substantially rehabilitated, converted from
market rate to affordable, or where unit affordability is preserved to be counted towards the
adequate sites requirement. [Section 4.5]
