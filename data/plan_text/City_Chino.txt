5 COMMUNITY CHARACTER ELEMENT
  Chino began as an agricultural community around a railroad depot in 1887.
  The City maintained its agricultural focus well into the 1940s, expanding its
  focus to include dairy production. In the 1980s, the City shifted toward in-
  dustrial, warehouse, and distribution land uses. Today, Chino maintains a
  strong sense of its agrarian roots even though it displays a diverse economy.
  Chino residents take pride in their involvement in youth sports, religious
  groups, schools, and other community organizations, and value the City’s
  small town character, even while its population has grown and experienced
  economic expansion. These key elements of Chino’s community character
  have built a strong foundation as the City has worked toward creating a
  healthy city. This element includes policy statements that will help the City
  continue to maintain its small town character, improve community design,
  and achieve improved public health.
  This Element specifies how new development should look, feel, and function,
  and provides guidance for ongoing improvements of established areas of the
  City. It includes creative approaches to integrating new and more established
  areas of the City.
  This element is organized into the following sections:
    ♦ Background. Describes the character of the distinct areas in Chino.
    ♦ Community Design Principles.          Describes key features of a well-
      designed community.
    ♦ Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Provides policy guidance to
      the City related to community character decisions.
    ♦ Indicators. Provides methods for evaluating progress on implementing
      the Community Character Element.

                                     A. Background
                                     Chino can be divided into several distinct areas, each with its own character.
                                     Descriptions of the areas follows, and their locations are shown on Figure
                                     CC-1.
                                       ♦ Chino’s Civic Center. This area is the core of the City, located at Cen-
                                           tral Avenue and Chino Avenue, which features key civic components,
                                           such as the City Hall, a branch of the County library, and the Chino
                                           Transit Center.
                                       ♦ Downtown. A limited number of older, commercial buildings adjacent
                                           to the Civic Center constitute Chino’s Downtown. These buildings sur-
                                           vive from the early days of Chino and provide a connection to the City’s
                                           past.
                                       ♦ Central neighborhoods. These are the oldest, residential areas sur-
                                           rounding the Civic Center. They fit the pattern of traditional neighbor-
                                           hoods and contain one- and two-story bungalows, many of which predate
                                           the 1920s. Many of the streets have good tree cover that provides shade
                                           for streets, sidewalks, and front yards. An alley system exists so that
                                           front sidewalks are not interrupted by driveways. The design of the
                                           homes has historically included front porches and other architectural fea-
                                           tures that emphasize a pedestrian scale. Such details are not as evident in
                                           recent construction and remodels.
                                       ♦ 20th Century suburban neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were
                                           built in the decades following World War II. Most of the housing stock
                                           was built up to the 1980s. They are primarily auto-oriented, with limited
                                           sidewalks and prominent garages. The street network is less regular than
                                           the central neighborhoods, including more cul-de-sacs that restrict con-
                                           nectivity within the neighborhoods.
                                       ♦ East Chino. This area was primarily developed in the late 1980’s
                                           through the present, and is characterized by a loop road that connects
                                           single-family residential neighborhoods to a series of school sites and

                                           ity corridor” of higher-intensity uses, such as multi-family housing,
                                           shopping centers and business parks. Neighborhood entry monuments
                                           located on arterial streets are also a defining characteristic of this area.
                                       ♦ Rural neighborhoods. The rural neighborhoods predominate in the
                                           northwest part of Chino, as well as in the unincorporated Sphere of In-
                                           fluence (SOI). They are marked by parcels that are deeper than they are
                                           wide, and streets that lack curbs, gutters, sidewalks and trees. The homes
                                           in these neighborhoods are more varied than in the 20th Century subur-
                                           ban neighborhoods, reflecting development in different time periods.
                                           Some of these areas focus on rural uses such as horse-raising or small-scale
                                           crops.
                                       ♦ The Preserve and College Park. These two Specific Plan areas were de-
                                           signed in the early 2000s using New Urbanist principles. They incorpo-
                                           rate mixed-use development, bringing community services close to where
                                           people live. Walkability is also a central theme of the design of these two
                                           areas. The homes are more varied in size and design than in other parts
                                           of the City.
                                       ♦ Retail corridors. Chino includes several retail corridors in close prox-
                                           imity to where people live and work. The main corridors are along Cen-
                                           tral Avenue and Riverside Drive. They were built as the City expanded
                                           over the past 50 years, but have never developed a cohesive look and feel.
                                           They include a wide range of development types, including small offices,
                                           mini-malls, some multi-family housing, and restaurants. Some buildings
                                           are close to the street, while others have extensive front parking lots.
                                       ♦ Shopping centers. Unlike retail corridors, which developed gradually,
                                           Chino’s shopping centers were more often developed, or redeveloped, all
                                           at one time. The primary shopping centers are The Spectrum and those
                                           near the intersection of State Route 60 and Central Avenue. Although
                                           these were developed at different times, they all include extensive parking
                                           areas and pedestrian connections between the stores, allowing patrons to
                                           stroll from one store to another.

  ♦ Industrial areas. Chino’s industrial areas are primarily those located in
     the southern part of the City, consisting of very large warehouse and
     manufacturing buildings. These buildings feature large loading docks and
     are separated from the rest of the City by the driveways and employee
     parking lots. Some smaller-scale industrial uses, including those just to
     the south of the Civic Center, are more integrated into the surrounding
     area, with smaller buildings, driveways, and loading areas.
  ♦ Agricultural areas. Agricultural uses exist throughout Chino. Most are
     dairy operations in the southern part of the City. These consist primar-
     ily of feeding areas and barns, rather than open agricultural fields. Some
     open agricultural fields are found in the City, with accompanying wind-
     rows. Although these areas are now limited in size, they provide a strong
     connection to Chino’s agricultural past.
  ♦ Open space areas. Open space areas in Chino consist primarily of open
     fields in the southern part of the City, below the 566-foot elevation line
     associated with the Prado Dam.
  ♦ Institutions. By far the largest institution in Chino is the California In-
     stitution for Men, a large prison facility in the southern part of the City.
     Its main buildings are not visible from public roads, but the facility sepa-
     rates southern parts of Chino, including The Preserve and the Chino Air-
     port, from the older, more established parts of the City.
B. Community Design Principles
Community design addresses the image or character of a city’s built environ-
ment. It considers the relationship between the location of uses and the visual
appearance and character of the built environment, with the ultimate goal of
attaining a strong sense of place. In addition to making a place that people
relate to clearly, strong community design supports a healthy community.
Pleasant, tree-lined streets are more likely to encourage people to walk or
bicycle to get around their neighborhoods. Well-designed public spaces en-
courage people to get outside and encourage people to interact with their
                                                                                                                  CC-5

C I T Y O F C H I N O

                                     neighbors and community members. That level of interaction supports men-
                                     tal health, as well as increasing options for physical activity.
                                     A well-designed community is also a sustainable community. The potential
                                     for pedestrian and bicycle travel reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Sustain-
                                     ability is also about equity, and community design principles focus on im-
                                     proving the day-to-day environment of all residents of the community, mak-
                                     ing public areas more accessible and diverse.
                                     Six community design principles that will lead to healthy, more livable com-
                                     munities are discussed below. To the extent possible, these principles should
                                     be applied at all scales of development in Chino, from individual buildings to
                                     larger development projects and should apply to new development as well as
                                     the redevelopment of existing areas.
                                     1. Human-Scale Design
                                     People feel most comfortable and secure in environments that are designed at
                                     the scale of the individual. At a neighborhood level, this translates into
                                     shorter block lengths that are walkable and provide more connections
                                     throughout a neighborhood. At a site or building design level, human-scale
                                     design involves the massing of buildings, articulation of building facade, or-
                                     ganization of buildings on a site, landscaping of public and private areas and
                                     use of color and materials. Generally, this means avoiding or minimizing the
                                     use of soundwalls and cul-de-sacs in residential development and ensuring that
                                     retail, office and commercial development presents an attractive “face” to the
                                     street.
                                     2. Pedestrian Orientation
                                     Designing places that are pedestrian-oriented rather than automobile-oriented
                                     often can discourage the consumption of fossil fuels, encourage a healthy life-
                                     style that includes walking, and promote the use of public spaces. Pedestrian
                                     orientation involves providing good physical connections between destina-
                                     tions, a mix of uses in close proximity to each other, and a safe walking envi-
                                     ronment. In terms of building design, pedestrian orientation can be achieved

                                                                                               C I T Y O F C H I N O
                                                                                                G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                      C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
by orienting buildings to the street and providing pedestrian amenities such as
awnings, benches, and attractive street lighting.
Increasing pedestrian-orientation not only enhances attractiveness and safety,
but it also offers people the option to forgo reliance on auto travel. The chal-
lenge in pedestrian-oriented development is to plan for non-auto travel while
recognizing that the automobile will also continue to play an important part
in transportation.
3. Focal Points
Focal points are locations that serve as meeting and gathering places. Exam-
ples include shopping areas, restaurants, churches, schools, plazas, parks, and
                                                                                           Development surrounding a focal point.
community centers. Focal points are important components of a community
because they provide a common location for people to meet, talk, shop, and
play. They are also locations to sit and relax, read, or converse.
4. Visual Landmarks
A visual landmark is an element that orients people and helps to create a
unique identity for an area. Examples of visual landmarks include statues,
major works of public art, historic buildings, water towers, significant land-
scaping or land forms, and other easily identifiable features. Entryways to the
City or a neighborhood can also be marked by landmarks such as fountains,
attractive signage, or natural features such as rows of trees.                                        Landmark.
5. Edges
Edges help to define space and in built environments they can be created by
buildings or rows of trees. Edges can have differing degrees of permeability.
For example, an edge created by a wall would be considered “impermeable.”
A building can create a “semi-permeable” edge with a feature such as a col-
umned arcade, which allows people visual and physical access between the
sidewalk area and the private property. Ensuring that buildings, trees or
other architectural features provide edges or definition to the street enhances

Edges are particularly important in areas with high pedestrian traffic, such as

                                     the Civic Center. Cities, as a whole, are also defined by their edges. In gen-
                                     eral, edges can be “hard,” where there is an abrupt or clearly defined transi-
                                     tion between urban and rural or undeveloped uses or “soft,” where the transi-
                                     tion between urban and rural is more gradual or smooth.
                                     6. Building Siting
                                     Buildings should be sited carefully to enhance the built environment. In par-
                                     ticular, buildings in central areas and along major corridors should generally
                                     be sited to create a strong street edge and to “hold corners” by placing devel-
   Building edges.                   opment at the corner lots of intersections close to or at the lot line. Strategi-
                                     cally placing development along street fronts and on corner sites gives better
                                     definition to a street or intersection, which makes pedestrians feel less ex-
                                     posed to the adjacent traffic. Ensuring that buildings in Chino are designed to
                                     hold street edges and corners of key intersections will enhance the visual qual-
                                     ity and the safety of the pedestrian environment as compared to development
                                     that provides “a sea of asphalt” to passersby. Along certain corridors, such as
                                     Euclid Avenue, additional setbacks along the roadway may be desired in or-
                                     der to preserve significant views of the San Gabriel Mountains and the Chino
                                     Hills.

  P2.    New development should preserve, restore, rehabilitate, reuse,
         and maintain existing buildings that have historic character or
         other community value.
  P3.    New multi-family housing shall be in scale with surrounding
         residential neighborhoods and shall feature similar setbacks,
         complementary building arrangements, and patterns that
         avoid overwhelming building scale and visual obstructions.
  P4.    New single-family housing shall be designed to be compatible
         with adjacent neighborhoods. Considerations such as building
         height, size, and setbacks shall be taken into consideration in

              place.
  Objective CC-3.1         Establish a focal point in every neighbor-
  hood.
  Policies
     P1.    Every neighborhood should have at least one focal point,
            which should be a park, school, plaza, clubhouse, recreation
            center, retail, open space, or combination thereof.
     P2.    Focal points shall have ample public spaces that are accessible
            to all citizens.
     P3.    Focal points should be within ¼-mile walking distance of any
            point in the neighborhood.
  Actions
     A1.    Conduct a study to determine which established neighbor-
            hoods have focal points and which lack them. Create follow-
            up programs to create focal points where they are lacking., as
            well as programs to enhance existing focal points.

8 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  The Economic Development Element reflects the community’s desire to
  maintain and nurture Chino’s diverse economy through the next 20 years.
  The element seeks to set a policy framework to ensure that Chino stays com-
  petitive in the evolving Inland Empire economy, attracts successful and local-
  serving businesses, provides stable employment opportunities, and contrib-
  utes to the fiscal vitality of the City. This element contains goals, objectives,
  policies, and actions to encourage the development of the kinds of business
  and commercial activities suitable for Chino’s quality of life and economic
  viability, while preserving Chino’s small-town character.
  The Economic Development Element is not required by State law, but must
  be consistent with the other elements in the General Plan. The Land Use
  Element and the Economic Development Element particularly must be con-
  sistent in the allocation of land use designations that match the needs of
  Chino’s growing economy. The purpose of this Element is to identify grow-
  ing economic sectors, determine how employment demand will generate a
  need for different land uses, and develop goals, objectives, policies, and ac-
  tions to ensure land is available for future growth.
  This element is divided into five sections.
    ♦ Economic Conditions. Describes employment trends, key industries,
       and projections for the future.
    ♦ Jobs/Housing Balance. Describes demographic conditions and how the
       City’s workforce relates to jobs found in the City.
    ♦ Fiscal Conditions. Describes the City’s budget as it relates to economic
       development.
    ♦ Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Provides guidance to the City
       related to economic development.
    ♦ Indicators. Provides methods for evaluating progress on implementing
       the Economic Development Element.
                                                                                    ED-1

                                       This section provides a description of the background economic conditions in
                                       Chino, including employment and industrial trends, and an overview of in-
                                       dustrial growth.
                                       1. Employment Trends
                                       Chino’s economy has changed dramatically in the past 30 years. Once the
                                       country’s top dairy area, with a high percentage of land dedicated to row and
                                       orchard crops, Chino’s economy is now centered on manufacturing, whole-
                                       sale trade, distribution and logistics, and household-serving businesses.
                                       Three trends have most influenced the shift in Chino’s economy over the past
                                       30 years:
                                         ♦ Residential Expansion of the Greater Los Angeles Region. Chino ex-
                                            perienced a surge in residential development beginning in the mid-1960s.
                                            Cropland gave way to new housing as Chino’s population tripled be-
                                            tween 1970 and 1990. Public employment surged, as did household-
                                            serving businesses.
                                         ♦ Manufacturing’s Flight from Coastal Counties. Chino’s greatest pe-
                                            riod of economic growth was in the 1990s, when employment doubled.
                                            High land prices, competition for land in cities to the west, and access to
                                            uncongested highways pushed industrial uses inland.
                                         ♦ Expansion of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, and other
                                            Transportation Infrastructure Investments. The emergence of the
                                            Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles as two of the highest-volume ports
                                            in the world fueled strong interest in building large distribution opera-
                                            tion in cities like Chino. In addition, improvements to State Highways
                                            60, 71, 91, Interstates 10 and 15, and investments in Ontario Airport have
                                            made the Chino area appealing to national distribution companies.
                                                 1
                                                   The employment data analysis was completed in 2006 using the most recent
                                       data available at that time. In 2006, the latest year that California Employment De-
                                       velopment Department data was available for the City of Chino was 2004.

                                                                                                         G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                             E C O N O M I C D E V E L O P M E N T E L E M E N T
Between 1992 and 2004, Chino’s economy nearly doubled in size, adding
more than 19,000 jobs. With this growth rate, Chino even outpaced the
quickly expanding economies of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, as
shown in Table ED-1.
2. Industry Growth
Chino’s economic growth from 1992 to 2004 was driven by continued expan-
sion of its manufacturing sector. Manufacturing firms added over 5,700 new
jobs to the Chino economy during that time, accounting for 30 percent of the
City’s employment growth. The construction sector, business and profes-
sional services sector, and transportation and warehousing sector all grew
over this period as well. Retail employment growth was slower in Chino
than in other parts of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. This decline in
retail employment growth likely reflects the shift in Chino’s growth from
housing development to employment-related expansion. When most of
Chino’s growth was in housing, this drove a related expansion in industries
that support households. But, as this growth has leveled off, the need for new
stores and personal services has also leveled off, or even declined slightly.
3. Chino’s Economy Today
The trends outlined above have transformed Chino’s economy into one that
is highly competitive, rapidly growing and tied into a regional economy that
is generally strong. These conditions are moderated by the current economic
downturn, but are expected to return along with the resurgence of the na-
tional economy. While Manufacturing, Wholesale Trade, Distribution and
Logistics, Construction, and Retail Businesses now form the core of the
economy, professional, and business-support companies are beginning to
emerge as important sectors as well, capturing an increasing share of educated
workers living in the Inland Empire.
In 2004, Chino’s economy provided more than 38,000 jobs.2 As shown in
Figure ED-1, manufacturing firms accounted for the largest percentage of

                                       ployers, with five firms among the City’s top ten. Wholesale trade businesses
                                       and transportation and warehousing companies, which often have similar
                                       “logistics” roles in Chino, form the second largest block of industries when
                                       the two categories are combined. Public sector employment, while catego-
                                       rized as “other,” accounts for 10 percent of all City jobs. This sector is large
                                       because it includes Chino’s three correctional facilities as well as the local
                                       school system. The Chino Valley Unified School District is the largest single
                                       employer in Chino with approximately 1,168 jobs.
                                       by city. In 2004, EDD recorded an annual average of 39,121 jobs in zip code 91710,
                                       which closely approximates the City of Chino’s boundaries.

 4. Future Growth
 This section presents projected growth in the near future for Chino’s eco-
 nomic sectors as well as employment projections for the Inland Empire as a
 whole. The growth patterns of the Inland Empire subregion will have an
 important impact on Chino’s economy, and are shown in Table ED-2.
 Transportation and Warehousing is expected to grow at the fastest pace in the
 coming years, closely followed by Business and Professional Services. The
 slow growth of Manufacturing, at the bottom of Table ED-2, is consistent
 with nationwide trends.
                3
                  Generally, the EDD statistics follow the two-digit NAICS industrial classi-
 fication system. However, in the pie chart three NAICS sectors have been collapsed
 into one – (1) Administrative Support and Waste Services; (2) Professional, Scientific &
 Technical Skills; and (3) Management of Companies and Enterprises – into a new cate-
 gory called “Business and Professional Services,” to make larger patterns clearer.
                                                                                                                                                        ED-5

                                       regional economy, or the Inland Empire sector as a whole, other sectors (e.g.
                                       Manufacturing, Information, Health Care, and Food/Accommodation) have
                                       succeeded locally despite lesser growth among Inland Empire counterparts.

or national trends. The table is based on local data analysis and qualitative

B. Jobs-Housing Balance in Chino
This section addresses the relationship between Chino’s economy and its
resident workforce, and identifies opportunities to minimize long commutes.
1. Demographics
Expected growth in Chino’s population will contribute to economic growth.
The growth rate for housing units and population is expected to outpace em-
ployment by 2025, but the growth in employment will still be significant.
Population growth will create demand for housing units and retail businesses,
and will broaden the pool of workers for all industries. The provision of a
range of housing types will increase the diversity of new residents and in turn
fill the job market in Chino’s diverse economy.
2. Chino’s Workforce
Chino’s economy features nearly twice as many jobs today as it did in the
early 1990s. The ratio of jobs to housing has also been rapidly increasing over
the same time period. By 2002, Chino had transitioned from a bedroom
community, with fewer jobs than employed residents, to a city with a signifi-
cant “job surplus.” Chino’s economy in 2004 provided 1.4 jobs per employed
resident, resulting in a jobs-housing ratio between 2.1 and 1.5 employed per-
sons per household.
Chino also features a positive jobs match, or the degree to which local jobs
match the skill sets and household costs of local residents. Although Chino
residents on average have less formal education than residents in San Bernar-
dino and Los Angeles counties, the educational attainment levels of Chino
                                                                                                                 ED-7

                                       chief or growing employment sectors in Chino:
                                         ♦ Administrative Services
                                         ♦ Freight Trucking
                                         ♦ Miscellaneous Manufacturing
                                         ♦ Professional and Technical Services
                                       Chino residents have access to an array of occupations, despite relatively low
                                       levels of post-secondary education. Many of these jobs require significant on-
                                       the-job training or related work experience, and residents have the education
                                       needed to access many of these local jobs.
                                       3. Commuting Patterns
                                       Only 22 percent of City residents work in Chino. This situation exists de-
                                       spite the fact that Chino has more jobs than employed residents, has a good
                                       match between educational requirements of local jobs and educational at-
                                       tainment of Chino residents, and has a variety of local jobs sufficient for two-
                                       working-parent families to earn a living. Chino residents are even less likely
                                       to work where they live than the average San Bernardino County resident,

                                                                                               G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                   E C O N O M I C D E V E L O P M E N T E L E M E N T
where 25 percent of residents work in the place where they live. Several fac-
tors may contribute to this disparity:
  ♦ The pay of many local occupations may be so close to the minimum sal-
     ary needed for families to raise a family that even modest pay increases
     elsewhere in the region are worth a longer commute.
  ♦ The late arrival of Chino’s economy relative to population growth may
     have sown the seeds for the ongoing disconnect between employment
     and place of residence.
  ♦ Even as Chino began to add more local employment opportunities, it is
     likely that local residents employed elsewhere in the region stayed with
     prior employers.
Interviews with local employers and recent reports suggest long commuting
may decrease in the coming years as professional and business services move
to the western Inland Empire to offer an alternative to professional workers
presently traveling far for work.
C. Fiscal Conditions
Every year, the City of Chino staff must balance service and infrastructure
costs with limited revenues in order to achieve the City’s long range planning
goals. The City’s ability to balance costs and revenues varies year-to-year
with the types of projects that are in planning or implementation phases, and
with ongoing fluctuations in revenues coming from a patchwork of sources.
As such, the relationship between the City budget and its General Plan poli-
cies, particularly land use policies, is highly complex.
The budget’s largest funding stream is the General Fund, which comes from a
variety of sources, including property tax, unsecured property tax, and sales
tax. The main expenditures from the General Fund are for police, fire, and
community services. The strong presence of industrial firms in Chino pro-
vides significant General Fund revenues and helps to diversify the City’s sales
                                                                                                                 ED-9

                                       tax base away from commercial development. Sales tax revenues can be sensi-
                                       tive to changes in the market and development in nearby communities. The
                                       recent decline of prices and sales in the housing market will reduce Chino’s
                                       ability to grow property tax revenues in the short- to mid-term. The City
                                       still receives considerable property tax revenues from commercial property,
                                       which has not experienced steep declines in value that have been seen in the
                                       residential market.

10 PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
   Public parks and recreational facilities are important contributions to quality
   of life in Chino. Parks are prime locations for physical activity, sports, re-
   laxation and community gatherings, which are all keys to a healthy commu-
   nity. Residents are more likely to participate in these activities when park
   space is in close proximity to their homes and recreational opportunities are
   readily available.
   The purpose of the Parks and Recreation Element is to ensure the compre-
   hensive and long-range preservation and management of a wide range of parks
   and recreation facilities throughout Chino. While State guidelines do not
   require a Parks and Recreation Element, it is a key component of the General
   Plan and plays an important role in planning for a healthy city.
   This element is divided into six sections:
     ♦ Parks Standards. This section describes park types and standards in
        Chino.
     ♦ Funding Sources. This section describes the Quimby Act and how it is
        implemented in Chino.
     ♦ Existing and Planned Facilities and Programs in 2009. This section
        describes existing and planned park and recreational facilities in Chino.
     ♦ Recommended Park and Recreational Facilities. This section describes
        the locations and types of parks and recreational facilities needed to meet
        Chino’s needs.
     ♦ Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. This section provides policy
        guidance for the future of Chino’s parks and recreation.
     ♦ Indicators. This section contains tools for evaluating the City’s progress
        with regard to parks and recreation.
                                                                                    PR-1

                                      A. Parks Standards
                                      1. Park Design Standards
                                      In order to plan for an efficient and beautiful park system in Chino, careful
                                      park standards for space requirements and park facilities are essential. Stan-
                                      dards are not absolute and must be evaluated in terms of local development
                                      and need. The following list summarizes park standards in Chino, which are
                                      based on standards recommended by the National Recreation and Park Asso-
                                      ciation. These standards are widely used as criteria by many local jurisdic-
                                      tions and have been modified slightly to meet the needs of Chino.
                                        ♦ Mini Parks: Mini parks are less than 2 acres and have a service radius of
                                           up to ¼-mile. They are intended to be centrally located within each resi-
                                           dential neighborhood. They are typically designed for families with pre-
                                           school children, and include a playground and grassy areas. Other ameni-
                                           ties may include picnic areas, shade shelters, BBQs, and basketball and
                                           tennis courts. These parks are generally considered local neighborhood
                                           features, and do not count towards the City’s total park acres unless they
                                           are one-half acre or more and have amenities that include a barbeque and
                                           picnic tables at a minimum.
                                        ♦ Formative Parks: Formative parks are between 2 and 5 acres, and are in-
                                           tended to be focal points within residential neighborhoods and to serve
                                           neighborhood residents. They have a service radius of up to ½-mile.
                                           Formative parks may have amenities such as picnic areas, tot lots, BBQs,
                                           play areas, restrooms, shade shelters, and basketball and tennis courts.
                                        ♦ Neighborhood Parks: Neighborhood parks range from 5 to 20 acres and
                                           have a service radius of up to 1-mile. Neighborhood parks are intended
                                           to serve recreational needs of local children, and may include tot lots,
                                           picnic facilities, multiple use courts, passive recreational areas, active rec-
                                           reation fields, such as for baseball or soccer, parking lots, community
                                           centers, special use facilities, and restrooms.
                                        ♦ Community Parks: Community parks are between 20 and 50 acres in
                                           size and have a service radius of up to 3 miles. Community parks are in-
                                           tended to provide for both local recreational activities and community-
                                           wide activities, and include lighted sports fields, tennis courts, swimming

     pools, community recreation centers, outdoor amphitheatres, and pedes-
     trian and bicycle trails.
  ♦ Regional Parks: Regional parks are at least 50 acres in size, serving a
     large population within a one-hour drive. They may include picnic areas,
     informal sports fields, formal sports activities, nature centers, boating and
     swimming areas, nature hiking and riding trails, and sports camps.
     Amenities typically found in Community and Neighborhood parks may
     also be included.
  ♦ Parkways and Recreational Trails: Parkways and recreational trails
     provide space for walking, running, skating, horseback riding, and cy-
     cling.
  ♦ Special Use Facilities: Special use facilities can include community cen-
     ters that provide a variety of programmed recreation and education ac-
     tivities, as well as public pools, skateboarding/BMX facilities, equestrian
     centers, handball courts, outdoor shuffleboard courts, amphitheatres, and
     community gardens.
2. Parkland Provision
Cities commonly set a goal of how many acres of park space they would like
to have per 1,000 residents. In Chino, the standard for provision of parks to
residents is 3 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. This standard includes
formative, neighborhood, and community parks, as well as mini parks that
are at least a one-half acre in size and that contain a barbeque and picnic tables
at a minimum, and regional parks under the City’s jurisdiction.
The Quimby Act requires cities to calculate park acreage relative to popula-
tion using the most recent U.S. Census. Additional background information
about the Act is provided in Section B of this element. Chino’s population at
the time of the 2000 Census was 67,168. Using the standard of 3 acres of
parkland per 1,000 residents, 202 acres of parkland are required to meet the
City’s standard. As of 2009, Chino has approximately 228 acres of formative,
neighborhood, community and mini parks, and regional parks, meeting the
criteria described above, and regional parks under the City’s jurisdiction, and
therefore exceeds this requirement.
                                                                                                                     PR-3

C I T Y O F C H I N O
G E N E R A L P L A N
P A R K S A N D R E C R E A T I O N E L E M E N T
                                      As Chino’s population grows, additional parks must be built to keep the ratio
                                      as high as possible. With a projected population of approximately 122,647 by
                                      2025, Chino will need approximately 368 acres of parks, an increase of ap-
                                      proximately 145 acres, to meet the goal of providing 3 acres per 1,000 resi-
                                      dents.1 The completion of the remaining parks planned for The Preserve and
                                      College Park areas will add approximately 117 acres, bringing the city’s total
                                      parkland to 345 acres. This would still leave a shortfall of approximately 23
                                      acres.
                                      3. Proximity to Parks
                                      In addition to the importance of the overall park acreage in the City, the loca-
                                      tion and relationship of park facilities to neighborhoods is extremely impor-
                                      tant. A ½-mile walk is the average maximum distance people will be inclined
                                      to walk to reach a destination, including a local park.
                                      B. Funding Sources
                                      The 1975 Quimby Act (California Government Code Section 66477) author-
                                      izes cities and counties to pass ordinances requiring developers to set aside
                                      land, donate conservation easements or pay fees as a means of ensuring ade-
                                      quate provision of parkland. Revenues generated through the Quimby Act
                                      cannot be used for the maintenance and operation of park facilities. A 1982
                                      amendment (AB 1600) to the Quimby Act requires agencies to demonstrate a
                                      strong relationship between the public need for the recreation facility or park
                                      land, and the type of development project upon which the fee is imposed.
                                      Under the Act, the dedication of land, payment of fees or both cannot exceed
                                      the proportionate amount necessary to provide 3 acres of park area per 1,000
                                      residents, unless the amount of existing parkland already exceeds that limit.
                                      Chino’s neighborhood and community parkland does not exceed 3 acres per
                                      1,000 residents.
                                                1
                                                  This projected population does not include the incarcerated population,
                                      which does not contribute to the demand for parks.

In addition to the Quimby Act, the City has numerous options for funding
parks. These include the use of monies from the General Fund, Redevelop-
ment funds within Redevelopment areas, the sale of local bonds, State-level
competitive grants for park funding available through the Prop 84 Statewide
Park Program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Habitat Conser-
vation Fund, and the Recreational Trails Program. At the federal level, enti-
tlement community funds are available through the Community Develop-
ment and Block Grant (CDBG) program.
C. Existing and Planned Facilities and Programs in 2009
1. Existing Parks and Open Space Facilities
As previously discussed, Chino counts the following park categories towards
its total park acreage: formative, neighborhood, and community parks, mini
parks that are at least a one-half acre in size and contain a barbeque and picnic
tables at a minimum, and regional parks under the City’s jurisdiction. As of
2009, Chino has approximately 228 acres of formative, neighborhood, and
regional parks, including mini parks greater than a ½-acre. There is also a
2,000-acre regional park, Prado Regional Park, in the southwestern part of the
City. In addition to facilities formally recognized as parks, some school play-
grounds and ballfields are available through permit outside of school hours.
The current parks and recreational facilities in Chino are heavily used for a
wide variety of recreational activities. Table PR-1 lists the City’s current and
planned parks. Figure PR-1 shows the locations of City parks. Additional
parks not operated by the City of Chino are listed in Table PR-2
There are also trails and corridors that contribute to open space in Chino.
Equestrian, cycling, and multi-use trails are discussed in the Traffic and Circu-
lation Element. Two Southern California Edison easements, in East Chino
and in The Preserve, serve as open space corridors in Chino. In addition,
there are open space areas along portions of Chino Creek, Cucamonga/Mill
Creek, Cypress Channel, and Magnolia Channel. In the future, these creeks
and channels may be protected under conservation and preservation ease-
ments. Policies under Objective OSC 1.1 in the Open Space and Conserva-
                                                                                                                    PR-5

                                      tion Element call for the protection of these areas, and for the promotion of
                                      easements to protect habitat areas and corridors. Cucamonga/Mill Creek
                                      would be protected under a conservation easement as a result of a mitigation
                                      measure of the Edgewater Communities EIR.
                                      In addition to the range of parks and open space areas located within Chino,
                                      Chino Hills State Park, located in the City of Chino Hills, provides 14,102
                                      acres and 65 miles of trails for camping, hiking, mountain biking, and horse-
                                      back riding.
                                      2. Planned Parks and Open Space Facilities
                                      As of 2009, several additional parks are planned as part of The Preserve and
                                      College Park Specific Plan areas. These are listed in Table PR-1. The planned
                                      parks in these areas are designed to provide neighborhood access within a
                                      maximum 10-minute walking distance. The Preserve will include 21 parks:
                                      one 42-acre community park, seven neighborhood parks ranging between 5
                                      and 10 acres in size, eight formative parks ranging between 2 and 4 acres in
                                      size, and several mini parks smaller than 2 acres in size. The Preserve will
                                      also include an urban plaza. One neighborhood park, two formative parks,
                                      and five mini parks have already been completed, with the remainder yet to
                                      be constructed.
                                      The College Park area will include one neighborhood park, one formative
                                      park and eight mini parks. Of these, the formative park and two mini parks
                                      have been completed.
                                      The addition of park and recreational space at key locations will increase resi-
                                      dents’ opportunities for active and healthy lifestyles.
                                      3. Recreation Program Facilities
                                      The City of Chino offers a variety of recreation programming for residents.
                                      These services are administered by the City’s Community Services Depart-
                                      ment. Chino’s recreation program facilities are shown in Table PR-3. The
                                      City currently provides a comprehensive range of recreation and social ser-
                                      vice programs to all of its residents, from infants to seniors.

D. Gaps in Park and Recreation Facilities
1. Parks
There are many residential areas in Chino that are a ½-mile or more from the
nearest park; these areas are mainly concentrated north of Highway 60 and
east of Pipeline Avenue. Figure PR-2 shows the general locations where there
are an insufficient amount of parks, including the following areas:
  ♦ Northeast neighborhoods around Vernon Avenue
  ♦ North San Antonio Avenue Corridor
  ♦ Neighborhoods around the intersection of Benson Avenue and Riverside
     Drive
  ♦ Neighborhoods north of Highway 60 and west of Yorba Avenue
  ♦ West Riverside Drive Corridor
  ♦ Neighborhoods west of East End Avenue
There are currently no community parks in Chino. A community park is
expected to be built in The Preserve. However, the majority of the city will
remain 3 miles or more from a community park, with the northern, more-
established areas of the City furthest from a community park.
With the addition of the already-planned parks, Chino would have 117 addi-
tional acres of parkland, which would increase total park acreage to 345. This
increase still falls short of the 368 acres needed to meet the needs of Chino’s
projected 2025 population.
2. Other Recreational Facilities
Chino does not have a year-round aquatics center. While there are two pools
available at high schools, the City only uses the Chino High School pool for
recreation programs during the summer months. The YMCA pool is avail-
able to the public for a fee. In addition, there is high demand for indoor rec-
reation spaces, such as those provided by the Neighborhood Activity Center,
community centers, and spaces dedicated to after-school activities.

             vide mini parks in infill areas to help meet the park standard,
             as long as they are over ½-acre and include sufficient ameni-
             ties.
     P3.     The City may permit homeowners’ associations to manage
             mini parks, formative parks and neighborhood parks, so long
             as parks are publicly accessible and maintained to a level
             equivalent to City cleanliness, landscaping, and safety stan-
             dards.
     P4.     In order to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, the City will

11 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
   The Public Facilities and Services Element provides information and policy
   guidance to ensure public facilities and services to support existing and new
   development in the City of Chino. This Element addresses the changing pub-
   lic services and infrastructure needs of Chino and provides for the logical and
   timely extension of these services to keep pace with growth. Policies support-
   ing quality schools and libraries, excellent police and fire services and well-
   maintained infrastructure are essential to achieve the City’s development ob-
   jectives and to support the future envisioned by the residents of Chino.
   Although the Public Facilities and Services Element is not explicitly required
   by State law, the topics addressed here are an integral part of the City’s over-
   all planning strategy and a basic consideration in setting growth and devel-
   opment policy. State law also requires that the Land Use Element include
   “the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses
   of the land for…solid and liquid waste disposal facilities,” and it requires that
   the Circulation Element include information on “the general location and
   extent of existing and proposed…public utilities and facilities.” These com-
   ponents are included in this Element, which covers the following ten topics:
     ♦ Fire
     ♦ Police
     ♦ Schools
     ♦ Health care
     ♦ Childcare
     ♦ Public buildings
     ♦ Water service, availability and conservation
     ♦ Sewers
     ♦ Stormwater
     ♦ Solid waste and recycling
   Each section in this Element is addressed in three subsections:
     ♦ Background. Provides background information on each topic.
     ♦ Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Provides policy guidance to
        the City related to the topics covered in this Element.
                                                                                     PFS-1

                                         1. Background
                                         The Chino Police Department provides police protection services in the City
                                         of Chino and in small portions of the SOI, covering approximately 31 square
                                         miles. The Department has one main office and two satellite stations. Their
                                         locations are shown on Figure PFS-1. The Department is currently in the
                                         planning stages for a new police facility. The Department has 102 sworn offi-
                                         cers, 51 civilian support staff, and 95 volunteers.
                                         The Police Department divides calls into six categories: Priority 1, Priority 2,
                                         Priority 3, Priority 4, Priority 5, and Priority 6. The categories range from
                                         the most critical Priority 1 calls, which are defined as calls that are “in pro-
                                         gress,” “just occurred,” or are of a life threatening nature, to Priority 6 calls,
                                         such as court orders and private property impounds of vehicles.
                                         Along with providing policing services to the City of Chino, the Department
                                         also responds to service calls outside of Chino City limits. These services are
                                         part of Chino’s mutual aid agreement with the following agencies:

                                         The Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD), encompassing 88 square
                                         miles, serves the City of Chino and includes the Cities of Chino, Chino Hills,
                                         part of the City of Ontario, plus unincorporated areas of San Bernardino
                                         County.
                                         The School District has a total of 35 public schools, which are located in the
                                         cities of Chino, Chino Hills and Ontario, consisting of 23 elementary
                                         schools, two K-8 school, five junior high schools, and five high schools. For
                                         the 2008-2009 school year, total enrollment in the CVUSD schools was
                                         32,428 students. Table PFS-2 shows the names of schools serving Chino resi-
                                         dents, 2008 to 2009 enrollment, and school capacity. Their locations are
                                         shown on Figure PFS-1.
                                         There are six private schools in Chino. Chino residents are also served by
                                         Chaffey Community College, a community college based in Rancho Cuca-
                                         monga with a campus in Chino. The City also partners with several public

                                         a. Water Supply
                                         The City of Chino’s Water Utility operates within the City’s Public Works
                                         Department, and provides water to an area of about 27 square miles. It is a
                                         sub-agency of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA), a member of the
                                         Water Facilities Authority – Joint Powers Agency (WFA), a member of the
                                         Chino Basin Desalter Authority (CDA), and a member of the Chino Basin
                                         Watermaster.
                                         There are three types of water resources: imported water delivered from out-
                                         side the City of Chino, local water from the local groundwater supply, and
                                         recycled water processed locally by the IEUA. Additionally, the Monte Vista
                                         Water District (MVWD) provides retail potable water service to a 2007 popu-
                                         lation of about 8,600 people in portions of northwest Chino and the City of
                                         Chino Hills provides retail potable water service to a 2007 population of ap-

The quantity and timing of imported water deliveries are constrained by en-
vironmental factors and other issues affecting the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta. Because of this, optimally managing limited supplies of imported wa-
ter to Southern California is critical.
b. Potable and Recycled Water Demand
Currently, residential water consumption represents the greatest demand in
Chino. The next largest users of water are commercial and institutional users.
The limited agricultural land uses currently found in the City represent a very
small portion of the total potable water use. Approximately 75 percent of the
City’s current recycled water demand consumption is for agricultural irriga-
tion. The remaining 25 percent of recycled water is used for landscape irriga-
tion and industrial uses.
c. Water Quality
Local water supplies include surface water from mountain-fed streams and
creeks, the Chino Groundwater Basin, and recycled water. State and federal
agencies establish and enforce primary Maximum Contaminant Levels
(MCLs) for drinking water to protect public health. MCLs are in place for
several types of water quality contaminants found in local water supplies.
d. Recycled Water
The IEUA produces tertiary treated water from its wastewater treatment
plants. This recycled water can be used for non-potable purposes such as
landscape irrigation, agricultural irrigation, construction and industrial cool-
ing. Most of the IEUA’s recycled water users are located in the Southern Ser-
vice Area, with disinfected tertiary treated recycled water sold wholesale to
the Cities of Chino, Chino Hills, and Ontario. The IEUA is undertaking
plans to expand the recycled water system through a system of recycled water
pipelines, pump stations and satellite plants. The City of Chino receives
about 22 percent of its water supply from recycled water.

1. Background
The City of Chino is served by a local and regional wastewater system. The
local system consists of the City-owned and maintained gravity flow collec-
tion and conveyance sanitary sewer system. The local sewer is then con-
nected at various locations to the regional sewer system, which is owned and
operated by the IEUA. The IEUA owns and operates this 66-mile regional
interceptor system that collects and conveys wastewater from local sewers
owned and operated by its member agencies, including the City of Chino.
The IEUA has organized its service area into two portions: its Northern Ser-
vice Area (NSA), generally north of State Route 60, and its Southern Service
Area (SSA), generally south of State Route 60. The SSA encompasses the Cit-
ies of Chino and Chino Hills, and the New Model Colony portion of the
City of Ontario. The City of Chino itself does not have wastewater treat-
ment facilities and therefore depends on the IEUA treatment plants. The
City of Chino pays the IEUA for the treatment and disposal of wastewater.
The IEUA regional system also utilizes gravity flow, pump stations and force
mains to convey the wastewater. There are two pump stations and two force
mains: the Montclair Interceptor Pump Station and Force Main and the
Prado Park Lift Station and Force Main. There are three regional treatment
plants that serve Chino and its SOI:
  ♦ Regional Plant-1, in Ontario, east of Euclid Avenue and south of SR-60.
                                                                                                                      PFS-27

                                         However, IEUA has a permit to use the facility for bio-solid waste handling
                                         and other waste related activities.
                                         Non-domestic wastewater generated by industry is conveyed out of the local
                                         area by two non-reclaimable wastewater systems (NRW). IEUA operates a
                                         “northern” NRW that conveys wastewater to Los Angeles County’s Sanita-
                                         tion District facilities for treatment and disposal, and a “southern” NRW
                                         which connects to the Santa Ana Regional interceptor (SARI) for treatment
                                         and disposal by the Orange County Sanitation District. The IEUA also pro-
                                         vides tertiary treated recycled water, a byproduct of its wastewater treatment
                                         activities, to Chino for non-potable uses.

   community from unreasonable risks from natural and human-made hazards.
   This Element provides information about these risks in Chino and establishes
   goals, objectives, policies, and actions to prepare and protect the community
   as much as possible from the effects of:
     ♦ Geologic hazards, including earthquakes, ground failure and subsidence
        and slope instability
     ♦ Flooding and dam failure
     ♦ Wildland fires
     ♦ Hazardous materials and waste
     ♦ Airport operations
     ♦ Disaster and terrorism preparedness
   Each section in this Element is addressed in three subsections:
     ♦ Background. Provides background information on each topic.
     ♦ Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Provides policy guidance to
        the City related to the topics covered in this Element.
     ♦ Indicators. Provides methods for evaluating progress for each topic cov-
        ered in this Element.
   A. Geologic Hazards
   1. Background
   Chino lies within the geologically active Southern California region, which is
   subject to earthquakes of varying magnitudes. In the last several decades, the
   region has experienced major earthquakes including the San Fernando quake
   of 1971 and the Northridge quake of 1994. Chino has not experienced any
   major damage from these earthquakes.
   According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), there is one active
   fault in the Chino area: the Chino-Central Avenue Fault. The fault has two
   segments that run roughly south-east to north-west and are found on the
                                                                                  SAF-1

                          western edge of the City and just to the west in the City of Chino Hills, as
                          shown in Figure SAF-1.
                          The California Geological Survey (CGS) has developed a list of cities affected
                          by surface fault ruptures referred to as the Alquist-Priolo earthquake fault
                          zones, called for by the Alquist-Priolo Act passed in 1972. The Act prevents
                          the construction of buildings on top of active faults. Chino is not found on
                          the list because the CGS has determined that the Chino-Central Avenue Fault
                          is sub-surface and does not represent a risk of ground rupture in the event of
                          an earthquake. The Act only addresses the hazard of surface fault rupture and
                          does not address other earthquake hazards such as ground shaking and land-
                          slides. Despite the presence of faults in the City, no potential landslide areas
                          are found in the City of Chino, or in the City’s SOI.
                          Chino is situated on an alluvial fan of unconsolidated, coarse- to medium-
                          grained soil. Groundwater levels in and around the City are shallow, gener-
                          ally in the range of 30 to 500 feet below the surface. Due to Chino’s loosely
                          compacted, silty, sandy alluvial soil and shallow groundwater, ground shaking
                          and liquefaction would present the most significant hazards during a moder-
                          ate-to-significant earthquake. Groundshaking causes liquefaction, a phenom-
                          ena by which soil, due to saturation by ground water, assumes properties of a
                          liquid, caused by groundshaking. Liquefaction causes shifting and settling of
                          structural foundations, settling of roadways and rupture of underground
                          pipes and cables.
                          The unconsolidated nature of the soil would magnify ground shaking and
                          present a hazard to the structural integrity of unreinforced masonry build-
                          ings. The City of Chino has few remaining unreinforced masonry buildings.
                          While the City has a variety of both old and new residential, commercial, and
                          industrial development, the majority of Chino’s buildings are single-story
                          wood frame homes which are considered earthquake resistant. The City has
                          adopted the California Building Code (CBC), which outlines

                          technical engineering studies be undertaken for any development in areas
                          where potentially serious geologic risks exist.
                          Chino’s Local Hazard Mitigation Plan identifies earthquakes as the highest-
                          priority risk among natural hazards facing Chino residents.
                          Large earthquakes reoccur on the San Andreas fault, on average, about every
                          150 years. The last large quake on the southernmost section of this fault oc-
                          curred in 1680; therefore, the likelihood of this portion of the fault erupting
                          is extremely high. A moderate-to-severe earthquake in or near the City
                          would likely result in fatalities, property damage, disruption of critical life-
                          lines, including surface and rail transportation, rupture of water and gas lines,
                          and power outages.

       P4.      The City shall work with utility providers to ensure that util-
                ity lines are designed to withstand seismic forces, are accessible
                for rapid repair, and are provided with safety features such as
                automatic shutoff valves, switches and expansion joints.
       P5.      The City shall consider utilizing redevelopment funds to help
                reconstruct or replace inadequate structures within redevel-
                opment areas.

B. Flooding and Dam Failure
1. Background
The City of Chino is located at an elevation of 700 feet above sea level in the
Chino Basin, a relatively flat area surrounded by hills and mountains. This
location, in combination with flash-flood cycles common in the very dry
Southern California region, has made the Chino area susceptible to flooding.
There are two types of flood risks in Chino: flooding from local streams and
creeks, and flooding associated with the Prado Dam, located to the southwest
of Chino’s City limits.
a. Local Flooding
As shown in Figure SAF-2, the southwestern portion of the City is located
within a 100-year floodplain, as defined by the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency (FEMA). This means that there is a 1 percent chance of
                                                                                                      SAF-5

 flooding in that location in any given year. In addition, certain portions of
the City are located within the 500-year floodplain, meaning that there is a
0.2 percent chance of flooding in that location in any given year. Almost all
portions of the City developed with residential and commercial uses are out-
side the 100-year or 500-year floodplains.
Serious flooding could result in the contamination of water supplies, electrical
outages, and the closure of major transportation routes through the City.
Some areas of Chino are prone to ponding due to the accumulation of debris
in storm drains and in flood control channels and drainage systems.
b. Prado Dam Flood Inundation Area
The Prado Dam was completed in 1941 and is designed to provide flood con-
trol for portions of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. When
constructed, the maximum reservoir water surface was 556 feet above sea
level. The United States Army Corps of Engineers and Orange County
Flood Control District (OCFD) are in the process of raising the height of the
dam to allow a maximum reservoir water surface of 566 feet above sea level in
order to accommodate additional flood control capacity for the region.
Chino is located upstream of the dam, which creates a flood risk when the
water levels rise to the top of the dam. When the raising of the dam is com-
pleted, areas below the 566 foot flood inundation line will be subject to flood-
ing. These areas are restricted to recreation, open space and resource man-
agement uses. OCFD is in the process of acquiring through fee or flowage
easement all of the remaining privately owned property below the 566-foot
level for flood control purposes. Until the dam spillway is completed and the
properties are acquired, the flood inundation level will remain at its current
556 foot level. Existing land uses below the 566-foot inundation line primar-
ily include dairies, other agricultural uses, and vacant land, as well as Prado
Park and the El Prado Golf Course. The ultimate Prado Dam inundation
area is shown in Figure SAF-3, though the boundary is approximate. A de-
tailed survey at a site-specific level would be utilized to determine which por-
tions of a particular property are below the 566-foot level.

Goal SAF-2 Reduce hazards related to flooding and inunda-
               tion.
   Objective SAF-2.1      Minimize flood risks associated with de-
   velopment.
   Policies
     P1.    The City shall not permit new development within the 100-
            year flood zone unless it can be shown that the development
            will not:
            1.   Create danger to life and property due to increased flood
                 heights or velocities caused by excavation, fill, roads and
                 intended use.
            2.   Create difficult emergency vehicle access in times of flood.
            3.   Create a safety hazard due to the unexpected heights ve-
                 locity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
                 flood waters at the site.
            4.   Create excessive costs in providing governmental services
                 during and after flood conditions, including maintenance
                 and repair of public facilities.
            5.   Interfere with the existing waterflow capacity of the
                 floodway.
            6.   Substantially increase erosion and/or sedimentation.
            7.   Contribute to the deterioration of a watercourse or the
                 quality of water in any body of water.
            8.   Require storage of material, or any substantial grading or
                 placement of fill.
                                                                                                 SAF-9

                                         9.   Change the water storage/volume capacity of the flood
                                              basin.
                               P2.       The City shall prevent the construction of flood barriers
                                         within the 100-year flood zone which will divert flood water
                                         or increase flooding in other areas.
                               P3.       The City shall refer any new development proposed within
                                         the flood plain to the United States Army Corp of Engineers
                                         for approval. Such approval will require, at a minimum, vol-
                                         ume offsets in order to maintain the existing storage capacity
                                         of the basin.

C. Wildland Fires
1. Background
The risk of wildland fires is related to a combination of factors, including
winds, temperatures, humidity levels and fuel moisture content. Of these
four factors, wind is the most crucial. Steep slopes also contribute to fire haz-
ard by intensifying the effects of wind and making fire suppression difficult.
Chino’s flammable grassland, agricultural vegetation, and warm and dry sum-
mers create a situation that results in potential wildland fires. Where there is
easy human access to dry vegetation, fire hazards increase because of the
greater chance of human carelessness. High hazard areas include outlying
residential parcels and open lands adjacent to residential areas.
To quantify this potential risk, the California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has developed a Fire Hazard Severity Scale that
utilizes three criteria to evaluate and designate potential fire hazards in wild-
land areas. The criteria are fuel loading (vegetation), fire weather (winds,
temperatures, humidity levels and fuel moisture contents), and topography
(degree of slope). There are no Very High Fire Hazard Severity zones within
Local Responsibility Areas or State Responsibility Areas in the City.
Cal Fire also maintains data regarding the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI)
fire threat. WUI data describe relative wildfire risk to areas of significant
population density. Risk is expressed in terms of a “Threat to Community
Areas” value, with potential values ranging from -14 (Little or No Threat to
Community Areas with average density of one housing unit per 20 acres or
less), to +44 (Extreme Threat to Community Areas with average density of
one unit per acre or more). The southwest portions of the City are in the
“Very High Threat to Community Areas” range and northwest portions of
the City (primarily within the SOI) are in the “High Threat to Community
Areas” range, as shown in Figure SAF-4. The rest of the City is within the
“Moderate Threat to Community Areas” range.
The City has not experienced damage from wildfires in the past. The major-
ity of Chino’s facilities are not located near wildfire areas; however, the
                                                                                                    SAF-11

                          D. Hazardous Materials and Waste
                          1. Background
                          Products as diverse as gasoline, paint solvents, film processing chemicals,
                          household cleaning products, refrigerants and radioactive substances are cate-
                          gorized as hazardous materials. What remains of a hazardous material after
                          use or processing is considered to be a hazardous waste.
                          Many businesses and residents in Chino use hazardous materials and generate
                          some amount of hazardous waste. The most common hazardous wastes are
                          generated by gasoline service stations, dry cleaners, automotive mechanics,
                          auto body repair shops, machine shops, printers, photo processors, and agri-
                          culture. Most of these wastes are petroleum-based or hydrocarbon hazardous
                          waste and include cleaning and paint solvents, lubricants and oils. However,
                          medical wastes, defined as potential infectious waste from sources such as
                          laboratories, clinics and hospitals, are also included among the hazardous
                          wastes found in Chino.
                          Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes are heavily regulated by a range of
                          federal, State and local agencies. One of the primary hazardous materials
                          regulatory agencies is the California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
                          Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). DTSC is authorized by
                          the U.S. EPA to enforce and implement federal hazardous materials laws and
                          regulations.
                          The City of Chino and San Bernardino County both monitor hazardous ma-
                          terials and waste and provide collection facilities for most household hazard-
                          ous waste in and around Chino. The County also provides Antifreeze, Bat-
                          teries, Oil, and Paint (ABOP) facilities that can dispose of antifreeze, automo-
                          tive and household batteries, oil and oil filters, and latex paint. Any business
                          in Chino that handles, uses, generates, or stores hazardous materials is re-
                          quired to submit a “Business Emergency/Contingency Plan” to the Hazard-
                          ous Materials Division of the San Bernardino County Fire Department. In

E. Airport Operations
1. Background
The Chino Airport is the largest airport operated by the San Bernardino
County Airports Department. Due to its proximity to Ontario International
Airport and John Wayne Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) classifies the Chino Airport as a reliever airport, meaning it reduces
congestion by accepting small aircraft traffic from the larger metropolitan
airports in the region. The airport is currently undergoing improvement and
expansion and will assume an increasingly important role in Chino’s trans-
portation, land use, and economy. The Chino Airport is subject to both the
Chino Airport Master Plan and the Chino Airport Comprehensive Land Use
Plan. More information on land uses relating to airport operations can be
found in the Land Use Element.
a. Chino Airport Master Plan
The Master Plan was completed in 2003 and has been adopted by the Board of
Supervisors of San Bernardino County. It serves to guide the development
and expansion of the airport in response to projected future needs. The plan
calls for an extension of an existing east-west runway, expansion of taxiways,
and upgrades to the Runway Safety Area (RSA) required for compliance with
FAA regulations. The RSA is the area immediately around the runway that
provides a safety buffer in the event of an overshoot, undershoot or excursion
from the runway. The FAA has increased RSA regulations from 200 feet
from the ends of a runway to as much as 1,000 feet from the ends of a runway
in recent years. The Chino Airport Master Plan extends the RSA to meet
these new FAA regulations. Since all of the RSA is within the boundaries of
the Chino Airport, changes in the RSA will not affect surrounding land uses.
The plan also indicates that the airport plans shall acquire some of the lands
within its Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) as well as negotiate an aviation
                                                                                                 SAF-17

S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
                          easement over State-owned lands within the zone. The RPZ is a trapezoidal-
                          shaped piece of land on either side of the runway that requires enhanced pro-
                          tection of people and property on the ground from aircraft. Portions of the
                          RPZ extend beyond the boundaries of the Chino Airport onto adjacent par-
                          cels that are designated for other uses. The FAA recommends that an airport
                          have control over a RPZ in order to ensure that incompatible development is
                          not allowed in these areas. Land use designations included in the General
                          Plan Land Use Element prohibit incompatible uses in these areas.
                          b. Chino Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
                          The Land Use Plan was adopted in 1991 and no update has been undertaken
                          since then, although the Airport Master Plan addresses some similar issues. It
                          includes projections for an additional runway that has since been built. It also
                          indicates airport safety zones, which are zones that require certain restrictions
                          on land uses in varying distances from the runway due to the level of inten-
                          sity of the associated impacts. Safety Zone 1 is the most restricted of the
                          safety zones, prohibiting all structures and limiting the population density at
                          any given time to ten people per acre. A small portion of Safety Zone 1 ex-
                          tends into the agricultural area of the California Institution for Men; how-
                          ever, this area is vacant and is leased as a buffer area to the Chino Airport.
                          All other land use designations in these referral areas allow only uses that are
                          compatible with the Chino Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan.

F. Disaster and Terrorism Preparedness
1. Background
a. Disaster Preparedness
As required by State law, Chino has established emergency preparedness pro-
cedures to anticipate and respond to a variety of potential natural and man-
made disasters in its Emergency Operations Plan adopted in September 2008.
The Emergency Operations Plan addresses hazard preparedness, mitigation,
response and recovery for earthquakes, hazardous material incidents, flood-
ing, urban flooding, major air crashes, trucking incidents, civil unrest, na-
tional security emergency, and terrorism events.
In addition to the City’s Emergency Operations Plan, the City of Chino also
has adopted a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (Resolution 2005-017) pursuant
to the federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This plan is designed to be a
guiding document that describes the process for identifying hazards, risks and
vulnerabilities, identifying and prioritizing mitigation actions, encouraging
                                                                                                  SAF-19

                          its website that provides tips on preparing for an emergency. In 2008, the
                          Chino Police Department launched CodeRED, an emergency notification
                          system that can deliver pre-recorded emergency messages by phone at the rate
                          of up to 60,000 calls per hour. Residents and businesses are encouraged to
                          register their phone numbers through the CodeRED link on the Chino Po-
                          lice Department’s website to ensure that they will receive the emergency mes-

                          As characterized by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, terrorism is any ac-
                          tivity that meets all three of the following conditions: a) involves an act that is
                          dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or
                          key resources; b) is a violation of the criminal laws of the United States, a
                          State or other subdivision of the United States; and c) appears to be intended
                          to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, to influence the policy of gov-
                          ernment by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a govern-
                          ment by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.
                          The Terrorism Annex of the Chino Emergency Operations Plan addresses
                          preparation for and response to terrorism events. The Terrorism Annex pro-
                          vides guidance on developing terrorism response plans and procedures and
                          identifies the respective roles and relationships of federal, State and local gov-

14 NOISE ELEMENT
   The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify and evaluate noise generation
   in the City of Chino in order to minimize problems from intrusive sound
   and to ensure that development does not expose people to unacceptable noise
   levels. State law requires a Noise Element as part of all city and county Gen-
   eral Plans. The Noise Element should provide a systematic approach to the
   measurement and modeling of noise, the establishment of noise standards, the
   control of major noise sources, and community planning for the regulation of
   noise. This Noise Element provides baseline information on the existing
   noise environment, including noise measurements taken throughout the City;
   identifies noise-sensitive uses in Chino; provides goals, objectives, policies, and
   actions for controlling noise in existing and future development; and provides an
   indicator for monitoring Chino’s noise-control efforts.
   A. Background
   This section provides a brief discussion of noise perception and measurement,
   acoustical fundamentals, current noise policies regulating development in the
   area, and existing noise sources in the City of Chino.
   1. Understanding Noise
   This section explains how noise is measured and gives an overview of the po-
   tential effects of excessive noise. An explanation of how noise affects various
   land uses is provided.
   a. Measurement of Noise
   Noise can be defined as a sound or series of sounds that are intrusive, irritat-
   ing, objectionable, or disruptive to daily life. Noise varies widely in its scope,
   source, and volume, ranging from individual occurrences, such as a lawn
   mower, to the intermittent disturbances of train whistles, to the fairly con-
   stant noise generated by traffic on freeways. Noise is primarily a concern
   when generated in the vicinity of noise-sensitive uses such as residences,
   schools, places of worship, and hospitals.
                                                                                       N-1

                        The objectionable nature of a sound can be caused by its pitch or its loudness.
                        Pitch is the height or depth of a tone or sound, depending on the relative ra-
                        pidity of the vibrations (frequency) by which it is produced. Higher-pitched
                        signals sound louder to humans than sounds with a lower pitch. Loudness is
                        the intensity of sound waves combined with the reception characteristics of
                        the ear.
                        In addition to the concepts of pitch and loudness, there are several noise
                        measurement scales that are used to describe noise in a particular situation.
                        These are listed in Table N-1. The most basic unit of measurement is the
                        decibel (dB), which is a unit of measurement that indicates the relative ampli-
                        tude of a sound. The zero on the decibel scale is based on the lowest sound
                        level that the healthy, unimpaired human ear can detect. Sound levels in
                        decibels are calculated on a logarithmic basis. An increase of 10 decibels
                        represents a ten-fold increase in acoustic energy, while 20 decibels is 100 times
                        more intense, 30 decibels is 1,000 times more intense, etc. However, the hu-
                        man ear perceives loudness according to a slightly different scale. Each 10
                        decibel increase in sound level is perceived as approximately a doubling of
                        loudness over a fairly wide range of intensities. Generally, the human ear
                        cannot perceive a difference between two noises that are less than three deci-
                        bels different from one another.
                        There are several methods of characterizing sound. The most common in
                        California is the A-weighted sound level or dBA. This scale gives greater
                        weight to the frequencies of sound to which the human ear is most sensitive.
                        Representative outdoor and indoor noise levels in units of dBA are shown in
                        Table N-2. Because sound levels can vary markedly over a short period of
                        time, a method for describing either the average character of the sound or the
                        statistical behavior of the variations must be utilized. Most commonly, envi-
                        ronmental sounds are described in terms of an average level that has the same
                        acoustical energy as the summation of all the time-varying events. This en-
                        ergy-equivalent sound/noise descriptor is called Leq. The most common

averaging period is hourly, but Leq can describe any series of noise events of
arbitrary duration.
Since the sensitivity to noise increases during the evening and at night –
because excessive noise interferes with the ability to sleep – 24-hour descrip-
tors have been developed that weight noise during quiet periods of the night
and evening more heavily. The Community Noise Equivalent Level, CNEL,
is a measure of the cumulative noise exposure in a community with a 5 dB
penalty added to evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and a 10 dB addition to
nocturnal (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) noise levels. The Day/Night Average
Sound Level, Ldn, is essentially the same as CNEL, with the exception that the
evening time period is dropped and all occurrences during this three-hour
period are grouped into the daytime period.
b. The Effects of Noise
There are several short- and long-term effects of noise on communities, in-
cluding hearing loss, sleep and speech interference, and annoyance. These
potential effects are described below.
i. General Hearing Loss or Damage
Hearing loss occurs mainly due to chronic exposure to excessive noise, but
may be due to a single event such as an explosion. Natural hearing loss asso-
ciated with aging may also be accelerated by chronic exposure to loud noise.
Sound levels that exceed 85 dBA, when experienced for long durations during
each working day, may result in severe temporary or even permanent hearing
loss. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estab-
lished a noise exposure standard at the noise threshold where hearing loss
may occur from long term exposures. The maximum allowable level is 90
dBA averaged over eight hours. If the noise is above 90 dBA, the allowable
exposure time is correspondingly shorter.
                                                                                                      N-5

G E N E R A L P L A N
N O I S E E L E M E N T
                        ii. Sleep and Speech Interference
                        Sound levels that exceed 40 to 45 dBA are generally considered excessive for
                        sleeping areas within a residence. Speech intelligibility is impaired when
                        sound levels exceed 60 dBA. The amount of interference increases with
                        sound level, and with distance between speaker and listener.
                        Typical structural attenuation is 12 to 17 dBA with open windows. With
                        closed windows, the noise attenuation factor is around 20 dBA for an older
                        structure and 25 dBA for newer homes. In order to achieve an acceptable
                        interior noise environment, bedrooms facing secondary roadways must have
                        operable windows; those facing major roadways and freeways typically need
                        specially designed glass installed in window frames.
                        iii. Annoyance
                        Attitude surveys are used for measuring the annoyance felt in a community
                        for noises intruding into homes or affecting outdoor activity areas. In these
                        surveys, it was determined that the causes for annoyance include interference
                        with speech, radio and television, house vibrations, and interference with
                        sleep and rest. The Ldn as a measure of noise has been found to provide a
                        valid correlation of noise level and the percentage of people annoyed.
                        People continue to disagree about the relative annoyance of noise from air-
                        crafts and roadways. When measuring the percentage of the population
                        highly annoyed, the threshold for ground vehicle noise is about 55 dBA Ldn.
                        At an Ldn of about 60 dBA, approximately 2 percent of the population is
                        highly annoyed. When the Ldn increases to 70 dBA, the percentage of the
                        population highly annoyed increases to about 12 percent of the population.
                        There is, therefore, an increase of about 1 percent per dBA between an Ldn of
                        60 to 70 dBA. Between an Ldn of 70 to 80 dBA, each decibel increase results
                        in about a 2 percent increase in population that is highly annoyed. People
                        appear to respond more adversely to aircraft noise. When the Ldn is 60 dBA,
                        approximately 10 percent of the population is believed to be highly annoyed.
                        Each decibel increase to 70 dBA adds about two percentage points to the
                        number of people highly annoyed. Above 70 dBA, each decibel increase re-

                                                                                   G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                                    N O I S E E L E M E N T
sults in about a 3 percent increase in the percentage of the population highly
annoyed.
c. Land Use Compatibility
Land uses deemed noise-sensitive by the State of California include schools,
hospitals, rest homes, long-term care, and mental care facilities. Many juris-
dictions consider residential uses particularly noise-sensitive because families
and individuals expect to use time at home for rest and relaxation, and noise
can interfere with those activities. Chino also identifies churches, libraries,
and health care institutions as noise-sensitive land uses in Section 9.040.070 of
the Noise Ordinance.
Land uses that are relatively insensitive to noise include some office and retail
developments. Other examples of insensitive uses include industrial and
manufacturing uses, utilities, agriculture, vacant land, parking lots, salvage
yards, and transit terminals.
2. Regulatory Framework
In addition to policies in this Noise Element, noise within Chino is also gov-
erned by standards established by the State Office of Noise Control, the Cali-
fornia Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Noise
Ordinance of the Chino Municipal Code. A discussion of these guidelines
and regulations follows.
a. The State Office of Noise Control
The Government Code and State Office of Noise Control (ONC) Guidelines
require that certain major noise sources and areas containing noise-sensitive
land uses be identified and quantified. This can be shown on community
maps with generalized noise exposure contours for current and projected lev-
els of activity. Contours may be prepared in terms of either CNEL or Ldn
which are both descriptors of total noise exposure at a given location for an
annual average day. The noise exposure information serves as a basis for
achieving land use compatibility with respect to noise. Noise exposure in-
formation is used to provide baseline levels and noise source identification for
                                                                                                        N-7

N O I S E E L E M E N T
                        use in the development and enforcement of a local noise control ordinance
                        and for ensuring compliance with the State’s noise insulation standards.
                        According to the Government Code Section 65302(f) and ONC Guidelines,
                        the following major noise sources should be considered in the preparation of
                        a Noise Element:
                          ♦ Highways and freeways
                          ♦ Primary arterials and major local streets
                          ♦ Railroad operations
                          ♦ Aircraft and airport operations
                          ♦ Local industrial facilities
                          ♦ Other stationary sources
                        b. California Noise Insulation Standards
                        California’s noise insulation standards were officially adopted by the Califor-
                        nia Department of Housing and Community Development in order to regu-
                        late the noise levels allowed in habitable structures. The regulation requires
                        that interior noise levels attributed to exterior noise sources do not exceed 45
                        dB in any habitable room (noise metric measured in either CNEL or Ldn, con-
                        sistent with the noise element of the local general plan). Additionally, the
                        commission specifies that residential buildings or structures require an acous-
                        tical analysis if they are to be located within exterior Ldn (or dBA) contours of
                        60 dB or greater of an existing or adopted freeway, expressway, parkway, ma-
                        jor street, thoroughfare, rail line, rapid transit line, or industrial noise source.
                        The analysis must show that the building has been designed to limit intruding
                        noise to an interior Ldn of 45 dB.
                        c. Chino Noise Standards
                        Chino’s interior and exterior noise standards are presented in Table N-3.
                        d. Chino Municipal Code, Noise Ordinance
                        Chino’s existing Noise Ordinance provides regulations for the control of ex-
                        cessive and annoying noise from stationary sources. Examples of stationary
                        sources include industrial plants, pumps, compressors, and refrigeration units.

                        The ordinance provides specific standards to be applied for various land uses
                        for both daytime and nighttime hours, prohibits certain noise sources, and
                        describes the manner in which standards are to be enforced. Section 9.40.040
                        of the Noise Ordinance describes maximum noise levels for noise intrusion
                        into residential properties. These are presented in Table N-4. Each of the
                        noise levels in this table should be reduced by 5 dBA for impulse or simple
                        tone noises, or for noises consisting of speech or music. However, if the am-
                        bient noise level exceeds the resulting standard, the ambient shall be the stan-
                        dard.
                        The Noise Ordinance exempts certain activities from the noise standards in

                        B. Existing Noise Sources
                        The most significant noise-producing activity within the City of Chino is
                        transportation. This noise source consists of several components: arterial
                        traffic, traffic on the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60) and the Chino Valley
                        Freeway (State Route 71), aircraft operations at Chino Airport, and aircraft
                        overflights from Ontario International Airport. Activities at commer-
                        cial/industrial properties also contribute to the existing noise environment in
                        Chino. The following sections provide a discussion of the noise measure-
                        ments obtained throughout the City, and an inventory of these noise sources.
                        From these measurements and corresponding analytical procedures, existing
                        noise exposure contours have been derived, and noise impact areas identified.
                        An evaluation of the existing noise environment in Chino has been conducted
                        by Wieland Acoustics, Inc., including the following measurements:
                          ♦ 24-hour Noise Measurements. 24-hour noise levels were monitored at
                             eight locations in Chino over a period of three days in November 2008.
                          ♦ Limited Noise Measurements. Twelve limited noise measurements
                             were made at ten locations throughout Chino in November 2008 as well.
                        The 24-hour noise measurement and limited noise measurement data are
                        summarized in Table N-5 and the locations are shown in Figure N-1.
                        The Ldn contours for Chino’s major arterials, the freeways, and the railroad
                        under current conditions were developed utilizing SoundPLAN version 6.5
                        software and the Traffic Noise Model (TNM) lookup tables developed by the
                        Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Traffic data for the models was
                        obtained from Caltrans and Iteris. The measured noise levels shown in Table
                        N-5 of this report were used to calibrate the SoundPLAN noise model for the
                        City. Noise measurements and contours for each noise source are described
                        below.

                        1. Freeway and Arterial Traffic
                        Freeway traffic is the dominant noise source in Chino. The main contribu-
                        tion of noise is from State Route 60 (Pomona Freeway) which runs through
                        the northern edges of the City of Chino. With 225,000 vehicles per day, State
                        Route 60 generates approximately 85 dB at locations next to the freeway that
                        are noise sensitive. The City’s exterior noise standard is 65 dB as defined in
                        the Noise Ordinance. In other areas along the freeway with mitigating condi-
                        tions such as the existence of topography or existing buildings, the Ldn was
                        lower, although these measurements still exceeded the Noise Ordinance stan-
                        dard.
                        Another source of freeway traffic noise is created by State Route 71, which
                        runs along the southwest edge of Chino. State Route 71, with 57,000 to
                        92,000 vehicles per day, generates about 80 dB at noise-sensitive locations ad-
                        jacent to the freeway.
                        Other sources of noise in Chino are the many major and secondary arterials
                        traversing the City that are within or adjacent to noise-sensitive areas. Exam-
                        ples of such areas might be residential communities, hospitals and parks near
                        major and secondary arterials. The following roadway segments may exceed
                        the 65 dB standard:
                          ♦ Benson Avenue, from Phillips Boulevard to Chino Avenue

2. Chino Airport
The Chino Airport is located in the southeastern portion of the City, and is a
source of noise in its vicinity. The Airport Master Plan for the Chino Air-
port contains noise contours for the Airport. The 65 dB noise contour in
general does not extend beyond the Chino Airport boundaries. More signifi-
cantly, the noise contour does not cover any residential properties. Near the
airport, 24-hour noise measurements were taken which revealed an Ldn of 61.6
                                                                                                   N-17

dB, which does not exceed the Noise Ordinance exterior noise standard of 65
dB. Existing noise contours for the Chino Airport are shown in Figure N-3.
3. Ontario International Airport
The Ontario International Airport, a commercial air facility 2 miles northeast
of Chino, exposes Chino residents to single-event takeoff noise. However,
the Ontario International Airport noise contour map does not cover any part
of the City of Chino which implies that in general Chino residents are not
adversely affected by airport noise from that airport. Additionally, the City
of Chino has a Letter of Understanding with Los Angeles World Airports,
the entity that operates the Ontario Airport. This agreement provides for a
modified flight path for certain aircraft to ensure that they do not create addi-
tional noise impacts to Chino’s residential areas. This agreement is in effect
until 2011. Existing noise contours for the Ontario Airport are shown in
Figure N-4.
4. Union Pacific Rail Line
The Union Pacific operates a spur line that runs in the City of Chino. While
the line is only used to service local industries, it does stop at a siding between
Ramona and Monte Vista Avenues in a residential area. When stopping here,
the freight train generates high noise levels. Noise measurements in the resi-
dential community were taken; the results range from an Ldn of 66.3 dB to
98.1 dB. The line runs about two times a day.
5. Commercial/Industrial Properties
Large industrial and commercial areas in Chino have the potential to generate
noise. The primary noise-generating activities in these areas are loading dock
operations, trucks entering and leaving the area, and mechanical equipment
located both inside and outside the buildings.
Residential areas and other noise-sensitive activities that are located close to
these commercial/industrial operations are generally at risk of noise distur-
bance. However, in general there are relatively few areas where industrial
uses are located immediately adjacent to residential areas in Chino. Noise at

                        residential/industrial interfaces has been measured and found to be below the
                        Noise Ordinance standard. Table N-6 shows noise measurements for one
                        area in the City that generates noise complaints, the residential/industrial
                        interface at the rear yard of 13640 Amber Road (location 17 in Table N-5).
                        The table compares the highest noise levels measured at this interface with the
                        maximum allowed noise levels in the Noise Ordinance.
                        On the day of the measurement, the noise levels at location #17 generated by
                        activities at the commercial use complied with the City’s noise ordinance
                        standards. The Ldn measured at the residence was 52.1 dB, which is well be-
                        low the City’s Noise Element standard of 65 dB.
                        C. Future Noise Sources
                        1. Freeway and Arterial Traffic
                        Transportation will continue to be the major source of noise in Chino in fu-
                        ture years. Chino is traversed by several major and secondary arterials that
                        are within, or adjacent to, noise-sensitive areas. Noise exposure along many
                        of these roadways could exceed normally acceptable levels for noise-sensitive
                        uses. When exterior noise levels exceed 60 dBA Ldn in new residential devel-
                        opment, interior levels may exceed 45 dBA Ldn. Interior noise levels within
                        residential units with the windows partially open are approximately 10 to 15
                        dB lower than exterior noise levels, and interior noise levels within residential
                        units with the windows closed are approximately 20 to 25 dB lower than ex-
                        terior noise levels, assuming typical California construction methods.
                        Ldn contours were developed for Year 2025 noise conditions for major arte-
                        rials, the freeways, and the railroad under the proposed General Plan. Figure

                        The 2003 Master Plan for Chino Airport focuses on meeting design and safety
                        standards for each runway, improving instrument approach capability, ex-
                        tending Runway 8L-26R, and the eventual development of new taxiways to
                        improve airfield capacity, safety, and efficiency. Over time, these improve-
                        ments, together with general growth, are expected to increase annual opera-
                        tions at the airport from 145,491 in 2001 to 209,400 by 2025. Figure N-6

the City of Chino. Although takeoff patterns from the airport do direct the
aircraft over the central and eastern portions of Chino, exposing residents in
these areas to single-event takeoff noise levels, future development under the
General Plan would not expose residents to excessive noise associated with
the Ontario Airport.
4. Union Pacific Rail Line
Future rail operations are expected to be generally similar to current opera-
tions, although data on such operations is not available. If that is the case,
noise measurements would continue to be similar to current measurements of
Ldn of 66.3 dB to 98.1 dB.
5. Commercial/Industrial Properties
There are few areas in Chino where industrial uses are located immediately
adjacent to residential areas, and development under the General Plan would
not increase the incidence of major noise-generating uses locating immediately
adjacent to residential areas.
D.   Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions
Goal N-1          Protect Chino residents from excessive noise.
     Objective N-1.1           Ensure appropriate exterior and interior
     noise levels for existing and new land uses.
     Policies
       P1.      The City shall not locate noise-sensitive land uses (schools,
                medical centers and hospitals, senior centers, and residences) in
                areas with noise levels that exceed those considered normally
                acceptable for each land use unless measures can be imple-
                mented to reduce noise to acceptable levels.
                                                                                                      N-29
C I T Y O F C H I N O
G E N E R A L P L A N
N O I S E E L E M E N T
                        P2. The City shall require measures to ensure noise-sensitive uses
                            have appropriate interior noise environments when located in
                            areas adjacent to major noise generators.
                        P3. The City shall require measures that attenuate exterior and/or
                            interior noise levels to acceptable levels to be incorporated
                            into all development projects where current and/or future
                            noise levels may be unacceptable.
                        P4. The City shall require a noise impact study to evaluate im-
                            pacts of projects that may exceed 65 Ldn as part of the design
                            review process.
                        P5. The City shall require an acoustical study for all new residen-
                            tial developments that lie within the 65 Ldn noise contour on
                            the Future Noise Contour Map, to ensure indoor levels will
                            not exceed City standards. In addition, the City shall con-
                            tinue to enforce the California Building Code for indoor noise
                            levels.
                        P6. The City shall only approve projects which comply with
                            adopted noise standards, or meet the provisions of the Cali-
                            fornia Environmental Quality Act.
                        P7. The City shall require noise reduction features to be used in
                            the site planning process for new projects where current
                            and/or future noise levels may be unacceptable. The focus of
                            these efforts shall be site design techniques, so long as they do
                            not conflict with the goals of the Community Character Ele-
                            ment. Techniques include:
                            1.   Designing landscaped building setbacks to serve as a buffer
                                 between the noise source and receptor.
                            2.   Placing noise-tolerant land uses such as parking lots, main-
                                 tenance facilities, and utility areas between the noise
                                 source and receptor.

                                                                             N O I S E E L E M E N T
         3.    Orienting buildings to shield noise-sensitive outdoor
               spaces from a noise source.
         4.    Locating bedrooms or balconies on the sides of buildings
               facing away from noise sources.
         5.    Utilizing noise barriers (e.g. fences, walls, or landscaped
               berms) to reduce adverse noise levels in noise-sensitive
               outdoor activity areas.
Objective N-1.2         Reduce noise impacts from transportation.
Policies
 P1.     The City shall minimize transportation noise through street
         and right-of-way design or route coordination including reduc-
         ing speed limits or planting street trees along high-volume ar-
         terials.
 P2.     The City shall require mitigation of noise impacts for new
         roadway projects, including roadway alignment and noise bar-
         riers.
 P3.     The City shall use pavement surfaces that reduce noise from
         roadways when paving or repaving whenever feasible.
 P4.     The City shall seek to reduce impacts from groundborne vi-
         bration associated with rail operations by requiring that vibra-
         tion-sensitive buildings (e.g. residences) are sited at least 100
         feet from the centerline of the railroad tracks whenever feasi-
         ble. The development of vibration-sensitive buildings within
         100 feet from the centerline of the rail-road tracks would re-
         quire a study demonstrating that groundborne vibration issues
         associated with rail operations have been adequately addressed
         (i.e. through building siting, foundation design, and construc-
         tion techniques).
                                                                                               N-31

                        Objective N-1.3         Control sources of construction noise.
                        Policies
                         P1.     The City shall require a noise monitoring plan to be prepared
                                 and submitted prior to starting all construction projects. The
                                 noise monitoring plan shall identify monitoring locations and
                                 frequency, instrumentation to be used, and appropriate noise
                                 control measures that will be incorporated.
                         P2.     The City shall limit all construction in the vicinity of noise-
                                 sensitive land uses, such as residences, hospitals, or senior cen-
                                 ters, to daylight hours or 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. In addition,
                                 the following construction noise control measures shall be in-
                                 cluded as requirements at construction sites to minimize con-
                                 struction noise impacts:
                                  ♦ Equip all internal combustion engine-driven equipment
                                     with intake and exhaust mufflers that are in good condition
                                     and appropriate for the equipment.
                                  ♦ Ensure that during construction, trucks and equipment are
                                     running only when necessary.
                                  ♦ Shield all construction equipment with temporary noise
                                     barriers to reduce construction-related noise impacts.
                                  ♦ Locate stationary noise-generating equipment as far as pos-
                                     sible from sensitive receptors when sensitive receptors ad-
                                     join or are near a construction area.
                                  ♦ Utilize “quiet” air compressors and similar equipment,
                                     where available.
                         P3.     The City shall evaluate new development projects for poten-
                                 tial construction related noise impacts.

1.       Introduction
1.1      Background
Chino is situated at the junction of the 60 and 71 Freeways in western San Bernar-
dino County. Chino has a long history dating back to a land grant from Spain. The
Chino area was used for cattle ranching during the early 1800s. Prior to its incor-
poration in 1910, Chino was subdivided into a grid pattern with homes on long,
narrow lots.
For most of its history, Chino Valley was known as an agricultural community
dominated by dairies. Following the opening of the 60 Freeway in the early 1970s
and the 71 Freeway in the mid-1990s, Chino expanded from its agricultural roots
into a community that offers quality residential neighborhoods, retail centers, and a
diverse industrial base. With the recent annexations (The Preserve and College
Park), Chino is expected to expand its resident population significantly in upcom-
ing years.
Rapid growth has brought along changes to the City’s demography, employment,
and housing markets. In light of these changes and projecting into the future, the
City of Chino recognized the need for a planned course of action and embarked on
an update to its General Plan. General Plan 2025 embodies a “healthy city” con-
cept that emphasizes diversity, sustainability, and planning with the health of Chino
residents in mind.
This Housing Element, as an integral component of the General Plan, embraces
the “healthy city” concept. Residential neighborhoods are preserved, enhanced, or
created to promote diversity in the community, foster neighborhood character and
sense of community, promote linkages among various parts of the City, and en-
courage interactions and activities.
                                                                                    1

1.2      Organization of the Element
The housing market is volatile; therefore the Housing Element is updated frequent-
ly. This Housing Element covers the planning period of October 15, 2013 through
October 15, 2021. The previous Housing Element originally had a planning period
of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2014, but the planning period was amended to end
on October 15, 2013 (pursuant SB 375). The Housing Element identifies policies,
programs, and objectives that focus on the following:
           Conserving and improving existing affordable housing;
           Providing adequate housing sites to accommodate future housing needs
            for all income segments of the community;
           Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
           Removing governmental constraints to housing development; and
           Promoting equal housing opportunities for all Chino residents.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
           An analysis of the demographic, household, and housing characteristics
            and trends;
           A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental con-
            straints to meeting the identified housing needs;
           An evaluation of the land, financial, and administrative resources available
            to address housing needs;
           An evaluation of the accomplishments achieved under the adopted 2000
            Housing Element; and
           A statement of the Housing Plan, including goals, policies, and programs
            to address the identified housing needs.
1.3      Data Sources and Methods
In preparing this Housing Element, various sources of data were consulted. These
include:
           Bureau of the Census, 1990, 2000 and 2010 Census;
           Bureau of the Census, 2006-2010, 2007-2011, and 2009-2011 American
            Community Surveys;

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Population and household projections from the Southern California As-
            sociation of Governments (SCAG) and San Bernardino Association of
            Governments (SANBAG);
           Real estate data from commercial data sources such as Dataquick and Cal-
            ifornia Association of Realtors;
           HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS);
           Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data;
           Data from the State Departments of Employment Development, Finance,
            and Social Services.
In most cases, the three-year 2009-2011 American Community Survey (ACS) was
used rather than the five-year 2006-2010 or 2007-2011 ACS. Although it represents
a smaller sample size and greater margin of error, it better reflects current housing
market trends and the impacts created on population and housing characteristics.
The 2006-2010 and 2007-2006 ACS data do not accurately average the economic
depression experienced in the years leading up to 2010 and the impacts that may
have occurred in its estimates. Therefore, when available and appropriate, the
2009-2011 ACS estimates are presented in this Housing Element, shown as per-
centages, and used for reference.
1.4      Community Participation
An extensive community outreach program was implemented as part of the Hous-
ing Element development.
1.4.1 Public Meetings
The City held a study session before the Planning Commission on June 3, 2013 to
present the 2013-2021 Draft Housing Element. To ensure that all economic seg-
ments of the community maintained involvement throughout the Housing Element
update process, the City advertised the study session through:
           Notifications published in the Chino Champion;
           Special invitations sent out to approximately 60 local service providers,
            housing developers, and community groups; and
           Information posted on the City’s website
                                                                                   3

No members of the public attended the June 3 study session before the Planning
Commission and no comments have been received regarding the 2013-2021 Draft
Housing Element.
1.4.2 Telephone Interviews
In addition to the public meetings discussed above, the City outreached to social
service agencies, developers, and community groups to solicit input on housing
needs and issues in the community. Three agencies responded and provided input
on housing needs. The outreach list and comments received were summarized in
Appendix A of this Housing Element.
1.4.3 Public Hearings
Public hearings will be conducted before the Planning Commission and City Coun-
cil prior to adoption of the Housing Element.
1.4.5 Housing Element Response
Table 1 below summarizes comments received and responses of the Housing Ele-
ment:

1.5      General Plan Consistency
The City’s General Plan 2025 was adopted in 2012. Residential land use policies
and housing objectives were developed to implement the new General Plan vision
of a “healthy city.” This Housing Element builds upon the General Plan 2025 ele-
ments and is entirely consistent with the policies set forth by the General Plan.
The Housing Element relies on the Land Use Element to establish the amount,
intensity, and distribution of residential uses. As portions of the General Plan are
amended in the future, the Plan (including the Housing Element) will be reviewed
to ensure that internal consistency is maintained. As part of the comprehensive
General Plan update, the City has already addressed issues and policies regarding
flood hazard and flood management.

2. Community Profile
Rapid growth has resulted in changes to the City’s demographic profile, employ-
ment base, and housing markets. Many of these changes affect the housing needs
of residents as well as their ability to afford housing suited to their needs. This
section examines the availability, affordability, and adequacy of the existing housing
stock to Chino residents.
2.1      Demographic Profile
Population characteristics affect the type of housing needs in a community. Popu-
lation growth, age composition, race/ethnicity, and employment trends help define
the housing needs in a community.
2.1.1       Population Trends
During the past 30 years, Chino has gradually transformed from an agricultural-
based community to a bustling suburban community. Many of the changes can be
linked to the construction of the 60 and 71 Freeways, which opened access to the
housing and job markets throughout the Inland Empire and Los Angeles County.
As an emerging employment and housing center in western San Bernardino Coun-
ty, Chino’s population rose dramatically between 1980 and 1990 and has continued
to increase steadily ever since. The City’s population growth in the most recent
decade (approximately 16 percent from 2000 to 2010) was similar to the growth
experienced by most neighboring communities, except for Fontana and Rancho
Cucamonga, where population increases were significantly higher at approximately
52 and 30 percent, respectively (Table 2).
                                                                                    5

The Chino population estimates include inmates at the California Institution for
Men (CIM), a state correctional institute. It is located at the southern border of the
City and is a minimum and medium security institution. In 1990 the CIM popula-
tion made up ten percent of the Chino population. The CIM population was 4,781
in September 2012, making up approximately six percent of Chino’s 2010 popula-
tion. The CIM population has declined steadily over time, with around 6,500 in-
mates in 1990 and just under 5,000 by 2012.1
2.1.2       Age Trends
Housing demand is affected by the age of residents. Younger adults, for example,
tend to prefer apartments, condominiums, and smaller single-family homes that are
affordable, while older adults, particularly those with children, prefer larger homes.
However, as children leave home, seniors often trade down for smaller, moderately
priced homes that require less maintenance.
The age distribution of Chino residents has shifted toward the mature adult and
senior age groups (Table 3). Between 2000 and 2010, the mature adult age group
(ages 45-64 years) had the largest increase (at 47 percent) followed closely by the
senior age group (age 65 or above), with a 44 percent increase. There was also a
nine percent increase in the number of preschool age children (ages 0-4 years).
Minimal increases occurred during this time period in the college age group (18-24
years) (four percent) and young adult age group (25-44) (nine percent). The dra-

                matic increases in the City’s older population may indicate that Chino residents are
                choosing, and are financially able, to age in place.
                The 2010 Census documents the continued aging of the City’s population, with a
                median age of 34.0, noticeably higher than the median age of 30.9 recorded just 10
                years before. Changes in the age structure of residents could create a demand for
                different types of housing in Chino, particularly smaller homes to accommodate the
                needs of seniors.

2.1.3       Race and Ethnicity
Chino, like many communities across the southland, is becoming more racially and
ethnically diverse. The City’s increasing diversity has brought with it shifts in the
distribution of households at each income level, prevalence of certain family types,
and housing preferences of residents.
As the City grew in size, the racial and ethnic composition of its residents also
changed. The number of Non-Hispanic White residents in the City declined by
about 14 percent between 2000 and 2010; White residents made up just 28 percent
of all residents in 2010 (Table 4). In 1990, Whites made up a majority of the City’s
total population. Meanwhile, the number and proportion of Hispanic residents in
the City continues to increase. Hispanic residents represented 54 percent of the
City’s population in 2010 and maintained their standing as the majority ethnic
group in Chino. Chino’s Asian/Pacific Islander population experienced the largest
increase (140 percent) between 2000 and 2010. This group about comprised 10
percent of the City’s total population in 2010. African-Americans made up about
six percent of the City and were the only other racial/ethnic group in Chino (other
than Whites) to experience a decrease during this time period.

Household median income often varies in relation to the race/ethnicity of the
households. According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS),
median household income for Whites was estimated at $81,011, compared to
$75,896 for Asians, $71,346 for Blacks and $66,559 for Hispanics. The differences
in household income by race/ethnicity also often translate into differences in
homeownership rates. Between 2006 and 2010, more than 75 percent of White
and Asian households owned their homes, compared to about 61 percent of Black
households and 67 percent of Hispanic households.
2.1.4       Educational Attainment
An individual’s level of education can affect their ability to earn a living. As shown
in Table 5, the educational attainment of Chino residents is comparable to the
County of San Bernardino and low relative to the State of California. The propor-
tion of residents with college degrees specifically was slightly higher than the share
for the County though less than for the State.

2.2      Household Characteristics
A household is defined as all persons occupying a housing unit. Families are a sub-
set of households and include all persons living together who are related by blood,
marriage, or adoption. Single-person households include persons living alone in
housing units. (Individuals living in group quarters, such as convalescent homes or
dormitories, are not counted as households.) Other households include unrelated
people living together, such as roommates. Household type, income and tenure
can help to identify special needs populations as well as other factors that affect the
housing needs of a community.

2.2.1       Household Type and Size
As of 2010, the City had 20,772 households, representing a 20-percent increase
since 2000. During the decade, Chino’s household profile saw some significant
changes with respect to household types (Table 5). Chino remains a predominantly
family community with family households comprising approximately 82 percent of
total households in the City. Many of these families have children, but the propor-
tion of married couple family households with children has declined since 1990
while the proportion of other families, including single parents with children, has
increased. These changes in household type are reflected in the age structure of
Chino residents – significant increases in the older population and very small in-
creases in the number of young children (age 0-4 years) (Table 3).

Size
Source: Bureau of the Census, 1990-, 2000, and 2010
        Household size is a significant factor in housing demand. Often, household size
        can be used to predict the unit size that a household will select. For example, small
        households (one and two persons per household) traditionally can find suitable
        housing in units with up to two bedrooms while large households (five or more
        persons per household) typically require housing units with three to four bed-
        rooms. Average household size in Chino increased during the 1990s but did not
        change during the decade from 2000 to 2010.
        People’s choices, however, also reflect personal preference and economics. During
        the housing boom when mortgage credit was readily available, many households
        purchased large homes, often extending themselves beyond their financial means.
        Now after the housing boom, the National Association of Realtors estimates that
        the average size of homes purchased will be smaller in future years.
        In 2010, the average number of persons per household in the San Bernardino
        County region ranged from 2.98 to 3.98, with a County average of 3.26 persons per
        household. Chino had an average of 3.41 persons per household in 2010, repre-
        senting a small decrease from 2000, when an average of 3.43 persons per house-
                                                                                             11

2.2.2       Household Income
Household income indicates the wealth of a community and is directly connected
to the ability to afford housing. As household income increases, households are
more likely to be homeowners. As household income decreases, households are
more likely to experience housing problems, such as overcrowding and overpay-
ment.
The 2009-2011 ACS estimated the median household income for jurisdictions with
populations over 20,000. As shown in Figure 1, median household income in Chi-
no was higher than for San Bernardino and most neighboring jurisdictions, with the
exception of Rancho Cucamonga and Chino Hills.

For planning and funding purposes, the State Department of Housing and Com-
munity Development (HCD) categorizes households into five income groups based
on the County Area Median Income (AMI):
           Extremely Low Income – up to 30 percent of AMI
           Very Low Income – 31 to 50 percent of AMI
           Low Income – 51 to 80 percent of AMI
           Moderate Income – 81 to 120 percent of AMI
           Above Moderate Income – greater than 120 percent of AMI
Combined, extremely low, very low, and low income households are often referred
to as lower income households.
2.2.3       Income by Household Type and Tenure
The 2010 Census does not contain information on household income. Household
income data were tabulated by the Southern California Association of Govern-
ments (SCAG) using the 2005-2009 ACS (Table 8).2 As shown, between 2005 and
2     For planning purposes, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
      (HUD) uses Census data to develop special tabulations by HUD income group and
      special needs category. This data set is collectively known as the Comprehensive Hous-
      ing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).
                                                                                           13

2.3      Employment Market
Employment plays a major role in housing because it is highly correlated to in-
come. Higher paying jobs give residents a wider range of housing options, while
lower paying jobs can severely limit housing choices. Analyzing employment data
for the City will reveal important correlations to the housing needs of Chino resi-
dents.
2.3.1       Major Employers
Chino’s prime location near the borders of four counties (San Bernardino, Los
Angeles, Orange and Riverside), with freeway access, has made the City a conven-
ient place for business. As of January 2011, there were 4,056 businesses located in
Chino, including 461 manufacturers/warehouses.3
2.3.2       Occupation and Wage Correlations
Occupations held by Chino residents are similar to those of the rest of San Bernar-
dino County. According to the 2009-2011 ACS, about one-third of Chino resi-
dents held management, business, science, and art occupations (33 percent) and
just over one-quarter were employed in sales and office occupations (27 percent)
(Table 9). Transportation occupations employed about 14 percent of residents and
service occupations employed about 19 percent of residents.

2.3.3       Jobs-Housing Ratio
One way of evaluating the housing market of a community is in terms of whether it
can house the people who work there. While not everyone who works in a particu-
lar community will choose to live there, if there is sufficient housing for the num-
ber of jobs available they are more likely to do so. If more employees live in the
community in which they work, they will save time and resources commuting, will
contribute less to regional air pollution, and will be more able to participate in
community activities. In 2011, there were roughly 1.7 people in the job market for
each housing unit in the City.

It appears that, based on a variety of sources, Chino’s jobs-housing ratio has
changed dramatically over the 19-year period presented in Table 11. In 1992, the
ratio was skewed towards housing (1.21 jobs per housing unit). By 2004, the situa-
tion had shifted to a ratio of 2.11 jobs per housing unit, suggesting that there were
not enough local workers to fill the local jobs. The ratio in 2011 decreased to 1.73
jobs per housing unit as the number of persons in the labor force decreased be-
tween 2004 and 2011 by approximately four percent.
SCAG projects that job growth in the region will pick up dramatically over the next
two decades and will likely result in a higher jobs-to-housing ratio over the next 25
years. SCAG’s projections are shown in Table 12. However, comparing these two
ratios, while useful, does not tell the full story. Although new jobs may be located
in Chino, the people who fill those jobs may not live in the City. In 2011, for ex-
                                                                                       17

                  2.4      Housing Problems
                  The SCAG income data presented earlier do not provide details on the specific
                  housing needs and problems faced by the City’s lower income households. The
                  Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census
                  Bureau for HUD, however, provides detailed information on housing needs by
                  income level for different types of households in Chino. Detailed CHAS data
                  based on the 2005-2009 ACS data is displayed in Table 13. Housing problems con-
                  sidered by CHAS include:
                             Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
                             Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per
                              room);
                             Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross in-
                              come; or
                             Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of
                              gross income.
                  Most lower and moderate income households cope with housing cost issues either
                  by assuming a cost burden, or by occupying a smaller than needed or substandard
                  unit. Specifically, according to HUD, 83 percent of the City’s extremely low in-
                  come households and 82 percent of the very income households were experiencing
                  one or more housing problems (e.g. cost burden, overcrowding, or substandard
                  housing condition) between 2005 and 2009.4 The types of housing problems expe-

rienced by Chino households vary according to household income, type, and ten-
ure. Some highlights include:
           In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (58
            percent) than owner-households (49 percent).
           Elderly renter-families had the highest level of housing problems regard-
            less of income level (73 percent).
           Approximately 83 percent of extremely low income (households earning
            less than 30 percent of the AMI) and 82 percent of very low income
            households (households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI)
            had housing problems.
           68 percent of extremely low income elderly households spent more than
            50 percent of their income on housing, including 100 percent of large
            owner households, 68 percent of elderly renters and 67 percent of elderly
            owners within this income category.

                                              Overcrowding is defined by the State Department of Housing and Community
                                              Development (HCD) as a household with more than one person per room (exclud-
                                              ing bathroom, kitchen). Severe overcrowding occurs when there is an average of
                                              more than 1.5 persons per room.5
                                              The 2007-2011 ACS estimates that more than six percent of the City’s households
                                              were living in overcrowded conditions.6 High housing costs relative to income,

                                                    as overcrowded. In calculating overcrowding, living and dining rooms are included but
                                                    kitchens and bathrooms are excluded.

families to share housing units. In other cases families choose smaller units so they
can devote income to other necessities such as food and healthcare.
From 2000 to 2010, the incidence of overcrowding decreased substantially in Chi-
no. Overcrowding, however, affects renter-households disproportionately (Table
14). In 2010, 11 percent of renter-households were overcrowded compared to
almost five percent of owner-households. Furthermore, two percent of renter-
households were severely overcrowded compared to only less than one percent of
owner-households.

2.4.2       Cost Burden/Overpayment
Housing cost burden, also known as overpayment, occurs when a household’s
housing costs exceed 30 percent of their gross income. A severe cost burden oc-
curs when housing costs exceed 50 percent of a household’s gross income.7 Hous-
ing cost burden is particularly problematic for low and moderate income house-
holds in that it leaves few resources for a household to pay for other living expens-
es.
The 2005-2009 CHAS data estimated that 51 percent of owner-households and 46
percent of renter-households in the city were overpaying for housing. Because
housing cost burden tends to concentrate among the most vulnerable populations,
reducing cost burden is an important housing goal for the City of Chino.
As shown in Table 13, cost burden seemed to affect owner-households more than
renter-households, regardless of income level. As market rents were generally af-
fordable to moderate income households, renters in this income group were not as
impacted by cost burden. Among the different household types, large family
homeowners and senior renters in the lower income groups were most impacted by
cost burden, compared to other household types.
Housing cost burden was generally most prevalent among the City’s very low in-
come households, rather than in its extremely low income households, potentially
because more extremely low income households in Chino were receiving some
form of housing assistance. However, housing cost burden was most severe
among extremely low income large renter-households; 100 percent of this group
had a severe housing cost burden, more than any income group or any household
type.
Rental assistance (such as Section 8) and affordable rental housing are the most
direct and effective housing programs serving households in the very low and ex-
tremely low income groups. The City has also adopted a rent stabilization program
for its mobilehome parks that will benefit extremely low and very low income
households in the City.
7     A household spending more than 30 percent of its gross household income on housing
      is considered cost-burdened both by the State Department of Housing and Community
      Development (HCD) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
      (HUD).

2.5      Special Needs
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent,
affordable housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related
to one’s employment and income, family characteristics, disability and household
characteristics, among other factors. Consequently, certain residents in Chino may
experience higher incidences of housing overpayment (cost burden), overcrowding,
or other housing problems. The special needs groups analyzed include seniors,
persons with disabilities, large households, single parents, people living in poverty,
farm workers, homeless individuals and families, college students, and military per-
sonnel (Table 15). 8 Many of these groups overlap, for example some single parents
are homeless, and many seniors have a disability of some type. The majority of
these special needs groups could be assisted by an increase in affordable housing,
especially housing located near public transportation and services.
8     Although the Chino has virtually no farming operations remaining, State Housing Ele-
      ment law requires that the City examine the extent of farmworker housing needs.
                                                                                      23

                           The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing
                           each particular group as well as programs and services available to address their
                           housing needs.
                           2.5.1        Senior Households
                           Senior households have special housing needs due to three concerns – limited and
                           fixed incomes, health care costs, and disabilities. The City’s aging population also
                           makes this particular group of special concern. Chino experienced a 44-percent
                           increase in senior residents from 2000 to 2010 (Table 3). The Census estimated
                           that in 2010, 7.3 percent of Chino population was seniors, compared to 5.9 percent
                           in 2000. Furthermore, 4.9 percent of Chino households in 2010 were seniors liv-
                           ing alone (33 percent of all senior residents).

According to the 2005-2009 CHAS, among senior households, approximately 1,615
(or 54 percent) were considered lower income. Approximately 67 percent of the
lower income senior households overpaid for housing. Aside from overpayment
problems due to relatively fixed incomes, many seniors are faced with various disa-
bilities. Roughly 52 percent of Chino’s senior population was listed as having one
or more disabilities according to the 2009-2011 ACS.
Resources
The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including con-
gregate care, rent subsides, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance.
For the frail or disabled elderly, housing can be modified with features that help
ensure continued independent living arrangements. Affordable housing opportuni-
ties for seniors are available at two locations in the City: 84 units at the Steelwork-
er’s Oldtimers Apartments and 104 units at the Seasons Seniors Villas.
Senior residents can benefit from activities and services available at the Chino Sen-
ior Center. Among the services provided, case management assistance aids seniors
through help with information and referrals, counseling, support groups, volunteer
opportunities, and the C.A.R.E. program (Citizens Assisting Retired Elders). Addi-
tional services at the center include a variety of social services such as legal aid,
income tax assistance, health insurance counseling and advocacy program, and daily
lunches with a home delivery option. The center also offers a wide array of educa-
tional and instructional classes. A seasonal newsletter distributed by the City details
all of the services available at the center and includes a weekly schedule of pro-
grams.
Ten licensed residential care facilities provide assisted living, nursing care, and gen-
eral services to seniors in Chino. These facilities have a combined capacity of 205
beds. The City permits residential care homes for six or fewer persons in all resi-
dential zones as regular residential uses. Residential care homes for more than six
persons are conditionally permitted in all residential zones, subject to additional
requirements in order to provide clear guidance for the development of such facili-
ties.
2.5.2       Persons with Disabilities (including Developmental Disabili-
            ties)
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from
working, restrict one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, disa-
bled persons often have special housing needs related to limited earning capacity, a
lack of accessible and affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with a
                                                                                     25

disability. Some residents suffer from disabilities that require living in a supportive
or institutional setting.
The living arrangement of disabled persons depends on the severity of the disabil-
ity. Many persons with disabilities live at home in an independent fashion or with
other family members. Independent living can be furthered through special hous-
ing features for the disabled, income support for those who are unable to work,
and in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions, among oth-
ers. Other persons with disabilities live in group homes or other institutionalized
settings.
The 2010 Census did not collect information on disabilities. However, according
to 2009-2011 ACS data, approximately nine percent of Chino residents had a disa-
bility. The ACS also tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one
or more disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied cognitive and ambulatory difficul-
ties were the most prevalent. Specifically, cognitive disabilities were the most com-
mon among disabled persons ages 5 to 17, while ambulatory difficulties were re-
ported the most frequently by disabled seniors (Table 16).

The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is
adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people with
mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable to widened door-
ways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other
26
C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
features necessary for accessibility. Location of housing is also an important factor
for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to
travel to necessary services and shops.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing
needs of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “de-
velopmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
           Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of men-
            tal and physical impairments;
           Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
           Is likely to continue indefinitely;
           Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the follow-
            ing areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive lan-
            guage; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independ-
            ent living; or g) economic self- sufficiency;
           Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
            interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other
            forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are indi-
            vidually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Ad-
ministration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage
of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent.
This percentage equates to 1,170 persons in the City with developmental disabili-
ties, based on the 2010 Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services (DDS), as of No-
vember 2012, at least 448 Chino residents with developmental disabilities were be-
ing assisted at the Developmental Center and Regional Center.9 Most (341) of
these individuals were residing in a private home with their parent of guardian and
specifically 200 of these persons with developmental disabilities were under the age
of 18. Another 107 clients were residing at community care facilities.
9     The State DDS aggregates the client data by age group, ZIP Code, and type of housing
      arrangement. Data are suppressed when a ZIP Code contains fewer than 25 clients.
                                                                                        27

Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affect-
ed individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention
and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before
adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is
the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
Resources
According to the State Department of Social Services, 22 licensed residential care
facilities in Chino with a total capacity of 117 beds to accommodate persons with
disabilities. The City permits residential care homes for six or fewer persons in all
residential zones as regular residential uses. Residential care homes for more than
six persons are conditionally permitted in all residential zones, subject to additional
requirements in order to provide clear guidance for the development of such facili-
ties. The City also provides rehabilitation programs that include accessibility im-
provements as eligible activities.
State and federal legislation mandate that a percentage of units in new or substan-
tially rehabilitated multi-family apartment complexes be made accessible to individ-
uals with limited physical mobility. The City also offers flexibility in development
standards for projects proposing housing affordable to seniors and persons with
disabilities.
2.5.3       Large Households
Large households are defined as households with five or more members in the unit.
A large household may be a large family (e.g., parents with children and/or extend-
ed family members), two or more families sharing the same housing unit, more
than five unrelated individuals living together, or any of these combinations.
Large households comprise a special needs group because of their need for larger
units, which often command higher prices that may not be affordable to many
households. In order to save for other necessities such as food, clothing, and med-
ical care, it is common for lower income large households to reside in smaller units,
frequently resulting in overcrowding.

In 2010, large households comprised 24 percent of all households (Table 17).
Since 2000, the number of large households in Chino has increased; however, the
proportion of large households actually decreased slightly from the previous dec-
ade. Overall, about 58 percent of the large renter-households and 59 percent of the
large owner-households experienced some housing problems between 2005 and
2009 (Table 13).
Resources
The City addresses the affordable housing needs of large households by encourag-
ing the development of affordable housing with two or more bedrooms. Infill sin-
gle-family homes developed by Habitat for Humanity, with assistance from the
City, offer affordable housing for large households. Additionally, through its Infill
Housing Development Program, the City provides financial assistance to non-
profit and for-profit developers to construct affordable homes suitable for large
families. In the past, the City’s Housing Programs also included a Homebuyer As-
sistance program. However, with the dissolution of the City’s redevelopment agen-
cy, the City’s primary funding source for this program has been eliminated. How-
ever, the City was recently awarded a CalHOME grant that has allocated $180,000
to fund three (3) Homebuyer Assistance loans. City staff will continue to seek
funding resources in an effort to continue its Homebuyer Assistance program.
2.5.4       Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households, particularly female-headed families with children, often
require special consideration and assistance because of their greater need for af-
fordable housing and accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services.
Female-headed families with children are a particularly vulnerable group because
they must balance the needs of their children with work responsibilities, often while
earning limited incomes.
In 2010, 1,485 female-headed households with children and 667 male-headed
households with children resided in the City and together made up ten percent of
                                                                                 29

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
all Chino households. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of female-headed
households in the City increased slightly from 13 percent to 15 percent, while the
proportion of female-headed households with children remained at approximately
seven percent.
Resources
Single-parent households can benefit from a number of the housing programs
available to Chino residents, including the homebuyer assistance program, Housing
Choice Vouchers, and affordable childcare. Locating housing near public transit
and recreation facilities would also help address the housing needs of this group.
In addition, the City offers support programs to help single parents with children
maintain the quality of life for their family. These include counseling, subsidized
childcare, recreational activities, and parenting classes.
2.5.5       Residents Living Below the Poverty Level
Families with incomes below the poverty level, typically those households with
extremely low and very low incomes, are at greatest risk of becoming homeless and
typically require special programs to assist them in meeting their rent and mortgage
obligations to avoid becoming homeless. The 2007-2011 ACS found that five per-
cent of all families in Chino were living below the poverty level. However, female-
headed households with children were disproportionately affected by poverty.
Between 2007 and 2011, 14 percent of all female-headed families were living below
the poverty level. For female-headed families with children, 16 percent were living
below the poverty level.
Households living in poverty are in need of subsidies for mortgage and rent pay-
ments, utilities, and other living expenses, and of supportive services.
Resources
Households living in poverty can benefit from single room occupancy units
(SROs). The Chino Zoning Ordinance does not currently include specific provi-
sions for the development of SROs. However, the City will amend the Zoning Or-
dinance to conditionally permit this type of housing within one year of adoption of
the Housing Element. Additional resources include Housing Choice Vouchers and
other housing programs that benefit extremely low income households.
2.5.6       Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are
earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers
work in the fields, processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round
30
C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
basis. When workload increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supple-
mented by seasonal labor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops,
farms may employ migrant workers, defined as those whose travel distance to work
prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, 200 Chino residents were employed in some
occupation in farming, forestry, or fishing, making up less than one percent of the
City’s employed population over the age of 16. This represents a slight decrease
since 2000, when the Census reported 378 Chino residents employed in farming,
forestry, or fishing, representing about two percent of the working population.
These occupations, particularly in urban areas like Chino, include gardeners, land-
scapers, and people who work in plant nurseries.
The few remaining agriculturally zoned properties in the City are used for compost-
ing and sod farming. No traditional farming remains in the City. Most of the dairy
farms still in operation are located within The Preserve Specific Plan area. As The
Preserve continues to develop, these dairy farms will be replaced with residential
development.
Generally, persons in the agricultural industry tend to earn lower incomes com-
pared to those employed in other industries. Based on the California Economic
Development Department research, persons employed in farming, forestry, and
fishing occupations in Riverside, Ontario, San Bernardino Metropolitan Area
earned approximately $21,564 in 2011 compared to the countywide median annual
wage of $44,506. Due to the high cost of housing and low wages, migrant farm
workers have difficulty finding affordable, safe and sanitary housing. This limited
income is exacerbated by their tenuous and/or seasonal employment status.
Resources
Because farmworkers make up such a small percentage of the City’s population, no
specific programs are necessary. In general, housing assistance such as rent subsi-
dies would benefit farmworker families.
2.5.7       Homeless Persons
State law (Section 65583(a)(7)) mandates that municipalities address the special
needs of homeless persons within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness”
as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
describes an individual (not imprisoned or otherwise detained) who:
                                                                                31

C I T Y O F C      H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1   H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
           Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
            o A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to pro-
                  vide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels,
                  congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill);
            o An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals in-
                  tended to be institutionalized; or
            o A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a
                  regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing (unless it
has been officially condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (for exam-
ple, doubled up with others; persons being discharged from mental health facilities
(unless the person was homeless when entering and is considered to be homeless at
discharge); or persons who may be at risk of homelessness (for example, living
temporarily with family or friends).
Assessing a community’s homeless population is difficult because of the transient
nature of the population. There are essentially three categories of homeless popu-
lations: the chronically homeless, migrant farmworkers, and the situationally home-
less. The chronically homeless often have problems such as substance abuse and
mental illness that led to their homelessness. They opt to live on the streets rather
than participate in a case managed program.
Migrant farmworkers or day laborers live under difficult conditions in encamp-
ments, often adjacent to farming operations. Because of their tenuous living condi-
tions, it is very difficult to estimate their numbers. Mostly single adult men from
Mexico, migrant farmworkers are paid minimum wage and often choose to send a
portion of their earnings home to support their families rather than using the mon-
ey to obtain housing. They also tend to travel from community to community ac-
cording to the harvesting schedules of crops.
The last category of homeless people, the situationally homeless, often find them-
selves homeless due to a combination of factors beyond their control, such as rent
increases, medical bills or loss of employment. This is also the segment that is
most likely to seek help from service agencies and best able to work toward becom-
ing self-sufficient again. San Bernardino County’s leading authority on the region’s
homeless population is the San Bernardino Continuum of Care (CoC). The CoC in
San Bernardino County is supported by the Office of Homeless Services (OHS), a
32

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
subdivision of the Human Services Department, Department of Behavioral Health.
The Office of Homeless Service (OHS) was created in September 2007 by the San
Bernardino County Board of Supervisors. OHS works to develop a countywide
public and private partnership that coordinates services designed to reduce and
prevent homelessness.
OHS strives to end homelessness in San Bernardino County by providing compre-
hensive services and resources for homeless persons and by increasing permanent
supportive housing opportunities for very low income and long-term homeless
persons. The Office of Homeless Services carries out this directive by developing
and implementing a countywide 10-Year Strategy to End Homelessness through
advocacy, policy review, technical assistance, priority setting, linkages and coordina-
tion, provision of financial and other resources, and articulation of the vision of the
San Bernardino County Homeless Partnership. The enumeration of homeless per-
sons in San Bernardino County has been conducted by OHS since 2007. The most
recent OHS point-in-time count of the region’s homeless population was conduct-
ed in 2011. Included in this homeless survey was a street count (conducted in eve-
ry city) as well as a count of homeless persons in every emergency shelter, transi-
tional housing facility, hospital and jail from January 26-27, 2011. One-on-one
interviews were also conducted for 77 clients.
The San Bernardino County 2011 Point-in-Time Homeless Count and Survey Re-
port counted 1,692 homeless people on the streets, an additional 1,039 homeless
people in emergency shelters, transitional housing, or domestic violence shelters, as
well as another 145 people using hotel/motel vouchers issued on the night of the
count. In total, the 2011 Homeless Census and Survey found 2,876 homeless per-
sons in the County, which excludes figures from rehabilitation facilities, jails, and
hospitals. Among the unsheltered homeless persons in the County, the 2011
Count estimates that the majority were adult males (77 percent). Female youth
represented approximately nine percent of the estimated homeless population and
84 percent of all youth (Table 18).

The 2011 Count does not provide estimates on the number of homeless persons by
city; however, Chino’s homeless population can be estimated using data from the
County’s Homeless Count. Chino’s population makes up approximately four per-
cent (3.8 percent) of the total population in San Bernardino County. Applying this
percentage to the data provided in the Homeless Count gives Chino an estimated
total homeless population of 110 homeless persons, including 64 unsheltered
homeless persons, 40 sheltered homeless persons, and 6 homeless voucher recipi-
ents.
Resources
The City collaborates with the County of San Bernardino Office of Homeless Ser-
vices in building a regional continuum of care for the homeless and those at-risk of
becoming homeless. Annually, the City uses 15 percent of the CDBG allocation to
provide public and supportive services to prevent homelessness and/or aid those
who are homeless and at risk of becoming homeless. This includes the extremely
low and very low income residents, especially those with special needs. Homeless
supportive and prevention services funded by CDBG in the past include:
           Community Outreach Program – Referral service and case management
            to assist those in need.
           Chino Neighborhood House – Emergency food and clothing.
           House of Ruth – Transitional housing for domestic violence victims and
            their children.
Through Case Management services offered at the Neighborhood Activity Center,
the City also offers one-time emergency motel voucher assistance for eligible resi-
dents who are low-income individuals or families and are homeless or at risk of
becoming homeless. Other homeless programs that are available to residents, but
not funded by the City, include: Isaiah’s Rock, a nonprofit located in downtown
Chino, offers food, clothing, and shelter for persons and families in need; and
Catholic Charities also provides food, clothing, and rent vouchers to women and
children who are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. In addition, the
San Bernardino County Homeless Partnership adopted a 10-Year Strategy to End
Homelessness in June 2009. This Strategy includes 25 specific action recommenda-
tions to be undertaken throughout San Bernardino County.
In 2010, the City amended its Zoning Ordinance to define emergency shelters as “a
structure that provides temporary shelter and feeding of indigents or disaster vic-
tims, and that is operated by a public or nonprofit agency.” The Zoning Ordinance
34

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
was also amended to permit emergency shelters by right in the CS zone. In addi-
tion, the City allows emergency shelters in the MU 20, MU 30, and CG zones with
the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. The City adopted the following stand-
ards for the development of emergency shelters:
           Maximum capacity of 30 beds
           Emergency shelter facilities can be available to residents for a maximum
            of 90 days
           Staff must be provided at shelter facilities to assist residents with finding
            permanent shelter
           Shelter providers must have a written management plan
           Emergency shelters can not be located within 300 feet of another emer-
            gency shelter
           120 square feet of indoor living area must be provided, plus an additional
            50 square feet of living area must be available for each additional person
            over two persons, excluding staff, of which thirty percent shall be com-
            mon or recreational space.
           A minimum 200 square foot of enclosed or screened waiting area must be
            provided to prevent queuing in the public right-of-way
           Emergency shelter facilities must establish hours of operation and provide
            on-site personnel, security and safety lighting.
2.5.8       Students
Chaffey College, University of the Pacific and Biola University are all located in the
City. A total of 7,027 Chino residents were enrolled in college or graduate school
according to the 2009-2011 ACS, comprising just nine percent of the population.
Students have unique housing needs because they are on tight budgets and need
seasonal short-term housing. A lack of affordable housing impacts this special
needs group often leading to overcrowded living situations.
Another consideration is the retention of recent college graduates in the communi-
ty. Young professionals are often unable to afford the rent or to purchase price of
a home in Chino and therefore, would seek housing in other communities.
Resources
Students are able to take advantage of the City’s multi-family rental housing stock.
Multi-family housing is permitted in the City’s RD12, RD14, and RD20 zones.
                                                                                      35

2.6      Housing Stock Characteristics
The Census defines a housing unit as any of the following: a house, an apartment,
a mobile home or trailer, a group of homes, or a single room intended for use as
separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants
live separately from any other individuals in the building, and which have direct
access from outside the building or through a common hall.
This section discusses various housing characteristics and trends that affect housing
needs in Chino. Important characteristics include housing types, tenure, vacancy
rates, housing age and condition, and housing cost and affordability.
2.6.1       Housing Growth
Over the years, population and employment growth have spurred housing devel-
opment in Chino. The City’s housing stock has experienced steady growth over
the past 20 years, with housing growth in the 2000s eclipsing growth during the
1990s by a significant amount. The City’s housing stock grew from 16,137 units in
1990 to 21,797 units in 2010, or a 35 percent increase over 20 years (Table 19).
During the most recent decade, the City’s housing stock grew more (22 percent)
than the housing stock of most neighboring jurisdictions and the County as whole.
The City was still outpaced, however, by the growth that occurred in Rancho
Cucamonga (56 percent) and Fontana (44 percent).

2.6.2       Housing Type
A certain level of housing diversity is an important factor in ensuring adequate
housing opportunities for Chino residents. A diverse housing stock helps ensure
that all households, regardless of their income, age group, and/or household size,
have the opportunity to find housing that is best suited to their needs.
Currently, over three-quarters of Chino’s housing stock consists of single-family
homes (Figure 2). Multi-family dwellings account for 20 percent of homes in Chi-
no, while mobile homes comprise four percent of all homes in the community.
Though the City experienced some multi-family housing construction during the
1970s and 1980s, residential growth in the 1990s and 2000s had been primarily
single-family construction. Between 2000 and 2010, the City’s single-family hous-
ing stock increased by 29.9 percent (4,006 units), while multi-family housing in the
City grew by 17.5 percent (691 units). Of the new units built over the last decade,
approximately 14 percent were multi-family units (Table 20). By percentage, the
most noticeable change in the City’s housing stock was the increase in attached
single-family homes, probably as townhome developments.

             2.6.3       Housing Tenure and Vacancy
             Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost
             of housing. Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Tenure is
             an important market characteristic because it is directly related to housing types and
             38
C I T Y O F C      H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1   H  O U S I N G   E L E M E N T
turnover rates. The tenure distribution of a community’s housing stock can be an
indicator of several aspects of the housing market, including the affordability of
units, household stability and residential mobility among others. In most commu-
nities, tenure distribution generally correlates with household income, composition
and age of the householder.
The vacancy rate is often a good indicator of how effectively for-sale and rental
units are meeting the current demand for housing in a community. Vacancy rates
of five to six percent for rental housing and one to two percent for ownership
housing are generally considered optimal, showing there is balance between the
demand and supply for housing. A higher vacancy rate may indicate an excess
supply of units and therefore price depreciation, while a low vacancy rate may indi-
cate a shortage of units and resulting escalation of housing prices. Census data
indicated that the housing market in Chino was at the optimum level in 2010, based
on recorded vacancy rates (Table 21).

as one of the factors in determining
housing rehabilitation needs.
Generally, housing older than 30 years of age will require minor repairs and mod-
ernization improvements. Housing units over 50 years of age are more likely to
require major rehabilitation such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs.
After 70 years of age a unit is generally deemed to have exceeded its useful life.
Table 22 shows that 50 percent of the 21,797 units in Chino were built prior to
1980, making about one-half of the City’s housing stock at least 30 years old. Many
of these older units were built during the 1970s and may potentially require minor
repairs. Units older than 40 years comprised about 22 percent of the housing
stock. These units may require moderate to substantial repairs. Less than two per-
cent of the units are older than 65 years; therefore, few units in Chino are likely to
have exceeded their useful life.
Housing age is a general indicator only. It does not take into account private ac-
tions by property owners to maintain and upgrade their properties. According to
City staff, less than a dozen housing units in Chino could be considered substand-
ard or unsafe for occupancy and would require substantial rehabilitation and/or
demolition/replacement.
The City recognizes the need to preserve its housing stock and will continue to
provide rehabilitation assistance to income qualified residents. Between July 1, 2008
and December 31, 2011, the City provided rehabilitation assistance to 151 house-
holds using Redevelopment Housing funds, CalHOME Program funds, CDBG

funds and City Affordable Housing Funds financed with in-lieu fees. Additionally,
in 2013, the City was awarded $420,000 in CalHOME grant funding to finance
home improvement loans. The City’s Infill Housing Development Program is also
expected to help eliminate some of the substandard or dilapidated housing units in
Chino.
In addition, through its partnership with the Code Compliance division, the Hous-
ing Division has been able to redevelop several abandoned and/or substandard
properties that presented a threat to public health and safety. This program has
proved to be very successful; however, the primary source of funding for the pro-
gram (RDA Housing Funds) is no longer available. As such, activities and accom-
plishments for this program may be more limited in the future.
2.6.5       Housing Cost and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a com-
munity. If housing costs are relatively high compared to household income, hous-
ing cost burden and overcrowding occur. This section summarizes the cost and
affordability of housing to Chino residents.
Ownership Market
As in most of southern California, housing prices in the region escalated substan-
tially between 2000 and 2005. In 2000, the median home price in Chino was
$170,000. By 2005, the median home price in the City had increased to $494,000, a
33-percent increase from the 2004 median price of $370,250 and almost three times
the price in 2000, indicated in Table 23. However, by the end of 2005, the implo-
sion of the mortgage lending industry led to steep price depreciation in most south-
land communities. Between 2005 and 2007, median home prices in Chino de-
creased six percent. By 2012, housing prices decreased another 38 percent. Most
of the communities compared in Table 23 experienced a significant decline in me-
dian home prices between 2007 and 2012; however, the declines experienced by
Chino were greater than those experienced by most of its neighbors.

                 Given its geographic location bordering Los Angeles County, home prices in Chino

            Housing Affordability by Income
            Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a
            home with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different in-
            come levels. Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford
                                                                                                                                 43

what size and type of housing and indicate the type of households most likely to
experience overcrowding and overpayment.
Housing affordability is an important indicator of quality of life in Chino. If resi-
dents pay too much for housing they will not have sufficient income for other ne-
cessities such as health care. Households that spend a substantial portion of their
income on housing may also be at risk of becoming homeless in the event of unex-
pected circumstances such as illness or loss of employment. State law requires that
the City facilitate provision of housing opportunities that are affordable to all eco-
nomic segments of the community.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts
annual household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility
for federal housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can
be used to determine the maximum price that could be affordable to households in
the upper range of their respective income category. Households in the lower end
of each category can afford less by comparison than those at the upper end.
Based on these income limits for San Bernardino County and current real estate
prices, homeownership in Chino is beyond the reach of most lower and moderate
income households, depending on household size. Housing options for extremely
low and very low income households are almost non-existent unless public assis-
tance is involved. Ownership housing is beyond the reach the City’s lower income
households, and appropriately sized market-rate rental housing is not affordable to
these households. Housing options available to extremely low and very low in-
come households include Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers and affordable
housing developments within the City. Chino also has a rent stabilization program
in place for its mobile home parks which provides additional affordable rental
housing opportunities for extremely low and very low income residents.
As shown in Table 25, moderate income households can generally afford the mar-
ket rents for apartments in Chino; however, only four- to five-person households
can afford to rent single-family homes. Moderate income households in Chino
may also be able to purchase housing in the City, though competition for appropri-
ately sized affordable homes may lead to a housing cost burden or overcrowding.

To afford the median-priced home of $289,000 in 2012, a household income of
approximately $72,000 (111 percent of the County median income for a family of
four) would be needed (Figure 4). Renting an average apartment at $1,242 would
require less income. However, many of the occupations in San Bernardino County,
even professional ones, offer lower wages than needed to afford housing in Chino.

2.7      Affordable Housing
State law requires the City to identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve
existing multi-family rental units that are currently restricted to low income housing
use and that will become unrestricted and possibly be lost as low income housing
(i.e., “units at risk” or “at-risk units”). State law requires the following:
           An inventory of restricted low income housing projects in the City and
            their potential for conversion;
           An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing the units at risk
            and a comparison of these costs;
           An analysis of the organizational and financial resources available for pre-
            serving and/or replacing the units “at risk”; and
           Programs for preserving the at-risk units.
The following discussion satisfies the first three requirements of State law listed
above pertaining to the potential conversion of assisted housing units into market
rate housing between October 15, 2013, and October 15, 2023. The Housing Plan
section includes a program for preserving the at-risk units, which meets the final
requirement of State law.
2.7.1 Inventory of Affordable Rental Housing
Chino has a broad array of housing opportunities for lower income households.
Housing is available through public housing, rent controlled mobilehomes, and
other subsidized rental housing.
Public Housing
In the City of Chino, there is currently one public/affordable housing site with 50
units managed by the Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino—
referred to as the Chino Affordable Housing Community. Of these units, two are
five-bedroom units, six are four-bedroom units, 16 are three-bedroom units, 18 are
two-bedroom units, and eight are one-bedroom units. Vacancy at this project is
limited and the waiting list is long. Public housing is considered permanent afford-
able housing.
Rent Stabilized Mobilehomes
The City adopted a rent stabilization ordinance that covers five mobilehome parks
with 577 units. These affordable units are exempt from the Costa-Hawkins bill
                                                                                    47

2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G  E L E M E N T
that allows the decontrol of rent upon voluntary vacation of the units by tenants.
Because of this exemption, these units are considered a permanent source of af-
fordable housing.10 One of the City’s mobilehome parks, Lamplighter Mobile
Home Park, is in the process of converting to resident ownership. The conversion
was legally contested, but in March 2013, the Court ruled that the owner of the
Lamplighter Mobile Home Park had the right to convert to ownership.
Tenant Based Rental Housing Assistance
The city contracts with the San Bernardino County Housing Authority to adminis-
ter the Housing Choice Voucher Program on behalf of the City. As of March
2013, a total of 110 households in Chino received Housing Choice vouchers and an
additional 27 households were on the waiting list for assistance. Table 26 summa-
rizes the household characteristics of the City’s Housing Choice Voucher holders.
Approximately 89 percent of voucher holders are small households and 11 percent
were large households. Approximately 18 percent households receiving assistance
are elderly-headed.

Publicly Assisted Rental Housing
There are a total of 628 publicly assisted rental housing units located in the City.
Currently, two projects, totaling 124 units, are at risk of losing their affordability.
Both of these developments (Steelworkers’ Oldtimers Apartments and Vista Park
Chino) are assisted with project-based Section 8 contracts under agreements with
HUD. These Section 8 contracts are due to expire prior to October 15, 2023. The
contracts at both locations are renewed on an annual basis. Extensions for both
projects are expected and conversion of these projects to market-rate housing is
highly unlikely. However, for purposes of the Housing Element, State law treats
these projects as potentially at risk of losing their subsidies.
10    Recent legislation sponsored by rental property owners attempted, but without success,
      to remove the mobilehome exemption from vacancy decontrol.

The City’s publicly assisted rental housing stock includes the following:
           Seasons Senior Apartments: This 104-unit senior housing complex was
            completed in 2001 with subsidies from Redevelopment Housing Set-
            Aside funds and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). Of the 104
            units, 102 units are affordable to lower income households. This project
            is deed restricted as affordable housing for 57 years until 2055 and there-
            fore is not at risk of converting to market rate housing.
                                                                                   49

           Villa del Sol: RDA purchased affordability covenants in 2003, requiring
            that 10 units (two studios, three one-bedroom units. and five two-
            bedroom units) be rented at rates affordable to very low income house-
            holds for a period of 55 years.
           Meadow Square Apartments: This 250-unit affordable housing com-
            munity accessible for persons with low-income was completed in 2008.
            This affordable housing community is privately owned and operated and
            located in the new Preserve master planned community. All 250 units are
            available at monthly rents affordable to very low income (53 units), low
            income (53 units) and moderate income (144 units) households and are
            protected until 2063.
           Steelworkers Oldtimers: 84-unit housing for seniors and disabled per-
            sons; project was constructed with HUD Section 202/811 funds and
            maintains a Section 8 contract. Nonprofit ownership is required for this
            project as a condition for the Section 202/811 loan, and the project must
            remain as low income housing for the life of the project. Although this
            project cannot be converted to market-rate housing, the Section 8 con-
            tract will expire on July 10, 2013. Annual renewal of the Section 8 con-
            tract is required to maintain the affordable rent levels.
           Vista Park Chino: This project is a 40-unit family housing development
            constructed with a HUD Section 221d4 mortgage financing and maintains
            a Section 8 contract. Because this project was financed with a market-rate
            loan, no binding low income use restrictions are in place. Affordability of
            these units is controlled by the Section 8 contract that is set to expire
            April 4, 2013, with the possibility of renewing the contract. Property
            management had previously indicated that the owner intends to maintain
            the project as affordable housing unless economic circumstances change
            substantially. As of the writing of this Housing Element, no Notice of In-
            tent to opt out of the Section 8 program has been filed. On August 21,
            2012, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2012-40 approving the is-
            suance of multi-family tax exempt bond financing for Vista Park Chino in
            order to provide funding to the Borrower for substantial renovations to
            the site and unit interiors, including new kitchen cabinets, bathtubs and
            fixtures, ADA improvements, interior and exterior doors, new roofing,
            exterior and interior painting, and new energy efficient products (such as
            kitchen appliances). The Project is intended to make a significant invest-

            ment to preserve, maintain and enhance the property as a high-quality af-
            fordable rental housing community in Chino.
Planned Affordable Developments
           Ivy at College Park: 133-unit housing complex funded with subsidies
            from Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds. The project is under con-
            struction as of March 2013 with a Spring 2014 projected completion date.
            The earliest expiration of affordability for these units is 2067. This project
            is therefore not at-risk of conversion to market rate housing within the
            Housing Element planning period.
           Seasons Senior Villas Expansion: Nine-unit expansion at the senior
            housing complex to be constructed with subsidies from Redevelopment
            Housing Set-Aside funds. The project is expected to commence con-
            struction in 2014.
Preservation of At-Risk Units
State Housing Element law requires the analysis of government-subsidized housing
that may change from low-income housing to market-rate housing during the next
ten years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from October 15,
2013 through October 15, 2023. This section evaluates affordable housing in Chi-
no that may be at-risk of converting to market rates and the estimated costs to pre-
serve or replace the at-risk units.
Within the 2013-2023 “at-risk” housing analysis period, two of the City’s affordable
housing projects are considered at low risk of being converted to market rate be-
cause the owners have continued to renew their HUD contracts. While the HUD
renewal process is periodic, the approval is fairly automatic. Though unlikely, it is
possible 124 of the City’s affordable housing units could convert to market-rate at
some point in the planning period.
Preservation Options
Depending on the circumstances of the at-risk projects, different options may be
used to preserve or replace the units. Preservation options typically include: 1)
transfer of units to non-profit ownership; and 2) purchase of affordability cove-
nants. For replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted
multi-family housing units. The following discussion highlights ways that the City’s
at-risk projects could be preserved as affordable housing. All of the presented al-
                                                                                      51

              ternatives are costly and beyond the ability of the City of Chino to manage without
              large amounts of subsidy from federal and/or State resources. These options are
              described below.
              Rental Assistance
              Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing.
              Similar to Section 8 vouchers, the City, through a variety of potential funding
              sources, could provide rent subsidies to very low income households. This option
              is applicable to all 124 units subsidized with Section 8.
              The level of the subsidy required to preserve the at-risk units is estimated to equal
              the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for a unit minus the housing cost affordable by a very
              low income household. Table 28 estimates the rent subsidies required to preserve
              the affordability of the 124 at-risk units. Based on the estimates and assumptions
              shown in this table, approximately $302,136 in rent subsidies would be required
              annually. Assuming a 20-year affordability, the total subsidy is about $8.1 million.

              Transfer of Ownership
              Another preservation option is to transfer the ownership of the at-risk units to a
              nonprofit organization or purchase similar units by a nonprofit organization. This
              option is only applicable to Vista Park Chino Apartments, the only for-profit at-risk
              housing project. The cost of transferring ownership depends on a number of fac-
              tors, including the market conditions at the time, occupancy rate, and physical con-
              ditions of the building and units. The estimated market value for the for-profit
              units at risk is provided in Table 29.

Current market value for the at-risk units is estimated on the basis of the units’
potential annual income, and operating and maintenance expenses. As indicated,
the estimated market value of Vista Park’s at-risk affordable housing units is $5.4
million. This estimate is provided for the purpose of comparison and understand-
ing the magnitude of costs involved and does not represent the precise market val-
ue of this project. The actual market value at time of sale would depend on market

             Market value for at-risk units is estimated with the following assumptions:
             1. Average market rent based on Fair Market Rents (FY 2013) established by
                HUD (Two-bedroom unit = $1,116, and Three-bedroom unit = $1,577).
             2. Average size is assumed to be: 850 square feet for a two-bedroom apart-
                ment, and 1,200 square feet for a three-bedroom apartment.
             3. Annual income is calculated on a vacancy rate = 5%.
             4. Annual operating expenses per square foot = $4.50.
             5. Market value = Annual net project income*multiplication factor.
             6. Multiplication factor for a building in good condition is 12.5.
Replacement Option
The Steelworkers Oldtimers project is owned by a nonprofit organization with a
mission to provide affordable housing for very low income households. As long as
Section 8 or similar funding continues to be available, these units are likely to be
maintained as affordable housing for the life of these buildings. Therefore, re-
placement is not an appropriate or effective option to preserve these at-risk units.
Replacement applies only to Vista Park Chino.
The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors such as densi-
ty, size of units, location and related land costs, and type of construction. Vista
Park Chino is comprised of family apartments of two- and three-bedroom units.
Assuming an average development cost of $150,000 per unit for multi-family rental
housing, replacement of the 40 at-risk units at Vista Park Chino would require ap-
proximately $6 million, excluding land costs.

3. Housing Constraints
Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are posed by mar-
ket, governmental, infrastructure, and environmental factors, among others. These
constraints may increase the cost of housing, or may render residential construction
economically infeasible for developers. Constraints to housing production signifi-
cantly impact households with low and moderate incomes and special needs.
3.1      Market Constraints
3.1.1 Economic Factors
The effects of market forces on the construction industry may act as a barrier to
affordable housing. The forces of supply and demand can affect the timing and
level of housing construction. The California housing market hit its peak in the
summer of 2005, and then prices declined. Home prices in Chino escalated be-
tween 2000 and 2005 but decreased after 2005 through 2012, with the median price
declining by more than 40 percent, according to DQNews.com (Table 23). A simi-
lar pattern characterized prices in the cities surrounding Chino. Throughout the
period, the city remained one of the more affordable communities in the region.
3.1.2 Land and Construction Costs
Construction factors such as type of construction, custom versus tract develop-
ment, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities, square footage, and
structural configuration can increase the cost of housing. Although construction
costs are a significant portion of the overall development cost, they are consistent
throughout the region and therefore are not considered a major constraint to hous-
ing production.
High land costs represent the overriding factor affecting the feasibility of residential
development in the City. The prices of land vary depending on zoning (number of
units allowed) and availability of improvements. Single-family subdivided land with
plans for infrastructure extensions generally commands higher prices than raw land.
Vacant multi-family land is limited in availability. As the City becomes increasingly
built-out and future development becomes more reliant upon the acquisition of
underutilized parcels and demolition of existing uses, the cost of a finished residen-
tial site will further increase.
                                                                                    55
        C I T Y O F C     H I N O
        2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
        3.1.3 Availability of Mortgage Financing
        Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are re-
        quired to disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the in-
        come, gender, and race of loan applicants. In 2011, a total of 953 households ap-
        plied for conventional mortgage loans and 774 households applied for government-
        backed loans to purchase homes in Chino.11
        As discussed before, 2005 represented the peak of the homeownership market in
        Chino and most Southern California communities. Beginning in 2006 and through
        2012, home prices and the number of sales declined. Table 31 shows the HMDA
        data for 2011 mortgage activities. As Table 31, 74 percent of the conventional
        mortgage applications were approved, 14 percent were denied, and 13 percent were
        withdrawn or closed for incompleteness.
        Government-backed loans have been a significant source of financing for lower
        and moderate income households. However, during the past decade, the lending
        market began to offer other loan options, such as zero percent down, interest-only,
        or adjustable loans. As a result, government-backed loans became less attractive as
        long as such options were available. With the collapse of private lending, however,
        government-back loans again became important. In 2011, 774 households applied
        to use government-backed loans to purchase homes in Chino and the overall ap-
        proval rate (73 percent) was comparable to conventional loans.

Overall, home purchase financing is available to Chino residents. Refinancing ac-
tivities were also strong, representing the majority of lending activities in 2011 and
achieving an approval rate of 66 percent. In comparison, the availability of financ-
ing for home improvement is more limited. Less than 60 percent of the house-
holds applying for home improvement financing in 2011 were approved.
Foreclosures
Between 2000 and 2005, with low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero
down, interest only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggres-
sive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many households purchased
homes that were beyond their financial means. Under the false assumptions that
refinancing to lower interest rates would always be an option and home prices
would continue to rise at double-digit rates, many households were (and still are)
unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates, and
decline in sales prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced with significantly inflated
mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the worth of the
homes, many had to resort to foreclosing their homes. After a period in which
foreclosures became common in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, the rate
has fallen, though the number of foreclosures remains high.
In San Bernardino County, 3,165 homeowners filed Notices of Default (NODs) in
the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 4,827 NODs filed during the same period
in the previous year, a decrease of 34 percent.12 Following the implosion of the
mortgage lending market, however, many households still have difficulty obtaining
new mortgage loans or refinancing, even for above moderate income households.
In March 2013, 245 homes in Chino were listed as foreclosures for sale.13 These
homes are listed at various stages of foreclosure (from pre-foreclosures to auctions)
and range in price from $81,000 to over $720,000. The high prices of these homes
facing foreclosure indicate that the impact of foreclosure extends not only to lower
and moderate income households, but also households with higher incomes.

3.2      Governmental Constraints
Actions by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing in
the City. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees,
and other local programs to improve the overall quality of housing may serve as a
constraint to housing development. The following public policies can affect overall
housing availability, adequacy, and affordability.
3.2.1 Land Use Controls
Overview of General Plan Land Use Policy
The City of Chino 2025 General Plan was adopted in 2010. To expand employ-
ment and housing opportunities in Chino, the General Plan Land Use Element
creates a new high-density residential (RD 30) and several mixed-use designations
(Mixed Use Medium Density and High Density) (see Table 32). Since adoption of
the General Plan, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance to implement the Mixed
Use designations (MU 20 and MU 30). However, a new zoning district to imple-
ment the High Density Residential designation has not yet been created.

Specific Plans
Two Specific Plans offer a range of housing types, densities, and mixed-use oppor-
tunities:
           College Park Specific Plan
           The Preserve Specific Plan
Combined, these specific plans offer a capacity of over 14,000 units, ranging from
estate and low-density single-family homes, to medium density town-
homes/condominiums, to high density apartments and mixed-use developments.
3.2.2 Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
primarily through the Zoning Ordinance. In general, the City’s zoning regulations
are designed to balance the goal of providing affordable housing opportunities for
all income groups while protecting the health and safety of residents and preserving
the character of existing neighborhoods. Chino’s existing residential development
standards are summarized in Table 33.
Lot Standards
Minimum lot size requirements range from 0.5 to one acre in larger estate areas, to
4,500 – 15,000 square feet for most single-family residential areas, to 10,000 square
feet for higher density multi-family areas. Single-family lots have modest depth
limits, while multi-family lots have no limit on lot depth.
Residential Densities
General Plan 2025 created new residential and mixed use designations that accom-
modate higher density developments, such as Mixed Use Medium Density (20 units
per acre) and Mixed Use High Density (30 units per acre) designations along major
commercial corridors (Riverside Drive and Central Avenue), as well as in the
Community Core of The Preserve Specific Plan.
Lot Coverage
The City of Chino allows for a maximum of 60 percent building coverage in its
lower density zones, but no limitation in its higher density zones. The only proviso
for multi-family units is that the minimum living area must be 650 square feet for
one-bedroom units and 800 square feet for two-bedroom units.
                                                                                  59

Height Limits
Height restrictions are not a significant constraint to development in Chino. Up to
2.5 stories (35 feet) are allowed for lower density single-family uses. Medium densi-
ty multi-family zones allow up to 2.5 stories (35 feet), and higher-density multi-
family land use designation in The Preserve Specific Plan allow heights up to 55
feet.
Open Space
The use of yard setbacks or open space requirement is one mechanism to ensure
that sufficient privacy and open space are afforded to enhance and maintain the
quality of life for residential neighborhoods. These requirements mitigate noise
from traffic, neighbors, and other noise generating uses that affect the quality of
life.
The Zoning Ordinance has also established open space requirements for multi-
family housing. Open space requirements include both common and private open
space. Overall, the setback and open space requirements are considered typical for
residential uses in the Chino Valley and in the west San Bernardino County.

Parking Standards
Chino’s Zoning Ordinance requires that all single-family units have a minimum of
two spaces in a covered garage per dwelling unit. The same general parking re-
quirements apply to other units, such as duplex units that are at least 950 square
feet in area. Duplexes are allowed to use a carport instead of garage parking for
smaller units. Secondary units require one parking space. Parking standards for
single-family homes are considered typical.
                                                                                       61

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G  E L E M E N T
Parking requirements for multi-family units are based on the size of the unit (Table
34). Typically, the minimum requirements average at least one covered garage
parking space per bedroom, with additional guest parking. The garage parking re-
quirement for multi-family housing can increase the cost of housing. On a case-by-
case basis, the City reviews the parking requirements as a potential constraint to
development and allows for reductions in parking requirements. Furthermore, pro-
jects with affordable housing units meeting the State density bonus requirements
are eligible to use the State parking standards as follows:
           Zero to One-Bedroom: One parking space
           Two- to Three-bedroom: Two parking spaces
           Four or More Bedrooms: 2.5 parking spaces
These requirements include guest and handicapped parking.

To facilitate multi-family and affordable housing, the City has historically modified
parking standards to enhance the feasibility of multi-family projects. For example,
under the City’s Zoning Ordinance, the recently constructed 250-unit Mead-
owsquare Apartments project should have been required to provide 483 garaged
spaces and 56 open spaces for parking. This project was approved with 40 garaged
spaces, 250 carports, and 247 open spaces. Another project – the 142-unit Villa
Serena Apartments – should have been required to provide 156 parking spaces.
This project was approved with 116 spaces. (This project also received a reduced
private open space requirement – from 100 square feet per unit to 63 square feet
per unit.)

Density Bonus
State law requires the provision of certain incentives for residential development
projects that set aside a certain portion of the units to be affordable to lower and
moderate income households. The City implements State law through the density
bonus ordinance. The ordinance was revised to reflect changes to the State density
bonus law (SB 1818). Specifically, the City removed the CUP requirement previ-
ously needed to obtain a density bonus.
Conclusion
To encourage higher density multi-family housing development, such as condomin-
iums and rental apartments, the City included several land use designations in the
General Plan update: RD30, Mixed Use Medium Density, and Mixed Use High
Density. Mixed Use Medium Density will allow for residential development up to
20 units per acre, and RD30 and Mixed Use High Density will allow residential
development up to 30 units per acre. The Zoning Ordinance was amended follow-
ing the General Plan update to establish appropriate development standards to
implement the MU20 and MU30 designations.
3.2.3 Growth Management
The Chino’s Measure M represents a potential constraint to the development of
housing. Measure M was passed by voters in November 1988 with the stated pur-
pose of ensuring the quality of residential environment and the quality of life in
Chino, and preventing the increase of land designated for residential uses without
the majority approval of Chino residents.
Specifically, Measure M requires that the maximum density of any land designated
for residential use shall not exceed the density for such land established by the zon-
ing map and zoning ordinance, or any development agreements in effect prior to
November 8, 1988. The only exception is for construction of senior housing pro-
jects.
Measure M also prohibits the conversion of any land designated for a nonresiden-
tial use to a residential use, excepting school sites designated in the General Plan or
in a specific plan, or development agreements approved by the City Council prior
to November 8, 1988. However, Measure M does not conflict with the State densi-
ty bonus law. Residential projects with an affordable housing component meeting
the State density bonus requirements will be eligible for density increases above the
maximum density permitted in accordance with State law.
                                                                                   63

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Under Measure M, the City Council retains the authority to reduce the density of
residential land. The Council may also convert any residential land to any other
nonresidential use, and may change uses among lands designated for nonresidential
uses. However, recent changes in State Housing Element law require that a juris-
diction demonstrate its continued ability to meet the Regional Housing Needs Al-
location (RHNA) of projected housing needs prior to reducing residential densities
(downzoning) or redesignating land from residential to nonresidential uses.
The majority of the City’s future residential growth will occur in the two specific
plan areas: College Park and The Preserve. The Preserve was annexed into the City
after Measure M was passed and therefore is not within the geographic boundaries
covered by Measure M. Land use changes in this specific plan area do not require
voter approval. A specific plan amendment increased the residential densities and
amount of mixed-use development in The Preserve. Residential opportunities of-
fered by College Park and The Preserve, as well as in other existing residential areas
in the City, provide adequate capacity to accommodate the City’s RHNA without
the need to seek Measure M voter approval (see Section 4, Housing Resources, of
this Housing Element).
3.2.4 Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be
made available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encour-
age the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, including
multi-family rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency shel-
ters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and farmworker housing. Table 35
summarizes the City’s zoning provisions for various types of housing.

      in the Mixed use 20 (MU20), Mixed use 30 (MU30), and General Commercial (CG) zones.
4. Farmworker housing is incidentally permitted in the Agricultural (AG) zone.
Single-Family
Single-family residences are permitted in all residential zones in the City except the
higher density multi-family zones.
Multi-Family
Multi-family housing is permitted in the City’s RD8, RD12 and RD20 zones. Mul-
ti-family residential development requires major or minor recreational facilities de-
pending on the number of dwelling units in the development. They also have a 35-
percent open space requirement as well as balconies for upper units and private
yards for ground level units. A detailed security plan is required before building
permit approval.
Factory-Built Housing
Factory-built housing is defined in the Zoning Ordinance with manufactured build-
ing, mobile home, and modular building. It is a building that has been constructed
                                                                                                 65

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
in whole or in component parts (walls, floors, roofs) off-site, and located in an as-
sembled or partly assembled state on the building site. Factory built housing that is
installed into a foundation is always permitted in a single-family zoned lot. Factory-
built housing that is not constructed with a foundation is generally found in mobile
home parks.
Mobile Homes
Mobile home parks, including manufactured housing development, are conditional-
ly permitted in most residential zones (except RD1 and RD2). Mobile home parks
have special setback requirements (front - 15 feet; rear – 10 feet; interior side – 5
feet; and street side – 15 feet) and a maximum lot coverage of 75 percent. These
standards allow efficient use of the lot to accommodate the maximum number of
units while providing for amenities such as open space and utilities.
Secondary Units
The City has adopted provisions for secondary residential units within its Zoning
Ordinance. Secondary units are permitted on a lot zoned for single-family use in
the R1, R2, R3, R4.5 and R4.5A as well as R8 provided the owner obtains a re-
quired zoning clearance approval. Secondary units are subject to the following
limitations:
           The secondary unit may either be: an independent unit attached to the ex-
            isting dwelling; a unit attached to the main existing dwelling, sharing living
            space; or an independent unit detached from the main dwelling.
           The unit shall be placed on the same lot as an existing single-family resi-
            dential dwelling. Within the RD8 zone, secondary units shall not be per-
            mitted on lots developed with multi-family residential units or duplexes.
           A unit shall not be permitted on residential lots already containing two or
            more dwelling units.
           Separate sale of the unit shall not be permitted; however, the unit may be
            rented.
           The floor area of a second unit shall not exceed 850 square feet for inde-
            pendent units either attached to or detached from the main dwelling, or
            25 percent of the main dwelling (before the addition) for a unit attached
            to the main dwelling and sharing living space.
           The second unit shall be provided with a complete kitchen and full bath-
            room, apart from those in the main residence.
           The unit shall match the main dwelling with respect to architectural design
            and detailing, roof material, and exterior color and finish materials.

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           The unit shall be compatible with the main unit and the surrounding
            neighborhood with respect to building height, scale and massing.
           The unit shall comply with all requirements that are applicable to the main
            dwelling, including, but not limited to, building setbacks, lot coverage,
            building height and architectural design.
           The unit may be metered separately from the main dwelling for gas, elec-
            tricity and water services. A sewer connection separate from the main
            dwelling may also be provided. Prior to the issuance of a building permit
            for a second unit, a covenant of restriction to run with the land shall be
            recorded which specifies that the use of the secondary unit as an inde-
            pendent dwelling may continue only if one unit on the property is owner
            occupied.
In addition to the limitations above, one covered parking space is required for the
secondary unit. Overall these requirements are consistent with State law provisions
on secondary units. Since 2008, five secondary units have been permitted in the
City, for an average of about one unit per year.
Agricultural Workers
Pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health and
Safety Code), employee housing for agricultural workers consisting of no more
than 36 beds in a group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single
family or household is permitted by right in an agricultural land use designation.
Therefore, for properties that permit agricultural uses by right, a local jurisdiction
may not treat employee housing that meets the above criteria any differently than
an agricultural use.
Furthermore, any employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer
employees shall be deemed a single-family structure with a residential land use des-
ignation, according to the Employee Housing Act. Employee housing for six or
fewer persons is permitted where a single-family residence is permitted.
According to the estimate of the 2009-2011 ACS, 200 Chino residents were em-
ployed in the industries of farming, forestry, or fishing . The majority of the City
AG zone is used for composting and sod farming. No traditional farming remains
in the City. Most of the dairy farms still in operation are located within The Pre-
serve Specific Plan area. As The Preserve continues to develop, these sod and dairy
farms will be replaced with residential development.
                                                                                    67

Pursuant to State law, farm employee housing and farm labor camps are permitted
by right in the City’s Agricultural (AG) zone. Farm labor camps are viewed as an
incidental use permitted in the zone and subordinate to the primary use of the
property. In addition, single-family homes are also permitted in the AG zone.
Transitional/Supportive Housing
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801(i)) defines "transitional housing"
and "transitional housing development" as buildings configured as rental housing
developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termina-
tion of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program
recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than
six months. Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to supportive
services designed to assist the homeless in achieving greater economic independ-
ence and a permanent, stable living situation. Transitional housing can take several
forms, including group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multi-family
apartments and typically offers case management and support services to help re-
turn people to independent living (often six months to two years).
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the home-
less, people with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. Cali-
fornia Health and Safety Code (Section 50675.2) defines “supportive housing” as
housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the low income adults
with disabilities, and that is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the sup-
portive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health sta-
tus, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the com-
munity. Target population includes adults with low incomes having one or more
disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other
chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the
Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5, commencing
with Section 4500, of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may, among other
populations, include families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out
of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, or
homeless people.
The Zoning Ordinance was amended in 2013 to permit transitional and supportive
housing in all residential zones subject to the same development standards as the
same type of housing in that zone.

Emergency Shelters
The Chino Zoning Ordinance was amended in 2010 to permit emergency shelters
in the Service Commercial (SC) zone and, in addition, conditionally permits shelters
in the General Commercial (CG), Mixed use 20 (MU 20), and Mixed use 30 (MU
30) zones. An emergency shelter shall have no more than 30 beds and shall be
available to residents for a maximum of 90 days.
Properties zoned Service Commercial (SC) are located along Central Avenue south
of Riverside Drive. This zone permits some residential activities such as caretaker
units and RV living quarters. In addition, professional services, health services,
other health care uses (e.g. health care clinics, hospitals, outpatient services), chari-
table organizations and services, and transportation terminals are permitted or con-
ditionally permitted uses in this zone. These uses are compatible with emergency
shelter uses and provide necessary supportive services for the homeless population,
particularly those with special medical/health care needs.
The SC zone is characterized by a mix of both small (0.25-1 acre) and medium
sized (1-5 acre) parcels, along with a mix of developed, undeveloped and under-
utilized parcels. There is currently approximately 130,000 square feet of building
area in the SC, along with 5.1 acres of undeveloped land. This broad variety of
parcel sizes and land use intensities provides excellent flexibility and therefore nu-
merous options to parties interested in operating emergency shelters. Based on the
San Bernardino County 2011 Point-In-Time Homeless Count and Survey Report,
the City estimates it has a homeless population of 110 persons, including 64 per-
sons who are unsheltered. The SC zone has adequate capacity to accommodate
this homeless population either in one large shelter or several small shelters.
Single-Room Occupancy
The Chino Zoning Ordinance does not currently address Single-Room Occupancy
(SRO) units.14 The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to specify SROs as a
conditionally permitted use in a zoning district to be determined. Conditions for
approval will relate to the performance of the facility, such as parking, security, and
management.
14    With high housing costs, many communities in California are exploring the use of SRO
      to fulfill the affordable housing needs of certain segments of the community, such as
      seniors, students, and single workers.
                                                                                        69

Residential Care Homes
In accordance with Section 1502 of the Health and Safety Code the Zoning Ordi-
nance defines a Residential Care Facility as "any family home, group care facility or
similar facility for twenty-four-hour nonmedical care of persons in need of personal
services, supervision or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily liv-
ing or for the protection of the individual.“
The City does not regulate residential care homes for six or fewer persons; such
homes are permitted in all residential zones as regular residential uses. Residential
care homes for more than six persons are permitted in all zones as long as a Special
Conditional Use Permit is obtained. An application must be filed with the City and
the Director of Community Development will determine if the application is com-
plete, in writing, within 30 days. The Director will evaluate whether the proposed
project:
           Will not endanger the public health, safety and welfare;
           Will not injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;
           Will not result in any significant environmental impacts;
           Will be in harmony in the are in which it is located; and/or
           Will be in conformity with the General Plan or an applicable specific plan.
The Zoning Ordinance definition of residential care homes was amended in 2010
to include facilities that do not require licensing by the State, such as homes for
battered women and children.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Housing options for persons with disabilities are often limited. The Americans
with Disability Act (ADA) came into effect in 1990. Multi-family housing built
prior to 1990 does not typically include accessible units on the ground floor. With
limited multi-family construction between 1990 and 2005, few rental housing units
in Chino are accessible. ADA also does not cover single-family homes. Rehabilita-
tion to accommodate the accessibility needs of disabled residents is needed, par-
ticularly to the older single-family housing stock. Therefore, it is important that the
City’s codes, policies, and regulations are free of constraints to encourage rehabili-
tation of the existing housing stock and to comply with ADA requirements.
Land Use Controls: The City’s Zoning Ordinance complies with the Lanterman
Disability Services Act with regard to licensing for residential care facilities for the
disabled (see discussion above). According to the State Department of Social Ser-
70

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
vices, over 40 residential care homes are located in the City of Chino. These in-
clude:
           21 adult residential facilities (113 beds)
           2 group homes (12 beds)
           12 residential care facilities for the elderly (367 beds)
           2 small family homes (11 beds)
Most of these are small facilities for six or fewer persons. However, a few large
facilities for the elderly are also located in the City. This Housing Element in-
cludes a program to amend the Zoning Ordinance to address provisions for SRO
units. The amendment will expand housing opportunities for persons with disabili-
ties.
No parking requirement is established for residential care facilities serving six or
fewer persons. For residential care facilities serving more than six persons, one
parking space is required for each staff member and one space for every ten per-
sons being cared for. These parking requirements are significantly lower than those
for regular residential uses.
The City has not established any distance requirements for residential care facilities.
The 300-foot distance established by the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities
Services Act governs the minimum distance between two facilities.
The City has not established specific site planning requirements for residential care
facilities. If the residential care facilities are housed in single-family homes, the site
planning requirements for such units apply. Similarly, if residential care facilities
are housed in multi-family structures, the site planning requirements for multi-
family residential apply (see details under Development Review Committee and
Review Criteria). No special site planning requirements would impede the devel-
opment of such facilities.
Definition of Family: Some local governments may attempt to restrict access to
housing for households failing to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in
a zoning ordinance. Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family” is one that lim-
its the number of persons in what is considered a “family” and differentiates be-
tween related and unrelated individuals living together. Restrictive definitions of
“family” may illegally limit the development and siting of group homes for persons
                                                                                      71

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
with disabilities but not for housing families that are similarly sized or situated.15 In
Chino, however, the definition of “family” in the Zoning Ordinance distinguishes a
family by the sharing of living expenses, a single lease or rental agreement, and oth-
er characteristics indicative of a single household. It does not address the number
of persons nor whether individuals are related or unrelated to each other.
Reasonable Accommodation Procedures: Both the Federal Fair Housing Act
and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to
make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their zoning
laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary
to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For
example, it may be a reasonable accommodation to waive a setback requirement so
that a paved path of travel can be provided to residents who have mobility impair-
ments. Another example would be to waive the maximum lot coverage require-
ment may be a reasonable accommodation to allow a disabled person to create a
bedroom on the ground floor.
Chino has recently adopted a formal procedure for reasonable accommodation
requests, which are reviewed and approved by the Director of Community Devel-
opment, at an administrative (staff) level. Application must be made to the Direc-
tor of Community Development on a form provided by the City. The determina-
tion is made based on the following factors:
           Special need created by the disability;
           Potential benefit received by the modification;
           Potential impact on surrounding uses;
           Physical attributes of the property and structures;
           Alternative accommodations which may provide equivalent benefits;
           Whether the targeted accommodation would place an undue financial or
            administrative burden on the City; and
15    California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista
      v. Pagard, 1981, etc.) have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an
      individual; (b) two or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a
      group of not more than a specific number of unrelated persons as a single housekeep-
      ing unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that distin-
      guishes between blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any le-
      gitimate or useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and land use plan-
      ning powers of a municipality, and therefore violates rights of privacy under the Cali-
      fornia Constitution.

           Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental al-
            teration in law, policy or procedure of the City.
A hearing on the request is conducted based on the accommodation necessary,
with a decision by the Director of Community Development. This is followed by
an investigation of the facts of the application to ensure that it is consistent with
the General Plan. The decision to approve, conditionally approve or deny the ap-
plication must be rendered within 45 days. The decision of the Director of Com-
munity Development is final in the absence of a timely appeal to the Planning
Commission.
Building Codes: The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations
that regulates the access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with
disabilities. No unique restrictions are in place that would constrain the develop-
ment of housing for persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the
Code of Regulations, and California Building Standards Code is reviewed and en-
forced by the Building Division of the Community Development Department as a
part of the building permit submittal.
3.2.5 Development and Planning Fees
The City charges various fees and assessments to cover the cost of processing per-
mits and providing certain services and utilities. Table 36 summarizes the City's
planning fee requirements for residential development. These fees are not consid-
ered excessive compared to surrounding communities (Table 37). In addition to
City fees charged at the time building permits are issued, developers are required to
pay school impact fees.

3.2.6 On- and Off-Site Improvements
Requirements for on- and off-site improvements vary depending on the presence
of existing improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed develop-
ment. In general, most residential areas in Chino are served with infrastructure.
The Zoning Ordinance holds any person constructing any building, parking lot or
developing any area responsible to pay for a number of improvements including:
concrete curbs, gutters, asphalt concrete street pavement, sidewalks and streetlights.
Public street widths are specified in the Chino Subdivision Ordinance. This docu-
ment establishes street standards for various types of streets. For typical residential
                                                                                       75

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
streets, the standard is 60 feet right of way (ROW). Private streets must be wide
enough to meet standards established in the California Fire Code for Fire Depart-
ment equipment needs.
The City of Chino’s fee structure includes some on- and off-site improvements,
which are described in the section above. Off-site improvement fees include drain-
age and sewer facility fees, school fees, park land fees, and public facility fees,
among others. While these fees add to the cost of housing development, these fees
are established to cover the costs of infrastructure, facilities, and improvements
necessary to serve the development. The City provides financial subsidies to af-
fordable housing development in order to offset the impact of development fees.
3.2.7 Building Codes and Enforcement
The City adopted and enforces the 2010 California Building Code to ensure that all
housing units are built to specified standards. The Code is substantially determined
by the International Conference of Building Officials and the State of California.
The City adopted the code with a few administrative amendments. These stand-
ards do not significantly increase construction costs. Code enforcement is imple-
mented on a complaint basis.
3.2.8 Processing and Permit Procedures
Chino’s processing procedures for new housing developments and the modifica-
tion of existing residential projects include the following frequently used permits
and actions: tentative maps, administrative permits and appeals, site plan reviews,
variances, and planned developments. The City complies with requirements under
the State’s Streamlining Review Act, and makes all attempts to expedite permit
processing.
Administrative Approvals
Some developments only require approval at a staff level. Projects requiring an
Administrative approval do not have to go through the Development Review
Committee process or a public hearing. They are approved at a staff level, typically
within 30 days of submittal.
Development Review Committee - Review Criteria and Required Ap-
provals
All proposed development projects not subject to the Administrative Approval
process are subject to an initial plan review process. After initial submittal of the
application, a meeting is scheduled with the Development Review Committee to
76

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
review the application. The Committee is consisted of representatives from various
City departments, including Planning, Building, Fire, and Police. The meeting is
scheduled within three weeks of the initial application submittal. The Development
Review Committee meets on the first and third Wednesday of every month. The
City has established clear and specific design guidelines in the Zoning Ordinance to
assist with the development review process.
Single-Family and Duplex: The site planning review criteria are listed below.
           Proportional mix and placement of lots;
           Preservation of mature trees and natural features;
           Placement of dwellings on lots;
           Preservation of views;
           Grading and treatment of natural drainage courses;
           Provision of amenities, such as treatment of subdivision entrance, land-
            scaping, open space, walls and fences, etc.; and
           Other unique amenities.
Single-family and duplex dwelling developments of four units or less only require
an Administrative Approval and are not subject to review by the Development
Review Committee. Single-family and duplex dwelling developments of five or
more units require a Site Approval, and are subject to review by the Development
Review Committee.
Multi-Family: The site planning review criteria are listed below.
           Mix and clustering of units;
           Placement buildings on the project site;
           Dominance of on-site parking facilities on the project;
           Relationship of pedestrian and vehicular circulation;
           Preservation of mature trees and natural features;
           Grading and treatment of natural drainage courses;
           Provision of amenities, such as treatment of project entrance, landscaping,
            open space, walls and fences, etc.; and
           Other unique amenities.
Multi-family developments of any size require a Site Approval and Development
Review Committee approval.
                                                                                   77

C I T Y O F C      H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1   H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
There is no particular architectural style required for single-family or multi-family
residential structures; however, the primary focus should be on the development of
a high quality residential environment. In general, the architecture should consider
compatibility with the character of the surrounding area, including harmonious
building style, form, size, color, material and roofline.
Planning Commission and City Council Review
After Development Review Committee approval, the project goes to either the
Planning Commission or the City Council. The Planning Commission meets on
the first and third Monday of every month, and the City Council meets on the first
and third Tuesday of every month. After the public hearing the Planning Commis-
sion makes its decision and has 45 days to provide the decision to the City Council.
If the Planning Commission is the final approval body, any party has 10 days to
appeal the decision to the City Council. If the City Council is the final approval
body, there is not further course for appeal.
The Chino Zoning Ordinance establishes specific required findings for reviewing
various development and planning applications. The following is a listing of re-
quired findings for the various application types and the level of review required for
each:
           General Plan Amendments: Findings

                  joining land uses, for the requested land use designation and antici-
                  pated development.
           General Plan Amendments: Level of Approval
            o General Plan Amendments require approval from both the Planning
                  Commission and the City Council.
            o General Plan Amendments only require Development Review Com-
                  mittee if they are associated with a proposed development project.

The required findings and approval process are clearly identified in the City’s Zon-
ing Ordinance. Meetings with the Development Review Committee also help clari-
fy City expectations. The City’s timeline (discussed in the following section)

demonstrates that the City’s approval process does not constrain housing devel-
opment.
Timelines
Timelines vary by project and the approvals required. The process can exceed the
estimated time based on circumstances, particularly if an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR) is required. Table 38 illustrates typical application review and pro-
cessing timeframes:

Plan Check                                7-10 weeks          City Staff
All residential developments greater than four units, whether single or multi-family,
go through the same review process. Application is made to the City and the pro-
posed project is scheduled for review by the Development Review Committee.
Staff will meet with the project applicant within 20 days of the application submit-
tal. If the application is determined incomplete, staff will give the applicant a de-
tailed list of all outstanding items, and the applicant is required to resubmit for De-
velopment Review. Resubmittal times vary by applicant, but the time between De-
velopment Review Committee meetings for a single project is usually four weeks. If
a project application is determined to be complete by staff, the applicant is required
to re-submit to the Development Review Committee a final time for Conditions of
Approval. At this time, a Planning Commission and/or City Council hearing date
is set. Most applications require between two and four Development Review
Committee meetings. Planning Commission hearing dates are typically three to four
weeks from the last Development Review Committee meeting on a proposed pro-
ject. City Council hearings are typically scheduled two to three weeks after the
Planning Commission hearing date. Most residential projects in the city are devel-
                                                                                    81

oped as infill projects or as greenfield development within an approved master
plan, so the environmental review process is streamlined. Many are determined
categorically exempt from CEQA, because they are infill or can rely on a previous
Master EIR.
After staff, Planning Commission, or City Council approval (depending on the type
of development), the applicant must submit building and engineering plans for Plan
Check before a building permit is issued. Plan check cycles typically run three to
five weeks for the first check, and three weeks for each subsequent check. Projects
usually take two to three plan check cycles for approval before permits are issued
so construction can begin.
Overall, a single-family subdivision or multi-family apartment project could begin
construction in as few as 17 weeks from the initial submittal date, with an average
of about 22 weeks. The development community has complimented the City of
Chino on the degree of certainty, consistency, and timeliness the City gives to the
development process, as compared to other jurisdictions.
Currently, the City achieves affordable housing primarily through development
agreement with major developers. Due to the scale and complexity of these large
development projects, dedicated staff persons are assigned to help process the pro-
ject applications.
3.2.9 State Tax Policies and Regulations
Proposition 13
Proposition 13, a voter initiative that limits increases in property taxes except when
there is a transfer of ownership, may have increased the cost of housing. The initi-
ative forced local governments to pass on more of the costs of housing develop-
ment (e.g., construction of infrastructure and community facilities) to new home-
owners.
Federal and State Environmental Protection Regulations
Federal and State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretion-
ary projects (e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs, resulting from fees
charged by local government and private consultants needed to complete the envi-
ronmental analysis, and from delays caused by the mandated public review periods,
are also added to the cost of housing and passed on to the consumer. However,
82
C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
the presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure envi-
ronmental quality for Chino residents.
3.3      Environmental Constraints
Future residential development potential is focused in several areas, particularly in
The Preserve Specific Plan area (see discussions in Section 4 of this Housing Ele-
ment). Environment constraints identified in The Preserve Specific Plan Environ-
mental Impact Report (EIR) include the following:
3.3.1 Flooding and Inundation
Prado Dam currently retains floodwaters up to an inundation elevation of 505 feet
on an annual basis. The 505-foot elevation is largely confined to the Chino Creek
and Mill Creek channels within The Preserve Specific Plan area. Federal Emergen-
cy Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) also iden-
tify portions of the plan area within the 500-year flood plain. In addition, the
FIRM maps and the Prado Flood Control Basin Master Plan indicate that 100-year
flood-prone areas occur within the plan area in the vicinity of Mills Creek and Chi-
no Creek floodplain below the 550-foot elevation. This essentially encompasses
the lower 30 percent of the plan area. In response to this constraint, no habitable
structures are planned in that area.
3.3.2 Biological Resources
The Santa Ana River is a major drainage that connects coastal regions of Orange
County with interior regions of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Mill Creek
and the Santa Ana River are regional corridors that link riparian ecosystems from
the immediate coastal plain with the interior plains and valleys of the region. The
Prado Basin, with its extensive riparian woodland, provides significant bio-diversity
and serves as a major link within this regional corridor.
The Specific Plan includes a 566-Foot Dam Inundation Elevation Overlay (DIO)
that is applied to all lands below 566-foot elevation inundation area. Areas of high
biological sensitivity within the Chino Creek and Mill Creek floodways below the
566-foot elevation line are included within an extreme resource area. These areas
include critical habitat areas identified as suitable only for extremely low intensity
use. No urban development is permitted below the 566-foot elevation line.
                                                                                  83

4. Housing Resources
The extent of housing needs in a community often far exceeds the resources avail-
able. The City of Chino must pull together limited resources and use them effi-
ciently in order to address the current and projected housing needs of Chino resi-
dents. This section of the Housing Element provides an overview of resources
available to the City.
4.1      Residential Development Potential
4.1.1 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate a share
of the region’s projected housing needs for the planning period. This share, called
the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is important because State law
mandates that jurisdictions provide sufficient sites to accommodate a variety of
housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community. Compliance
with this requirement is measured by the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate
land to accommodate the RHNA.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as the regional
planning agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to individual jurisdictions
within the six-county region, including the County of San Bernardino.16 The San
Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG), a subregional planning organiza-
tion, worked closely with SCAG to develop the RHNA for San Bernardino County
jurisdictions.
For the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the RHNA commences on January 1, 2014
through October 31, 2021. The RHNA is distributed by income category. For the
2013 Housing Element update, the City of Chino is allocated a RHNA of 2,894
units as follows:

      including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial.

           Above Moderate-Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 1,176 units
            (40.6 percent)
The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate densities and
appropriate development standards to accommodate these units.
4.1.2 Residential Sites Inventory
For the 2013-2021 Housing Element planning period, the City of Chino has a low-
er-income RHNA of 1,185 housing units. Potential development sites at adequate
densities and appropriate development standards must be made available to ac-
commodate these units.
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the
land inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the regional
growth. The City is committed to identifying sites at appropriate densities as re-
quired by law. The State, through AB 2348, has established “default” density
standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes that a density standard of 30
units per acre for metropolitan jurisdictions, such as Chino, is adequate for facilitat-
ing the production of housing affordable to lower income households. AB 2348
also includes provisions to allow a lower density threshold to be used if a jurisdic-
tion can demonstrate the feasibility of developing lower income housing at below
30 units per acre.
The City of Chino has a history of developing affordable housing at densities lower
than 30 units per acre. In 2007, during the peak of the housing market, Meadow
Square Apartments, a 250-unit 100-percent affordable project, was completed. An-
17    The City has a RHNA allocation of 707 very low income units (inclusive of extremely
      low income units). Pursuant to new State law (AB 2634), the City must project the
      number of extremely low income housing needs based on Census income distribution
      or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low. According to the
      CHAS data developed by HUD using 2005-2009 Census data, the City had 14.3 percent
      very low income households (6.8 percent extremely low income and 7.5 percent very
      low income) as shown in (Table 8). Therefore the City’s RHNA of 707 very low in-
      come units may be split into 339 extremely low and 368 very low income units. How-
      ever, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA, State law does not man-
      date the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.
                                                                                         85

                       struction and expected to be completed in 2014. Both affordable developments
                       were constructed at a density of about 20 units per acre. Specifically, Ivy at College
                       Park was built at 20 units per acre with a per-unit gap financing of about $122,000
                       (including LIHTC, redevelopment housing set-aside, and State Multi-Family Hous-
                       ing Program funds). This demonstrates the feasibility of providing affordable hous-
                       ing in areas of the City that allow up to 24 dwelling units per acre. A list of recent

                       According to a 2012 study by Keyser Marston Associates for the County of San
                       Diego, garden style apartments developed at approximately 24 units per acre were
                       the most cost effective to construct and required the lowest per unit gap financing
                       for lower income households. The study found that the higher construction costs
                       for structured parking, internal circulation, and a stacked‐flat configuration made
                       higher density residential projects a challenge for suburban jurisdictions with rural
                       subareas such as unincorporated San Diego County and Chino.
                       Furthermore, local developers have expressed concerns to City staff about the fi-
                       nancial feasibility of constructing residential projects at higher densities in the Chi-
                       no area. According to cost estimates presented to the City, development costs can

Therefore, as a result of recent development trends and financial feasibility con-
cerns, in estimating potential units by income category, it is assumed that:
           A density of zero to 10 units per acre (primarily for single-family homes)
            is assumed to facilitate housing in the above moderate income category;
           A density of 11 to 23 units per acre (primarily for medium density multi-
            family developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the moderate in-
            come category; and
           A density of 24 or more units per acre (primarily for higher density multi-
            family developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the very low and
            low income category.
Based on these assumptions, the City’s entire lower-income RHNA can be met
through residential opportunities that remain available in The Preserve Specific
Plan.
The Preserve Specific Plan
The Preserve is approximately two miles in width and three miles in length, en-
compassing 5,435 acres. Bordering The Preserve on the west is the City of Chino
Hills. To the north of The Preserve are the City of Ontario and the Chino Airport.
The City of Eastvale forms the eastern boundary of the planning area and the Pra-
do Flood Control Basin in the County of Riverside borders The Preserve to the
south.
To expand residential opportunities, the City and the master developer of The Pre-
serve Specific Plan area amended the Specific Plan in 2008. The amendment pro-
vided for increased high density residential development by reallocating Medium
                                                                                    87

Density Residential land (that allowed 20 units per acre) and nonresidential land to
High Density Residential land that permits development up to 40 units per acre,
with a minimum average of 30 units per acre. The amendment also increased the
allowable residential density of 13.5 acres of Community Core land to 40 units per
acre, with a minimum average of 30 units per acre. This amendment was not sub-
ject to Measure M voter approval. Overall, the Preserve Specific Plan amendment
provided for 1,092 additional units at an average density of 30 units per acre, with
portions of these areas reaching 40 units per acre.
The City is also currently pursuing an amendment to The Preserve Development
Agreement, which would allow for the rezoning of a three-acre area of land from
MDR (Medium-density residential) to HDR-30 along the east side of Chino-
Corona Road, north of Cucamonga Avenue. The allowable density range would be
24 to 40 units per acre, providing a minimum of 72 additional units.
Since its adoption in 2003, portions of The Preserve have already been developed,
according to standards outlined in the specific plan and its subsequent amend-
ments. Table 41 and Figure 5 below summarize the remaining residential capacity
in The Preserve. For the purposes of this Housing Element only, the City has or-
ganized the Preserve planning area into subareas by land use designation. Figure 5
identifies where the remaining developable land is located by land use designation.
There is no phasing plan for development within The Preserve. Most of the land is
owned by two large master developers, who are responsible for the development of
backbone infrastructure prior to development of specific sites. Development in the
planning area is market driven and likely to occur within the planning period, sub-
ject to market conditions.

College Park Specific Plan
The College Park Specific Plan is located within the northeastern boundary of the
city, encompassing 710 acres. The planning area is located in the southwestern
corner of San Bernardino County, approximately 28 miles east of Downtown Los
Angeles. The Specific Plan includes provisions for a variety of residential housing
types and varying architectural styles from estate homes to live/work units. Per
Measure A, up to 2,500 residential units may be developed within College Park’s
eight neighborhoods and the village center, although the College Park Plan pro-
vides for 2,200 units.
Residential development within College Park has been ongoing since the Plan’s
adoption in 2004 and Table 42 summarizes the remaining residential capacity with-
in the planning area.

Other Residential Development Potential
Outside of The Preserve and College Park planning areas, the City also has a num-
ber of vacant and underutilized properties with near-term redevelopment potential.
This inventory of vacant and underutilized sites, including detailed parcel-by-parcel
information, can be found in Appendix C. In compiling this inventory, staff used
their knowledge of the City to identify properties that had one or more of the fol-
lowing characteristics:
           Property is vacant;
           Property has a sizable amount of developable acreage remaining; and/or
           Property contains non-permanent construction (i.e. metal buildings).
The existing conditions of these properties were then verified though aerial photos
and surrounding parcels with similar characteristics were also added to inventory.
Estimating Realistic Capacity
In estimating the development capacity of each site, the City utilizes conservative
and realistic assumptions. Specifically, the sites inventory assumes 70 percent of
the maximum allowed density for most parcels, accounting for internal circulation,
landscaping, and parking/setback requirements. A review of City records indicated
that residential developments in Chino can achieve an average of 75 percent of the
maximum density allowed, with some projects achieving at or exceeding the allow-
able density:
           Ivy at College Park:
            ― Maximum Density = 20 units/acre
            ― Achieved Density = 20.9 units/acre
           Meadow Square Apartments:
            ― Maximum Density = 12 units/acre
            ― Achieved Density = 20.3 units/acre
A total of 522 residential units can be accommodated on vacant and underutilized
sites outside of The Preserve and College Park planning areas (Table 43 and Table
44). Of these housing units, 220 units (about 42 percent) qualify as feasible for fa-
cilitating the development of moderate income units, based on the allowable densi-
ty of the parcel.

       4.1.5 Availability of Infrastructure and Public Improvements
       Much of the future residential development is expected to occur within The Pre-
       serve Specific Plan area, which has developed infrastructure and public facility mas-
       ter plans to serve the anticipated growth. As part of the development plan for The
       Preserve, most of the infrastructure for the entire planning area is expected to be
       completed and in place prior to any significant residential development. As of June
       2013, a significant portion of the infrastructure for The Preserve has already been
       completed. The College Park Specific Plan area and the rest of the City are already
       well served by existing infrastructure with more than sufficient capacity.
       4.2      Financial Resources
       The provision of affordable housing requires substantial public subsidies. The City
       of Chino has access to a number of local, state, and federal resources. The key
       funding sources are described below.
       4.2.1 Community Development Block Grant
       The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides funds for a
       range of community development activities, including: acquisition and/or disposi-
       tion of real estate or property; public facilities and improvements; relocation; reha-
       bilitation of housing; and homeownership assistance.
                                                                                          97

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
The City of Chino receives approximately $425,000 annually. Furthermore, the
City has “mortgaged” much of the funding for the next several years for the con-
struction of the East Civic Center Project. A significant portion of the City’s
CDBG allocation is used to repay the Section 108 loan for the East Civic Center
Project.
4.2.2 Section 8 Rental Assistance
The City of Chino participates in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program
administered by the Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino. The
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program provides rental assistance to very low
income persons. Under this program, the voucher recipients pay 30 percent of
their income on housing, and the program subsidizes the rents up to the Fair Mar-
ket Rents (FMR). Should the voucher recipients decide to rent homes that are
above the FMR, the recipients would be responsible for the excess amounts.
As of November 2012, about 110 households in Chino receive Section 8 vouchers.
The need for Section 8 assistance far exceeds the funding available. The County
Housing Authority maintains a long waiting list, with the waiting being several
years.
4.2.3 State Housing Funds
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) adminis-
ters a range of housing funds, including:
           HOME Investment Partnership Act: HOME funds can be used for a
            variety of housing activities benefiting households with incomes up to 80
            percent of the AMI. Eligible activities include homebuyer assistance, ac-
            quisition/rehabilitation, major/substantial rehabilitation, rental assistance,
            and new construction.
           Multi-Family Housing Program: Low interest loans for the develop-
            ment of affordable rental housing, supportive housing for persons with
            disabilities who are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, and
            housing for homeless youth.
           CalHome: Grants for cities and counties to fund first-time homebuyer
            mortgage assistance and owner-occupied housing rehabilitation.

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Predevelopment Loan Program: Predevelopment capital to finance the
            start of low income housing projects.
           Affordable Housing Innovation Fund: Funding for pilot programs to
            demonstrate innovative, cost-saving ways to create or preserve affordable
            housing.
           Infill Incentive Grant Program: Funding of public infrastructure (water,
            sewer, traffic, parks, site cleanup, etc.) to facilitate infill housing develop-
            ment.
           Housing Related Parks Program: Grants for housing-related parks.
Eligibility for a number of these funds requires a Housing Element that complies
with State law.
4.3      Administrative Resources
The City of Chino actively works with a number of nonprofit organizations to ex-
pand and preserve affordable housing in the City. The following nonprofit agen-
cies are either active in providing or preserving affordable housing in the city or
have expressed interest in working in San Bernardino County. These include:
           Habitat for Humanity: The City is working with Habitat for Humanity
            in providing affordable single-family homes through infill development.
           Steelworkers Oldtimers: This organization owns and operates the 84-
            unit senior affordable housing in Chino.
           National Community Renaissance of California (formerly Southern
            California Housing Development Corporation): NCRC, located in
            Rancho Cucamonga, is one of the biggest nonprofit affordable housing
            developers in Southern California.
           Jamboree Housing Corporation: Based in Irvine, Jamboree is a major
            nonprofit affordable housing developer in California.
           Bridge Housing: Based in Irvine, Bridge Housing is a major nonprofit
            affordable housing developer in California, responsible for the Ivy at Col-
            lege Park development.
                                                                                         99

4.4      Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Residential energy costs can impact the affordability of housing in that increasing
utility costs decrease the amount of income that can be used for rents or mortgage
payments. Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory
energy standards for new housing development, and requires adoption of an “ener-
gy budget.”
In addition to ensuring compliance with Title 24 in new construction, the City pro-
vides assistance to homeowners to make energy efficiency improvements as part of
the Home Improvement Program. Additionally, solar (PV) panels will be installed
on four of six upcoming infill projects (5357 & 5359 Anderson St. and 13232 &
13240 5th St.
Several elements in the updated Chino General Plan contain policies relating to
energy conservation. Specifically:
           The Land Use Element promotes neighborhoods that are served by pub-
            lic transportation, close to public services and shopping; mixture of uses
            putting people close to destinations; jobs-housing balance.
           The Economic Development Element promotes jobs-housing balance.
            Specifically, policies and strategies are included to better match new jobs
            to skills of existing residents to reduce commuting.
           The Transportation Element establishes an efficient roadway network and
            priority for bike/pedestrian transportation.
           The Open Space and Conservation Element promotes green building;
            green operations for city services; recycling; incentives for purchase of en-
            ergy-efficient appliances.
           The Parks & Recreation Element proposes to locate parks within walking
            distance of housing.
All these elements contain policies and/or strategies that aim at reducing energy
consumption through reductions in vehicle trips and miles traveled.

5.2      Implementing Actions
5.2.1 Quality of Housing
Action 1: Ownership Rehabilitation Programs
The City of Chino offers a number of programs to help homeowners maintain and
improve their homes:
           Home Improvement Deferred Loan Program: This program provides
            qualified low and moderate income homeowners with a deferred payment
            loan of up to $40,000 ($60,000 in the event of an eligible room addition
            under overcrowded conditions). Under this loan program, no payments
            are required for ten years or the number of years remaining on the first
            mortgage, whichever is longer. The rate on the deferred loan is three per-
            cent. Room additions are an eligible activity under this program provided
            that the applicant household is overcrowded relative to unit size. During
            FY 2013-14, the City received $440,000 in CalHOME grant funding. Ap-
            proximately $260,000 will be used for the Home Improvement Deferred

            Loan Program. The City will continue to pursue funding annually to keep
            this program active.
           Mobile Home Improvement Grant Program: This program provides
            qualified low income mobile home owners with a grant of up to $7,500
            ($10,000 in the event that a roof replacement is necessary) for eligible
            health, safety, and code-related repairs. No funding was available for this
            program during FY 2013-14, but the City will continue to seek funding
            sources for this program.
Funding Sources:                        CalHOME; other funding as available
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Housing Division
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Assist 5 households annually, pending funding availability.
       Annually evaluate the need to apply for additional funding to sup-
            port/expand home improvement efforts.
Action 2: Code Compliance
Code Compliance is an important component of the City’s comprehensive afforda-
ble housing strategy. Code Compliance will work closely with housing staff to
identify abandoned properties for abatement, multi-family rental properties appro-
priate for acquisition/rehabilitation by affordable housing developers, and house-
holds requiring rehabilitation assistance.
Funding Sources:                        General Fund
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Code Compliance Di-

Time Frame and Objectives:
       Coordinate with Housing Division staff to identify opportunities for ac-
            quisition/rehabilitation.
       Ensure that Code Compliance staff provides information on home im-
            provement programs to eligible households.
5.2.2 Adequate Housing for All Income Groups
Action 3: Affordable Housing Opportunities
The City will facilitate the development and preservation of quality affordable
housing, as well as provision of housing assistance. Specifically, the City will pur-
sue various opportunities, including but not limited to the following:
                                                                                 105

C I T Y O F C     H I N O
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1  H  O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Acquisition/rehabilitation/conversion of market-rate rental housing into
            affordable housing;
           Infill housing development;
           Abatement of dangerous properties (such as abandoned or boarded up
            buildings) that threaten public health and safety;
           Gap financing of affordable housing development; and
           Provision of homebuyer and rehabilitation assistance.
The City will emphasize the development of affordable rental housing for extreme-
ly low, very low, and low income households, affordable ownership housing for
low and moderate income households, and housing for persons with special needs
(such as persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental disabili-
ties).

Time Frame and Objectives:
       Monitor HCD and HUD websites monthly for funding availability. Eval-
            uate the need to pursue such funds based on project readiness, competi-
            tiveness, and financial feasibility.
       Provide letter of support for funding applications by other organizations
            as long as the proposed projects/programs are consistent with the goals
            and objectives of the City’s General Plan.
       Consider fee reduction or deferral on a case-by-case basis.
       Offer density bonus, incentives, and regulatory concessions pursuant to
            State density bonus law.
       Continue to update and maintain an inventory of available sites appropri-
            ate for affordable housing. Provide assistance in identification of appro-
            priate sites and lot consolidation.
       Continue to grant priority processing to affordable housing projects
            where the applicant requests and demonstrates that priority processing is
            necessary to support the project.

Action 4: Homebuyer Assistance Program
Due to the high costs of ownership housing, the City does not provide a citywide
homebuyer assistance program. In recent years, home prices in Chino have ex-
ceeded the maximum home values established by most State and Federal housing
programs. However, the City is able to provide affordable homeownership through
development agreements. For example, developers of the Artisan project, College
Park Specific Plan, and The Preserve Specific Plan have agreed to set aside a por-
tion of the units as housing affordable to lower and moderate income households
through rental and ownership housing.
In November 2012, the City was awarded a CalHOME grant in the amount of
$600,000. Approximately $180,000 has been allocated to fund three (3) Homebuyer
Assistance loans of $60,000 each to qualified low income households. The City
recognizes the value and importance of providing affordable homeownership to
first-time buyers and will continue to seek, identify and secure new funding re-
sources to continue the implementation of its homebuyer assistance programs.
During FY 2013-14, the City received $440,000 in CalHOME grant funding. Ap-
proximately $180,000 will be used for the Homebuyer Assistance Program. The
City will continue to pursue funding annually to keep this program active.
Funding Sources:                        CalHOME Grant
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Housing Division
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Continue to utilize development agreements as a mechanism to provide
            homebuyer assistance.
       Continue to identify and secure new funding resources to implement a
            homebuyer assistance program.
Action 5: Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)
The HUD-funded Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program is administered
by the Housing Authority of the County of San Bernardino and provides rent sub-
sidies to very low income households and elderly who spend more than 50 percent
of their income on rent, live in substandard housing, or have been displaced. The
subsidies typically represent the difference between 30 percent of the monthly in-
come and housing payment standards established by HUD.
Housing Choice Vouchers are utilized by many extremely low income households
in Chino. The City will work with staff from the Housing Authority of the County
of San Bernardino to market the program and improve its overall effectiveness.
                                                                               107

                                        no
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Promote the use of Housing Choice Vouchers by publicizing the program
            on City website and make information available at public counters and
            community locations. Encourage nonprofit service providers to refer eli-
            gible clients, especially those with extremely low incomes, to the Housing
            Choice Voucher program for assistance.
       Coordinate with the Housing Authority for the prioritizing of vouchers to
            be set aside for extremely low income households.
       Provide Housing Choice Voucher information to owners of small rental
            properties to encourage acceptance of vouchers.
Action 6: Preservation of At-Risk Housing
Two publicly assisted housing projects with a total of 124 units may be at risk of
losing rent subsidies or converting to market-rate housing within the planning peri-
od of this Housing Element. Specifically, many households residing in publicly
assisted housing are extremely low income households with limited housing op-
tions elsewhere. To meet the housing needs of lower income households, the City
must guard against the loss of existing affordable housing units.
Funding Sources:                        To be identified
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Housing Division
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Preserve all 124 very low income units (84 units for seniors and 40 units
            for families).
       Notify property owners annually of the availability of State and federal
            funds to extend rent subsidies and/or restructure project financing, or as
            specific Notices of Funding Availability (NOFA) are released.
       Contact nonprofit housing developers for interest and capacity in pur-
            chasing and/or managing at-risk projects as soon as a Notice of Intent to
            opt out of the Section 8 program is filed.
       Proactively work with project owners to preserve ongoing affordability.
       Work with tenants of at-risk units and inform them or their rights and
            conversion procedures at least 12 months prior to conversion.

           Ensure tenants are notified at least 12 months prior to potential conver-
            sion to market-rate housing or expiration of subsidies and adequate relo-
            cation assistance is provided.
Action 7: Condominium Conversion
The City of Chino has a limited supply of apartment rentals. As a means to pre-
serve the City’s rental housing stock, the Condominium Conversion Ordinance
limits the conversion of apartment complexes to condominiums.
Funding Sources:                        General Fund
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Planning and Housing
                                        Divisions
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Ensure compliance with the City’s Condominium Conversion ordinance.
       Monitor the rate of conversion to determine if modifications to the ordi-
            nance are needed to maintain a healthy rental housing market.
5.2.3 Adequate Sites to Accommodate the RHNA
Action 8: Specific Plan/Planned Development
The City utilizes specific plans and Planned Development Overlay to achieve flexi-
bility in the design of residential neighborhoods and promote an efficient, aestheti-
cally pleasing use of land. During previous Housing Element cycles, the City effec-
tively provided flexible development standards in the Planned Development Over-
lay district and through the use of specific plans. This flexibility is evidenced in the
fact that two major specific plans were adopted – College Park and The Preserve –
which provide for the development of over 11,900 new units in a variety of densi-
ties and types.
Funding Sources:                        None required
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Planning Division

Action 9: Zoning Ordinance
In 2013, the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to include specific provisions for
emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing to comply with
the requirements of State law (Senate Bill 2 - Cedillo). However, the Zoning Ordi-
nance does not currently address the provision of Single Room Occupancy hous-
ing. In addition, the City’s definition of “family” distinguishes a family by the shar-
ing of living expenses, a single lease or rental agreement, and other characteristics
indicative of a single household. This may potentially impede housing options for
persons with disabilities since some residential programs for disabled persons re-
quire individual leases with participants.
Funding Sources:                        None required
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Planning Division
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Within one year of adoption of the Housing Element, the City will review
            a potential amendment to the zoning code that will address conditions
            that may allow SROs to be conditionally permitted within a specific zon-
            ing district to be determined.
       Within one year of adoption of the Housing Element, the City will review
            the definition of “family” and revise as appropriate.
       Continue to evaluate the City’s Zoning Ordinance during annual updates
            to determine whether additional amendments are necessary to accommo-
            date affordable and special needs housing.
Action 10: Permit Processing
Delays in the development such as plan checking and permit processing procedures
will increase the holding cost of development. Complicated procedures may also
discourage development especially by affordable and special needs housing devel-
opers. To facilitate residential development, the City provides development pre-
application review and offers a one-stop processing system that simplifies and ex-
pedites development processing.

Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Planning Division
Time Frame and Objectives:
       Continue to evaluate and improve the one-stop processing system in an
            effort to provide quick project entitlement processing.
       Continue to offer priority processing of affordable and special needs
            housing applications.

Action 11: Development Fees
The City charges various fees and assessments to cover the costs of processing
permits and to provide services and facilities to the project. These fees contribute
to the cost of housing and are ultimately passed on to the consumers. The City
may use CDBG or other funds to offset the fees for affordable and special needs
housing.
Funding Sources:                        CDBG
Responsible Agencies:                   Community Development/Planning and Housing

Time Frame and Objectives:
       Continue to use CDBG funds to help offset fees for affordable and spe-
            cial needs housing.
       Consider fee deferrals for affordable and special needs housing on a case-
            by-case basis, if requested by the project owner/developer.
       Work to identify a new funding source to finance fee waivers for afforda-
            ble and special needs housing.
       Pursue funding for infrastructure improvements needed to support af-
            fordable and special needs housing.
5.2.5 Equal Housing Opportunity
Action 12: Fair Housing Program
The City enforces both State and Federal fair housing laws. To achieve fair hous-
ing goals, the City contracts with a fair housing council to provide fair housing and
tenant/landlord counseling services.

       Continue to provide fair housing and tenant/landlord counseling services.
       Provide fair housing resources on City website and make fair housing
            brochures available at public counters and community locations.
       Complete the update of the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing
            Choice by 2013 to ensure that the fair housing program addresses the
            changing needs of residents.
                                                                                111

A.2         Telephone Interviews
Social service agencies and developers were contacted to solicit input of housing needs, constraints, and opportunities.
Three agencies responded to the interview:
Agency: Chino Neighborhood House
Contact: Don Naf
Over the seven years Don has been working with CC, the program has increased its capacity to serve clientele to approx-
imately 1,400. The type of clientele seeking their services has stayed the same during that time period as in order to qual-
ify they must be low-income. Don was not able to identify any changes in the amount of funding CCC has received
from the City over time, but he did identify funding as an important issue for organization as they simply need more
money to sustain and expand their services. Don did not identify any specific housing related issues that the organiza-
tion encounters in the process of serving its clientele; however, clientele often inquire for help with finding housing and
various other services.
Agency: Bridge Housing
Contact: Kim McKay
Bridge Housing is developing Ivy at College Park, an affordable inclusionary component as part of the project led by
Lennar Homes. The project is mix of two and three bedroom units and will total 135 units overall when construction is
complete. Kim said that so far the hardest part of the development process has been dealing with water department.
She also recalled that the fees the group has paid were on the higher side, though she could not provide any exact esti-
mates. City staff has been very cooperative and helpful to work with. Bridge Housing builds all over California, howev-
er, this is currently their only project in San Bernardino County. Kim stated that the City of Chino has been easier to
work with in comparison to projects they have developed in neighboring areas.
Agency: Standard Pacific Homes
Contact: Brian Jacobson
Standard Pacific Homes is currently part of a joint venture with Lennar homes to build 1,000 homes in College Park
with each developer building approximately half of the units. and it is an actively selling Community. None of their
homes are offered as affordable units, however, there are areas in the College Park Plan that call for affordable units to
be developed, an effort which will be led by Bridge Housing. The Standard Pacific Homes Inland Empire office works
with Cities throughout the area. Brian stated that, relatively speaking; Chino is one of the easier Cities to work with. He
could not speak to any housing related issues that arise with tenants, as the units they develop are for purchase and they
have no direct involvement with occupants.

Residential Sites Inventory
Table C-1 and C-2 list properties that are included in the Housing Element as vacant and underutilized properties
outside of The Preserve and College Park with near-term redevelopment potential. The map on the following page
shows all properties identified as vacant or underutilized based on an improvement-to-land value ratio of less than one.
Aerial photos were reviewed to narrow down the properties to those shown in both tables.

12 AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
   An Air Quality Element is not required by State law. However, air quality has im-
   portant impacts on public health and quality of life throughout the Southern Cali-
   fornia region. Therefore, Chino has elected to include an Air Quality Element.
   Air quality conditions in a city or region are shaped by a number of land use and
   transportation patterns. The Land Use and Transportation Elements include a
   variety of policies that complement those found in this Element seeking to reduce
   single-passenger vehicle trips, increase neighborhood services so residents can
   access services without driving, and increase the safety and convenience of walking,
   bicycling, and transit use. In turn, these efforts reflect the overall theme of this
   General Plan, to move Chino toward becoming a Healthy City.
   This Element is organized into the following sections:
         Background. Describes the air basin and Chino’s setting related to air quality.
         Regulatory Framework. Describes key federal, State, regional, and local or-
         ganizations and regulations.
         Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Provides policy guidance to the
         City related to air quality.
         Indicators. Provides methods for evaluating progress on implementing the
         Air Quality Element.
   A. Background
   1. Air Basin
   The South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) region includes parts of San Bernardino, Los
   Angeles, Riverside, and Orange Counties. The City of Chino is located approx-
   imately 30 miles east of the Pacific Ocean in southwestern San Bernardino County
   within the SCAB. The mountains to the north and east of Chino tend to restrict
   airflow and concentrate pollutants in the valleys and low-lying areas below.
   2. Environmental Setting
   The City of Chino, like the rest of the inland valley areas within the SCAB, is cha-
   racterized by a Mediterranean climate consisting of warm, dry summers and mild,
   wet winters. The average annual precipitation is 13 inches, falling primarily from
   November to April. The average maximum temperature is about 78 degrees Fa-
   hrenheit (ºF), and the average minimum temperature is about 48 degrees ºF.
                                                                                         AQ-1

C I T Y O F C H I N O

A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
                                  The prevailing wind in the SCAB is from a westerly direction and allows for the
                                  areas within the basin to be influenced by the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean.
                                  Occasionally, however, high pressure over the Great Basin will result in hot, dry
                                  easterly winds that are regionally called Santa Ana winds. These offshore winds
                                  typically bring some of the warmest temperatures of the year to coastal southern
                                  California and occur most often during the late summer or early fall months. Dur-
                                  ing these Santa Ana wind events, air pollutants in the basin are pushed westward
                                  out to sea, resulting in some of the best air quality days for the residents of the in-
                                  land valley areas. Generally speaking, the overall air quality within the basin is bet-
                                  ter during the winter months.
                                  B. Regulatory Framework
                                  The regulatory framework described below details the federal and State agencies
                                  that are in charge of monitoring and controlling air pollutants and the policies that
                                  impact management of air quality in the SCAB.
                                  State and federal agencies such as the CARB and the US Environmental Protection
                                  Agency (EPA) establish emission standards for mobile and stationary sources.
                                  Mobile sources of air pollution include on-road vehicles such as cars, trucks, and
                                  buses (which comprise more than half of all air pollution in the SCAB) and off-
                                  road equipment such as airplanes, trains, agricultural, and construction equipment.
                                  Stationary sources of air pollution are non-moving sources and include power
                                  plants, manufacturing and industrial facilities, chemical plants, and oil refineries.
                                  Stationary sources are generally regulated through the permitting process as imple-
                                  mented by the local air district.
                                  1. Federal Regulations
                                  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set primary and secondary Ambient Air
                                  Quality Standards (AAQS) for pollutants harmful to public health and the envi-
                                  ronment. AAQS represent the maximum levels of background pollution consi-
                                  dered safe, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health and wel-
                                  fare. Primary AAQS are intended to provide an adequate margin of safety to pro-
                                  tect public health, including sensitive groups such as children, senior citizens, and
                                  people with breathing difficulties. Secondary standards are designed to protect
                                  public welfare, including protection from air pollution impacts such as decreased
                                  visibility, and damage to crops and buildings.

                                                                                             G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                                  A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
EPA has designated six pollutants of primary concern, known as ―criteria pollu-
tants:‖ ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM10). The current federal AAQS for
these pollutants, along with those for California, are presented in Table AQ-1.
That portion of SCAB in which Chino is located was designated a ―Severe 17‖
non-attainment area for the eight-hour ozone standard in 2004. The period of
attainment for the eight-hour ozone standard is no more than 17 years from the
effective date of designation, which means SCAB must demonstrate attainment of
the eight-hour ozone standard by June 15, 2021.
That portion of the SCAB containing the project area is designated a non-
attainment area for the PM10 standard and was reclassified from a moderate to se-
rious non-attainment area on February 8, 1993. The area is also a non-attainment
area for the State PM10 standard.
                                                                                                              AQ-3

b California standards for ozone, carbon monoxide (except Lake Tahoe), sulfur dioxide (1 and 24 hour), nitrogen dioxide, suspended particulate matter—PM , PM , and visibility reducing particles are values
                                                                                                                                                                 10   2.5
that are not to be exceeded. All others are not to be equaled or exceeded. California ambient air quality standards are listed in the Table of Standards in Section 70200 of Title 17 of the California Code of
Regulations.
c National standards (other than ozone, particulate matter, and those based on annual averages or annual arithmetic mean) are not to be exceeded more than once a year. The ozone standard is attained when
the fourth highest eight-hour concentration in a year, averaged over three years, is equal to or less than the standard. For PM10, the 24-hour standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar
year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 µg/m3 is equal to or less than one. For PM2.5, the 24-hour standard is attained when 98 percent of the daily concentrations, averaged over three years, are
equal to or less than the standard. Contact U.S. EPA for further clarification and current federal policies.
d Concentration expressed first in units in which it was promulgated. Equivalent units given in parentheses are based upon a reference temperature of 25º C and a reference pressure of 760 torr. Most mea-
surements of air quality are to be corrected to a reference temperature of 25º C and a reference pressure of 760 torr; ppm in this table refers to ppm by volume, or micromoles of pollutant per mole of gas.
e Any equivalent procedure which can be shown to the satisfaction of the ARB to give equivalent results at or near the level of the air quality standard may be used.
f National Primary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health.
g National Secondary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant..
h Reference method as described by the EPA. An ―equivalent method‖ of measurement may be used but must have a ―consistent relationship to the reference method‖ and must be approved by the EPA.
i The ARB has identified lead and vinyl chloride as ―toxic air contaminants‖ with no threshold level of exposure for adverse health effects determined. These actions allow for the implementation of control
measures at levels below the ambient concentrations specified for these pollutants.
j National lead standard, rolling 3-month average: final rule signed October 15, 2008.
                                                                                                         AQ-5

                                  This portion of SCAB has also been designated a non-attainment area for the PM2.5
                                  standard, effective April 5, 2005. Attainment of the PM2.5 standards must be
                                  achieved 10 years after the final designation date; consequently, the SCAB must
                                  demonstrate attainment by April 5, 2015.
                                  In 2008, the EPA revised the primary standard for lead from 1.5 micrograms per
                                  cubic meter (µg/m3) to 0.15 µg/m3 over a rolling three-month period. The 1.5
                                  µg/m3 standard will be retained until one year after designations are made for the
                                  new standard, except in current non-attainment areas. States are required to make
                                  recommendations for areas to be designated attainment, non-attainment, or unclas-
                                  sifiable for the new standard by October 2009. The SCAB is in attainment of the
                                  1.5 µg/m3 lead NAAQS.
                                  2. State Regulations
                                  a. California Clean Air Act
                                  The EPA permits states to develop stricter standards for criteria pollutants than the
                                  national standards. The State of California generally has set more stringent limits
                                  on the six criteria pollutants. The State has also designated ambient air quality
                                  standards for four additional air pollutants: visibility-reducing particles, sulfates,
                                  hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride. The California Clean Air Act (CCAA) re-
                                  quires that districts implement regulations to reduce mobile source emissions of
                                  these pollutants through the adoption and enforcement of transportation control
                                  measures. The CCAA requires that a district must:
                                        Demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the air quality program;
                                        Reduce non-attainment pollutants at a rate of five percent per year or include
                                        all feasible measures and an expeditious adoption schedule;
                                        Reduce population exposure to severe non-attainment pollutants according to
                                        a prescribed schedule;
                                        Include any other feasible controls that can be implemented or for which im-
                                        plementation can begin within ten years of adoption of the most recent air
                                        quality plan; and
                                        Rank control measures by cost-effectiveness.
                                  The California standards for ambient air quality are presented with the federal stan-
                                  dards above in Table AQ-1.

b. The California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted in 1970 to inform
governmental decision makers about potential environmental impacts of a project,
discuss ways to reduce adverse impacts and evaluate alternatives to a project.
c. State Implementation Plan
A State Implementation Plan (SIP) is a collection of documents that set forth the
State’s strategies for achieving the air quality standards. The Air Quality Manage-
ment District (AQMD) is responsible for preparing and implementing the portion
of the SIP applicable to SCAB. The AQMD adopts rules, regulations, and pro-
grams to attain State and federal air quality standards and appropriates money (in-
cluding permit fees) to achieve these objectives.
d. Toxic Air Contaminants
The public’s exposure to toxic air contaminants (TACs) is a significant public
health issue in California. The California Legislature in 1983 enacted a program to
identify the health effects of TACs, to reduce exposure to these contaminants, and
to protect the public health (AB 1807: Health and Safety Code Sections 39650–
39674). The Legislature established a two-step process to address the potential
health effects from TACs: the risk assessment (or identification) phase and risk
management (or control) phase.
Diesel-exhaust particulate matter (DPM) emissions were established as a TAC in
1998. Since the designation of DPM as a TAC, the CARB has worked on develop-
ing strategies and regulations aimed at reducing the risk from DPM. The CARB
has set a target goal of reducing the cancer risk statewide arising from exposure to
DPM 75 percent below 2000 levels by 2010 and 85 percent by 2020. The CARB
administers several State programs and strategies to reduce DPM.
e. Children’s Environmental Health Protection Act
The Children’s Environmental Health Protection Act established specific require-
ments to determine if children are adequately protected from the harmful effects of
air pollution. The Act requires the CARB and the Office of Environmental Health
Hazard Assessment to review all health-based California AAQS to determine if
public health, particularly the health of infants and children, is adequately protected.
It also requires a review of the air monitoring network to determine if it accurately
measures the amount of pollutants in the air. Furthermore, the State’s list of TACs
must be reviewed, and Air Toxic Control Measures must be implemented, in order
to reduce exposure to TACs that cause children to be especially susceptible to ill-
ness.

                                  California is divided into 15 regional air basins and 35 air pollution districts for the
                                  purpose of managing air resources at the regional level. The South Coast AQMD
                                  is the agency that regulates air quality in the SCAB, in which Chino is located.
                                  AQMD prepares an air quality management plan (AQMP) every three years; each
                                  iteration of the plan is an update of the previous plan and has a 20-year horizon.
                                  The Final 2007 Air Quality Management Plan was prepared by AQMD, the Cali-
                                  fornia Air Resources Board (CARB), and the Southern California Association of
                                  Governments (SCAG) and was adopted in June 2007. The AQMP meets federal
                                  and State Clean Air Act planning requirements for all areas under the jurisdiction of
                                  the AQMD, including San Bernardino County.
                                  The AQMP is intended to provide for continued progress toward cleaner air and to
                                  comply with federal and State requirements. The plan includes a comprehensive
                                  strategy aimed at controlling pollution from all sources, including stationary
                                  sources, on-road and off-road mobile sources, and area sources.

                                  a. Healthy Chino Coalition
                                  The California Healthy Cities and Communities (CHCC) network began in 1988 to
                                  promote clean, safe, and healthy places to live. The Chino City Council in 2004
                                  passed a resolution endorsing the Healthy Cities concept and formal participation
                                  in CHCC. Focus areas include:
                                       Creating safe, walkable neighborhoods.
                                       Encouraging fitness by developing a Youth Fun Club.
                                       Providing health and human services by reducing barriers to the City’s mental
                                       health services.
                                       Supporting a healthcare center for low-income families.
                                       Promoting nutrition with healthier alternatives in the school lunch program.

C. Existing Air Quality Conditions
Air quality in a particular location is a function of the kinds and amounts of pollu-
tants being emitted into the air locally and throughout the basin, and the dispersal
rates of pollutants within the region. The major factors affecting pollutant disper-
sion are wind speed and direction, the vertical dispersion of pollutants (which is
affected by inversions), and the local topography.
1. Criteria Pollutants
As of 2008, AQMD operates 32 air-quality monitoring stations throughout the
SCAB, which record criteria pollutant concentrations and meteorological informa-
tion continuously. An additional monitoring station within the SCAB is operated
by the CARB. The Ontario–Francis Street monitoring station, located in the
northern portion of Chino; the Pomona monitoring station, located approximately
4.5 miles northwest of the northern Chino City boundary; the Upland monitoring
station, located approximately 5 miles northeast of the City’s northern boundary;
and the Norco-Norconian monitoring station, located approximately 2.5 miles east
of the City’s eastern boundary are the nearest stations to the project area, as shown
in Figure AQ-1. The Upland station monitors ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitro-
gen dioxide; the Pomona station monitors ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen
dioxide; the Ontario-Francis Street station monitors PM 10 and PM2.5; and the Nor-
co-Norconian monitors PM10.
Table AQ-2 summarizes the number of days per year during which State and feder-
al standards for criteria pollutants were exceeded in the SCAB overall during the
years 2003 to 2007.
Below is a summary by criteria pollutant of the current air quality conditions in the
SCAB and City of Chino.
a. Ozone
Ozone is the primary air pollution problem in the SCAB. Because sunlight plays
such an important role in its formation, ozone pollution or smog is mainly a con-
cern during the daytime in summer months. Nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons
(reactive organic gases) are known as the chief ―precursors‖ of ozone. These com-
pounds react in the presence of sunlight to produce ozone.
The SCAB is currently designated a federal and State non-attainment area for
ozone. As shown in Table AQ-2, the basin is an extreme federal and State non-
attainment area for the 1-hour average and a severe federal non-attainment area for
                                                                                                                  AQ-9

                                  the 8-hour average. Ozone concentration measurements recorded in the SCAB
                                  dating back to the late 1970s show a distinctive downward trend.
                                  The SCAB has been classified as a transport contributor to downwind air basins.
                                  The Mojave Desert Air Basin, the Salton Sea Air Basin, the San Diego Air Basin
                                  and the South Central Coast Air Basin are all affected by ozone concentrations
                                  from the SCAB.

                                                                                     A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
Figures AQ-2 and AQ-3 show plots of the measured ozone exceedances for the
year 2005 in the SCAB relative to the revoked federal one-hour standard and the
2005 federal eight-hour standard, respectively. In 2008 the federal eight-hour stan-
dard was strengthened to 0.075 ppm. As seen from these plots, the number of
days for which the ozone standards were exceeded generally increases with distance
from the coast. In the Chino area, the one-hour standard was generally exceeded
on ten or fewer days, and the eight-hour standard was exceeded on 20 or fewer
days.
Although State and federal standards are being exceeded, ozone in the SCAB has
improved substantially over the past three decades. In 1984, the State one-hour
ozone standard was exceeded 209 days, and the national one-hour ozone standard
was exceeded 175 days in the SCAB. In 2007, the State 1-hour ozone standard was
exceeded on 96 days, and the revoked national one-hour ozone standard would
have been exceeded on 18 days in the SCAB, as shown in Table AQ-2. As ozone
levels in the SCAB decline, the transport impact to downwind air basins will also
decline.
b. Carbon Monoxide
The SCAB is classified as a State and federal attainment area for carbon monoxide,
as shown in Table AQ-2. From 2003 to 2007, SCAB had zero days exceeding the
8-hour federal and State CO standards.
Small-scale, localized concentrations of carbon monoxide above the State and na-
tional standards have the potential to occur at intersections with stagnation points
such as those that occur on major highways, and heavily traveled and congested
roadways. Localized high concentrations of CO are referred to as ―CO hot spots,‖
and are a concern at congested intersections when automobile engines burn fuel
less efficiently and their exhaust contains more CO.
c. PM10
Particulate matter is a complex mixture of very tiny solid or liquid particles com-
posed of chemicals, soot, and dust. Ten microns is about one-seventh the diameter
of a human hair.            Sources of PM10 emissions in the SCAB consist

mainly of urban activities, dust suspended by vehicle traffic, and secondary aerosols
formed by reactions in the atmosphere. In general, particulate concentrations near
residential sources are typically greater during the coldest months of the year, when
more fireplaces are in use and when meteorological conditions such as inversions
prevent the dispersion of directly emitted contaminants.
Particles classified under the PM10 category are mainly emitted directly from activi-
ties that disturb the soil including travel on roads and construction, mining, or agri-
cultural operations. Other sources include windblown dust and the burning of
fuels such as gasoline, oil, diesel, or wood. For several reasons related to the area’s
dry climate and coastal location, the SCAB has special difficulty in developing ade-
quate tactics to meet present State particulate standards. While emission controls
for ozone also reduce levels of PM10, additional controls aimed specifically at PM10
will be required to reduce the high levels.
Currently, the SCAB is a State and federal non-attainment area for PM10. Table
AQ-2 shows that the 24-hour State PM10 standard was exceeded in the SCAB in
2003 through 2007. The less stringent 24-hour federal PM10 standard was exceeded
in the SCAB in 2003 and 2007.
Figure AQ-4 shows a plot of the measured annual average concentration of PM 10
for the year 2005 in the SCAB. The federal annual PM10 standard was revoked in
2006. As seen from this plot, maximum average annual PM10 concentrations tend
to occur east of the City of Chino. In and around Chino, the average annual PM10
concentrations exceeded State standards and ranged from approximately 30 g/m3
to 50 g/m3.
d. PM2.5
Airborne, inhalable particles with aerodynamic diameters of 2.5 microns or less
(PM2.5) have been recognized as an air quality concern requiring regular monitoring.
As noted previously, the Ontario–Francis Street monitoring station is the only sta-
tion      in    the     project      vicinity   that    monitors     PM2.5.         As

                                  in the SCAB in 2005. As shown in this plot, maximum average annual PM2.5 con-
                                  centrations tend to occur east of the City of Chino. However, average annual con-
                                  centrations of PM2.5 throughout the City were well in excess of the federal standard
                                  of 15 g/m3. At the Ontario–Francis Street monitoring station, the average annual
                                  PM2.5 concentration ranged between 18 and 24 g/m3 over the period from 2003

                                  the latest pollutant trends suggest that these standards will not be exceeded in the

insufficient monitoring data.
2. Sources
Emissions come from either stationary or mobile sources. Stationary sources are
generally categorized as either point sources or area sources. Point sources are
large emitters at an identified location such as power plants and manufacturing
facilities. Area sources consist of small emissions in a general area such as water
heaters and architectural coatings. Mobile sources are categorized as either on-road
or off-road. On-road mobile sources are vehicles on freeways and roadways. Off-
road sources include trains, ships, construction equipment, and other emitters that
operate off freeways and roadways. Table AQ-3 summarizes emissions to the
SCAB in 2002, the most recent year for which a complete inventory is available.

See the Open Space and Conservation Element for goals, objectives, policies, and
actions related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Also see the
Transportation Element for additional goals, objectives, policies, and actions re-
lated to reducing emissions associated with vehicle travel.
Goal AQ-1           Preserve and improve air quality in Chino and the
                    region.
     Objective AQ-1.1           Improve air quality through land use and
     transportation planning decisions.
     Policies
        P1.      The City shall promote land use patterns that reduce the number
                 and length of motor vehicle trips.
        P2.      Where development opportunities near shopping areas and transit
                 corridors exist, the City shall prioritize higher-density residential
                 development.
        P3.      The City shall encourage employment areas to include a mix of re-
                 tail support services.
        P4.      Design new intersections to function in a manner that reduces air
                 pollutant emissions from stop and start and idling traffic condi-

4 LAND USE ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the future physical development
  of the City of Chino and to preserve, protect, and enhance Chino’s current quality
  of life.
  As required by California Government Code Section 65302(a) and Public Re-
  sources Code Section 2762(a), the Land Use Element of the General Plan addresses
  the following:
    i Distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land for housing, business, in-
        dustry, open space, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic
        beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste dispos-
        al facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land.
    i Standards of population density and building intensity for the land use desig-
        nations.
  The Land Use Element sets forth specific goals, objectives, policies, and actions to
  guide land use in Chino. The General Plan Land Use Map, which is also part of
  this element, graphically represents the City’s vision for the future development of
  the City and the Sphere of Influence (SOI), the area that the City expects to grow
  into in the future.
  This Element is divided into eight sections.
    i Background. Describes existing land uses in Chino.
    i Future Growth Vision. Discusses the long-term vision for Chino’s future.
    i Sphere of Influence and Annexation. Describes the Planning Area and re-
        views policies related to the SOI and annexation.
    i Land Use Designations. Describes land use designations and includes a land
        use designation map.
    i Measure M and the Focused Growth Plan. Describes the process for im-
        plementing alternative land use designations, consistent with the Focused
        Growth Map, through a voter initiative.
    i Airport Land Use Compatibility. Discusses the relationship between the
        General Plan land uses and the Chino Airport.
    i Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Provides guidance to the City re-
        lated to land use decisions.
                                                                                        LU-1

                                      Land Use Element.
                                A. Background
                                Since the late 19th century, the City of Chino has experienced numerous transfor-
                                mations in its economy, population, and land use pattern. These periods of change
                                tell a story about why Chino looks the way it does today.
                                When Richard Gird founded the City of Chino in 1887, he organized the City
                                around a park, railroad depot, and hotel. The early development was soon fol-
                                lowed by the sugar beet factory to the south of the City. The City was connected
                                to Ontario with Gird’s Narrow Gauge Railway and to Los Angeles with the South-
                                ern Pacific Railway. The Butterfield stage route followed Chino Creek running
                                southeast to northwest along the edge of the City and the southern half of the City
                                continued to be dominated by the early ranchos.
                                Between 1910 and 1940, the City gained its first paved roads and began to develop
                                the larger street network that exists today. With increased population came more
                                civic organizations and churches. Orchards developed and a cannery was built to
                                pack their fruits. In the southern portion of the City, the California Institution for
                                Men (CIM) was built, creating new jobs in the community.
                                Between 1940 and 1960, the City’s agricultural focus turned to dairies, and the Cal
                                Aero Academy developed to train pilots during World War II. The development
                                of the Corona Expressway (State Route 71) and Riverside Freeway (State Route 91)
                                connected the City to the rest of Southern California’s growing highway network.
                                The following two decades were a period of explosive population growth in Chino.
                                New land uses focused on housing, turning the community into more of a bed-
                                room community for commuters. This commuter growth was facilitated by the
                                opening of State Route 60, which provided another connection between the Inland
                                Empire and the Los Angeles basin to the west.
                                In the 1980s and beyond, the land use focus in the City largely shifted away from
                                agriculture, and towards industrial and warehouse/distribution uses.
                                Industrial and warehouse uses are most common in the southern portions of the
                                City and take advantage of the City’s location along major trucking routes and near
LU-2

                                                                                            C I T Y   O F   C H I N O
                                                                                              G E N E R A L   P L A N
                                                                                      L A N D   U S E   E L E M E N T
rail lines and the Ontario Airport. The City’s primary commercial areas are located
along major transportation routes, including State Route 71, Central Avenue, River-
side Drive, and Philadelphia Street. As the City has developed these additional land
uses, it has significantly reduced the land area devoted to agricultural production,
although there are still some scattered agricultural uses. The CIM, another long-
time fixture in Chino, has constituted much of the less-developed area of land with-
in the City in recent years, but that status is changing with the development of Col-
lege Park.
B. Future Growth Vision
As this General Plan was developed, a long-term vision for Chino’s future was es-
tablished. This vision is shown in the Future Growth Vision diagram, included
here as Figure LU-1.
The Future Growth Vision indicates places in the City of Chino where more in-
tense development could be consistent with the City’s overall vision. These are
places with healthy transportation options, a small-town feel, and provide for resi-
dents’ daily needs. The vision indicates that change could take place in the follow-
ing areas:
                                                                                                               LU-3

     transition to focus on multi-family housing with a limited amount of retail and
     office development.
  i Central and Walnut Area. Future change in this area may include a transi-
     tion to mixed-use development, with a focus on providing neighborhood-
     serving retail.
  i North Central Avenue Corridor. Future change in this area may feature a
     transition to mixed-use development, with a focus on residential uses on the
     portion of the corridor further to the north of the freeway.
  i Riverside Drive East Corridor. Future change in this area may include a
     transition to focus on multi-family housing with a limited amount of retail and
     office development.
  i Euclid Avenue Corridor. Future change in this area may feature a transition
     to mixed-use development, with a focus on retail uses and some higher-
     intensity residential development. When change is considered here, it should
     take into account planned development in Ontario’s New Model Colony and
     Caltrans’ plans for the roadway.
  i Chino Avenue Corridor. Future change in this area may include a transition
     to higher-intensity, mixed-use development than is considered for other areas.
     The focus may be on transit-oriented development around the Chino Transit
     Center, potential connections to regional commuter rail, and additional civic
     uses such as a large performance space.
This future growth vision does not constitute City policy at this time. Instead, the
City expects that this diagram could be a starting point for the next comprehensive
update to the General Plan, which should occur before 2025. Moreover, individual
projects consistent with the Focused Growth Plan described in Section E of this
Element will help the City to move towards this Future Growth Vision.
C. Sphere of Influence and Annexation
The Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000
(CKHA) establishes procedures by which local governments can change their or-
ganization, including annexation of land into the city limits. Annexations are regu-
lated by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of each county. Un-
                                                                                                              LU-5

C I T Y   O F   C H I N O
G E N E R A L   P L A N
L A N D   U S E   E L E M E N T
                                der CKHA, each LAFCO’s primary responsibilities are to adopt SOIs for local
                                agencies and to act on local agency boundary changes. LAFCOs also have broad
                                statutory responsibility to facilitate planned, orderly, efficient patterns of urban
                                development, preserve agricultural lands, and discourage urban sprawl.
                                LAFCOs also have responsibilities for approval and comment that are closely relat-
                                ed to the General Plan process. In making decisions on annexations, LAFCOs
                                must review relevant local general plan policies and development proposals to en-
                                sure that objectives for efficient development are being achieved.
                                The SOI represents the area that the City of Chino views as its ultimate boundary.
                                Therefore, the City has an interest in development within the SOI, even though
                                current land use authority continues to be under the purview of San Bernardino
                                County. This interest includes ensuring that development either ties into Chino’s
                                infrastructure, or is able to tie in at a future date. The City has generally only an-
                                nexed properties within the SOI at the request of residents and is expected to con-
                                tinue with that approach in the future.
                                Current City policy requires owners of property located within Chino’s SOI who
                                wish to obtain sanitary sewer services from the City to submit a request that de-
                                scribes how it conforms with the City’s land use plan and where sewer facility con-
                                struction is required. This policy was established under Resolution Number 2006-
                                028. Property owners requesting sewer service for parcels contiguous to the City
                                boundary may be required to annex to Chino. If, at the time of the request, annex-
                                ation is determined by the City to be infeasible, such property owners must file an
                                irrevocable agreement to annex to the City. Property owners requesting sewer ser-
                                vice for parcels that are not adjacent to city boundaries must file and execute an
                                irrevocable agreement to annex to Chino when sufficient parcels can be assembled
                                to qualify for annexation in accordance with LAFCO policy.
                                The development of property requesting sewer service must be reviewed and ap-
                                proved by the City prior to receiving the sewer service connection permit, as di-
                                rected by Chino Municipal Code Section 13.12.091. This ordinance will continue
                                to be enforced under the General Plan, as described in Goal LU-3, below, calling
                                for a clear transition for properties in the SOI.

D. Land Use Designations
The General Plan Land Use Map, shown in Figure LU-2, illustrates the allowed
types of land uses throughout Chino. Table LU-1 presents acreages of each land
use designation. Land use designations represent the intended future use of each
parcel of land within the City limits and the SOI. Land use designations are devel-
oped to provide both a vision of the future organization of uses within Chino and a
flexible structure to allow for changes in economic conditions, environmental con-
ditions, and community visions.
Chino has five specific plans and two master plans, which are incorporated by ref-
erence into this General Plan: the Majestic Spectrum, East Chino, Eucalyptus Busi-
ness Park, College Park, and The Preserve Specific Plans, as well as the Downtown
Civic Center Master Plan and Central Avenue Specific Plan. These Specific Plans
provide concrete design and implementation measures to carry out the goals and
objectives of the General Plan. However, it is one of the goals of this General Plan
to phase out the Majestic Spectrum, East Chino, and Eucalyptus Business Park
Specific Plans over time, as well as the Downtown Civic Center Master Plan, and
Central Avenue Specific Plan. The Preserve and College Park Specific Plans will
remain throughout the life of the General Plan. In addition to the city-wide land
use designations, there are additional land use designations that apply to the College
Park or The Preserve Specific Plan areas are described below.

Note: du/ac= dwelling units per acre.
For each land use designation, the uses allowed and the standards of density or
intensity are specified. Densities and intensities in all cases are based on adjusted
gross acres. The adjusted gross acreage of a lot excludes all land within the ultimate
right-of-way for Expressways, Major Arterials, Primary Arterials, Secondary Arteri-
als, and Collector streets, as shown in the Transportation Element. The number of
residential units permitted for a parcel is determined by multiplying the residential
density factor by the adjusted gross acres of the parcel. For non-residential uses,
including commercial, office, and industrial uses, intensity is expressed as an aver-
age Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is calculated as the total square footage of build-
ings on a site, divided by the total square footage underlying the site. The city-wide
land use designations are described below, followed by the land use designations
for the Specific Plans.
1. Residential Land Use Designations
The residential designations include seven distinct designations of varying density.
They permit certain non-residential uses including places of worship, day care cen-
ters, schools, libraries, and recreational facilities.
a. RD1
This is a large-lot rural residential designation allowing 1 dwelling unit per adjusted
gross acre (1.25 with provision of affordable housing). The purpose of this land
use designation is to provide for very large lot residential development in a rural
environment. These areas should be typified by rural uses, including horse-keeping
and other small-scale agricultural uses consistent with residential areas.
b. RD2
This is large-lot residential compatible with semi-rural development allowing 1 to 2
dwelling units per adjusted gross acre (2.5 with provision of affordable housing).
This land use designation is to provide large lot residential development in a non-
                                                                                                                 LU-9

                                urbanized environment. These areas should either create or maintain areas
                                currently typified by large lot development and dominated by semi-rural uses.
                                c. RD4.5
                                This is a single-family suburban designation, expected to be primarily detached
                                units. It allows 3 to 4.5 dwelling units per adjusted gross acre (6 with provision of
                                affordable housing). The purpose of this land use designation is to preserve
                                existing single-family suburban residential neighborhoods.
                                d. RD8
                                This designation allows 4.5 to 8 dwelling units per adjusted gross acre (10 with
                                provision of affordable housing). This classification is intended for new and
                                existing single-family neighborhoods with slightly higher densities.             This
                                designation is mainly located in the older existing neighborhoods in Chino and in
                                transition zones between lower-density residential uses and higher-density
                                commercial, industrial, and multi-family residential land uses.

housing over small-scale retail. Maximum allowed residential density is 20 dwelling
units per adjusted acre and the FAR is 1.25.

                                commercial designations are diverse and provide locations for an array of local- and
                                regional-serving commercial establishments in Chino.

                                radius of approximately 1 mile. Typical uses include supermarkets, drug stores and
                                a variety of smaller shops. These neighborhood amenities should be provided
                                throughout the City, generally on lots no greater than 5 acres. The FAR is 0.3.
                                d. Office Commercial
                                While office uses are allowed in all commercial designations, the office commercial
                                designation applies to areas to be used predominantly for offices. The FAR is 1.0.
                                4. Industrial Land Use Designations
                                Chino has four categories of industrial land uses to plan for the large industrial
                                economy in the City.
                                a. General Industrial
                                This designation is for heavy industrial or manufacturing uses, many of which may
                                generate heavy traffic, noises, or odors. There is a 1-acre minimum lot size and

                                allowed residential density. This section provides general background on Measure
                                M, and explains how some parcels might be developed with alternative uses under
                                this General Plan after a Measure M vote.
                                1. Measure M Background
                                In 1988 the citizens of Chino adopted Measure M as part of the General Plan and
                                municipal code. Its purpose is to limit the expansion of multiple family housing
                                developments by preventing the rezoning of non-residential land to residential use.
                                Measure M prevents the change of any land zoned non-residential to residential use
                                and the rezoning of any land zoned residential for higher density residential use.
                                Any such changes must be made through another ballot initiative. The ordinance
                                applies to the zoning map as it was on November 8, 1988. The following text con-
                                stitutes the General Plan policies enacted by the Measure M ordinance:
                                  i Section 1: To insure the quality of the residential environment and the quality
                                     of life in the City of Chino, the People of the City of Chino hereby declare
                                     their intent to establish maximum densities for residential lands and to prevent
                                     the increase of land designated for residential uses within the City of Chino.
                                  i Section 2: Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Plan, the max-
                                     imum density of any land designated for residential use within the City of Chi-
                                     no shall not exceed the density for such land established by the Zoning Map
                                     and the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Chino or any development agree-
                                     ments in effect on November 8, 1988, except for Senior Housing Projects.
                                     However, the City Council of the City of Chino may reduce the density of any
                                     land designated for a residential use.
                                  i Section 3: Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Plan, any land
                                     designated for a non-residential use within the City of Chino shall not be con-
                                     verted to a residential use, except for school sites designated in the General
                                     Plan or a specific plan and development agreements approved by the Chino
                                     City Council prior to November 8, 1988. However, the City Council of the
                                     City of Chino may convert any land designated for a residential use to any oth-
                                     er non-residential use and may also change uses among lands designated for
                                     non-residential uses.
                                  i Section 4: The City of Chino has set no maximum population limits. Growth
                                     shall be in a phased and orderly manner consistent with the availability of ade-

2. The Focused Growth Plan
The Focused Growth Plan, shown in Figure LU-3, indicates parcels for which an
alternative land use designation is foreseen under this General Plan in the event of
a successful Measure M vote.
The land use designations shown in Figure LU-3 have been cleared programmati-
cally under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) through this Gen-
eral Plan’s Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and can therefore be implemented
upon passage of a voter initiative. The land use designations shown in Figure LU-3
allow more intense residential development than the designations on the Land Use
Map in Figure LU-2. In some cases the designations are purely residential, while in
others they call for mixed-use. The places where more intense development is
called for in the Focused Growth Plan support smart growth principles, including
laying the groundwork for a more walkable City. They also target areas of the City
where limited change has taken place in recent decades and where a more intense
designation may help spur revitalization.
The majority of the land use designation changes in the Focused Growth Plan are
contained in three portions of the city. These three areas have been studied in de-
tail during the General Plan Update process in the Special Study Areas Report,
which is included as Appendix A of the General Plan. The Special Study Areas
Report contains additional land use and design guidelines for these areas that may
be considered as a basis for future development in these areas.

Goal LU-2 and its associated objectives, policies, and actions include policy lan-
guage related to these parcels. The policy language under Goal LU-2 focuses on
modifications to the Land Use Map that are consistent with the Focused Growth
Plan.
The following is an outline of the process that property-owners must undertake to
develop one or more parcels consistent with the Focused Growth Plan.
  i Verify that proposed designations for the parcel(s) are consistent with the Fo-
     cused Growth Plan.
  i Verify that the project complies with any appropriate Focused Growth Plan
     mitigation measures in the EIR.
  i Conduct any necessary additional environmental review. This review will only
     be necessary if conditions change or designations other than those in the Fo-
     cused Growth Plan are proposed.
  i Request that the Planning Commission review the proposed project for con-
     sistency with the General Plan and Focused Growth Plan.
  i Apply for a General Plan Amendment for the parcel or parcels.
  i Request that City staff prepare the General Plan Amendment for review by the
     City Council.
  i Request City Council consideration of placement of the Measure M vote on
     the ballot.
  i If the vote passes, the City Council will certify the results of the election and
     approve the General Plan Amendment and corresponding Zone Change.
F. Airport Land Use Compatibility
The Chino Airport and surrounding areas are subject to the Chino Airport Com-
prehensive Land Use Plan (CACLUP). The CACLUP outlines Airport Safety
Zones as shown in Figure LU-4, which have particular land use restrictions associ-
ated with them. California Government Code Section 65302.3(a) requires that the
Land Use Element be consistent with the CACLUP, unless the City makes certain
overriding findings.
                                                                                                             LU-23

L A N D   U S E   E L E M E N T
                                This General Plan Land Use Element is consistent with the CACLUP. All of the
                                area in Safety Zone 1, which restricts residential and industrial development, is des-
                                ignated in this Land Use Element for public uses and it is also under the control of
                                the Chino Airport. Safety Zone 2 restricts uses that would result in more than 50
                                persons per assembly area or 25 persons per building being present. This is con-
                                sistent with the designation in this Element for Urban Reserve, General Industrial,
                                Light Industrial, Agriculture, and Recreation/Open Space. The Urban Reserve
                                consists of the southern portion of the CIM property, which is used for farming.
                                Safety Zone 3 places no restrictions on residential or other uses, so the uses de-
                                scribed in this Element are consistent with the requirements for this area.
                                The Safety Element also addresses the Chino Airport with goals, objectives, poli-
                                cies, and actions related to airport compatibility.
                                G. Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions
                                Policy statements in this section that reference mixed-use development apply only
                                in College Park, The Preserve, and the SOI, where mixed use land use designations
                                are found on the land use map included in this Element as Figure LU-2. However,
                                if a Measure M vote results in approval of mixed-use development consistent with
                                the Focused Growth Plan, mixed use-related policies would apply.
                                In response to the existing conditions outlined in the preceding sections, the fol-
                                lowing goals, objectives, policies, and actions provide a framework for land use
                                decisions that move the City towards its vision of a healthy, walkable community
                                with amenities to serve residents in the newer and more established areas of Chino.

                                   Objective LU-1.1           Provide a variety of housing types that meet
                                   the housing needs of residents of all income levels in Chino.
                                   Policies
                                     P1.      Chino residential neighborhoods should contain a mix of housing
                                              types including single-family homes on a range of lot sizes; town-
                                              homes; duplexes, triplexes and four-plexes; and apartments.
                                     P2.      Wherever feasible, affordable housing shall be integrated into both
                                              new and established neighborhoods.
                                     P3.      The City shall allow and encourage non-traditional housing types
                                              that can provide affordable housing, such as accessory dwelling
                                              units.
                                     P4.      The City shall encourage the development of senior housing and
                                              assisted living facilities, especially near transit, recreational facilities,
                                              medical centers and hospitals, neighborhoods well-served by pe-
                                              destrian facilities, and access to healthy food.
                                   Actions
                                     A1.      Develop a program to work with large employers developing new
                                              projects in Chino to ensure local housing opportunities for their
                                              employees.
                                     A2.      Conduct a review of existing City policies to identify barriers to the
                                              development of accessory dwelling units, co-housing, and other
                                              non-traditional housing types. Where necessary, modify policies to
                                              support development of these housing types.

   Policies
     P1.     Neighborhoods should be designed such that all residences are
             within a quarter-mile walk of transit stops and recreational areas,
             and within a half-mile walk of daily retail needs.
     P2.     The City shall encourage the development of complementary land
             uses not already present in residential neighborhoods, such as gro-
             cery stores, basic commercial services, parks and recreational fields,
             and schools.
   Objective LU-1.3          Encourage commercial development that
   will support and enhance vibrant commercial areas and serve ex-
   isting neighborhoods.
   Policies
     P1.     The City shall encourage a combination of daily and specialty retail,
             office, entertainment, and other commercial uses that serve daily
             and occasional needs in commercial areas of Chino.
     P2.     The City shall prohibit strip commercial development, whether re-
             tail, office, or service commercial, to avoid the traffic congestion,
             inaccessibility, and poor aesthetic character associated with such
             development. Strip commercial development is commercial de-
             velopment, usually one lot deep, that fronts on an arterial street,
             and is designed primarily for automobile access and convenience
             of parking.
Goal LU-2       Foster the development of new industrial uses in

                                            performance standards consistent with General Plan policies.
                                     P2.    The City shall prevent encroachment of industrial lands by incom-
                                            patible uses.
                                     P3.    The City shall reserve sufficient space for industry, recognizing in-
                                            dustry's greater land requirements due to new methods of opera-

                                     P4.    The City shall evaluate proposed industrial development in terms
                                            of its impact on local employment.
                                     P5.    New industrial development shall be designed to be adaptable to
                                            both warehousing and manufacturing uses through inclusion of the
                                            following:
                                            i Upgraded interior lighting;
                                            i Foil-backed insulation on ceilings;
                                            i Skylights to provide natural light;

Objective LU-3.1         Encourage development as shown in the
Focused Growth Plan, which implements the Focused Growth
Vision.
Policies
  P1.    Property owners who wish to develop using the land use designa-
         tions shown in the Focused Growth Plan shall follow the process
         as described in Section E of this Element. Any other proposed
         land use change shall be subject to the standard General Plan
         Amendment process.
  P2.    As described in Section E of this Element, City staff shall support
         and expedite General Plan and/or Specific Plan Amendments,
         Zone Changes, and development applications to the greatest extent
         possible for projects that are proposed by owners and consistent
         with the Focused Growth Plan designation on the associated par-
         cel or parcels.
  P3.    Development projects using Focused Growth Plan land use desig-
         nations shall be designed to support the use of public transporta-
         tion, including orienting entrances where possible to face the pub-
         lic right-of-way rather than rear parking areas, pedestrian-oriented
         facades, and signage, where appropriate, indicating the locations of
         nearby transit stops.
  P4.    The City shall waive General Plan and/or Specific Plan Amend-
         ment and Zone Change application fees for those projects that are
         consistent with the Focused Growth Plan.
  P5.    Where applicable, the City shall use the infill streamlining provi-
         sions found in Section 21094.5 of the California Environmental
         Quality Act, to streamline environmental review of infill develop-
         ment on parcels with a Focused Growth designation.
  P6.    The City shall be proactive in encouraging development on parcels
         with a Focused Growth designation, including contacting property
         owners, local brokers, and others in the development community
         to ensure they are aware of the Measure M process and potential
         benefits of participating in that process.

                                  A1.   Study the use of graduated-density zoning, which encourages par-
                                        cel assembly by allowing higher densities for larger sites, or other
                                        policy-based mechanisms to encourage the development of pro-
                                        jects on more than one parcel that are consistent with the Focused
                                        Growth Plan.
                                  A2.   Work with the Southern California Association of Governments
                                        (SCAG) when it prepares its Sustainable Communities Strategy
                                        (SCS) to ensure that sites from the Focused Growth Plan are in-
                                        cluded in the SCS.
                                  A3.   Consider revising the Focused Growth Plan if SCAG’s ultimate
                                        SCS map is not consistent with it.
                                  A4.   Develop a Focused Growth Plan zoning overlay district, consider-
                                        ing approaches such as providing reduced minimum parking re-
                                        quirements; expanding the flexibility of the Zoning Code’s general
                                        parking provisions with respect to shared and off-street parking;
                                        increased maximum heights, numbers of stories, and floor area ra-
                                        tio; streamlined permit processing procedures; and expanded flexi-
                                        bility in setbacks for parcels with a Focused Growth designation.
                                        The overlay shall be designed in a manner that maintains the char-
                                        acter of the surrounding neighborhood, and that meets the pur-
                                        pose set out in the Zoning Code for the applicable zoning district.
                                        The provisions in the overlay shall become effective immediately
                                        upon passage of the Measure M vote for such parcels.
                                  A5.   Apply the Focused Growth Plan zoning overlay district to parcels
                                        with Focused Growth designations, identifying the approaches and
                                        opportunities that will help to facilitate infill development on those
                                        parcels.

Objective LU-3.2          Enhance the commercial areas at the inter-
section of Walnut and Central Avenues and incorporate housing
onto those parcels.
Policies
  P1.      The City shall review development applications for properties at
           the intersection of Walnut and Central to ensure they include a
           combination of housing, retail and office uses, with a focus on de-
           velopment of multi-family housing.
  P2.      New residential uses, whether single- or mixed-use, shall use state-
           of-the-art design, technologies and siting techniques to mitigate the
           effects of living near a high-traffic road on residents of the new
           housing units.
Actions
  A1.      Provide expedited review of projects on the four corners of this in-
           tersection that meet both the land use regulations and the design
           guidance provided for these properties and for mixed-use proper-
           ties in general.
Objective LU-3.3          Develop Riverside Drive with additional
housing as either mixed-use or multi-family homes so that addi-
tional residents provide shoppers for local-serving retail.
Policies
  P1.      The City shall review proposed new development on Riverside
           Drive to ensure that it is designed to provide a more pedestrian-
           oriented environment, with two to three story mixed-use and resi-
           dential buildings, improved street furnishing, and other pedestrian
           amenities.
  P2.      New development on Riverside Drive that is directly adjacent to
           single-family homes should be designed for consistency with those
           homes, by providing a buffer in the rear area of the parcels be-
           tween new buildings and existing homes.

7 TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Transportation Element is to demonstrate how people and
  goods will move through the City. The transportation system should support travel
  within Chino and connect to regional transportation options, reduce the impacts of
  transportation on the region’s environment, and provide a variety of options so
  individuals can choose to travel by car, bicycle, foot, or public transportation. This
  Element balances the need to provide efficient and reliable ways to move people
  and goods by multiple transportation modes and routes. These qualities of the
  transportation system indicate the important link between transportation and pub-
  lic health. They support Chino’s vision of remaining a safe, attractive community
  that provides opportunities for healthy, active lifestyles, with walkable neighbor-
  hoods, vibrant retail districts, and economically strong employment areas. Many of
  the goals, objectives, policies, and actions in this Element were referenced in Chap-
  ter 3, A Healthy City, as they support healthy means of travel, reduced air pollution,
  and strong connections between people in the community.
  Transportation policies are key to meeting Statewide goals for reduction of green-
  house gas (GHG) emissions. Many of the goals, objectives, policies, and actions in
  this Element will help Chino contribute to reduced GHG emissions, primarily
  through reductions in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), shifting toward pedestrian,
  bicycle, and transit travel, and alternative vehicle technologies.
  The Transportation Element is correlated with the Land Use Element. As required
  by Government Code Section 65302(b), this Element contains information on the
  general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, trans-
  portation routes, and terminals. State law calls for a Circulation Element contain-
  ing data and policies related to transportation as well as the circulation of water,
  sewage and storm drainage, and other public utilities. In this General Plan, the
  Transportation Element covers only transportation and other circulation issues are
  presented in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
  This element is divided into four sections.
      Background. Describes the existing transportation network in Chino.
      Roadway Classification Standards. Describes key aspects of Chino’s road-
       ways.
      Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions. Guide the development of the
       City’s transportation system.
      Indicators. This section provides methods to guide the City in evaluating im-
       plementation of the Transportation Element.

                                        A. Background
                                        The existing transportation system in the City of Chino consists of the following
                                        major components.
                                           Roadways. There is an extensive network of roadways in Chino, including
                                             major freeways (e.g. State Route 60, State Route 71), expressways (e.g. Euclid
                                             Avenue), arterials (e.g. Central Avenue), collectors, and local streets.
                                           Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Equestrian Facilities. The bicycle network in-
                                             cludes on-street bicycle lanes, off-street facilities, and multi-use paths. Pedes-
                                             trian facilities are primarily sidewalks, in addition to multi-use trails.
                                           Public Transit. Chino’s public transit system includes local and regional bus-
                                             es. Local bus service provides access and mobility around Chino. Metrolink
                                             service in Ontario and Pomona provides regional transit access as well.
                                           Freight Movement. Chino has a significant number of rail facilities, includ-
                                             ing several active freight rail lines. These rail lines are supplemented with des-
                                             ignated truck facilities that route truck traffic through the City to the regional
                                             roadway network.
                                           Airport. The Chino airport is owned and operated by San Bernardino County
                                             and serves regional aviation needs, as well as providing general aviation relief
                                             to the LA/Ontario and John Wayne airports.
                                        Each of these components are addressed below.
                                        1. Roadways
                                        In Chino, as in most cities of a primarily suburban character, most travel of any
                                        significant distance occurs in motorized vehicles, primarily the automobile. This
                                        section discusses the key components of the vehicular circulation network.
                                        a. Streets and Highways
                                        The roads in Chino range in size from highways to local residential streets and al-
                                        leyways. Each level serves a different function in the system of vehicular move-
                                        ment. Highways and expressways serve regional traffic, arterial and collector
                                        streets serve city-wide travel needs, and local streets serve the needs of individual
                                        neighborhoods.

b. Freeway Interchanges
There are eight freeway interchanges adjacent to the City of Chino. Three of these
interchanges are found on State Route 60 and five are found on State Route 71.
c. Traffic Signals
In total, the City of Chino Traffic Signal Master Plan includes 197 existing or
planned traffic signals within its City boundary, Sphere of Influence, and its sur-
rounding areas. Of the 197 traffic signals, 103 are existing Chino traffic signals, 38
are existing State Department of Transportation (Caltrans) traffic signals, five are
existing County of San Bernardino traffic signals, one borders Chino and Riverside
County, one is in Chino Hills, and two are in Ontario. The remaining 48 planned
traffic signals are spread throughout the City and its surrounding areas, with 41
future Chino traffic signals, four future Chino/Ontario traffic signals, two future
Chino/Riverside County traffic signals, and one future Chino Hills traffic signal.
See Figure TRA-1 for details.
d. Level of Service
Intersection operations are evaluated using a level of service system. Level of ser-
vice is a performance measure used to characterize a single dimension – intersec-
tion seconds of delay – of how well the roadway network is operating for motor-
ized vehicles. These evaluations are based on empirical data collected and reported
in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, which is maintained by the Transportation
Research Board as directed by the “Guidelines for CMP (Congestion Monitoring
Program) Traffic Impact Analysis Reports in San Bernardino County.” The 2000
Highway Capacity Manual utilizes a methodology that assesses the average control
delay for motorized vehicles at intersections. This methodology results in level of
service measurements, indicating the quality of traffic flow and using letter grades
from level of service (LOS) A (best) to F (worst). The level of service ranges for
signalized intersections are provided in Table TRA-1.
Unsignalized intersections are analyzed using a similar methodology, but delay is
calculated only for movements that are controlled by the stop sign. Therefore the
delay at side-street stop controlled intersections reflects only the delay accruing to
vehicles that are stopping at the stop sign, while through traffic on the main street
flows uninterrupted with no delay. The level of service ranges for unsignalized
intersections are shown in Table TRA-2.
Roadway capacity is one measure of the ability of the street system to meet and
serve the demands placed on it by motor vehicles. It is a commonly-used measure
of how well City streets are serving motorized vehicles. There are other metrics
                                                                                                                       TRA-3

                                        both motor vehicles as well as other modes, most notably safety statistics and user
                                        satisfaction surveys.
                                        The capacity of a roadway is affected by a number of factors, including street
                                        width, roadway design, number of travel lanes, number of roadway intersections,
                                        number of driveways, presence of on-street parking, and traffic signal

                                        f. Safety
                                        The existing roadway system in Chino can also be evaluated in terms of the safety it
                                        provides to pedestrians and cyclists. The City experienced an average of 16 pedes-
                                        trian/vehicle collisions per year during the period 2000-2006. In 2005, Chino expe-
                                        rienced the lowest number of pedestrian/vehicle collisions with nine collisions and
                                        no fatalities. In 2006, the number of pedestrian/vehicle collisions increased slightly
                                        to 11 collisions; however they were more severe with three fatalities. Table TRA-4

shows a downward trend in pedestrian/vehicle collisions since the high in 2002.
This is especially encouraging when considering the increase in population and
geographic area due to annexation over that same time period. All new traffic sig-
nal installations within the City are required to have pedestrian countdown timers,
which enhance pedestrian safety during street crossings.
Table TRA-4 illustrates the number of pedestrian and bicycle collisions from 1997
to 2006. For pedestrians, the injury and fatality rate in Chino is closer to that of the
US rather than that of California, which has a much higher rate than the rest of the
country.
In the period 1997-2006, the City averaged 23 bicycle-related crashes per year. In
that same period, there were five bicycle fatalities, although there were none be-
tween 2004 and 2006. For bicycles, the City’s injury/fatality rate is almost as high
as the California rate, and higher than the US rate.
Helmet use for children in the City is mandatory, and enforcement of this law has
generally increased helmet use and awareness throughout the City. This may re-
duce the severity, although not the frequency, of bicycle/vehicle crashes.
Geographically, bicycle and pedestrian crashes tend to be concentrated along major
commercial corridors such as Central Avenue and Riverside Drive. Crashes mirror
nodes of bicycle and pedestrian activity – for pedestrians, there seems to be a rela-
tionship between crashes and bus routes. Transit stops, especially transfer points
and high-ridership stops, should be focal points for future pedestrian safety, access,
and crossing improvements. Bicycle crashes also seem to concentrate somewhat
along bicycle lanes and trails, where there are presumably more cyclists.

                                        g. Neighborhood Traffic Calming
                                        Some of the safety issues described in section f can be addressed through neigh-
                                        borhood traffic calming. The Institute of Transportation Engineers defines traffic
                                        calming as “the combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative
                                        effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior, and improve conditions for non-
                                        motorized street users.” Neighborhood traffic calming measures are often evaluat-
                                        ed after residents have expressed concern about speeding, cut-through traffic, and
                                        the overall safety in their residential neighborhood. Common traffic calming
                                        measures include:
                                           Traffic circles

2. Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Equestrian Facilities
a. Bicycle Facilities
The facilities available to bicyclists are categorized as Class I, Class II, or Class III.
   Class I bicycle facility: bicycle path physically separated from vehicular traffic
     on its own right-of-way.
   Class II bicycle facility: designated bicycle lane on a road identified by pave-
     ment markings and/or signs.
   Class III bicycle facility: bicycle route that shares the roadway with motor ve-
     hicle traffic with bicycle route signs posted at intervals.
The City mainly has Class II bicycle facilities, although Class I facilities do exist
mostly in the southeastern area of the City near open space and recreational facili-
ties. Class III shared lanes are available in parts of the City as well. Figure TRA-2
indicates the locations of existing and future bicycle facilities in Chino. There is
currently no formal bicycle plan for the City as a whole, although planned facilities
are those shown in Figure TRA-2. The Preserve and College Park Specific Plans
indicate where bicycle facilities are planned within those areas of the City.
The current network is located throughout the City, with facilities being created as
the College Park and The Preserve Specific Plans are built out. However, in the
northern part of the City, the facilities are less continuous. There are no continu-
ous north-south routes through the entire City. The only continuous east-west
route is the Class II facility along Schaefer Avenue. There are limited bicycle park-

b. Pedestrian Facilities
Chino’s pedestrian network consists of both dedicated trails and the sidewalk net-
work that covers much of the residential and commercial area of the City.
c. Equestrian Facilities
There are two major north-south equestrian tails in Chino: the potential Chino
Creek Multi-Purpose Trail, which runs along the western boundary of the City, and
the Euclid Avenue trail which travels along the City’s eastern edge from the Prado
Equestrian Center and The Preserve to Chino Avenue. There are other, shorter
trails available for horseback riding, some of which are located in private residential
developments. These trails, along with planned equestrian trails, are shown in Fig-
ure TRA-3.
3. Public Transit
Public transit service in and around Chino is provided by five agencies: Omnitrans,
Foothill Transit, Orange County Transportation Authority, Metrolink, and Amtrak.
The Chino Transit Center serves as a "hub" to allow bus riders from various loca-
tions to assemble at a central point to take advantage of express trips or other
route-to-route transfers. The services provided by each, and their plans for the
future, are presented in this section.
a. Omnitrans
Omnitrans is the largest public transit provider in San Bernardino County, serving
over 15 million passengers each year throughout 15 cities and unincorporated areas
including Chino. Omnitrans service in Chino is provided on four fixed routes: the
63, 65, 68, and 83. All routes meet at the Chino Transit Center and connect Chino
to neighboring communities including Montclair, Ontario, Upland, Pomona, and
Chino Hills. Current transit service is sparse in the northwest and rapidly expand-
ing southeast quadrants of the City. Most Chino residents live within a half-mile of
an existing Omnitrans bus stop, although residents in the northwest and southeast
corners of the City are not within typical walking distance of a bus stop.

                                        d. Metrolink
                                        Metrolink is the regional commuter rail service providing fast and reliable service to
                                        Ventura, San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange, and San Diego counties.
                                        Service is provided on seven lines on weekdays, two lines on Saturdays, and one
                                        line on Sundays.
                                        While there are no Metrolink stations in Chino, neighboring cities do have stations.
                                        The closest Metrolink line serving Chino is the Riverside line. The Riverside line is
                                        located north of Chino and stops in East Ontario and in downtown Pomona. The
                                        line connects Riverside to Los Angeles at Union Station. The two stations are ap-
                                        proximately seven to ten miles from the Chino Transit Center. Numerous Omni-
                                        trans bus routes serve both stations but there are no direct routes between Chino
                                        and these two stations. Approximately ten weekday runs are provided in each di-
                                        rection on the Riverside line and fares vary by distance traveled.
                                        e. Amtrak
                                        Amtrak provides intercity passenger train service throughout the United States.
                                        While there are no Amtrak stations in Chino, the Ontario Amtrak station and Po-
                                        mona Amtrak station are approximately four and five miles north of Chino. The
                                        Pomona station is used by Metrolink commuter trains, Foothill Transit Buses, and
                                        Amtrak's Sunset Limited, which stops in Pomona on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.
                                        The Sunset Limited operates three times a week on a schedule connecting Los An-
                                        geles to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.
                                        The Ontario Amtrak Station is used by Amtrak California's daily Motorcoach ser-
                                        vice between the San Joaquin trains at Bakersfield and Calexico, with intermediate
                                        stops at Claremont, San Bernardino, Palm Springs, Thousand Palms, Indio, Braw-
                                        ley, and El Centro. The stations are fully wheelchair accessible and have free short-
                                        term parking.
                                        4. Freight Movement
                                        Goods movement activity is related directly to the type and intensity of the sur-
                                        rounding land use. Rail and trucking activity is generally focused in areas where
                                        commodities must be picked up or delivered. That may include industrial areas
                                        with manufacturing, warehousing, truck terminals, and other land uses which utilize
                                        raw materials and generate products. Commercial areas also generate trucking
                                        movements, although to a lesser intensity than highly industrial areas. Rail trips
                                        generally begin or end in industrial locations; however, rail activity may impact resi-

dential and commercial areas where rail tracks are located. This section identifies
the existing rail system and designated truck routes in the City of Chino.
As industrial development increases in Chino, it will likely result in greater demand
for rail services. Since the main rail lines to the industrial areas cross residential and
commercial neighborhoods, increasing rail service increases the potential for land
use conflicts.
a. Freight Rail System
Union Pacific (UP) operates one rail line in the City of Chino. The UP rail line
enters the northwest portion of the City, between Philadelphia Street and Walnut
Avenue, and extends diagonally to its eastern terminus at Benson Avenue and Chi-
no Avenue. Several shorter lines also branch from the main UP line in the City of
Chino, and extend throughout a small portion of the City bounded by Pipeline
Avenue, Chino Avenue, Central Avenue, and Eucalyptus Avenue.
The UP rail line intersects with 24 streets in the City of Chino. Various mecha-
nisms are used to warn oncoming traffic of a train’s presence in the City of Chino,
including flashing lights, gates, cross bucks, and stop signs. A maximum of two
freight trains travel through each rail line/roadway intersection on a daily basis. Of
these crossings, the one on Central Avenue, just south of Chino Avenue, often
causes delays due to train crossings. At this location, the train tracks are configured
such that trains must cross at that point and then reverse onto the continuing rail
line to proceed through the City. Most other rail crossings in Chino have limited
delays due to the limited number of trains. The existing and future freight rail facil-
ities located in the City of Chino are shown in Figure TRA-4A, and the typical rail-
road right-of-way cross-sections are shown in Figure TRA-4B.
b. Truck Routes
The City of Chino has adopted a series of truck routes, as illustrated in Figure
TRA-5. The purpose of the truck route system is to identify the most appropriate
routes for “through” trucks, as well as extra large trucks, in the City. Truck routes
also inform truck drivers of the allowable routes to take, and help to avoid intru-
sion of non-local truck movements into areas of the City where they would not be
desired, such as residential districts and sensitive land uses such as schools, senior
centers, hospitals and day care centers. By State law, trucks are allowed to use any
arterial roadway to access a destination for purposes of doing business along that
roadway. However, a truck that is merely “passing through” may be restricted to
certain designated routes. A “through” truck trip is defined as a truck trip that uses
a roadway facility to get from one roadway or freeway to another without stopping
                                                                                                                          TRA-17

                                        along its route for purposes of doing business. For example, in Chino, a through
                                        truck trip could occur from State Route 71 to Euclid Avenue via a number of east-
                                        west streets, or in the north-south direction from State Route 60 to State Route 71
                                        along several streets. Many of the current truck trips in the City are made for pur-
                                        poses of doing business in the City (the truck stops along the way to deliver or pick
                                        up goods), but there are also other truck trips that are non-local “through” trips.
                                        The State of California Vehicle Code states that cities may post truck-restricted
                                        routes, or alternatively, truck designated routes, for trucks of certain weight classifi-
                                        cations. Other types of truck restrictions may apply in selected areas such as bridg-
                                        es or roadway segments that are not designed to handle trucks of a certain height or
                                        weight. Those restrictions would be in addition to the limitation on general
                                        through-truck travel.

                                        Several factors affecting goods movement will continue to see change in the near
                                        future. Agricultural uses have been replaced with industrial warehouse uses. The
                                        industrial warehouse development in the southwestern portion of Chino, together
                                        with access to State Route 71, may result in continued increases in volume and
                                        changes in truck travel patterns.
                                        To accommodate and facilitate truck travel while controlling impacts on non-truck
                                        generating land uses, unique truck facilities are necessary. Specifically, through
                                        truck routes must be designated on major routes (expressways or large primary
                                        arterials) to provide access to the industrial areas and through the City. These
                                        routes should be separate to the extent possible from residential, commercial, and
                                        public land uses. These routes should be constructed to support vehicles weighing
                                        10,000 or more pounds. Local truck routes are typically designated on major arte-
                                        rials, allowing trucks weighing more than 10,000 pounds to access commercial and
                                        industrial areas.
                                        A significant number of individual truck owners/operators reside in Chino. Some
                                        of the independent truck operators desire to park their vehicles on residential
                                        streets adjacent to their homes throughout the City. In response, the City has de-
                                        veloped parking regulations that limit the locations where trucks may park over-
                                        night to designated and signed truck routes unless restricted by code.
                                        The City of Chino truck route system includes the following categories of routes:
                                           City of Chino Truck Routes
                                           State Truck Routes
                                           Large (38/40) Truck Routes
                                        Chino truck routes are located primarily on east-west oriented roadways, including
                                        Riverside Drive, portions of Schaefer Avenue, Edison Avenue, Eucalyptus Avenue,
                                        Chino Hills Parkway, Merrill Avenue, Pine Avenue, Bickmore Avenue, El Prado
                                        Road, and Kimball Avenue. Several of those routes provide a continuous truck
                                        route connection from State Route 71 to Euclid Avenue through the City of Chino.
                                        All of the north-south oriented truck routes are intentionally discontinuous because
                                        the City does not wish to facilitate “cut-through” routes for trucks to and from
                                        State Route 60; two sufficient north-south routes are already provided by Euclid
                                        Avenue and State Route 71. The north-south discontinuous routes include por-
                                        tions of East End Avenue, Pipeline Avenue, Ramona Avenue, Monte Vista Ave-
                                        nue, Central Avenue, Mountain Avenue, Mayhew, Walker Avenue, Hellman Ave-
                                        nue, and Carpenter Avenue.

                                                                                                          G E N E R A L   P L A N
                                                                                      T R A N S P O R T A T I O N   E L E M E N T
As shown on Figure TRA-5, while only small portions of State Route 71 are actual-
ly located within the City of Chino, it serves the City and provides regional through
access for trucks. Thus, there are good north-south (Euclid Avenue and State
Route 71), as well as east-west (State Route 60) access routes for through trucks in
the City of Chino.
5. Airport
Chino Airport (CNO), formerly known as Cal Aero Field, is a county-owned pub-
lic-use airport located east of Euclid Avenue (State Route 83), between Merrill Av-
enue and Kimball Avenue. Chino Airport has three runways and is classified as a
general aviation reliever airport due to its proximity to LA/Ontario Airport and
John Wayne Airport. Chino Airport serves private, business, and corporate tenants
and customers from the Inland Empire. Operations are expected to grow from a
projected 243,523 takeoffs and landings in 2015 to a projected 260,448 takeoffs and
landings in 2025. Some runway expansions are planned, for both safety improve-
ments and to allow a larger range of aircraft to use the airport.
B. Roadway Classifications, Standards, and Improvements
The City of Chino groups its streets and highways into six functional classifications
according to the number of lanes and the type of service the roadway is intended to
provide. Roadway functional classifications are used to describe the function and
character of streets and highways. Different types of streets are intended to handle
different types of traffic associated with different modes of travel, including autos,
cyclists, pedestrians, and transit. Auto trips are channeled through a hierarchical
system that progresses from a lower classification handling short, locally-oriented
trips to higher classifications that connect regional and inter-regional traffic genera-
tors, handling longer trips. The roadway classification system is used to generally
describe the total volume of auto traffic on a roadway, as well as the auto trip
length, trip type, local access (number and type of curb cuts and driveway access),
posted speeds, parking, median type, traffic control, and other characteristics.
The paragraphs below describe the general characteristics of each of the seven
functional street classifications in the City of Chino. They are listed in order of
volume, from highest to lowest.
    Freeway: A freeway is an access-controlled, divided highway, with two or
     more lanes in each direction. Freeways are designed for high speed inter-city
     travel.
                                                                                                                        TRA-23

                                           Expressway: An expressway is a divided high-flow arterial street with three or
                                             more lanes in each direction. Typical right-of-way width is 206 feet. Express-
                                             ways may be separated by a median and may have a bicycle lane/trail and/or
                                             an equestrian trail.
                                           Major Arterial: A major arterial is a divided roadway with six to eight through
                                             lanes. Major arterials serve major activity centers within the City, carry the ma-
                                             jority of intra-city trips, and provide access to high volume corridors, such as
                                             freeways. Public transportation is usually most prominent along the major ar-
                                             terial system. Major arterials may be divided by a median and may have a bicy-
                                             cle lane/trail and/or an equestrian trail. Typical right-of-way width ranges be-
                                             tween 120 feet and 134 feet, and curb-to-curb width ranges from 100 feet to
                                             114 feet.
                                           Primary Arterial: A primary arterial is a roadway with four through lanes.
                                             Primary arterials may be separated by a median, and may have a bicycle
                                             lane/trail and/or an equestrian trial. The typical right-of-way width is 98 feet,
                                             and the curb-to-curb width is 74 feet. Parking is prohibited on primary arteri-
                                             al roadways.
                                           Secondary Arterial: A secondary arterial is an undivided roadway with four
                                             through lanes. Typical right-of-way width is approximately 88 feet, and curb-
                                             to-curb width is 64 feet. Secondary arterials may have a bicycle lane/trail
                                             and/or an equestrian trail. Parking is allowed on secondary arterial roadways.
                                           Collector: A collector street is a two lane undivided roadway with the primary
                                             function of collecting and distributing local traffic. Typical right-of-way width
                                             ranges between 60 feet and 88 feet. Collector streets may be further broken
                                             down into three subcategories according to adjacent land use:
                                              Urban Residential Collector
                                              Rural Collector
                                              Urban Industrial Collector
                                           Local Street: A local street is a two lane undivided roadway. Local streets are
                                             primarily used to gain access to and from adjacent properties. The minimum
                                             right-of-way width for local streets is 60 feet.

                                        is provided in Figure TRA-6. Sample cross-sections of the roadway types, except
                                        for Freeways, over which Chino has no jurisdiction, are shown in Figures TRA-7A,

Not all roadways are currently built out to the functional street classifications, and
changes associated with the buildout process are discussed below in Changes to the
Transportation Network. The Majestic Spectrum, East Chino, Eucalyptus Business
Park, College Park and The Preserve Specific Plans may have roadway functional
classifications that vary from the figure provided; refer to the individual plans for
more information. A description of the ultimate buildout of each arterial roadway
is provided in Table TRA-5A and 5B, and a map of the future number of lanes is
provided in Figure TRA-8.
As this General Plan is implemented, the City will undertake a significant number
of changes to the roadway network. As these changes are undertaken, the City will
add auto travel lanes, develop new signals, and widen intersections. The City will
also         develop         a       hierarchy       of        pedestrian          and

bicycle trails, with the goal of creating pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails that
are separated from automobiles in most cases. These changes are reflected in the
functional roadway classification map, Figure TRA-5. As improvements are con-
structed, they will be reviewed for consistency with other forms of transportation,
including cycling, walking, and transit use, to ensure the transportation system
works for all users. Development of the new roadways included in Figure TRA-6
is expected to cost approximately $103 million (in 2005 dollars). There are several
possible funding sources for these new roadways:
   Development impact fees.
   San Bernardino County Measure I, the county half-cent sales tax for transpor-
     tation.
   State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).

     Policies
        P1.       The City should consider deviating from the standard street cross-
                  sections when improving arterials in existing neighborhoods with
                  extremely limited expansion and widening opportunities. Bicycle
                  lanes should only be eliminated if they are replaced with parallel fa-
                  cilities on neighboring streets with equivalent or better connectivity
                  and safety for bicyclists.

                                          P2. When roadway widening will take place after a development pro-
                                              ject is completed, the City shall require the developer to dedicate
                                              the ultimate right-of-way for future widening along the front of the
                                              subject property and deposit an in-lieu fee of their fair share of the
                                              cost of the future improvements into an account to be held by the
                                              City for said improvements.
                                          P3. Through the development review process, the City shall ensure
                                              that new developments consider location, roadway width, existing
                                              driveways, and surrounding development in order to minimize the
                                              impacts of new development on surrounding neighborhoods.
                                          P4. Through the development review process, the City shall limit the
                                              number of access points along all major arterials, continue to con-
                                              trol access points through construction of median turn lanes and
                                              island curb cuts, and reduce and consolidate the current number of
                                              access points along major arterials.
                                          P5. The City shall require all new development to mitigate traffic im-

                                              This includes projects such as those with: 100 or more residential
                                              units, 25,000 or more square feet of office space, 1,000 or more
                                              square feet of retail, or 100,000 or more square feet of industrial.
                                          P7. The City shall undertake road-widening projects only when they
                                              are feasible on a significant length of roadway, while still requiring
                                              necessary dedications on an on-going basis.
                                          P8. The City shall ensure that construction of all transportation facili-
                                              ties is fully funded, or in the case of facilities that are funded
                                              through Development Impact Fees, the fair share is paid, by the

  P11.    The City shall prioritize the improvement and widening of saw-
          tooth roads and intersections that currently exist.
Actions
  A1.     Develop and implement a prioritization and phasing program for
          new and improved roadway facilities based on existing facilities,
          planned facilities, and funding.
  A2.     Conduct a study of the standard cross-sections used for roadways
          to determine whether there are appropriate locations in the City
          for a narrower auto travel lanes, reduced median widths, expanded
          bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and/or reduced on-street parking
          requirements; this study should also consider situations where
          there is not sufficient right-of-way to build or widen a street con-
          sistent with the standard section, and should consider the relation-
          ship of the roadway to adjacent properties to ensure compatibility
          to the greatest extent possible.

9 OPEN SPACE         AND   CONSERVATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Open Space and Conservation Element is to plan for compre-
  hensive and long-range preservation of open space and agriculture, and conserva-
  tion of natural resources. The element seeks to maintain Chino’s small town char-
  acter by preserving agricultural and open space lands in the periphery of the City
  and maintaining Chino’s connection to its agricultural past. The element also fur-
  thers the purpose of creating a healthy City by providing open space for recreation-
  al opportunities, encouraging the use of healthy building materials, and preserving
  agricultural land that will provide fresh local produce to the community.
  This Element combines two State-mandated elements, Open Space and Conserva-
  tion, into a single element. Additional open space policies can be found in the
  Parks and Recreation Element. The State-mandated Open Space Element is con-
  cerned with the management of open space resources. Open space is defined as
  any parcel or area of public or private land or water that is essentially unimproved
  and undeveloped. Government Code Section 65560 describes six categories of
  open space: Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources; Open Space
  for the Managed Production of Resources; Open Space for Outdoor Recreation;
  Open Space for Public Health and Safety; Open Space in Support of the Mission of
  Military Installations; and Open Space for the Protection of Native American Plac-
  es, Features, and Objects. The types of open space in each of these categories and
  where they are addressed in this General Plan are identified in Table OSC-1.
  The State-mandated Conservation Element is concerned with the conservation of
  natural resources, including plant and animal wildlife, water bodies and watersheds,
  forests, soils, minerals, and energy conservation. Since many natural resources are
  located in open space land, the Chino General Plan combines the Conservation
  Element with the Open Space Element into one element.
  This element is divided into the following sections:
     Biological Resources
     Agricultural Lands
                                                                                       OSC-1

A. Biological Resources
1. Background
The City of Chino currently contains a variety of types of vegetation: agricultural,
riparian woodlands, seasonal wetlands, farmed wetlands, and non-native grasslands.
The majority of Chino is urbanized; however, there is a concentration of open
space and recreation areas in the southeastern portion of the City that provides for
biological habitat. Southeastern Chino is located within the Santa Ana River drain-
age basin, which includes Prado Dam and the following open space areas: Prado
Regional Park, Prado Lake, Subarea 1, and The Preserve. These open spaces host a
wide range of wildlife and plant species that reflect the biodiversity in the Chino
Valley and adjacent portions of the Santa Ana River watershed.
Diversity of wildlife within the northwestern portion of the City is relatively low as
a result of development. Species expected to occur commonly in these urbanized
areas include small mammals such as desert cottontail, California ground squirrel,
Botta’s pocket gopher, striped skunk, Virginia opossum, Pacific chorus frog, west-
ern toad, western fence lizard, side-blotched lizard, various urban-adapted, non-
migratory birds, and modest numbers of migratory birds (especially fall through
spring). Some raptor species are expected to occur within developed areas such as
Cooper’s hawk and red-tailed hawk.
A somewhat greater diversity of wildlife occurs along the flood control channels,
within unimproved areas, and in the southern portion of Chino. Burrowing owls
and other raptors forage in agricultural fields, searching for small rodents and birds.
Wet fields attract wading birds hunting small animals that concentrate in wet areas.
                                                                                                                       OSC-3

                                        In general, limited development in the southern portion of the City supports a
                                        greater diversity of native and non-native wildlife than the more-developed north-
                                        ern portion of the City.
                                        Special-status species are plants and animals that are legally protected under the
                                        State and/or federal Endangered Species Acts, or by other regulations. Reported
                                        sightings of rare plants are mapped by the California Native Plant Society’s (CNPS)
                                        Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants and the California Natural Diversity Database,
                                        which also maps sightings of special-status animals.
                                        There are a total of 40 special-status plant species and 57 special-status animal spe-
                                        cies that have been observed in Chino. Least Bell’s vireo, loggerhead shrike, and
                                        southwestern willow fly catcher rely upon open spaces, riparian trees, and shrubs,
                                        some of which are found below the 566-foot elevation line associated with the Pra-
                                        do Dam. A remnant of the Delhi series soils may be found east of the Chino air-
                                        port, although habitat for the Delhi sands giant flower-loving fly may no longer
                                        exist. Raptors and migratory birds find roosting and foraging habitat in Chino’s
                                        agricultural lands and other open spaces. Burrowing owls are a particularly sensi-
                                        tive species and are the most dependent on specific sites.
                                        2.   Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Actions

B. Agricultural Lands
1. Background
Chino was founded as an agricultural community and has soils and climate suitable
for growing crops and raising livestock. However, over the latter half of the 20 th
century, the City was developed with primarily urban uses. This has followed larger
changes that have taken place throughout Southern California, and particularly in
the Chino Valley. For example, between 1987 and 2002, agricultural acreage in San
Bernardino County dropped from 1.7 million acres to 0.5 million acres, as the en-
tire county became more developed. Over the same time period, the average size
of farms decreased from 868 acres to 371 acres, representing a shift to more inten-
sive agricultural land uses, primarily milk production. Milk production currently
dominates agricultural areas in San Bernardino County, but has been shrinking at
an increasing rate and is expected to continue to decline in years to come. Decreas-
ing demand, in combination with planned urban land uses for most of the agricul-
tural land, suggests that more agricultural land will be urbanized as this General
Plan is implemented.
The California Department of Conservation (CDC) considers Chino to have im-
portant agricultural resources. The CDC Important Farmland Inventory System
classifies land into one of eight mapping categories based on soil and climatic con-
ditions, including, in order of importance: Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide
Importance, Unique Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance. These areas are
shown in Figure OSC-1. The CDC continually revises these maps, in coordination
with the City of Chino. This General Plan uses the most current data available,
which were last updated in 2008.
According to the 2008 CDC farmland data, there are a total of 2,527 acres of Prime
Farmland and Farmland of Statewide Importance in Chino. These two categories
account for the majority of important farmland within the City limit. Most of Chi-
no’s current agriculture takes place in the southern portion of the City. Most of the
areas identified as Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide Importance are locat-
ed in the southern and eastern parts of the City, where agriculture is most concen-
trated. A significant percentage of this land is located within the boundaries of the
                                                                                                                     OSC-7

                                        ations remain as administered by the land owners. Since the CDC last classified the
                                        City’s farmland in 2008, some of Chino’s prime and important farmland has already
                                        been converted to urban uses. These areas are primarily located in The Preserve,

C. Mineral Resources
1. Background
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) requires
General Plans to incorporate mapped mineral resources designations approved by
the State Mining and Geology Board. SMARA seeks to promote conservation and
protection of significant mineral deposits, and to ensure that significant aggregate
resources are recognized.
In order to classify lands according to availability of mineral resources, the State
Mining and Geology Board has established four designations, MRZ-1 through
MRZ-4. MRZ-1 is defined as a zone where adequate information indicates that no
significant mineral deposits are present or likely to be present. In MRZ-2 and
MRZ-3, there is a higher likelihood for the presence of mineral resources. MRZ-4
is defined as a zone where there is insufficient data to assign any other MRZ desig-
nation. Figure OSC-3 shows the mineral resource zones in Chino. These mineral
resource designations are intended to prevent incompatible land use development
on areas determined to have significant mineral resource deposits.
The City of Chino lies within the Claremont-Upland Production-Consumption (P-
C) Region. The entire Claremont-Upland P-C Region has been divided into Min-
eral Resources Zones to aid in the classification of areas with mineral deposits.
Chino is located in the MRZ-1 and MRZ-3 zones, as shown in Figure OSC-3.
                                                                                                                    OSC-13

                                        Chino’s MRZ-1 consists of rocks unsuitable for commercial use, such as shale,
                                        siltstone, carbonates, and chlorite-schist, as well as fine-grained sedimentary depos-
                                        its that are unsuitable for use as aggregate. The MRZ-3 contains sand and gravel
                                        deposits, although there is insufficient data to ascertain whether these mineral de-
                                        posits are significant. There is a projected demand of 240 million tons of aggregate
                                        for the Claremont-Upland P-C Region until the year 2056, and the region may ex-
                                        perience a shortage. If a shortage occurs, the region may need imported aggregate
                                        from surrounding regions in addition to implementing aggregate conservation
                                        strategies.

                                        a. Energy Conservation
                                        High utility rates and the rise of the price of oil have led to a heightened awareness
                                        of the need for energy conservation techniques as a means of saving money and
                                        natural resources. The benefits of energy conservation go well beyond financial
                                        savings for individual consumers. The combustion of fossil fuels for producing
                                        electricity and powering automobiles is a direct cause of air pollution and global
                                        warming. Additionally, conservation efforts, in tandem with the provision of local
                                        sources of alternative energy, will alleviate the current reliance on diminishing for-
                                        eign sources of fuel supplies and thus increase national security.
                                        Chino can implement energy conservation strategies in a variety of ways. Energy
                                        used in transportation, particularly private automobiles, can be minimized by com-

pact development and provision of transportation alternatives to the automobile,
including walking, bicycling, and public transportation. As land uses and circula-
tion patterns allow residents to meet their needs within a short distance of their
homes, they have many more opportunities for alternative modes of transportation.
Goals, objectives, policies, and actions relating to development patterns that have
energy conservation implications are discussed in the Land Use, Transportation,
and Healthy City Elements. Chino will also conserve energy through the use of
green building standards and energy-saving technologies in residential, commercial,
and civic buildings.
“Green building” techniques significantly reduce the environmental impacts of new
development. Green building techniques incorporate energy efficient design, recy-
cled and non-toxic building materials, siting and landscaping to maximize passive
heating and cooling opportunities, and water efficient systems in landscaping. On a
wider scale, a sustainable community can be fostered by development patterns that
reflect compact, neighborhood-oriented infill and clustered development, both of
which decrease urban sprawl, minimize loss of open space and natural resources
and encourage alternative modes of transportation.
b. Climate Change
Leading scientists around the world now agree that climate change is a reality and
that human activities are disrupting the earth’s climate by intensifying the green-
house effect. A balance of naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere determines
the Earth’s climate by trapping solar heat through a phenomenon known as the
greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor keep solar radiation from exiting our atmos-
phere. The increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases resulting
from human activities is changing the climate in ways that pose serious risks to
Chino’s health, economy, and environment. Mass migration and/or loss of plant
and animal species could occur. Global climate change could also lead to more
extreme heat waves and heat-related stress in Chino, an increase in climate-sensitive
diseases, and more frequent and intense natural disasters such as drought and in-
creased levels of air pollution.
Addressing climate change will require the participation of all levels of government,
all sectors of society and every individual. The State of California has taken steps,
including Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the California Climate Solutions Act of 2006.
AB 32 directs the California Air Resources Board to develop and implement regu-
lations that, by 2020, would achieve state-wide greenhouse gas emissions equivalent
to 1990 levels. AB 32 requires the development of a Scoping Plan, which was
                                                                                                                    OSC-17

                                        adopted in 2008. The Scoping Plan identifies greenhouse gas reduction techniques
                                        to achieve the emissions goals.
                                        Senate Bill (SB) 375 further implements AB 32. SB 375 requires metropolitan
                                        planning organizations (MPOs) to prepare sustainable communities strategies,
                                        which will demonstrate how a region will meet CARB’s greenhouse gas reduction
                                        targets by reducing the amount of vehicle miles traveled. The Southern California
                                        Association of Governments will work in cooperation with the San Bernardino
                                        Associated Governments (SANBAG) to prepare the Sustainable Communities
                                        Strategy for San Bernardino County, including the City of Chino.

                                             house, the building was nicknamed “PigPen” and had dirt play areas that were
                                             separated by fences to segregate boys and girls. It was originally located near
                                             5th and D Streets, but now is located at 11th and B Streets and is owned by the

                                           Chino Valley Champion. Located at 13220 Central Avenue, this site is indi-
                                              cated by a marker.
                                           Cornerstone to Chino’s First Reservoir. Located at 17127 Pomona-Rincon
                                              Road, the site of Chino’s first reservoir is indicated by a marker.
                                        Native Americans once inhabited the areas around Chino Creek, before the Span-
                                        iards arrived. Archaeological artifacts and interviews with early settlers in Chino
                                        indicate that Chino was a stopping-point between inland areas and the ocean and
                                        the site of a temescal, or hot bath, for a thriving community in the Chino Valley. A
                                        review of the Historical Resources Inventory List identified numerous prehistoric
                                        sites in Chino, including villages and campsites, food-processing sites, middens, and
                                        metates.
                                        Chino lies in a region which is made up of alluvial valley floors, fans and terraces
                                        and the basic soil types are young alluvial deposits. Pleistocene alluvium and Holo-
                                        cene alluvium deposits underlying several areas of the City have been identified as
                                        having varying potential to yield fossils of importance. Vertebrate land mammal
                                        fossils have been discovered in parts of the City, including the fossils of a mam-
                                        moth, ground sloth, camel, bison, horse, and deer.
