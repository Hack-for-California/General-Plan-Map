Water and Energy Conservation
Water and energy conservation are linked. A tremendous amount of
energy is required to pump water. The California State Water Project
consumes approximately 2-3 percent of the State’s energy supply to
pump water. 2 In addition to energy used for pumping water,
wastewater treatment also consumes energy. Thus, when water is
conserved, so is energy. Conserving water is one step the City can
take toward long-term sustainability.
Green Building
There are many different conceptions of green building design due to
the broad range of sustainable issues. Definitions range from broad
concepts that incorporate all aspects of sustainability to narrow
definitions that focus on one specific sustainable design feature such as
recycled content materials or energy efficiency. While there is no
formal definition of green building, the term implies a structure that is
friendlier to its occupants and the environment and is more resource           Solar-paneled roof at Applied Biosystems (Chris Crannell and Ken Mantoani)

                             Program 12.2:      Consider a range of municipal utility options for Pleasanton.
Alliances
                  Policy 13: Join or work with regional energy alliances where there are clear benefits for Pleasanton.
                             Program 13.1:      Identify and join existing energy alliances, and create energy alliances when appropriate. When possible,
                                                assume a leadership role in alliances.
                             Program 13.2:      Work with PG&E to design and locate appropriate expansions of the gas and electric system.
                             See also the policy and programs in the Air Quality Element regarding the City joining International Council for Local
                             Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) – an organization of local governments that takes action on climate protection. Many
                             of these policies and programs would also reduce energy usage.
Design of Energy Facilities
                 Policy 14:  Minimize the visual impact of distribution and transmission lines and facilities.
                             Program 14.1:      Underground local serving electrical transmission and distribution lines in residential and commercial
                                                areas where feasible.
                             Program 14.2:      Place new regional serving transmission and distribution lines underground where feasible.
                             Program 14.3:      Design utility substations in a visually appealing manner, and minimize their impact on nearby
                                                residential areas.
                 Policy 15:  Experimental technology should not be used for power transmission in Pleasanton.                     Established technology
                             appropriate for the environment should be used.
Transportation Energy
Goal 2: Save transportation energy by implementing a more effective transportation system.
                 Policy 16:  Reduce vehicle fuel consumption in the City.
                             Program 16.1:      Synchronize traffic lights and smooth traffic flow so that gas is not wasted accelerating and decelerating.

This Element focuses on two descriptors for sound levels: Leq and                 up to 66 dBA, group conversations up to 50 or 60 dBA, and public

used to describe any time period but is particularly useful in
describing the change in noise level of a single activity, such as noise
from a nightclub. The day/night average sound level Ldn accounts
for the difference in response of people to daytime and nighttime
noises by weighting noise levels generated during the nighttime when
background noise is generally lower and people are more sensitive to
noise events. Each nighttime noise event is multiplied by a factor of
ten, which is approximately equal to a doubling in perceived
loudness, to compensate for people’s increased sensitivity during
nighttime hours. Pleasanton generally uses Leq for describing the
change in noise level of a single activity while using Ldn to evaluate
background noise exposure in the city.

these noise reduction measures should be considered in locations
within conditionally acceptable areas and should be tailored to
individual site characteristics based on an acoustical report. The
objective in these areas is to provide outdoor noise levels at or below
60 dBA Ldn where people can be expected to spend time and indoor
noise levels of 45 dBA Ldn. In particular, any new construction near
the airport should be sound insulated to ensure that these standards
are met.
Noise Ordinance and Other Regulations
Pleasanton also has adopted a Noise Ordinance which regulates the
level of noise emanating from residential, commercial, and industrial
properties.10 The Ordinance is intended to discourage unusually
noisy activities, but provides for permits in exceptional cases. In
addition, the Ordinance also regulates the use and operation of
skateboard ramps and power leaf blowers. The City also uses
conditions of project approval to address noise issues, for example                                Children at play at Gingerbread Preschool

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Goal 1:        Reduce noise to acceptable levels throughout the community.
               Policy 1:        Require new projects to meet acceptable exterior noise level standards.
                                Program 1.1: Use the normally acceptable designation and text description contained in Table 11-5 “Noise and Land-
                                             Use Compatibility Guidelines,” to determine the acceptability of new development and to determine
                                             when noise studies are required. For new single-family residential development, maintain a maximum
                                             day/night average noise level standard of 60 dBA Ldn for exterior noise in private or shared outdoor use
                                             areas excluding front yards. For new multi-family residential development, maintain a maximum
                                             standard of 65 dBA Ldn in community outdoor recreation areas (or 60 dBA Ldn when the outdoor noise is
                                             due to aircraft). Noise standards are not applied to balconies or front yards. In the Downtown, the City
                                             Council will evaluate the requirement to achieve these standards on a case-by-case basis.
                                Program 1.2: Where high noise levels are the result of railroad trains, an exterior noise level of up to 70 dBA Ldn would
                                             be considered compatible with most residential development recognizing that day-night average noise
                                             levels are controlled by intermittent, loud events. Vibration-sensitive land uses located near the Union
                                             Pacific Railroad tracks should demonstrate compatibility with the Federal Transit Administration’s
                                             vibration impact criteria by completing site-specific vibration analyses.
                                Program 1.3: Use noise guidelines and contours to determine the need for noise studies, and require new developments
                                             to construct or pay for noise attenuation features as a condition of approving new projects. An exterior
                                             increase of more than 4 decibels is considered significant.
                                Program 1.4: Require noise studies for future projects to use a consistent format, to include a description of the
                                             methodology and assumptions used, to analyze alternative noise mitigation measures, and to evaluate the
                                             effectiveness of the mitigation following implementation.
                                Program 1.5: Encourage the use of setbacks, landscaped earth berms, and frontage roads where feasible to reduce
                                             exterior noise levels. The use of soundwalls should only be used where other mitigation measures are not
                                             feasible. Where sound and frontage roads walls are needed, design and high quality materials, as well as
                                             landscaping, should be used to mitigate their visual impact.

                                               pre-drilling pile hoses, driving piles hydraulically or enclosing sheet piles with rubber aprons. The City

               Policy 2:        Reduce outdoor noise levels in existing residential areas where economically and aesthetically feasible.
                                Program 2.1:   Consider Capital Improvement Program (CIP) funding for repair, landscaping, and maintenance of
                                               existing deteriorated sound walls.
                                Program 2.2:   Project and monitor noise levels using traffic projections and periodic noise monitoring.
                                Program 2.3:   Where traffic volumes increase by more than 50 percent from baseline 2006 noise data, verify projected
                                               noise levels with noise monitors at locations adjacent to residential and other noise sensitive areas.
                                Program 2.4:   When considering approval of uses with loading bays, drive-through restaurant facilities, or other features
                                               that could generate noise, ensure that any nearby residential neighborhoods are protected as much as
                                               possible from excessive noise.
                Policy 3:       Ensure that noise does not exceed interior noise levels of 45 dBA Ldn for residential uses and those levels
                                specified in noise studies for other uses.
                                Program 3.1:   Require new developments to pay their fair share of mitigation measures necessary to reduce interior
                                               noise levels within existing adjacent or impacted land uses.
                                Program 3.2:   Require noise-attenuation measures when necessary to ensure that interior noise levels for new single- and

                                               of the space. Interior noise levels in noise-sensitive spaces (e.g., offices) generally should be maintained at
                                               45 dBA Leq or less (hourly average).
                Policy 4:       Control noise at its source to maintain existing noise levels, and in no case to exceed acceptable noise levels
                                as established in the Noise and Land Use Compatibility Guidelines, Table 11-5.
                                Program 4.1:   Enforce the noise emission standards for various noise-emitting land uses established in the City’s Noise
                                               Ordinance.
                                Program 4.2:   Develop a mechanical drive engine ordinance that would establish noise limits for engines, such as
                                               electricity generators, used in commercial and industrial operations.
                                Program 4.3:   Aggressively enforce the noise emissions standards for all vehicles. Enforce Section 27007 of the
                                               California Motor Vehicle Code. This section prohibits amplified sound which can be heard 50 or more feet

12. COMMUNITY CHARACTER ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Community Character Element is to identify the
physical and social aspects of Pleasanton’s unique identity and to
establish goals, policies, and programs to preserve and enhance
those aspects which make the city special and distinct.
OVERVIEW
Pleasanton’s community character is the physical reflection of its
location, setting, history, and numerous design decisions made over
time. It is an expression of community values as well as constraints
as perceived at the time of each of those decisions. Some aspects of
community character are the result of one-time actions while others
have been adopted and repeated as traditions. Major contributors to
Pleasanton’s community character are discussed below. See Figure

vacant intill parcels, buildmg additions, renovations, and public
improvements are expected within the next 20 years.
Edge Environment
The Foothdl Road area including the Main and Pleasanton Ridges to
the west creates the western edge of the city. Although this area is
changmg due to increased housing development and street
improvements, it still appears semi-rural in character and closely
connected to open space. Many sections of Foothill Road are
narrow and follow natural contours. HiUs and riparian corridor trees
approach the roadway in many locations. The road is generally
elevated in height above the rest of the city and provides at several
locations a broad overview of the green valley below. Along

exist that connect to other neighborhoods or to schools, thus
limiting the walkability of the city as a whole. To reach their
destination, residents, includq children walking to school, often use
sidewalks along major arterials designed primarily for vehicle use.
The "Y" form of the former Southern Pacific and Union Pacific
railroad corridors has influenced street and subdivision layouts in the
past, and continues to exert a strong influence on the character of
the community. Most noticeable are the vistas to distant hills and
Mount Diablo provided at road crossings of the railroad corridors.

heritage and is a source of pride to its residents. Older commercial
and residenual buildings lend richness to the area, and new
development has generally been designed to complement the older
structures and reinforce the small-scale character.            Historic
buildings, the Pleasanton Arch, street trees, many restaurants, special
paving, and street furniture, along with unique shops, all enhance
the pedestrian scale and attractiveness of Downtown Pleasanton.
Residential Neighborhoods
Residential neighborhoods are the heart of Pleasanton. The
neighborhoods perform a major role in what makes Pleasanton an
attractive place to live, work, and play. Each neighborhood has a
unique character, from the semi-rural Happy Valley, to the more
conventional suburban homes in Pleasanton Valley, to the Victorian
and bungalow architecture of residential streets around the
downtown. In general, Pleasanton neighborhoods show a pride of
ownershp as reflected in improvements, such as home additions,
and a Qh level of home maintenance. Neghborhoods consist not                           517 Saint Mary Street with garage in the rear

Commercial Areas
Unlike many cities that saw substantial development during the mid-
20th century, Pleasanton has few commercial corridors. Main Street
and First Street are the exceptions. However, unlike the "strip
commercial'' development in other cities where gansh s w s ,
franchise architecture, and poorly landscaped parlung lots dominate,
development along these streets includes re-use of older, historic
buildmgs, street trees, mixed-use buildings and neighborhoods,
parking located at the rear of businesses, and pedestrian amenities.
As of 2006, Pleasanton has upgraded First Street - which carries the
bulk of the traffic through the Downtown area - with removal of
overhead lines, installation of pedestrian-level streethghts, and
reconstruction of the bridge over the Arroyo del Valle.

           1990s, Pleasanton’s local economy was characterized by several large
           employers, along with a growing number of smaller firms. During this
           time, strengthening business sectors included software,
           communications, miscellaneous materials and devices, and the service
           industry, specifically hotel, health and business services. Retail also
           continues to be a strong sector in the Pleasanton economy.
           While Pleasanton remains a desired location for corporate
           headquarters and large employers, the region is gaining a reputation
           for entrepreneurship. Over the past few years, Pleasanton and the Tri
           Valley have developed as an innovation-driven economy with a
           specialization in information technology, scientific and biomedical
           products and services, innovation services, and business operations.
           As such, “homegrown” firms are now an important source of job
           growth and economic revenue. Despite the economic stagnation in
           the San Francisco Bay Area in the past few years, the recovery has
           been stronger in the East Bay. As a result, Pleasanton and the

To ensure the City’s long-term fiscal health and to minimize future
burdens on the City’s resources and taxpayers, a balanced budget is
essential. To ensure a balanced budget, the City must use its current
resources to meet current obligations and make sure that operating
fund debt is minimized. In addition, future costs such as asset
replacements must be recognized and funded like current expenses.
To aid the City in structuring a balanced budget, regular review must
be performed to allow revenue sources to be properly identified and
matched with their intended purposes. The balancing of future
budgets will be facilitated by the City setting aside funding for
obligations when they are incurred. For example, as assets are being
used, their depreciation should be recognized as an expense, and dollars
set aside to ensure adequate funding is available at the appropriate
future time. The City can lessen the burden on future taxpayers by
utilizing debt only for acquiring long-term capital and when it is cost                      Maintenance of utilities in street right of way

Pleasanton has endorsed Alameda County’s Every1Home Plan,
although it has not committed funding. The purpose of the plan is to
end chronic homelessness and reduce housing crises for extremely
low-income people with HIV\AIDS and chronic mental health
problems. It includes a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness
within a broader 15-year housing plan that includes families. The plan
recognizes that homelessness is a regional problem that requires
regional solutions and coordination.

Traffic and Roadways
Two interstate freeways and one State route serve the Try-Valley.
Interstate 580 (I-580) is an eight-lane freeway which runs east-west
from the Altamont pass through Livermore, between the cities of
Pleasanton and Dublin, and through the western ridge of the Tri-
Valley. Interstate 680 (I-680) runs north-south just east of the western
Tri-Valley area through Pleasanton, Dublin, San Ramon, and Danville.                               Wheels bus on Peters Avenue

In 1998, the City of Pleasanton along with seven jurisdictions in the
Tri-Valley area developed a Tri-Valley Transportation Development
Fee to help defray the cost of needed regional improvements, and
initially funded 11 regional projects. Of these, several have been
completed or are under construction, while others are being
considered for addition to the list. The intent of the fee is not to fully
pay for these projects, but to fund the local share.
County voters reauthorized a one-half cent sales tax in November
2000 for essential transportation improvements and services in
Alameda County.

Agricultural Lands
Major agricultural products in the Tri-Valley area include cattle
grazing, hay production, and wine grapes. Urban development has
replaced much of the area’s productive croplands, which are relatively
flat and possess the best agricultural soils. Considerable land remains
in large-lot agricultural use, under Williamson Act preserves.
Historically, owners of some parcels near existing urbanized areas
have filed notices of non-renewal for their Williamson Act contracts.
In early 2003, the South Livermore Valley Agricultural Land Trust
initiated a strategic planning process and its board recognized the need
to have a greater conservation presence in the region. The Trust
became the Tri-Valley Conservancy with an expanded geographic area                                  Vineyard at Mitchell Katz Winery

Air Quality
The combination of light winds, high terrain, and frequent
temperature inversions continues to give the Tri-Valley air basin a
higher potential for air pollution than most other locations in the Bay
Area. During the summer, conditions are conducive to the creation of
ozone, and during the winter, accumulations of pollutants such as
carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Consequently, the Tri-Valley
area has more days when State air quality standards are not met than
most other parts of the Bay Area.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Location and Intensity of Urban Development
Goal 1:          Achieve a coordinated, efficient, and environmentally sensitive pattern of development in the Tri-Valley area.
                 Policy 1:   Ensure that new development occurs in a compact community-centered pattern which supports existing communities,
                             improves mobility, minimizes public infrastructure costs, protects natural resources, and supports economic activity.
                             Program 1.1:    Promote growth management in subregional jurisdictions.
                             Program 1.2:    Support implementation of the Urban Growth Boundary concept in all Tri-Valley cities and counties.
                             Program 1.3:    Encourage all urban development within the Tri-Valley area to take place within cities. If the counties
                                             choose to process applications for urban development in unincorporated areas, then urban-level services
                                             should be provided, development should not adversely affect existing developed areas, and development
                                             standards should be consistent with those of the nearest city or cities.
                             Program 1.4:    Pursue an agreement with Alameda County and relevant special districts to establish a process for
                                             reviewing applications for development outside the city limits. The agreement should include a
                                             commitment to: (1) review development standards to assure that they are consistent and subject to the
                                             same interpretation; (2) include representatives of all affected jurisdictions in pre-application conferences
                                             with developers; (3) establish procedures regarding if and when annexation should take place; and
                                             (4) establish standards for tax-sharing agreements.
                             Program 1.5:    Encourage the Local Agency Formation Commissions of Alameda and Contra Costa counties to consider
                                             spheres-of-influence as a 20-year commitment, subject to periodic review coincident with comprehensive
                                             general plan updates.
                             Program 1.6:    Encourage periodic review of general plan planning areas between the Tri-Valley jurisdictions.
                             Program 1.7:    Provide notice and referral of projects of subregional significance to potentially affected jurisdictions.
                Policy 2:    Maximize the efficiency of existing and future public services and facilities.
                             Program 2.1:    Encourage efforts to improve efficiency and quality in the provision of public services and facilities on a
                                             subregional basis.

                             Program 2.2:     Identify needed public facilities of subregional significance, and require that new development approvals
                                              are conditioned to assure that they contribute their fair share of the cost of such facilities.
                             Program 2.3:     Coordinate development policies and capital improvement programs affecting multiple jurisdictions at the
                                              subregional level, to assure that services and facilities are provided in a timely and cost-effective manner.
                             Program 2.4:     Work with special districts and other service providers to assure that necessary services are provided in
                                              advance of or concurrently with development.
                             Program 2.5:     Consider subregional impacts and mitigation measures in the environmental review of all new major public
                                              facilities and expansions of existing facilities.
                             Program 2.6:     Continue to cooperate with neighboring jurisdictions in evaluating the needs, costs, and benefits of a full
                                              range of options for sewage treatment and export capacity expansion.
Housing
Goal 2:          Attain an adequate amount and distribution of affordable and special needs housing throughout the Tri-Valley.
Goal 3:          Enhance housing choice in the Tri-Valley for Tri-Valley workers.
                 Policy 3:   On a subregional level, work towards a jobs/housing balance.
                 Policy 4:   Strengthen inter-jurisdictional efforts to ensure a fair, equitable, and rational distribution of affordable and special needs
                             housing throughout the Tri-Valley consistent with land-use policies, transportation services, and employment locations.
                             Program 4.1:     Support the efforts of the Tri-Valley Affordable Housing Committee to promote housing for very low-,
                                              low-, and moderate-income households and for people with special needs, including the elderly.
                             Program 4.2:     Seek public/private cooperation to ensure a mutual understanding of subregional housing needs, common
                                              housing development practices, finance marketing, and ways to lower housing costs.
                             Program 4.3:     Establish a cooperative program to designate specific sites for the provision of homeless shelters and
                                              related services, and investigate public and private sources of funding for these facilities and services.
                             Program 4.4:     Continue to look for opportunities to provide shelter and emergency housing in the Tri-Valley, based on
                                              the Sojourner House model.

which meander through the community and create quiet, safe
environments. The street pattern carves out distinct neighborhoods,
each having a diversity of uses: housing, a local park, an elementary

landscaping, street trees, sidewalks, and bicycle paths.
As of January 2007, Pleasanton provided 25,765 housing units
for approximately 68,800 residents. The housing mix included
about 17,200 detached single-family and duet units (67 percent),
and 8,556 attached single-family units and multi-family units (33
percent). 1 According to the 2000 Census, the average household size
for owner-occupied units was 2.87 persons compared to 2.3 persons
for renter-occupied units. The overall residential vacancy rate
remains relatively low at 2.7 percent.

As of 2005, Pleasanton contained about 4,100 businesses 2 (excluding
home occupations) which together employed about 58,110 full- and
part-time workers. 3 Approximately 21 percent of these workers lived
in Pleasanton, another 29 percent lived elsewhere in the Tri-Valley,
and the remaining 50 percent commuted from the greater outlying
area. The location of people’s place of work compared with their
place of residence plays a crucial role in traffic patterns, commuting
time, energy consumption, noise, and air pollution.
Community Facilities
Numerous and varied community facilities and programs characterize
Pleasanton. Almost every neighborhood features a school and a park
within walking distance of its residents. In addition, Pleasanton offers
several large public facilities which serve the entire community such as

AREAS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
Pleasanton Ridgelands
The Pleasanton Ridgelands area includes approximately 13,000 acres
generally bounded by Interstate 580 (I-580) to the north, the 670-foot
elevation near Foothill Road to the east, Niles Canyon Road to the
south, and Palomares Road to the west – excluding the existing
communities of Sunol, Kilkare Canyon, and Castlewood. Part of the
Ridgelands area is within the City of Hayward, part within Pleasanton,
and the remainder in unincorporated land of Alameda County.
The Ridgelands area consists of ridges and valleys which separate the
Tri-Valley from Castro Valley, Hayward, San Leandro, Union City,
and Fremont. It provides the primary western visual backdrop for
Pleasanton and joins the more westerly ridges in establishing the
topographic edge to Hayward and Castro Valley. This predominantly              View of ridgelands behind Pleasanton Avenue commercial building

area. This area will be the subject of a future specific plan (see
following Specific Plan Areas section).
The quarry lands create a valuable urban separator between
Pleasanton and Livermore. This land should be carefully studied
during specific plan preparation, and its qualities as an urban separator
should be substantially protected. The lake areas should be restored
to a safe and natural condition, and wildlife areas should be
regenerated to the fullest extent feasible. The future specific plan
should be closely coordinated with affected property owners, the City
of Livermore, Zone 7 Water Agency, and Alameda County.

Growth Management Program
The City adopted its first growth management ordinance in 1978,
designed to regulate the location and rate of new residential growth
in a period of sewage treatment constraints and air quality concerns.
The growth management program was modified following the
comprehensive revisions to the General Plan in 1986 and 1996.
Currently the Growth Management Ordinance:
       Establishes an annual limit for new residential units.
       Requires the apportionment of yearly total new residential units
        to categories of projects (i.e., affordable projects; major
        projects; first-come, first-served projects; small projects).
       Defines a process for obtaining an allocation under the program.
                                                                                               Older homes along Saint Mary Street

based on a variety of personal, financial, and locational factors.
Workers often make a trade between housing cost and length of com-
mute with some choosing to undertake a longer commute for more
affordable housing and others paying a higher housing cost for a
shorter commute. Therefore, a certain percentage of workers will
choose to live and work within the same community, such as
Pleasanton, a certain percentage within the same commute area, such
as the Tri-Valley, and a certain percentage will choose to live great
distances away from their places of employment. The essence of the
jobs/housing issue is to recognize these different types of commute
behaviors, to provide adequate housing opportunities within the
commute area desired by each group of workers, and to provide a
variety of employment opportunities for residents.
Planning to accommodate this diversity of commute patterns
involves identifying and providing for employment-generated
housing needs on three geographic levels – the community, the
commute area, and the region (such as the Bay Area). State law

managing traffic congestion have been major challenges in the past
and will continue into the future. This General Plan seeks to maintain
and enhance the community’s high quality of life and to incorporate
innovative “smart growth” planning strategies such as mixed-use and
transit-oriented development (TOD) to address challenges such as
housing choice and traffic congestion, and to further the goal of
creating a more sustainable and energy efficient city.
Smart growth, mixed-use development, and transit-oriented
development all have the potential to result in a more efficient use of
land and other resources, and therefore a more sustainable
community compared to conventional development. For example,
multifamily residential development utilizes land and construction
materials more efficiently, and can result in heating, cooling, and
water-use efficiencies compared to single-family construction.
Mixed-use development adjacent to transit can encourage walking

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Sustainability
Goal 1:         Create a land use pattern that promotes resource sustainability and environmental quality.
                Policy 1:    Integrate energy efficiency, energy conservation, and energy self-sufficiency measures into land-use planning.
                             Program 1.1:      Biennially assess community sustainability and quality of life in Pleasanton through measures such as:
                                               traffic congestion and delay, energy use, water quality and availability, fiscal sustainability, air quality,
                                               extent of tree canopy, and park acreage and bike path/trail miles per capita.
                             Program 1.2:      When reviewing development projects (especially in areas where there is likely to be the most change
                                               and the greatest impact can be made), consider how the following will impact energy use: density,
                                               neighborhood design, proximity to transit, proximity to shopping/employment, walkability, street
                                               layout, and construction techniques (Green Building). Develop new measures of sustainability based
                                               on these factors and adopt minimum sustainability scores for typical projects.
                             Program 1.3:      When reviewing development projects, review transportation energy-efficiency measures alongside
                                               level-of-service standards. Develop a methodology to accomplish this and then adopt it.
                             Program 1.4:      Consider using software tools to assist in the evaluation of the energy efficiency of development
                                               proposals.
                             Program 1.5:      Support more locally-serving shopping opportunities in neighborhoods so that people do not have to
                                               drive far to purchase goods.
                             Program 1.6:      Encourage local employers to hire locally.
                             Program 1.7:      Use the City’s housing programs to encourage people who work in Pleasanton to live in Pleasanton.
                Policy 2:    Integrate land-use and transportation planning in order to ensure patterns that facilitate safe and convenient mobility
                             of people and goods at a reasonable cost, and to increase travel alternatives to the single-occupant automobiles.
                             Program 2.1:      Reduce the need for vehicular traffic by locating employment, residential, and service activities close
                                               together, and plan development so it is easily accessible by transit, bicycle, and on foot.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                           2-28

                            Program 2.2:    Encourage the reuse of vacant and underutilized parcels and buildings within existing urban areas.
                            Program 2.3:    Require transit-compatible development near BART stations, along transportation corridors, in
                                            business parks and the Downtown, and at other activity centers, where feasible.
                            Program 2.4:    Require higher residential and commercial densities in the proximity of transportation corridors and
                                            hubs, where feasible.
                            Program 2.5:    Assure that new major commercial, office, and institutional centers are adequately served by transit and
                                            by pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
                            Program 2.6:    Require design features in new development and redeveloped areas to encourage transit, bicycle, and
                                            pedestrian access, such as connections between activity centers and residential areas, and road design
                                            that accommodates transit vehicles, where feasible.
                            Program 2.7:    Allow the location of small-scale neighborhood telecommuting centers and the infrastructure needed
                                            to support them in or near residential areas to enable residents to work close to home, where feasible.
                            Program 2.8:    Require land development that is compatible with alternative transportation modes and the use of
                                            trails, where feasible.
                Policy 3:   When setting land-use policy and when reviewing potential development proposals, make minimizing energy use
                            and impacts on the environment important considerations.
                            Program 3.1:    Establish an advisory committee to the City Council to provide recommendations and policy
                                            implementation regarding energy, environmental projects and priorities, and climate change and to
                                            review the energy and environmental issues relevant to development proposals generally.
Overall Community Development
Goal 2:         Achieve and maintain a complete well-rounded community of desirable neighborhoods, a strong employment base, and a variety
                of community facilities.
                Policy 4:   Allow development consistent with the General Plan Land Use Map.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                        2-29
2005 Pleasanton Plan 2025                                                                                              2.0 Land Use Element
                          Program 4.1:    Ensure consistency between the General Plan Land Use Map and the zoning designation for all
                                          properties within the City’s sphere of influence.
                          Program 4.2:    While mid-points and maximum densities/floor area ratios are used to calculate holding capacity for
                                          planning purposes, these numbers are not entitlements. The appropriate density and intensity will be
                                          determined based on General Plan policies, Specific Plans where appropriate, site conditions, project
                                          design, and other considerations.
                Policy 5: Evaluate land-use changes in the context of overall City welfare and goals, as well as the impacts on surrounding
                          neighborhoods.
                          Program 5.1:    When evaluating development proposals or changes in land use consider General Plan and Specific
                                          Plan policies, Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance standards, existing land uses, environmental impacts,
                                          safety, aircraft noise, and resident, merchant and property owner concerns.
                          Program 5.2:    Consider surrounding land uses and potential impacts when changing land-use designations.
Special Interest Areas
                Policy 6: Develop comprehensive planning documents for undeveloped and underutilized areas of Pleasanton that are
                          changing or have the potential to change. In the planning process, identify facility needs, explore opportunities for
                          mixed-use development, and plan for a comprehensive circulation system.
                          Program 6.1:    Prepare a Specific Plan for East Pleasanton as a coordinated effort between property owners, major
                                          stakeholders, and the Pleasanton community, including residents of East Pleasanton. Although the
                                          General Plan map indicates several types of land use that may be considered in the specific planning
                                          process, this General Plan confers no entitlement to any future development of land in East
                                          Pleasanton.
                          Program 6.2:    Work with the Hacienda Owners Association and other stakeholders to prepare a comprehensive
                                          planned unit development amendment for the Hacienda Business Park.
                Policy 7: Continue to implement adopted specific plans along with relevant rezoning.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                        2-30

Residential
                Policy 8:  Preserve and enhance the character of existing residential neighborhoods.
                           Program 8.1:       Enforce the provisions of the City’s Zoning Ordinance and related planning ordinances to maintain the
                                              character of existing residential neighborhoods.
                           Program 8.2:       Use the City’s development review procedures to minimize intrusions into existing neighborhoods.
                Policy 9:  Develop new housing in infill and peripheral areas which are adjacent to existing residential development, near
                           transportation hubs or local-serving commercial areas.
                           Program 9.1:       Zone vacant infill sites at densities to facilitate development, which includes affordable housing, while
                                              respecting the character of surrounding uses.
                Policy 10: Provide flexibility in residential development standards and housing type consistent with the desired community
                           character.
                           Program 10.1:      Use planned unit development (PUD) zoning for residential properties that have unique characteristics
                                              or to accommodate development that does not fit under standard zoning classifications.
                           Program 10.2:      Residential projects proposed for land designated as Rural Density Residential should be encouraged to
                                              cluster home sites on lots of one acre or larger.
                Policy 11: Residential density is determined by the General Plan density range or applicable specific plan as outlined below:
                           Residential projects proposed for land designated as Low- and Medium-Density Residential should propose densities
                           generally consistent with the average densities assumed for buildout of the General Plan, as shown in Table 2-3.
                           Low- and Medium-Density projects which propose densities greater than the average shown in Table 2-3 should be
                           zoned PUD and contain sufficient public amenities to justify the higher density. Examples of amenities which might
                           qualify a project for density bonus include the provision of affordable housing; and dedication and/or improvement of
                           parkland, open space, and/or trails beyond the standard requirements.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                           2-31

2005 Pleasanton Plan 2025                                                                                                     2.0 Land Use Element
                           Low- and Medium-Density projects zoned PUD may exceed the maximum density shown in Table 2-3 on portions of
                           the site, as long as the overall density for the entire site does not exceed the overall maximum permitted. Housing with
                           increased densities on portions of the parcel shall be sited to minimize potential adverse impacts on adjacent, developed
                           properties.
                           The number of units allowed on parcels zoned PUD shall be consistent with the underlying General Plan Map
                           designation (plus a possible 25 percent density bonus for the provision of significant affordable housing), multiplied by
                           the number of gross developable acres in the parcel unless otherwise determined by a specific plan. Gross Developable
                           Acres shall include all privately owned acreage within a parcel and shall exclude all publicly owned facilities
                           (e.g., City-owned parks, flood control channels, and public school sites) or such sites planned to be purchased by a public
                           agency. Acreage to be devoted to publicly owned facilities dedicated as part of a project (e.g. roadway rights-of-way,
                           parks, and trails) shall be included as “gross developable acres” unless such acreage is rendered undevelopable by other
                           General Plan provisions.
                           While midpoints and maximum densities are used to calculated residential holding capacity for planning purposes, these
                           numbers are not entitlements. The appropriate residential density for properties developed as Planned Unit
                           Developments will be determined by the City Council based on site conditions, project design, General Plan policies, and
                           other considerations.
                           Land containing no slope of less than 25 percent should be limited to one single-family home per existing lot of record.
                           The maximum density of properties designated as High-Density Residential or Mixed-Use shall be determined on a case-
                           by-case basis based on site characteristics, amenities, and affordable housing incorporated into the development.
                           The calculation of residential units based on gross developable acres and General Plan density shall be rounded down to
                           the whole unit if under 0.9 and rounded up where 0.9 and over.
Industrial, Commercial and Office
                Policy 12: Preserve the character of the Downtown while improving its retail and residential viability and preserving the
                           traditions of its small-town character.
                           Program 12.1:       Implement the 2002 Downtown Specific Plan and the necessary rezonings.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                           2-32

                         Program 12.2:    Prepare a Civic Center Master Plan to determine the future location and footprint of an expanded
                                          library, consolidated City Hall, Police Station, public parking, and other uses. The Master Plan should
                                          consider transit-oriented development, include public open spaces and plazas, and add to Downtown
                                          vitality, while also maintaining the character and ambiance of Downtown.
                         Program 12.3:    In the Downtown, implement mixed-use development which incorporates higher density and
                                          affordable residential units consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan., where feasible.
                         Program 12.4:    Encourage second-floor apartments above first-floor commercial uses and live-work units in the
                                          Downtown. Also allow mixed-use development in the Downtown where residences are located
                                          behind commercial uses.
                         Program 12.5:    Consider drafting an ordinance that protects the right of businesses to operate in the Downtown
                                          commercial area.
              Policy 13: Ensure that neighborhood, community, and regional commercial centers provide goods and services needed by
                         residents and businesses of Pleasanton and its market area.
                         Program 13.1:    Zone sufficient land for neighborhood, community, and regional commercial uses to support
                                          Pleasanton’s increasing business activity.
              Policy 14: Provide adequate neighborhood commercial acreage to serve the future needs of each neighborhood at buildout.
                         Program 14.1:    Locate appropriately-scaled commercial centers with reasonable access to the residential
                                          neighborhoods they serve.
                         Program 14.2:    For large-scale commercial projects, require the preparation of a fiscal impact and market study that is
                                          peer-reviewed or vetted by City staff to determine the costs and benefits of the project for the City and
                                          the economic viability of the project.
              Policy 15: Encourage industrial, commercial, and office development which is compatible with environmental constraints in
                         Pleasanton.
                         Program 15.1:    Encourage business parks and large employers to provide on-site childcare facilities.

                                 Program 15.3:      Generally discourage the redesignation of commercial, business park, and industrial land to residential
                                                    use, except for the area surrounding the BART Stations. Encourage the designation of land as mixed-
                                                    use where impacts can be mitigated, and where there is potential to reduce traffic and facilitate
                                                    affordable housing.
                                 Program 15.4 :     Require non-residential projects to provide a landscape buffer between new non-residential
                                                    development and areas designated for residential use.
                                 Program 15.5:      Industrial, retail, and office projects should generally conform to the average densities assumed in
                                                    Table 2-3. However, projects proposing intensities greater than the average assumed in Table 2-3 may
                                                    be allowed up to the maximum indicated, provided that sufficient amenities and mitigations are
                                                    incorporated into the project to justify the increased density.
Mixed Use
                Policy 16:       Encourage mixed-use development which encompasses any combination of commercial development, housing units,
                                 or community facilities in an integrated development. In areas served by transit, encourage mixed use and
                                 residential densities that support affordable housing and transit.
                Policy 17:       The specific location of land uses, appropriate floor area ratios, and residential densities in mixed-use areas will be
                                 determined by the City Council through the planned unit development process or through the preparation of specific
                                 plans.
                Policy 18:       Establish a well-planned mixture of land uses around the BART Stations.
                                 Program 18.1:      Work with the Hacienda Owners Association to prepare a comprehensive planned unit development
                                                    amendment for the Hacienda Business Park with special emphasis on creating a mixed-use, pedestrian-
                                                    friendly area around the East Pleasanton/Dublin BART Station. This General Plan confers no
                                                    additional development entitlement above what is currently entitled in Hacienda.

                         Program 18.2:    Provide land use flexibility for the Hacienda Business Park, portions of Stoneridge Mall area, and other
                                          areas through the Mixed Use/Business Park, and Mixed Use land use designations. The intent is to
                                          plan for a mixed use area sufficient to accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs
                                          Determination.
                         Program 18.3:    Use the development review process to reduce or mitigate any potential adverse impacts (noise, odor,
                                          parking, light and glare, etc.) related to allowing a mix of land uses in Hacienda.
Open Space
              Policy 19: Preserve designated open space areas for the protection of public health and safety, the provision of recreational
                         opportunities, agriculture and grazing, the production of natural resources, the preservation of wildlands, water
                         management and recreation, and the physical separation of Pleasanton from neighboring communities.
                         Program 19.1:    Preserve open space by way of fee purchase, developer dedications, conservation and scenic easements,
                                          transfer of development rights, Williamson Act contracts, open-space zoning categories, and other
                                          means which may become available.
              Policy 20: In the Ridgelands, preserve the remaining agricultural open space.
                         Program 20.1:    The base density for agricultural areas in the Ridgelands is 100 acres per building site. New homes may
                                          be located only on a legal building site, must not interfere with agricultural use in the area, and must not
                                          interfere with documented public agency plans to connect or create trails and open space areas.
                                          Measure F may not be amended as to land-use designations nor repealed except by a vote of the citizens
                                          of Pleasanton.
              Policy 21: Preserve scenic hillside and ridge views of the Pleasanton, Main, and Southeast Hills ridges (Measure QQ, Nov.
                         2008).
                         Program 21.1:    Continue to implement the land-use and development standards of the Pleasanton Ridgelands Initiative
                                          of 1993 (Measure F).
                         Program 21.2:    Study the feasibility of preserving large open-space areas in the Southeast Hills by a combination of
                                          private open-space and a public park system (Measure QQ, Nov. 2008).

                           Program 21.3:        Ridgelines and hillsides shall be protected. Housing units and structures shall not be placed on slopes
                                                of 25 percent or greater, or within 100 vertical feet of a ridgeline. No grading to construct residential or
                                                commercial structures shall occur on hillside slopes 25 percent or greater, or within 100 vertical feet of
                                                a ridgeline. Exempt from this policy are housing developments of 10 or fewer housing units on a
                                                single property. Splitting dividing, or subdividing a “legal parcel” to approve more than 10 housing

Growth Management
Goal 3:       Develop in an efficient, logical, and orderly fashion.
              Policy 22:   Maintain a permanent Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) beyond which urban development shall not be permitted.
                           Program 22.1:        Permit only non-urban uses beyond the Urban Growth Boundary.
                           Program 22.2:        Extend urban services only to areas within the Urban Growth Boundary, with the following possible
                                                exceptions for selected urban services: (1) areas beyond the boundary where the public health and
                                                safety present overriding considerations; (2) as to water service, areas which are within the boundaries
                                                of the former Pleasanton County Township Water District and where the service extension is
                                                consistent with the 1967 Joint Powers Agreement between the City and the District; (3) on reclaimed
                                                land which is currently designated as Sand and Gravel Harvesting in East Pleasanton when the
                                                potential future use is non-urban.
                           Program 22.3:        Because the Urban Growth Boundary is considered to be permanent, future adjustments to the
                                                boundary line location are discouraged; provided, however, minor adjustments may be granted that
                                                meet all of the following criteria: (1) are otherwise consistent with the goals and policies of the General
                                                Plan; (2) would not have a significant adverse impact on agriculture, wildland areas, or scenic ridgeline
                                                views; (3) are contiguous with existing urban development or with property for which all discretionary
                                                approvals for urban development have been granted; (4) would not induce further adjustments to the
                                                boundary; and (5) demonstrate that the full range of urban public facilities and services will be
                                                adequately provided in an efficient and timely manner.
                           Program 22.4:        Encourage lower intensity uses immediately inside the Urban Growth Boundary, as necessary, to
                                                prevent potential land use conflicts with outlying non-urban uses.

                                 residents of a predictable growth rate.
                                 Program 23.1:     Review and modify the City’s Growth Management Program to ensure an orderly process for
                                                   developing residential units to ensure that the City’s goals for affordable housing and energy

                                 Program 23.2:     Prepare a “Growth Management” report as needed on which the City Council can base its Growth
                                                   Management allocations.
                Policy 24:       Annex urbanized pockets of unincorporated land adjacent to the city limits in areas where landowners are willing to
                                 accept City services and development standards.
                                 Program 24.1:     Explore methods of annexing the remaining unincorporated pockets of urbanized land.
                Policy 25:       Encourage development in locations which would complete or install planned public facility systems.
                                 Program 25.1:     Invest in public facilities and amenities that support infill development.
                                 Program 25.2:     Assure that services to existing developed areas are maintained at an acceptable level when new
                                                   development occurs.
Citizen Participation
Goal 4:         Encourage the participation of residents, businesses, and neighboring jurisdictions in planning for community development.
                Policy 26:       Encourage the participation and collaboration of Pleasanton residents and businesses in land-use planning and

The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide policies and             An extensive roadway network which includes freeways, arterials,
maps which indicate the general location and extent of existing and           collectors and local streets serves Pleasanton. Table 3-1 lists existing

The City of Pleasanton embraces the concept of sustainable
development and planning. A sustainable city draws from the
environment only those resources that are necessary and that can be
used or recycled perpetually, or returned to the environment in a form
that nature can use to generate more resources. Relating the
sustainability concept to circulation, this Circulation Element
encourages alternatives to fossil-fuel consumption, encourages
walking and bicycling as well as high-occupancy vehicle use, and
provides public facilities and programs in ways that reduce motor
vehicle-trips and energy usage. Thus schools, libraries, parks and
recreational facilities, community facilities, cultural arts, human
services, businesses, and jobs should be readily accessed by walking,
bicycle riding, transit, carpools, or linked automobile trips. Overall,
the Circulation Element includes goals, policies, and programs that
seek to improve the links between jobs, housing, and community
services and amenities, and to increase the functionality of the
circulation system for all users.

include older streets which were built prior to modern road standards
and streets where the rights-of-way are insufficient for roadway
improvements.
Pleasanton also has standards for acceptable levels of traffic
congestion within the city. These level-of-service (LOS) standards
generally require developers of major projects to limit traffic volumes
to LOS D or better (see Table 3-3 level-of-service definitions)
throughout Pleasanton or provide mitigation measures which will
ensure that traffic volumes meet this standard. Potential mitigation
measures include traffic signals; roadway improvements such as street
widening or turn lanes; traffic trip reductions such as ridesharing
(carpools and vanpools), bicycling, walking, public transit, preferential
parking, and flexible working hours; or limiting the density or type of
land uses. There are a few exceptions to the LOS standard within
Pleasanton. The exceptions are in the Downtown Area and at the
City of Pleasanton gateway intersections (i.e., constrained gateways).                                          Main Street at Rose Avenue / Neal Street

                                      LOS A describes driving conditions with average delays of 10 seconds or fewer per vehicle. When traffic
           A            < 10.0        signals are synchronized, this level of service allows for most vehicles to arrive during the green light. The

                                      LOS E describes very congested driving conditions with delays averaging up to 80 seconds per vehicle. This
           E          55.1-80.0       high congestion allows for very poor progression down the main street and green lights are frequently not long

                                      LOS F describes very congested driving conditions where the number of vehicles arriving at an intersection
                                      exceeds the capacity of the intersection. Average delays exceed 80 seconds and most drivers have to wait for

safety concern. Its construction increased the capacity through the
interchange but also has created additional vehicular demand on I-
580. In the evening peak hour, the existing four-lane eastbound I-580
is unable to accommodate this additional traffic, resulting in more
congestion throughout the corridor. This congestion has started to
spill back onto the I-680 corridor to a point where the congestion
now extends both the morning and evening commute periods well
beyond one hour.
The congestion of the regional traffic system impacts Pleasanton’s
local roadway circulation. As the freeway system becomes congested,
motorists search for faster routes, such as using local roadways to
bypass the freeway congestion. The result is additional vehicles in the
Pleasanton circulation network with non-Pleasanton destinations and
origins. This is most readily apparent at the local freeway interchanges.

As can be seen from Table 3-6, the largest volume roadway segments
in Pleasanton are on the major arterials approaching the interstate
freeway system. Figure 3-3 and Figure 3-4 show existing morning and
evening peak-hour traffic volumes, respectively. Approximately
80 percent of Pleasanton jobs are performed by workers who reside
outside of Pleasanton. 3 Conversely, approximately 70 percent of
Pleasanton residents work outside of Pleasanton. This dynamic
results in the majority of Pleasanton’s workforce leaving the City in
the morning, and being replaced by the working population. This is
reversed in the afternoon commute, creating significant trips on the
arterial system going to and from the freeways.
In addition to morning and evening peak commute hours, the City of
Pleasanton has a school-related commute that adds to traffic con-
gestion. In the morning, the school peak coincides with the morning
commute peak creating additional congestion on the local roadway                                         Traffic on Hopyard Road at Owens Drive

rail transportation goals. The plan identifies opportunities to expand
existing facilities such as BART, CalTrain, and ACE, as well as
incorporate plans for a new high speed rail system into the existing
regional rail network. In the Tri-Valley Area, the Plan recommends
an extension of BART to Livermore, with a connection to improved
rail service over the Altamont Corridor. Improved rail service will
likely be connected to the The California High-Speed Rail. The
California High-Speed Rail Authority, with the Federal Rail
Administration, has prepared a programmatic EIR/EIS that further
examines the San Francisco Bay Area to Central Valley region. This

Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
The City of Pleasanton’s Community Trails Master Plan provides general
direction as to the proposed location of pedestrian and bicycle
recreational facilities. The City has received funding to create a
pedestrian and bicycle master plan to explicitly address on-street
facilities that will complement and expand on the existing Community
Trails Master Plan. See Figure 3-13 for existing and proposed
pedestrian and bicycle trails and paths. The proposed plan will
prioritize projects, establish new standards for bicycle and
pedestrian facilities, and be incorporated into the Alameda Countywide
Bicycle Plan and the Alameda Countywide Strategic Pedestrian Plan.
The goal of the proposed pedestrian and bicycle master plan is to
make Pleasanton a city where walking and biking are viable

Best Workplaces for Commuters in October 2006. The list
commends Bay Area employers committed to improving the quality
of life for employees, while at the same time helping to reduce traffic
and air pollution. In addition to recognizing individual employers, the
coalition also designated the Hacienda Business Park as one of the
best districts for commuters, in recognition of the wide variety of
commute alternatives available in the Park.
The City’s Commendable Commutes program is a partnership
between the City of Pleasanton and local employers with 75 or more
employees to help reduce peak-hour traffic and air pollution through
the promotion of transportation alternatives. Employers who wish to
enroll in the program enter into a participation agreement with the
City and agree to develop a trip-reduction program and goals, conduct
a bi-annual transportation survey, and appoint a management-level                             Dial-A-Ride Bus at Kaiser Medical Center

implement the objectives described in this Element.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                      3-45

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Streets and Highways
Goal 1:          Develop a safe, convenient and uncongested circulation system.
Goal 2:          Develop and manage a local and regional street and highway system which accommodates future growth while maintaining
                 acceptable levels of service.
                 Policy 1:    Complete the City’s street and highway system in accordance with the General Plan Map, Figures 3-7 and 3-10, and
                              Table 3-8.
                              Program 1.1:     Require new developments to pay for their fair share of planned roadway improvement costs.
                              Program 1.2:     Update the Traffic Development Fee study consistent with improvements needed to implement the
                                               General Plan circulation system.
                              Program 1.3:     Support the use of assessment districts to equitably spread the cost of new roadways and improvements
                                               and to facilitate installation of improvements with development.
                              Program 1.4:     Continue to implement the North Pleasanton Improvement District infrastructure cost sharing fee for
                                               non-participatory properties which benefit from the District. Review and modify the North Pleasanton
                                               Improvement District for future development not anticipated when the District was implemented.
                              Program 1.5:     Preserve rights-of-way needed for local and regional roadway improvements through dedication of land,
                                               as adjacent properties develop.
                              Program 1.6:     Open the Stoneridge Drive extension to through traffic when Pleasanton reaches an agreement with its
                                               regional partners (i.e., the cities of Livermore and Dublin, the County of Alameda) for a strategic
                                               approach and funding plan for relieving traffic congestion in the Tri-Valley. This agreement will be
                                               embodied in a policy/plan adopted by the City Council (following a public hearing) that includes
                                               a plan which prioritizes funding for improvements to I-580, I-680, and State Route 84 and requires
                                               completion of a regional arterial network that includes Dublin Boulevard, Jack London Boulevard, North
                                               Canyons Parkway, and the Stoneridge Drive extension. As elsewhere, the City is committed to creating a
                                               safe environment on the Stoneridge Drive extension, consistent with General Plan policies as applied
                                               throughout the City.
Adopted 07 21 09                                                                 3-46

                               Program 1.7:        If the General Plan is amended to include on the General Plan Map the West Las Positas Boulevard / I-
                                                   680 Interchange and the City Council votes to construct such Interchange, it shall do so conditionally
                                                   and shall defer actual implementation for a period of one year in order to allow citizens who may disagree
                                                   with the decision the opportunity to circulate an initiative measure to delete the interchange from the
                                                   General Plan Map and to amend the General Plan in other respects so as to maintain internal
                                                   consistency. The process for implementing construction may proceed if: (a) a Notice of Intent to
                                                   Circulate Petition is not filed with the City Clerk within 30 days of the Council’s decision to implement
                                                   the interchange’s construction; (b) a Notice of Intent is filed but a sufficient number of signatures is not
                                                   gathered within six months of the filing of the Notice; or (c) the initiative measure fails.
                 Policy 2:     Phase development and roadway improvements so that levels of service at adjacent major intersections do not
                               exceed LOS D at major intersections outside Downtown and gateway intersections, except as noted below. 6
                               Program 2.1:        Monitor roadway improvements to determine if levels of service are approaching congestion according
                                                   to City standards.
                               Program 2.2:        Require site-specific traffic studies for all major developments which have the potential to cause the level
                                                   of service at one or more major intersections to exceed LOS D, and require developers to implement the
                                                   mitigation measures identified in these studies. In general, require development to improve congested
                                                   intersections adjacent to such development or to pay its pro-rata share of the cost of such improvements,
                                                   and to pay traffic development fees for use in mitigating traffic impacts in other areas of the city.
                               Program 2.3:        Exempt conditionally the Santa Rita Road / Valley Avenue intersection from the City’s LOS D standard
                                                   in that the mitigation of adding a third southbound left turn lane is a short-term mitigation, with buildout
                                                   mitigation being the Stoneridge Drive extension. The City Council shall decide if and when this
                                                   intersection modification is needed, for example, in conjunction with development projects which add
                                                   traffic to it. Projects which add traffic to this intersection, but are not required to improve this
                                                   intersection because of the exemption, will only pay Traffic Development Fees as mitigation for their
                                                   impact on this intersection.
                               Program 2.4: Use the City’s Baseline Traffic Report to address specific criteria to establish when a traffic impact study
                                                   is required for a development proposal and to identify the scope and contents of the traffic report.
6  Major intersections are those intersections of two or more arterials or one arterial and one collector street. Gateway intersections are intersections located at the edges of the city.

2005 Pleasanton Plan 2025                                                                                                    3.0 Circulation Element
                           Program 2.5: Continuously upgrade the City’s traffic computer and signal system to better monitor traffic flows and to
                                             translate traffic volumes into levels of service.
                           Program 2.6: Report intersections that have the potential to exceed level of service D in a regular baseline report to
                                             City Council and affected developers.
                           Program 2.7: Require feasible mitigation measures to keep intersections impacted by development to acceptable
                                             service levels, in the event that LOS D is exceeded. If there are no feasible mitigation measures and if
                                             the intersections are otherwise not exempt from the LOS D standard, withhold development approvals,
                                             including building permits, until the intersections exceeding LOS D are at an acceptable level of service.
                           Program 2.8: Strongly encourage public transit and regional projects that skirt traffic around Pleasanton rather than
                                             through it to mitigate LOS problems in the city.
                 Policy 3: Facilitate the free flow of vehicular traffic on major arterials.
                           Program 3.1:      Continually update computer-control technology for traffic lights.          Continue to coordinate and
                                             synchronize computer-controlled traffic signals on major city streets.
                           Program 3.2:      Prohibit additional private-access driveways onto major arterials.
                           Program 3.3:      Minimize traffic signal delays to less than 100 seconds, whenever possible.
                           Program 3.4:      Make street improvements as appropriate to reduce traffic queuing and delay.
                           Program 3.5:      Discourage additional on-street parking on arterials.
                 Policy 4: In the Downtown, facilitate the flow of traffic and access to Downtown businesses and activities consistent with
                           maintaining a pedestrian-friendly environment.
                           Program 4.1:        Downtown intersections shown in the Downtown Specific Plan are exempted from the citywide LOS D
                                               standard. Consideration may be given to improvements at Downtown intersections when it is clear
                                               that such improvements are necessary and are consistent with the pedestrian-friendly environment as
                                               established in the Downtown Specific Plan.
                 Policy 5: At gateway intersections, facilitate the flow of traffic and access into and out of the City, consistent with maintaining
                           visual character, landscaping, and pedestrian convenience.

                           Program 6.4:     Notify all residents and property owners who may be directly affected by potential street closures and
                                            traffic re-routing in advance of taking such actions.
                           Program 6.5:     Prohibit Mohr Avenue and Valley Avenue as a truck route or primary access to industrial development
                                            to the east.
                           Program 6.6:     Discourage residential driveway access directly onto residential collector streets.
                 Policy 7: Adhere to City design standards for streets in new developments.
                           Program 7.1:     Incorporate City design standards for arterials, collectors, neighborhood collectors, and local public and
                                            private streets as part of the City’s review of new developments.
                           Program 7.2:     Provide more than one access road for emergency vehicle routes to new developments, whenever
                                            feasible.
                           Program 7.3:     Design complete streets serving pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders of all ages and
                                            abilities, except where infeasible. Complete streets may include: alternative intersection control where
                                            appropriate; requiring bicycle and pedestrian connections from cul-de-sacs to adjacent streets, trails,

This 5th Cycle Housing Element focuses on the 2015–2023 planning
period, consistent with the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) and State law requirements. It builds upon the goals, policies
and implementing programs contained in the City’s 2007-2014, 4th
Cycle Housing Element, and contains an updated analysis of existing
and projected housing needs, identification of sites for future housing
development, in particular, high density housing, a review of potential
constraints to housing, identification of adequate sites for all types of
housing, and updated policies and implementing programs and
objectives to address the existing and projected needs of all economic
segments of the community. For detailed information regarding

HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The Housing Element’s intent with respect to housing needs in Pleasanton is expressed in two ways. The first is in the form of goals and
objectives sought by the community. A goal is the ideal we strive for –– or the desired state of things. State law requires that the City’s housing
objectives establish the maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated or conserved between the years 2015 and 2023.
The second, and more specific aspects of the Housing Element, are policy statements and implementation programs. These describe the way citizens,
local government, and other involved agencies or organizations can achieve objectives, and move closer to the City’s goals. Policies establish a
recognized community position on a particular subject. Programs are more detailed actions that the City, or other specific entities, will implement to
ensure the attainment of the Housing Element’s goal and objectives.
The following goals, policies, and programs will guide the City over the 2015–2023 Housing Element planning period. By identifying the
responsible agency, time period, objective, and funding source, the following programs constitute the required quantifiable objectives for the
Housing Element. The intent of the Housing Element is to address the housing needs of all income levels. In particular, the housing needs of
extremely low, very low, and low-income households are explicitly mentioned because special emphasis on these income groups is needed.
Programs relying on the City’s Lower Income Housing Fund are intended to specifically address the needs of extremely low income, very low
income and low income households.
In some cases programs implement several goals and policies; therefore programs apply to all goals and policies within the applicable section.

                             objective of this program is to ensure that adequate sites are available to accommodate the City’s regional housing need
                             for all income levels.

                            districts to be designed at the maximum height allowed for multiple-family residential zoning districts, consistent with
                            neighborhood character; however in the Downtown, multiple-family residential building height should be consistent with
                            the design policies of the Downtown Specific Plan and the Downtown Design Guidelines.

                           standards are met.
              Policy 5:    Apply for Federal and State grants offered for mixed-use development near transit centers.
              Policy 6:    Actively promote the creation of second units on single-family residential lots and their maintenance as sources of
                           housing affordable to moderate-, low-, and very low-income households.
                            Program 6.1: Continue monitoring second units to determine if they are being rented and, if so, determine their rent
                            levels. Include conditions of approval for second unit Administrative Design Review approvals requiring a monitoring

                            the program. Incentives should include fee reductions or waivers and information/assistance to help homeowners be
                            landlords. Such incentives should be made available to applicants of second units during the Administrative Design

5. PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Public Safety Element – a required element of
the General Plan – is to provide information, policies, and programs
directed toward reducing the potential for human injury and loss of
life, and to minimize property damage and economic and social
disruption due to natural and human-made hazards.
RISKS OF HAZARDS
All urban areas in California are subject to a variety of naturally-
occurring hazards as well as hazards caused by human activities.
Risks to life and property within the Planning Area are most
commonly posed by geology (earthquakes; landslides; fire; flood;
aviation, train and auto accidents; and the accidental discharge of
hazardous materials. None of these hazards can be avoided entirely                    Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Station Number 4
or mitigated completely. However, potentially devastating impacts

The Pleasanton Planning Area is located within the Amador Valley,

Two non-earthquake related geologic hazards exist in the Planning
Area: landslides (not related to seismic shaking) and expansive soils.
Landslides
Landsliding is a natural process of relatively rapid downslope
movement of soil, rock, and rock debris as a mass. The rate of
landsliding is affected by the type and extent of vegetation, the slope
angle, the degree of water saturation, the strength of the rocks, and
the mass and thickness of the deposit. Some of the natural causes of
this instability are earthquakes, weak materials, stream and coastal
erosion, and heavy rainfall. In addition, certain human activities
tend to make the earth materials less stable and increase the chances
of ground failure. Activities contributing to instability include
extensive irrigation, poor drainage or groundwater withdrawal,                            Open space and hillside development in Pleasanton

Liquefaction is a specialized form of ground failure caused by
earthquake ground motion. It is a quicksand condition, occurring in
water-saturated, unconsolidated, and relatively clay-free sands and
silts caused by hydraulic pressure (from ground motion) forcing
apart soil particles, and forcing those into quicksand-like liquid
suspension. In the process, ground materials that are normally firm
but wet take on the characteristics of liquids. The potential for
liquefaction depends on soil conditions and groundwater levels,
which may fluctuate. Susceptibility to this hazard is greatest when
                                                                                                                                                                 US Geological

     Alluvial deposits are water-transported sediments such as clays, sands, and/or
     gravels. Fluvial deposits are those produced by action of, or found in, a river

In order to implement fire protection measures, the Pleasanton
Municipal Code contains four sections that bear directly on fire
safety. The Building Code provides minimum standards for design,
construction, materials, occupancy, location, and maintenance of all
buildings within the city. The Fire Code regulates how a building is
used, how machines and equipment are maintained, how hazardous
materials are handled and stored, and how access to and from a site
is provided. The Zoning Ordinance regulates site location and
design, the type and intensity of land uses, building height and
separation, access, and street layout. The Subdivision Ordinance
establishes standards for roadway dimensions, subdivision layout,
and public improvements needed to protect public safety. In
addition, City departments review all proposed new developments
for their potential effects on public safety, and attach conditions to
minimize those effects and conduct inspections to ensure proper
installation.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Seismic Safety
Goal 1:         Minimize the risks to lives and property, and minimize the potential liability to the City due to seismic activity within
                the Planning Area.
                Policy 1:          Restrict development in areas prone to seismic safety hazards.
                                   Program 1.1:  Comply with the Alquist-Priolo Act and other seismic safety criteria established by the City of Pleasanton
                                   Program 1.2:  Prohibit construction of habitable structures within at least 50 feet of an identified active fault trace where
                                                 the fault has been specifically located in site-specific geologic studies.
                                   Program 1.3:  Prohibit construction of a habitable structure within at least 100 feet of the most likely line of the fault
                                                 trace, if the active fault trace is approximately located, concealed or inferred. The applicant’s geologist
                                                 (with concurrence from the City’s peer review geologist) shall identify the most likely line of the fault
                                                 trace. This program applies only to new development approved after date of adoption and does not make
                                                 non-conforming those structures approved under policies and regulations allowing structures at least 50
                                                 feet from a fault trace.
                                   Program 1.4:  Prohibit construction of facilities and systems vital to the public health and safety (e.g., water facilities, fire
                                                 stations, hospitals, communication facilities, etc.) within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones.
                Policy 2:          Investigate the potential for seismic hazards during the development review process, and implement soils
                                   engineering and construction standards which minimize potential danger from earthquakes.
                                   Program 2.1:  Require site-specific soils, geologic, and/or geotechnical engineering studies prior to development approval
                                                 of structures for human occupancy for any project proposed within areas shown on current Alquist-Priolo

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The main purpose of the Water Element is to consolidate information      facilities including water wells, reservoirs, sewer and waterlines,
and polices related to the conservation and management of water          treatment plants, stormwater control, and drainage, all of which are
resources, riparian corridors, 1 and watershed lands. The Water          parts of the infrastructure that support development. By including

During normal year peak periods, Pleasanton can currently rely, in
total, on a delivery or supply capacity of approximately 34.4 mgd
through the current infrastructure system (25.4 mgd from Zone 7 and
9.0 mgd from the City’s wells). Under normal water supply
conditions, the City has sufficient water supply to deliver to its users.
Recent planned improvements to the City and Zone 7’s delivery
system will ensure that ample water supplies meet maximum-day
demands. Thus through at least 2012, the City can meet water
demands in accordance with its Water System Master Plan standards
without adding additional facilities. Depending upon the timing and
location of demands, this date could be further in the future.

flooding. Flooding could be aggravated by several problems. First,                            programs sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
sediment accumulates in the arroyos and reduces their capacity.                               (FEMA) and desires to increase public awareness about flooding.
Second, removing sediment has the potential for disturbing
established wetland habitat. Finally, expanding the size of existing
channels would cause significant biological effects. In response to
these problems, Zone 7 will divert peak flows from Arroyo las Positas
and Arroyo Mocho to the Chain of Lakes and will, where possible,
remove excess arroyo sediment. 15
Alameda County developed the “chain of lakes” concept in the 1970s.
The Chain of Lakes are located between the cities of Livermore and
Pleasanton and, when complete, will consist of a series of abandoned
gravel quarry pits converted into nine lakes, linked in a series, plus
Cope Lake. 16 Thus far the County owns two of these lakes, and will
acquire one around 2014 and two more by 2030. The lakes are used
for seasonal waterstorage and conveyance, and floodwater detention.

Stormwater Management
Historically, the City has focused stormwater runoff management
efforts on reducing downstream flooding risks by providing storm
drain systems in developed areas. However, stormwater runoff also
carries urban pollutants, which create water-quality problems in
downstream water bodies and which, in turn, impact aquatic life and
the overall ecosystem health.
Because the Federal Clean Water Act requires municipalities to
implement stormwater management programs, the City prepared the
Phase I Storm Water Program in 1989 and Phase II program in 2001.
To protect water quality, municipalities – under newly established

GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Goal 1:          Preserve and protect water resources and supply for long-term sustainability.
                 Policy 1   To ensure sustainability, promote the conservation of water resources.
                            Program 1.1:     Prohibit water supply production policies and practices which would deplete groundwater resources
                                             below existing sustainable levels.
                            Program 1.2:     Foster water conservation practices which do not allow depletion of groundwater and surface water
                                             resources to the extent that they cannot be replaced within the same water season.
                            Program 1.3:     Support Zone 7 Water Agency in water supply production, treatment, and procurement practices that
                                             do not negatively impact the environment.
                            Program 1.4:     Work with Zone 7 Water Agency to investigate innovative and more efficient ways to recharge aquifers

                            Program 1.9:     Continue to demonstrate low water-use techniques at community garden and City-owned facilities.
                            Program 1.10:    During construction or reconstruction of public facilities, institute water conservation measures such as
                                             hot-on-demand water faucets, low-flush toilets, low water-using appliances, and low water-using
                                             irrigation devices and/or water-conserving landscaping.
                            Program 1.11:    Retrofit existing public facilities, as feasible, to institute water conservation measures.
                            Program 1.12:    Compile a list of recommended landscaping species, including trees, that are native and drought tolerant.
                                             Include discussion of any wildlife habitat values of these species. Compile a list of noxious and invasive
                                             species and educate the public about their disadvantages. Distribute these lists to the public and make

days during the summer months is an important factor that affects air
pollution potential. Although climate and topography influence air
pollution potential, air pollution also depends upon total
contaminants emitted in the surrounding area and/or the amount
transported from more distant places. Pollutants such as ozone,
created by photochemical processes – sunshine and certain chemicals
– in the air, may result in high concentrations many miles downwind
from the sources of the original chemicals.
Wind data for the Livermore Municipal Airport show wind
predominantly blowing from the west and southwest, reflecting the
location of the Hayward Canyon and Niles Canyon gaps in the East
Bay Hills. Winds are generally highest in the afternoon and lowest at
dawn. From 1998 to 2005, BAAQMD measured average wind speeds
between 12 and 13 miles per hour (mph) and maximum gusts between
47 and 56 mph.4 Calm conditions occur about one fourth of the
time.5

The Tri-Valley subregional air basin, in which Pleasanton is located,
also contains the growing communities of Livermore, Dublin, San
Ramon, and Danville. The Tri-Valley area is located generally
downwind with respect to the rest of the Bay Area, so that pollutants
released upwind contaminate the air stream into the Tri-Valley area.
In turn, winds transport pollutants generated within the Tri-Valley
easterly through the Altamont Pass into the San Joaquin Valley.
The combined effects of frequent light or calm winds, frequent
inversions that restrict vertical dilution, and terrain that restricts
horizontal dilution give Pleasanton a relatively high atmospheric
potential for pollution.
AIR POLLUTANTS AND STANDARDS
Both the federal and State governments have adopted air quality
standards. These are designed as health-based standards to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare. In order to evaluate compliance                    Evening traffic on Interstate 580 driving east
with these standards, local air districts continuously monitor selected
air pollutants. Table 9-1 presents these standards. The primary             Carbon Monoxide (CO)
pollutants for which there are standards are discussed below.               Carbon monoxide is a highly toxic odorless, colorless gas.
Ozone (O3)                                                                  Automobile emissions provide the main source of carbon monoxide

a California standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide (1-hour and 24-hour), nitrogen dioxide, suspended particulate matter (PM10), and visibility reducing
    particles are values that are not to be violated (exceeded). The standards for sulfates, lead, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride are not to be equaled or violated.
b National standards other than for ozone, particulates, and those based on annual averages are not to be violated (exceeded) more than once a year. The ozone
    standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations above the standard is equal to or less than one.
c In June 2004, the federal government designated the Bay Area as a marginal nonattainment area of the national 8-hour ozone standard.
d In April 1998, the federal government redesignated the Bay Area to attainment for the national 8-hour carbon monoxide standard.

county-wide vehicle use, the largest source of air emissions. Emissions
generated by automobiles are estimated for 2005 and 2025. Note that
all emissions, with the exception of carbon dioxide, would continue to
drop and that countywide air quality would improve. This is due to
improvements in the vehicle fleet: better controls on newer vehicles
while older vehicles are removed from roadways. Carbon dioxide,
the gas related to climate change, will continue to grow at about the
same rate as future gasoline consumption. Thus to lower greenhouse
gas emissions would require consuming less gasoline. Although
Pleasanton development contributes to vehicle miles traveled,
commuting within the Tri-Valley is a regional problem.
PURPOSE OF AIR QUALITY PLANNING
Air quality in the Tri-Valley area has continually improved over the
past 30 years. However, the area continues to violate both federal and
State ozone and particulate matter (PM10) standards. Continued

                                          on air quality. Public education and the use of new technologies should be considered as part of this
                                          program.
                        To reduce vehicle miles traveled with commensurate reductions in air pollution and climate change, implement
                        Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs from the Circulation Element, including the addition of local and
                        regional bicycle lanes. Also implement Circulation Element measures to facilitate the free flow of vehicular traffic,
                        including continually updating computer-control technology for traffic lights. In order to shorten the distance of worker
                        commutes, also implement programs from the Housing Element to provide mixed-use development and to provide
                        housing opportunities for Pleasanton workers of all socioeconomic levels.

                                              BMP# 8: In new commercial and multifamily projects, include facilities to accommodate recycling
                                               consistent with the City’s programs.
                                              BMP# 9: Incorporate “heat island” treatments that include cool roofs, cool pavements, and/or
                                               strategically placed shade trees.
                        Implement programs from the Energy Element including those related to green building, such as encouraging passive-
                        solar construction, as well as those related to reducing energy from appliances, equipment, and lighting.

                                        mechanical equipment, consider purchasing the least polluting equipment available.
                        Program 7.5:    Postpone activities that contribute to air emissions on Spare the Air Days. Activities include: use of
                                        fossil fuel-powered landscaping equipment; surface coating and paint projects; and refueling vehicles.
                                        Reschedule vehicle trips, if feasible, without impacting project deadlines.
                        Program 7.6:    Adopt a measure requiring large vehicles (gross weight rating of greater than 14,000 pounds) and off-
                                        road equipment owned by the City and/or private contractors to restrict engine idling to less than 5
                                        consecutive minutes and to prohibit engine idling in parking lots, where feasible.
Odors
              Policy 8: Minimize unpleasant odors in residential neighborhoods.
                        Program 8.1:    Continue efforts to have the asphalt plant relocated away from Vineyard Avenue residents.
                        Program 8.2:    Continue working with the Dublin-San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) to ensure that odors from the
                                        sewage-treatment plant are minimized and other air emissions meet all regulatory requirements.
Public Awareness
              Policy 9: Strongly encourage citizen and business participation in reducing air pollution.
                        Program 9.1:    Provide regional and local air-quality information on the City of Pleasanton’s website, including links to
                                        the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the California Air Resources Board, Alameda County
                                        Waste Management Authority Stop Waste.org, and other environmental-based internet sites.
                        Program 9.2:    Establish an air quality public awareness program which includes changes that people can make to
                                        minimize air pollution. This program would educate the public and encourage people to choose the
                                        cleanest paints and consumer products, and to purchase the most energy-efficient appliances,
                                        landscaping equipment, and gas cans. This program would further encourage the public to purchase
                                        more energy-efficient vehicles and to properly maintain them.
                        Program 9.3:    Develop incentives for the public to help reduce air pollution. This includes offering incentive
                                        programs for using non-motorized (i.e., pedestrian and bicycle) and low-polluting mobility alternatives.
                        Program 9.4:    Develop a recognition and awards program for businesses that reduce air pollution.
