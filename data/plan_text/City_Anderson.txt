City of Anderson General Plan                                                        May 2007
                         Summary of Anderson General Plan 2007
The City of Anderson General Plan 2007 is a Plan for the City and for the adjacent
Planning Area. The Plan will allow needed growth while protecting the “small town”
characteristics of Anderson. The Plan emphasizes planning for the health and safety of all
residents—now and in the future. Extending the various general plan diagrams to cover
the entire planning area is a new feature of the General Plan.
The Land Use Element includes new land use designations such as “Rural Holding”,
“Low-Density Residential Hillside”, “Mixed Use”, and “Special Planning Area” to
accommodate various types of development and to protect resource areas. The “Rural
Holding” designation will protect agricultural uses on larger parcels. The “Low-Density
Residential Hillside” designation will limit development in hilly areas. The “Mixed Use”
designation will allow a combination of residential, commercial and office uses in a
compact area. The “Special Planning Area” designation will be developed with a unique
Planned Development Zoning Ordinance especially suited to the area with this
designation. Extending the land use designations to the Planning Area will allow the pre-
zoning necessary for annexation.
The Circulation Element emphasizes the creation of a multi-modal transportation system
to benefit healthy lifestyles and connectivity at all levels. This Element classifies existing
roadways and shows where new arterial and collector roads may be built. The Element
6/26/2007

also allows the creation of various special roadway standards to facilitate environmental
protection in new developments. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic are promoted and
protected by policies in the Circulation Element.
The Open Space and Conservation Element highlights the many resources Anderson has
and the best ways to protect and enjoy them. Biological, open space, scenic, and
agricultural resources are all important to Anderson residents. The conservation of
various types of habitat and open space are emphasized along with the need to maintain
these areas and to make them accessible to the general public for education, appreciation
and enjoyment.
The Health and Safety Element provides guidance on public health issues and safety in
all areas. The importance of developing a community that will foster healthy lifestyles is
emphasized. These policies are coordinated with policies in the Land Use, Circulation
and Recreation elements. The Noise Element shows the noise corridors and standards for
development to minimize impacts from noise.
The Recreation Element expands the framework for increasing recreation facilities and
opportunities in Anderson. A diversity of park types is encouraged including small
privately-maintained parks, trails and neighborhood parks. Recreation is important to all
ages and groups within the City. The previously adopted Housing Element and Air
Quality Element will remain part of the General Plan.

City of Anderson General Plan                                                     May 2007
Introduction
1.        INTRODUCTION
1.1       General Plan Requirements
California State Law (Government Code Section 65300) requires the City of Anderson to adopt a
general plan “for the physical development of the city, and any land outside its boundaries which . .
. bears relation to its planning.” The general plan serves as a “constitution” for development, the
foundation upon which all land use decisions are to be based. It expresses community development
goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land use, both public and
private. In summary, it is a statement of the City’s vision of its physical growth over the next 20
years to the year 2027.
1.2       General Plan Format and Consistency
State Law is specific on the topics that must be addressed within the General Plan. The chapters, or
Elements, of the Plan must address various State-mandated topics, but the organization of the
Elements is at the discretion of each jurisdiction. Additionally, the State recognizes that each
jurisdiction may face unique issues and authorizes the adoption of optional Elements that address
issues of local concern.
The General Plan must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them to each other without
conflict. Internal consistency applies as much to figures and tables as to the General Plan text. It
also applies to the data, analysis, and policies. All adopted portions of the General Plan, whether
required by State Law or not, have equal legal weight. No Element may supersede another. Where
policies or implementation measures in one element relate to other elements in the General Plan
they will be noted in parentheses at the end of the statement.

City of Anderson General Plan                                                     May 2007
Introduction
The 2007 Anderson General Plan addresses the State-mandated requirements through the following
Elements:
     1. Land Use Element
     2. Circulation Element
     3. Open Space and Conservation Element
     4. Health and Safety Element
     5. Noise Element
     6. Recreation Element (optional element)
     7. Housing Element (adopted 2003)
     8. Air Quality Element (optional element, adopted 1998)
The organization of material within each general plan element is at the discretion of the local
jurisdiction. Each element of this General Plan has been organized as follows:
a) a brief Introduction that describes the element’s content and mandatory components; and
b) a Goals, Policies Objectives and Programs section that establishes the policies and regulations
     that will govern land uses and activities within the City.
This Plan is intended to be concise and easily understood.
1.3       City of Anderson
Anderson is located in south Shasta County along the Sacramento River. It is characterized by the
River Valley landscape that rises in the west into rolling foothills. The land is former agricultural

Introduction
land that has been changed to residential, commercial and industrial uses since the coming of the
railroad in 1872.
The area is sprinkled with large oak trees, including Valley Oaks, Blue Oaks, and Live Oaks. The
Sacramento River, Anderson Creek, other streams and man-made canals and waterways traverse the
area. These waterways have created delightful riparian corridors that support a wide variety of
plants and animal communities.
The gently sloping land transitions from the Sacramento River on the north and east to hillside
slopes to the south and west. The gentle slopes allow residents of the community to enjoy the
sweeping vistas of Mt. Shasta, the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, Mt. Lassen and the southern
Cascade Range.
Quality of life factors have been given consideration along with quantitative measures of success
and progress. Through the General Plan process, the City has identified priorities and planned
strategies based upon quality of life factors.
Anderson residents value the City’s “small town” characteristics, which are not indicative of size
but, instead, represent a sense of community.            Anderson’s friendliness and community
consciousness stand in sharp contrast to the perceived alienation often associated with impersonal
large cities and modern suburbs. Closely associated with “small town” character is convenience
(nothing is far from anything else) and proximity to open space.
The 2007 Anderson General Plan strives to maintain Anderson’s “small town” character and sense
of community in a number of ways, including an emphasis on infill development, neighborhood
integrity, community design and creation of community and neighborhood gathering places.
Promotion of Mixed Use Development for the Old Town Core is a key element of this Plan.

Introduction
The City works together with other public agencies to provide the community with a safe
environment, affordable housing, quality education and ever increasing opportunities for business
and industry. The community offers a variety of recreational, cultural, multicultural and educational
opportunities for preschoolers to seniors, with excellent schools, a Teen Center, the Frontier Senior
Center, Library, and concert stage in beautiful Anderson River Park. Anderson is also the home of
the Shasta District Fair.
1.4       Environmental Review
Adoption of a General Plan is considered a “project” under the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). As such, the potential impacts of adoption of the General Plan must be identified and
analyzed. For the Anderson 2007 General Plan, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) will be
prepared.
It has been the City’s intention to create a self-mitigating Plan. This strategy required the City to
consider potential impacts and incorporate policies, objectives and programs within the General
Plan that would reduce potential adverse environmental impacts to a level of “less than significant”.
It is also recognized that future development projects will be subject to project-specific and site-
specific review pursuant to CEQA.
1.5       Subsequent Actions
While adoption of the General Plan represents a major milestone for the City of Anderson,
additional concurrent and future planning efforts will be required. The City is engaged in numerous
planning efforts that are anticipated for adoption following the General Plan. Additionally, the City
shall amend the Zoning Map to achieve consistency with this General Plan.

Introduction
The General Plan anticipates the development of a large planned community governed by a Specific
Plan. The Vineyards at Anderson project will consist of housing that would approximately double
the population of Anderson and provide housing options and open space amenities not currently
available in the community. This project will focus on a mixed-use Village Center and include
parks and open space, commercial uses and the necessary public services and infrastructure.
1.6       General Plan Goals and Objectives
1.6.1 Definitions
The general plan defines key terms that are used repeatedly throughout the text. The following
terms are defined as used within the context of a general plan:
Goal: A goal is a broad, generalized expression of commonly held community values. Since a goal
is broadly stated, disagreement regarding a goal tends to be uncommon.
Objectives: Objectives are similar to goals and frequently the two terms are used interchangeably.
As used in the general plan, however, an objective is a more narrowly drawn expression of
community intent. One goal may imply two or more objectives, each responsive to a particular
aspect of a more broadly stated goal.
Policy:          A policy is a precise statement of public regulatory powers and fiscal resources that
will be exercised and allocated to achieve a specific objective. Policies may be expressed in text,
maps, diagrams, or some combination thereof.             Since policies are tangible, they can be
quantitatively measured. It is important to note that some policies are more specific than others.
6/26/2007                                                                                           5

Introduction
The policies contained in the general plan are expressed in terms of “shall” or “should”. There is an
important distinction between these two terms. As used in the general plan, “shall” indicates an
unequivocal commitment, while “should” indicates a guide toward accomplishing a long-range
goal.
Implementation: The final link in the hierarchy running from an objective to its physical realization
is provided by implementation. Although implementation is commonly spoken of in terms of
programs implying a long-term effort, it may have a much shorter duration and simply be referred
to as a measure. In any event, implementation programs and measures are concerned with the
specific actions necessary for accomplishment.
1.6.2 City of Anderson Goals
The 2007 General Plan is Anderson’s second General Plan in its 50-year history. The various
elements that make up the current General Plan were prepared between 1968 and 1986. The
elements were consolidated into a comprehensive document in 1986. The goals and priorities
established then are still important today. Goals may be followed by a reference to a specific
element of the General Plan to show consistency between the various elements and other parts of
the Plan.
The following are the general goals (GG) for the 2007-2027 General Plan:
GG-1. Enhance the physical, social, economic and environmental stability of the City of Anderson
          by maintaining orderly growth and physical development while ensuring the continuity of
          the City’s “small town” atmosphere. (Housing Element)

          that provides a variety of options; including walking, bicycles, public transit, rail, as well as,
          the automobile. (Circulation Element)(Air Quality Element)
GG-5. Protect and improve the Old Town Core to encourage improvement of the City’s historic
          structures and enhance the Old Town Core commercial base.
GG-6. Diversify the economy to provide a variety of job opportunities. (Housing Element)
GG-7 Locate industry to avoid undue traffic impacts. (Circulation Element)
GG-8. Preserve and enhance the quality of life by providing a variety of living environments and
          accommodating growth. (Housing Element)
GG-9. Geographic distribution and the timing of growth shall be directly related to the provision
          and/or improvement of public facilities, services and utilities.
GG-10. Recognition that the general plan is a decision-making tool which will be reviewed and
          revised periodically.
GG-11. Apply an inter-jurisdictional approach to planning issues.

Introduction
7. Housing: To ensure that the City of Anderson offers the opportunity for adequate and safe
     housing in a suitable environment for all economic groups. This consists of the conservation
     and rehabilitation of existing and older neighborhoods as well as planning of new and
     innovative residential developments. (Housing Element)
1.7       Intergovernmental Coordination and Cooperation
Coordination with Shasta County will increase as implementation of specific recommendations and
concepts start to take shape. Likewise, the City of Anderson must coordinate with the City of
Redding, Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation District, Anderson Fire Protection District, Cottonwood
Fire Protection District, school districts, air and water quality regional agencies, Caltrans and other
public service providers and enforcement agencies.
Coordination with the Shasta Local Agency Formation Commission (Shasta LAFCO) will be
especially important to process annexations to the City. Anderson will continue to participate in the
Southwest Redevelopment Project Area, the SHASTEC Redevelopment Project Area (Riverside
Avenue and North Street area) and the Enterprise Zone. A new Enterprise Zone application was
submitted in August 2006 for the Shasta Metro Enterprise Zone including Shasta County, City of
Shasta Lake, City of Redding, and City of Anderson.
The SHASTEC Redevelopment Plan was amended in 2006 to include an additional 870 acres. A
678-acre portion of this area is the chosen location for the development of a medium- to large-
parcel business park, to be known as the Stillwater Business Park. The 2006 Amendment also
includes construction of the “backbone” infrastructure necessary for the development of the

Land Use Element
2.        LAND USE ELEMENT
2.1       Land Use Element Introduction
California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that a land use element be included in a
General Plan and more specifically mandates that the element address the following:
     “...the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the
     land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural resources,
     recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public building and grounds, solid
     and liquid waste disposal facilities and other categories of public and private uses of
     land. The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population
     density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory
     covered by the plan...”
The Land Use Element describes the pattern of land development within the City of Anderson and
the proposed expansion area and provides direction for the future development envisioned for the
City. Also included in this Element are descriptions of geographic areas that are anticipated to be
developed over the term of this General Plan and Goals and Policies to guide the City’s decision
makers in their review of development proposals. This Element also defines land use categories and
provides supporting detail for the uses depicted upon the Anderson General Plan Land Use
Diagram.
The Land Use Element is viewed as the core of the General Plan and is frequently the most
referenced element. The General Plan Land Use Diagram designates land uses for all lands within
the City and visually depicts the community’s intended physical form and areas for growth.
6/26/2007                                                                                        11

Land Use Element
The Land Use Diagram is supported by text in this Element that describes bu
ilding intensity, population density and expectations of the citizens of Anderson. The framework of
Goals and Policies will guide the City’s decision-making throughout the term of the General Plan.
2.2 Future Development within the Present City Limits
The population of Anderson and its Planning Area (estimated at 12,000), is projected to grow to
19,575 by the year 2025. There are 3,372 households out of which 39.3% have children under the
age of 18 living with them, 42.6% are married couples living together, 20.2% have a female
householder with no husband present, and 31.2% are non-families. Households made up of
individuals are 26.5% of all households and 12.0% of all households have someone living alone
who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.64 and the average family size is
3.14.
Infill development on undeveloped land within Anderson is an important facet of the 2007 General
Plan. Infill and a compact development pattern will facilitate efficient use of land with a minimum
of public service extensions. About one-quarter of the City remains undeveloped. Some of this land
is constrained by natural features so that development may be limited without innovative building,
lot, and street designs and planning techniques.
The Old Town Core recognizes the 1892 town site as the area bounded by North Street from
Interstate-5 to State Highway 273, north along State Highway 273 to Briggs Street, west along
Briggs Street and First Street to the ACID Canal, South along the ACID Canal to South Street and
east along South Street to Emily Street, South along Emily Street to Anderson Creek, along the
Creek to a line extending from Balls Ferry Road, to Balls Ferry Road and along Balls Ferry Road to
Interstate-5. The Mixed Use area within the Old Town Core will be bounded by Ventura, North,
Douglas and South/Balls Ferry Streets.
6/26/2007                                                                                         12

City of Anderson General Plan                                                  May 2007
Land Use Element
The vision for the Old Town Core includes using the Mixed Use Land Use Designation, the
preservation of the historical area with smaller lots and homes and the addition of compatible
commercial and professional businesses.
Areas designated for residential uses within the current City Limits will accommodate the short-
term housing needs as outlined in the Housing Element. Long-term housing needs will depend on
annexation of additional land. Depending on market factors, infill may be able to accommodate
non-residential development. The City will meet the total commercial and industrial land demand
through the annexation of additional lands.
Although the basic development patterns within the City Limits are already established, much can
and should be done over the 20-year life of the 2007 General Plan. Many outstanding, though
subtle, land use concepts can enhance the City incrementally. The Old Town Core will in-fill and
build “up rather than out” and will develop for Mixed Use.
Renovation of individual homes and conservation of neighborhoods must keep up with further
aging of an older housing stock. Existing commercial areas must renovate and intensify. Housing
code enforcement and effective use of re-development programs are essential “implementers” of the
2007 General Plan.
2.3       City Expansion
Since its early days as an unincorporated settlement growing around a railroad station, Anderson
has often expanded its boundaries to embrace and facilitate new development. From an original 12
square block Town site in 1872; Anderson has grown to its current, irregularly shaped, 6.7 square
miles.
6/26/2007                                                                                      13

City of Anderson General Plan                                                      May 2007
Land Use Element
The Sphere of Influence comprises about 12.9 square miles, nearly twice the current area of the
Incorporated City. A substantial portion of the region’s commercial and industrial development is
presently outside of the City but within the unincorporated Planning Area. The City proposes to add
2,000 acres southwest of the City to the Sphere of Influence which may then be annexed to the City.
This area is proposed to be a special planning area which will develop according to an approved
Specific Plan.
Areas to the northwest of the City will also be added to the Sphere of Influence and annexed for
special uses, especially water storage, to serve future needs. The Rural Holding (RH) Land Use
Designation will be used for this area. Commercial development along State Highway 273 and the
Verde Vale and Spring Gulch may eventually be annexed to the City.
One of the central themes of the Shasta County General Plan is to direct urban growth into
community regions that can effectively and economically provide urban types of services. Anderson
supports a centralized growth concept. The City is the logical service provider of the urban services
required by future development within the Region.
Urban densities require urban services, and Anderson requires annexation prior to service extension.
The 2007 General Plan provides direction for future annexation without dictating a rigid schedule
for annexation.
2.4       Land Use Designations
The Land Use Element describes various land use designations for the land uses throughout the City
of Anderson with consideration for the comments from the residents of Anderson. These Land Use
Designations have been designed to maintain Anderson’s small-town characteristics as the
community evolves.
By defining residential, commercial and industrial uses, along with the public and open-space lands,
this Element of the General Plan provides clear direction for the various types of development that

will occur in Anderson. The Land Use Diagram guides future development in Anderson in
conjunction with plan goals and policies.

Land Use Element
2.4.1     Rural Holding (Agriculture) Land Use Designation (RH)
The Rural Holding Land Use Designation will allow various agricultural uses and a residential
density of one dwelling unit per five acres. Based on an average of 2.64 persons per unit this would
allow a maximum population density of 0.5 people per acre. This land use designation will be used
for lands outside the present City Limits which may be annexed in the future.
Agriculture will be a part of the City and of the surrounding area for the foreseeable future. The
Rural Holding Land Use Designation will be compatible with various agricultural uses such as crop
cultivation and grazing. This designation will be compatible with the County land use designation
for these areas.
Appropriate zoning would be “AG, Agriculture”.
2.4.2     Rural Estate (Limited Agriculture)
          Land Use Designation (RE)
The Rural Estate (Agricultural) Land Use Designation allows various types of “Rural Estate” type
of development including densities of two dwelling units per acre, one dwelling unit per acre, or
one dwelling unit per two acres. The minimum net parcel size area is one half acre. In the Special
Emphasis area, a Planned Development Zoning Designation, the minimum net parcel size area is
12,300 square feet maintaining the maximum density of two dwelling units per acre.. Based on an
average of 2.64 persons per unit, this would allow a maximum population density of 6 people per
acre.
The intent of the Rural Estate Designation is to preserve the rural nature of those areas which have
historically developed with large lots and agricultural uses and to provide for large estate type
development in less accessible or predominantly agricultural areas. Lots in this designation may be
developed with individual water supplies and on-site sewage disposal if the requirements of the
6/26/2007                                                                                         16

Land Use Element
Shasta County Environmental Health Department are met. (This usually requires two acres or
more.)
The Rural Estate (Agricultural) Land Use Designation will promote such desired characteristics as
open space, less traffic and a quiet setting. This designation also provides a medium to higher
market range property where the lower density can contribute to good development and provide for
a broadened housing choice in the community. The use of these sites for high-value agricultural
crops such as herbs, fruits, nuts, vegetables, wine grapes and a limited number of farm animals
(appropriately located on larger parcels) is encouraged as is the processing and sale of products
grown on the property.
This category will not be considered as a transitional land use once sites are developed to the
maximum density allowed but may buffer other rural areas from more dense urban development.
Future conversion to higher residential densities will; therefore, be discouraged if land is in the
minimum parcel sizes allowed.
The zoning districts appropriate for this category are “R-E, Rural Estate”, “R-E-2 (1/2 acre
minimum) Rural Estate”, and “PD, Planned Development”.
2.4.3     Low Density Residential-Hill Side Land Use Designation (LDR-HS)
The Low Density Residential-Hill Side Land Use Designation will allow limited residential
development on hills depending on the land formation. The degree of slope may have an effect on
density. Generally, the greater the slope, the lower the density will be in units per acre.
The appropriate zoning will be “R-1-HS, Low Density Residential with Hill Side Combining
District”.
6/26/2007                                                                                        17

Land Use Element
2.4.4     Low Density Residential Land Use Designation (LDR)
The Low Density Residential Land Use Designation will allow up to 6 residential units per gross
acre. Based on an average of 2.64 persons per unit this would allow a maximum population density
of 16 people per acre. This category allocates lands for detached single family housing. Any
density up to the maximum may be permitted as long as environmental constraints are respected and
urban services can be reasonably provided. Second dwelling units will be allowed in accordance
with the State Law.
The zoning districts consistent with this designation are “R-1, Single Family Residential” or “PD,
Planned Development” of the proper density. Some areas of the City may be appropriate for large-
lot development.
2.4.5     Medium Density Residential Land Use Designation (MDR)
The Medium Density Residential Land Use Designation allows from 10 to 20 dwelling units per
gross acre. Based on an average of 2.64 persons per unit this would allow a maximum population
density of 53 people per acre. The housing types planned for this density are duplexes, triplexes,
four-plexes,    townhouses    and   similar  multiple-unit  residential development.   Apartment,
condominium or cooperative units with Planned Development Zoning are permitted within this
density category.
Urban services required for this increased density make location more selective than for lower
density. Concerns regarding access, proximity to commercial services, impacts from adjoining uses
and meeting housing needs should be addressed when applying this density to the plan.
Mobilehome parks would be placed in this category. This designation may be used for small areas
to promote integration of a variety of housing types.

Land Use Element
The zoning districts which implement this density are “R-2, Medium-Density Residential” or “PD,
Planned Development” of a density up to 20 dwelling units per acre.
2.4.6     High Density Residential Land Use Designation (HDR)
The High Density Residential Land Use Designation allows from 20 to 40 dwelling units per gross
acre. Based on an average of 2.64 persons per unit this would allow a maximum population density
of 107 people per acre. Areas receiving this designation are planned for the greatest density of
residential development in the City. The types of units intended for this category are apartments,
townhouses or other multiple-unit structures. The use of the buildings and land shall be primarily
residential with accessory uses permitted, such as recreational facilities. Flexibility and innovation
and Mixed Use should be encouraged for projects of this type.
The zoning district used to implement this category is “R-3, Multiple-Family Residential” or other
zoning districts and the Planned Development Combining District.
2.4.7     Special Planning Area Land Use Designation (SPA)
The Special Planning Area Land Use Designation is used for areas in the City which are relatively
undeveloped but planned for a combination of uses. These areas have few existing public services
and most parcels are fairly large. The placement and timing of services requires the coordination
provided by a Specific Plan as described in Government Code Section 65450. Zoning would be a
“PD, Planned Development District”. The Specific Plans adopted will govern the development as
allowed by California Government Code Sections 65450 to 65457. A Specific Plan is a tool for
implementing the General Plan but it is not part of the General Plan. The Specific Plan must be
consistent with all facets of the General Plan.

Land Use Element
2.4.8     Mixed-Use Land Use Designation (MU)
The Mixed-Use Land Use Designation would allow in-fill development and General Commercial
uses such as stores and offices on the ground floor with high-density residential uses on second
floors. On interior blocks and on street frontages off the main commercial frontage, residential uses
may occupy the ground floor. The Mixed-Use Land Use Designation allows up to 40 dwelling units
per gross acre. Based on 2.64 persons per unit this would allow a population density of 79 people
per acre. This land use designation will be appropriate for a portion of the Old Town Core and may
be considered for appropriate service nodes throughout the City. The purpose of this land use
designation is to create functional, safe and attractive multi-use neighborhoods supported by all
necessary public facilities and services.
A zoning designation of “MU, Mixed-Use” or Planned Development is appropriate for this
Designation.
2.4.9     Commercial Land Use Designation (C)
The Commercial Land Use Designation includes high activity land uses. These include retail,
service, repair and storage uses. Additional uses would include warehouses, building material yards,
contractors’ storage yards, outside storage, repair establishments, caretaker residences and other
uses. The intensity factor would be eighty percent land coverage. These land uses cause increased
traffic, noise, visual effects from signs and architecture, service demands and related concerns. This
Plan strives to provide the necessary functions of commercial development without resulting in
unacceptable consequences for adjoining areas and the City’s circulation and public facilities.
The various types of commercial land use will by separated by the zoning districts within this land
use designation. Zoning districts appropriate for this category are “C-1, General Commercial
District”, “C-2, Highway Commercial District” and “C-3, Heavy Commercial District.”

Land Use Element
2.4.10 Industrial (Manufacturing) Land Use           Designation (I)
The Industrial (Manufacturing) Land Use Designation includes all types of manufacturing and
industrial uses and caretaker residences. Two zoning districts are compatible with this land use
designation: “M-1, Light Industrial” and “M-2, Heavy Industrial”. Light industrial uses do not have
smoke, fumes, risk of explosion or other noxious effects. Heavy industrial uses may have such
effects if they cannot be fully avoided.
2.4.11 Public and Semi-Public Land and Open Space Land Use Designation (PSP)
The Public Land and Open Space Land Use Designation includes a variety of uses such as
cemeteries, fairgrounds, parks, recreation centers, public buildings, open space, and schools. These
uses do not usually have adverse effects on other land uses. Public and non-profit agencies usually
own and operate these facilities.
Zoning districts consistent with this land use designation include “P-SP, Public/Semipublic” and
“NR-Natural Resource District”.

Circulation Element
3.       CIRCULATION ELEMENT
3.1      Circulation Element Introduction
The Circulation Element is one of the seven mandated general plan elements identified in the State
Planning and Zoning Law. Section 65302(b) of the California Government Code specifies that each
general plan must include “a circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of
existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public
utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.” The sewer and water
public utilities are covered in the Health and Safety Element.
According to State Planning Law, the Circulation Element must be consistent with the other
General Plan elements, which are all interrelated. Certain goals and policies of one element may
address issues that are primary subjects of other elements. This integration of issues throughout the
General Plan creates a strong basis for the implementation of plans and programs and achievement
of community goals.
3.2      Transportation in Anderson
The community desires transportation alternatives to the automobile. At the same time, they expect
solutions to present-day congestion. Citizens want traffic in residential neighborhoods to be slower,
less disruptive and less dangerous to pedestrians.
The City of Anderson can reduce traffic and congestion by improving internal circulation within the
City and by becoming a full service City which provides a complete range of retail experiences,
services, housing types, and employment opportunities. When citizens are required to travel to other
communities the use of parallel routes such as State Route 273 will be encouraged.
                                                                                                   41

City of Anderson General Plan                                                       May 2007
Circulation Element
Alternatives to the automobile most desired are bicycle and pedestrian ways, including trails, paths,
sidewalks, bike lanes and similar facilities.
Additionally the City is served by the regional transit system operated by the Redding Area Bus
Authority (RABA). Transit service is available on a commuter route from a transfer site within the City
to the Inter-modal Transit Center in Redding. A loop service is also provided on the Anderson end of
the route providing limited service within the town. Alternative transportation systems need to connect
identified nodes forming real networks. The system needs to be well marked and publicized to the
general public.
The Redding Area Bus Authority also provides “Demand Response” service within ¾ mile of the
fixed service route. Eligible riders may call for service. The Far Northern Regional Center provides
transportation for persons with developmental disabilities, the Redding Rancheria Indian Tribe
provides transportation to descendants of the indigenous tribes of Shasta County, and the Shasta
County Opportunity Center serves individuals with disabilities.
In a city where over 90% of all trips are made by automobile and other alternatives including
bicycling and walking represent 1.5% or less of all work trips, alternative transportation is not
expected to render vehicular transportation obsolete. However, Anderson has the potential to be a
healthy walkable, bikeable City due to the grid street pattern and generous rights-of-way in the Old
Town Core. Although alternative transportation modes are supplemental to the street and road
system, a choice of circulation alternatives is increasingly important to the quality of life and public
health in Anderson.
Because recreational use of alternative transportation modes leads to familiarity and acceptance,
implementation of a comprehensive Trails-Sidewalks Network is a high priority. Previous General
Plans have included versions of a trail system. Certainly, planning and developing a comprehensive
                                                                                                     42

Circulation Element
pedestrian/bicycle system will be difficult and expensive.           For that reason, multi-purpose
pathways/trails/sidewalks designed to meet the needs of (and to be funded jointly by) both
transportation and recreation interests are planned.
3.3      Street Classifications
The following street classifications are used in this General Plan: freeway, expressway, arterial,
collector and local street. These classifications are explained below. The specifications for these
routes are detailed in the City Code and in the Public Works Standards. Freeways and State
Highways are maintained by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).
3.3.1    Freeway
Interstate 5 (I-5), a limited access freeway, is the only route of this category in the Anderson
Planning Area. This route divides the City, separating the residential areas along the Sacramento
River from the older portions of the community near the railroad.
3.3.2    Expressway
An Expressway is a divided multi-lane major arterial street for through traffic with partial control of
access and with grade separations at major intersections. State Route 273 (old Highway 99) is an
expressway facility paralleling the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. The expressway continues to
be a major connection between the cities of Redding and Anderson. This route is four lanes with a
median separation and controlled access. All crossings are at grade.
                                                                                                    43

Circulation Element
3.3.3    Arterial
These streets provide the major routes for traffic flow within the City. They connect the areas of
high traffic generation; therefore, their function is to move large volumes of traffic and should be
designed to perform that function. Typical rights-of-way for arterials are 80 to 108 feet wide.
Pavement width and lane width of arterials may vary. Access from adjoining property should be
avoided or consolidated if at all possible to prevent interference with traffic flow. Parking, if
provided, may be converted to travel lanes if traffic warrants.
3.3.4    Collector
Collectors are minimum two lane streets with a minimum 60 foot right-of-way. They provide
circulation within and between neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas. Collectors
usually serve short trips and are intended for collecting trips from local streets and distributing them
to the arterial network. Direct driveway connections to the collector streets are discouraged. Usually
access is consolidated and driveways have joint access.
3.3.5    Local Street
These are used to provide access to abutting property, locations for utilities, and fire breaks between
buildings. Carrying through traffic is a secondary function of local streets and they should be
designed to disperse traffic and incorporate traffic calming measures. The use of curvi-linear streets
may be needed in hillside areas but the grid street pattern should be used where possible to provide
for connectivity and walkability.
                                                                                                      44

Circulation Element
Local streets may use a variety of street designs including the following:
a)       Traditional Local Street
The Traditional Local Street includes two twelve-foot wide traffic lanes, with parking, curb, gutter
and sidewalk areas in addition to the traffic lanes within a sixty-foot wide right-of-way.
b)       Special Local Street
The Special Local Street will be used in areas designated for planned development. These streets
may be narrow and have rights-of-way as small as forty-eight feet wide. The travel ways (including

4.        OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
4.1       Open Space and Conservation Introduction
Valuable resources in the City of Anderson include biological resources, open space resources,
scenic resources, agricultural resources, cultural and historic resources, and air quality. The Open
Space and Conservation Element focuses on the protection and enhancement of such resources to
ensure a high quality living environment for years to come.
The Open Space and Conservation Element expresses community goals to protect environmental
resources, open space, and scenic resources. Specifically, resources addressed in this element
include the following:
a) Biological resources, including significant habitat areas and special status plant and animal
     species.
b) Open space resources, including natural and improved open space areas that are physical,
     functional, and visual.
c) Scenic resources as predominant physical characteristics of the community.
d) Agricultural resources, including quantity and quality of agricultural lands within      the
     Planning Area.
e) Cultural resources in terms of known and potential archaeological and paleontological
     resources.
6/26/2007                                                                                         65
City of Anderson General Plan                                                        May 2007
Open Space and Conservation Element
f) Historic resources that are nationally designated, recognized by the State of California or locally
     significant.
g) Energy conservation
h) Air quality in terms of local and regional compliance with air pollutant standards.
This combined Open Space and Conservation Element meets the State requirements for Open Space
and Conservation Elements as defined in Sections 65301, 65302(d), 65302(e), and 65560 of the
California Government Code, respectively. According to these requirements, the Open Space
Element must contain goals and policies to manage open space areas, including undeveloped lands
and outdoor recreation areas.
Specifically the Open Space Element must address several open space categories such as those used
for the preservation of natural resources and managed production of resources, as well as open
space maintained for public health and safety reasons. Open Space for outdoor recreation is
addressed within the Recreation Element.
The Conservation Element must contain goals and policies to protect and maintain natural resources
such as water, soils, wildlife and minerals, and prevent wasteful resource exploitation, degradation
and destruction.
In adopting the requirement that all jurisdictions must prepare an Open Space Element, the
Legislature found that the preservation of open space land is necessary not only for the maintenance
of the economy of the State, but also for the continued availability of land for the production of food
and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic beauty, for recreation, and for the use of natural resources.
6/26/2007                                                                                            66

Open Space and Conservation Element
The Legislature further found that discouraging premature and unnecessary conversion of open
space land to urban uses is in the public interest because it discourages non-contiguous development
patterns that tend to increase the costs of community services to community residents. Finally, the
Legislature found that the anticipated increase in the population of the State demands that cities,
counties, and the State make plans at the earliest possible date for the preservation of valuable open
space land and take positive action to carry out such plans by the adoption and strict administration
of laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
4.2       Environmental Protection and Enhancement
Anderson’s environmental setting is both the object of affection and concern for the citizens of
Anderson. The area’s valley setting, the Sacramento River, streams, trees, and wetlands draw and
captivate residents. But these same natural features are sensitive to alteration, and may be destroyed
or seriously impaired in the course of land development.
Environmental challenges and opportunities are many; setting aside environmentally sensitive
areas; preserving open space; park and nature trail development; and restoring or reclaiming abused
areas. All are addressed effectively in the 2007 General Plan.
Rare botanical species and their supporting environs in and near Anderson have been identified and
described by the California Native Plant Society.
Anderson’s existing park system consists of land donated or purchased by the City over the years.
While attractive and pleasant, City parks are unevenly distributed, resulting in some areas being
well served while others are underserved. The 2007 General Plan contains a framework for a park
and recreation system, designed to meet current and future needs throughout the City and expanded
in scope to include natural areas, open space and passive parks as well as active parks and play
fields.
6/26/2007                                                                                           67

4.3       Objectives, Policies and Implementation Program
Open Space Objective:
To establish open space areas for the following:
a) the preservation of natural resources,
b) the managed production of resources,
c) outdoor recreation, public health and safety, and
d) to ensure the preservation and maintenance of these spaces consistent with community need.
Conservation Objective:
To ensure the planned management of the community’s natural resources, their permanency
consistent with community goals and prevention of their misuse.
4.3.1     Biological Resources
The City’s Plan Area supports a diverse assemblage of plant and wildlife species throughout several
habitat types. It is characterized by the river valley landscape that rises to the west into rolling
foothills. The area is
sprinkled with large oak trees, including Valley Oaks, Blue Oaks, and Live Oaks. The Sacramento
River, Anderson Creek, other streams and man-made canals and waterways traverse the area. These
waterways have created delightful riparian corridors that support a wide variety of plants and
animal communities.
Sensitive habitat areas in Anderson contain valuable biological resources. Efforts to identify and
preserve these valuable resources will improve the quality of the environment for Anderson
residents. Protection of biological resources requires design with sensitivity to existing landforms
and vegetation and includes protection of soil and water quality.
6/26/2007                                                                                         68

Open Space and Conservation Element
The following habitat types exist within the Anderson Planning area:
Seasonal Wetlands
Seasonal wetlands allow water to pond for a long enough period of time to support hydrophytic
vegetation and hydric soils and include both vernal and non-vernal wetlands. Seasonal wetlands
tend to lack standing water during the late summer months, or during prolonged dry periods. They
support hydrophytic species, such as spike-rush (Elocharis sp.) that require longer and typically
deeper inundation periods than those of vernal species. Accordingly, seasonal wetland lack
underlying hardpan common with vernal pools and swales.
Vernal pools form where there is a soil layer below or at the surface that is impermeable or nearly
impermeable. Vernal pools gradually dry during the spring, often forming a unique “bathtub ring”
of flowers from endemic vernal pool plants blooming successively at the pool margins. Vernal
swales differ from vernal pools in their function as shallow conveyance channels.
Fresh Emergent Wetland
This wetland type is a mixture of erect, rooted herbaceous hydrophytes that prosper in anaerobic,
frequently flooded areas. Fresh emergent wetlands often occur around lake edges and areas with
standing water for most of the year. Edge vegetation includes sedges, rushes, and nut grasses. Areas
that are slightly deeper and wet for longer periods of time consist of cattail, bulrush and arrowhead.
Birds, reptiles, and amphibians rely on fresh emergent wetlands for protection, breeding and
nesting, and foraging.
Pond
Palustrine or pond habitats are inland depressions or dammed riverine channels containing standing
water, which is removed only by percolation, evaporation, or transpiration.
Blue Oak Woodland
Blue Oak Woodlands generally have an overstory of scattered trees, but the canopy can be nearly
closed on better quality sites. Blue Oak is the dominant tree species. Common associates in the

canopy include Coast Live Oak and Valley Oak. Associated shrub species include poison oak,
California coffeeberry, buckbrush, redberry, California buckeye and manzanita species. The ground
cover usually consists of annual grasses.
Hardwood habitats, including Blue Oak Woodlands, are documented to provide breeding habitat for
more wildlife species than any other habitat in California, supporting important breeding habitat for
numerous amphibian and reptile, bird and mammal species.

Open Space and Conservation Element
Annual Grassland
Introduced annual grasses are the dominant plants species in this habitat. These include wild oats,
soft chess, ripgut brome, red brome, wild barley and foxtail fescue. Many wildlife species;
including reptiles, mammals, and birds, use annual grasslands as foraging or breeding habitat.
Valley-foothill Riparian
Riparian habitats provide food, water, migration and dispersal corridors and escape, nesting and
thermal cover for California’s wildlife. Dominant vegetation in the canopy includes Cottonwood,
California Sycamore, and Valley Oak.
Riverine
Intermittent or continually flowing water distinguishes rivers and streams. The majority of fast
stream inhabitants (typically insects) live in the riffles, on the underside of rubble and gravel,
sheltered from the current. Riverine habitats include the watercourse and associated wetland edge.
Many laws are involved in the protection of biological resources. These laws include the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean
Water Act (CWA). Two laws related to the protection of Endangered Species are the Federal
Endangered Species Act and the California Endangered Species Act.

4.3.2     Open Space Resources
Open space resources in Anderson consist of designated parkland, natural and recreational open
space areas and waterways (Sacramento River, Anderson Creek, Sacramento Gulch, and Tormey
Drain). Generally, open space land is unimproved and used for habitat preservation, recreation,
public safety, and/or managed production of resources.
Many of the City’s open space resources are addressed in other sections of the Plan and this
Element. For example, additional goals, policies and programs for parklands and recreational open
space are discussed in the Recreation Element. Similarly, natural habitat areas are discussed in the
Biological Resource section of this Element and agricultural lands are discussed in the Land Use
Element and in the Agricultural Resources section of this Element.
Goals, policies and programs in this section address the City’s desire to preserve, enhance, and
expand open space resources to maintain the natural physical and visual quality of Anderson.
Permanent open space areas
may include active recreation areas, habitat protection areas, and scenic open spaces. Resources
preserved within open space include creek corridors, steep slopes, oak woodlands, wetlands,
grasslands, and viewsheds.
The Open Space Resources Implementation and Action Plan shown below shall meet the
requirement for the Open-Space Action Program required by California Government Code Section
65564.

4.3.3      Scenic Resources
Scenic resources in Anderson include predominant natural landscape features of the Sacramento
River and views of surrounding mountains including Mount Shasta to the north and Mount Lassen
to the east. Trees and landscaping are valuable scenic resources. The City supports the preservation
of scenic resources and views.
A.         Scenic Resources Policies (SRP)

4.3.4      Agricultural Resources
Anderson has historically been an agricultural community with a wide variety of agricultural crops.
While much of the land used for agriculture has been developed into urban uses, there are remaining
private parcels that continue in agricultural production, if only on a hobby basis. The City hopes to
encourage low-impact, high-value agricultural crops such as herbs, fruits and vegetables, nuts and
wine grapes on smaller parcels.
These agricultural areas help to preserve the traditional “small town” character of the community,
maintain open space, and reduce congestion within the City. While the City recognizes the historic
role of agriculture within the Anderson community and supports continued agriculture, the
transition from agriculture to urban uses limits the potential for large-scale commercial agriculture
within the City Limits of Anderson. Outside the City Limits, agriculture will continue for the life of
this Plan. The City will work to ensure that new development is compatible with adjacent
agricultural uses.
A.        Agricultural Resource Policies (AP)
AP-1 Agricultural land can best be preserved outside the City Limits by encouraging development
          within the City Limits so that viable agricultural operations in the unincorporated area can
          continue.
AP-2 Allow keeping and raising of animals in undeveloped areas (planned for future growth)
           which are suitable for such use and compatible with established neighborhoods.
AP-3 Avoid conflicts between agriculture and urbanization within the City’s area of influence.
           Reduce the negative impacts resulting from urban uses and neighboring agricultural uses in
           close proximity. (Land Use Element)

          Designation. (Land Use Element)
AP-5 Promote community gardens, herb gardens, or tree nurseries on vacant lots in developed
          areas.
AP-6 Encourage the promotion and marketing of locally grown agricultural products.
AP-7 Incorporate parks, open space and trails between urban and agricultural uses to provide
          buffer and transition between uses. (Recreation Element)
AP-8 No agriculture shall be undertaken in areas of preserved wetlands.
B.        Agricultural Resource Implementation (AI)

4.3.5     Cultural Resources
The Anderson area was originally the home of the Wintu, the northern branch of the Wintun Tribe.
The use of the area may have begun as early as 16,000 to 20,000 years ago according to
archeological researchers. The Wintu represent the most northerly group of Penutian speakers in
California. Main villages located along the Sacramento River and its tributaries were occupied year
around. Seasonal food-gathering sites located in the foothills and grasslands were occupied
temporarily. The territory of the Wintu encompassed western Shasta County and eastern Trinity
County.
The basic unit of the Wintu was the family. Several families made up a village which was
considered the social, political and economic unit. A village would have had from four to thirty
bark houses and from twenty to 150 inhabitants. Leadership among the Wintu was, in theory,
hereditary from father to eldest son—but only if the son was considered fit for the position. The
men hunted deer, bear and smaller animals. The women gathered acorns, berries, plants and roots.
Salmon was also a significant part of the Wintu diet.
In the early 1800s, there were approximately 12,000-15,000 members of the Wintun Tribe. Spanish
settlers arrived in Wintun territory by 1808, and the Hudson Bay Company trappers arrived
sometime before 1832. Tribal unity was destroyed by the taking of land and the destruction of
traditional food and material-gathering areas. Approximately 75 percent of the Wintu populations
living along the Sacramento River were lost to malaria and influenza epidemics brought about by
the arrival of European and American trappers and settlers in the mid 1800’s. Along with the
introduction of cattle, hogs, and sheep, the construction of dams, and the Copper processing plants
in the 1880s and early 1900s, the Wintun suffered a heavy toll on their health and survival.

4.3.6     Historic Resources
History continues to live in Anderson. Anderson exhibits the settlement and progression of western
communities from the late 19th century through the early 20th century. The City of Anderson is
located within the original Rancho Buenaventura, a land grant given to Major Pierson B. Reading in
December 1844 by Mexican Governor Manuel Micheltorena.
Reading received a patent for this grant from the United States government in 1854. The rancho
contained six square leagues of land on the west side of the Sacramento River, from Salt Creek (at
Redding) on the north, to the mouth of Cottonwood Creek on the south.
During his lifetime, Reading sold approximately 5000 acres of land and the remainder of the rancho
was mortgaged when he died in 1868. The mortgage was foreclosed in 1871 and the majority of the
land was bought by James Ben Ali Haggin, a San Francisco financier and land speculator.
Anderson began as a community in 1872 with the successful negotiation with the Southern Pacific
Railroad for the railroad right-of-way. Haggin and his partner, Edward Frisbie, a local banker and
real estate promoter, laid out the original town of Anderson.
A twelve square block plat was filed. Anderson was named after Elias Anderson, the first resident,
in 1872. The town quickly began to grow into an actual community with businesses, residences,
hotels, post office, schools and churches. The community has had episodic growth spurts related to
agriculture, railroad shipping and lumber. By 1880, the population had gown to about 800 people.

Ball’s Ferry, established in 1868, was part of the transportation network between the east and west
sides of the Sacramento River. Ball’s Ferry Road and the ferry connected the towns of Cottonwood
and Anderson on the north, and Jelly’s Ferry Road and Red Bluff on the south. This road carried
traffic from the west side of the Sacramento River toward Shingletown, Burney Valley, Hat Creek
Valley, Big Valley, Aden, Alturas and eastern Oregon. The segment of the Balls Ferry Road that
intersected North Street was renamed Stingy Lane some time in the early 20th century.
Cattle and sheep ranching, as well as agriculture, formed the economic base around Anderson.
Grain crops were important, and fruit businesses flourished. Peaches, plums, and apricots were the
main fruit crops grown in the North Valley in the early days, as well as pears, nuts, and smaller
crops of citrus fruits and figs. Prunes were picked and dried by the grower and his family, placed in
sacks and sent by wagon to the railroad for shipping to the market.
Although there was little mining around Anderson, the Shasta County mining districts, and later the
copper mines north of Redding, drew many fortune-seekers to the area. Pioneer settlers commonly
tried their hands at mining before settling down to farm around Anderson, and the town was a major
supplier of agricultural products to the mining communities further north.
While the Shasta County copper boom gave employment for thousands of mine workers, many
North Valley fruit growers were impacted by toxic smoke from the smelters. Smelter smoke killed
native vegetation for miles around and was blamed for widespread devastation of fruit orchards in
Happy Valley and Anderson. Fruit growers eventually prevailed in the courts in their suit to have
the smelters shut down. By this time, however, many fruit growers had turned to diversified
farming, or had taken up other occupations.

Anderson, as an unincorporated community, grew until a decline in the lumber industry beginning
in 1910; began the first modification in the City’s focus. Construction of the Anderson Cottonwood
Irrigation District (ACID) Canal changed the agricultural basis of this area from orchards, grazing
and dry land crops to irrigated fields. The City began a period of limited development following
World War I. Between the two world wars Anderson existed as a relatively stable agricultural
community.
Following World War II Anderson began a second period of expansion resulting from the growth of
the lumber products industry. The largest employer was Shasta Plywood Corporation. By 1950 the
population of Anderson was 2,500. Anderson became an incorporated City on January 16, 1956. In
1967, the Anderson River Park was dedicated. The City Hall was built in 1977 and was the City’s
first three-story building.
This expansion continued until the decline in the lumber industry in the late 1980s. The economic
downturn for Anderson continued with the national recession in the 1990s. The City is currently
experiencing resurgence in economic vitality and a migration of people from other parts of
California seeking a “small town” atmosphere. The City celebrated 50 years as an incorporated city
in January 2006 and the City’s population reached 10,529.

4.3.7     Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is the practice of increasing the efficiency of use of energy in order to achieve
higher useful output for the same energy consumption. This may result in increase of national
security, personal security, financial capital, human comfort and environmental value. Individuals
and organizations that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to
reduce energy costs and promote environmental values. Industrial and commercial users may want
to increase efficiency and maximize profit.
On a larger scale, energy conservation is an element of energy policy. The need to increase the
available supply of energy (for example, through the creation of new power plants, or by the
importation of more energy) is lessened if societal demand for energy can be reduced, or if growth
in demand can be slowed. This makes energy conservation an important part of the debate over
climate change and the replacement of non-renewable resources with renewable energy.
Encouraging energy conservation among consumers is often advocated as a cheaper or more
environmentally sensitive alternative to increased energy production.
A.        Energy Conservation Policy (ECP)
ECP-1 Promote resource conservation and energy efficiency through water conservation and water

5.        HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
5.1       Health and Safety Introduction
The Health and Safety Element addresses the following issues:
     1. Public Health
     2. Public Safety and Police Protection
     3. Fire Protection
     4. Geology and Seismic Hazards
     5. Flood Hazards
     6. Airport-Related Hazards
     7. Hazardous Materials
     8. Public Protection and Emergency Planning
     9. Water System
     10. Wastewater Collection and Treatment.
A Safety Element is a required element of the General Plan. It establishes a framework of
objectives, policies and implementation programs that will be the basis for proficient land use
planning to reduce unreasonable risks and to protect public health and welfare.
California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that a Safety element be included in a
General Plan, and more specifically mandates that the element address the following:
...the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of
seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, tsunami, seiches, and dam failure; slope
instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic
hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8(commencing with Section 2690) of the Public

Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and
wildland and urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic and other
geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, peak load water supply requirements,
and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified
fire and geologic hazards...
The City of Anderson has expanded the intent of the safety Element to address public health
issues as a component of public safety. The result is a combined “Health and Safety Element.”
5.2       Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Program
Health and Safety Objective: To provide all City residents with adequate public services for a
safe and healthy living environment.
5.2.1     Public Health
From the beginning, town planning involved issues of public health. Urban planning and public
health professions both came out of a desire to prevent urban outbreaks of infectious disease.
Recently, health professionals have taken a new look at urban design and have become advocates
for designing and building healthy places, especially those designs which will promote increased
physical activity. Land use policies and programs that support active living include the
following:
     •    Mixed Use development
     •    Transit-oriented development
     •    Urban infill
     •    Parks
     •    Recreation
     •    Trails
These policies are said to ameliorate many medical conditions including respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and stroke), cancer, obesity, diabetes, depression and

anxiety. According to the Surgeon General, as little as 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day,
including brisk walking, can bring significant health benefits.
Mixed Use development allows planning and zoning to site residential, retail, office and
educational facilities within close proximity to each other to encourage walking and biking as a
routine part of everyday life.
Transit-oriented development includes bus and paratransit options and gives residents and
commuters more opportunities to combine biking and walking with other means of getting to
work, school or shopping centers. Public transit does not replace walking or biking, but
integrates them into the transportation mix.
Urban infill is often associated with Mixed Use development which results in compact
communities that can encourage walking and biking opportunities to jobs, schools and shopping
centers.
Parks can provide opportunities for family recreation, play areas and sports fields. Parks located
close to residential areas and/or schools can increase opportunities for biking and walking.
Recreation can either be active or passive. Active recreation is activity that requires the use of
organized play areas including, but not limited to, softball, baseball, football and soccer fields,
tennis and basketball courts and various forms of children’s play equipment. Passive recreation is
activity that does not require the use of organized play areas such as nature observation.
Trails for biking and/or walking can promote increased activity with smaller amounts of land
than large parks and can often use “left-over” or unwanted land. Promotion of trails is necessary
to gain the full public health benefits of increased use.

All sections of the General Plan include provisions to promote the health of Anderson residents.
The implementation of bicycle and pedestrian trails has been demonstrated to promote a healthy

5.2.2     Public Safety and Police Protection
Under the leadership of the Chief of Police, the Police Department is organized into two
divisions as follows:
1)        Field Services, and
2)        Support and Administrative Services.
Each of these divisions plays an integral part in the operation of the Police Department to
provide the community of Anderson with the highest quality of service possible. The Police
Station is located at 2220 North Street, at the intersection of Martha Street.
The department is focused on following community oriented policing principles:
     •    sharing the Department with the community by having special programs, such as the
          "Citizens on Patrol" volunteers;
     •    sponsoring an active Neighborhood Watch Program;
     •    providing a School Resource Officer, and
     •    participating in a Neighborhood Improvement Task Force Program to identify and
          resolve community problems.
The department is truly a "Full Service", community-oriented police agency that balances its
service standards with its enforcement standards.
The members of the Department pride themselves on providing friendly and humanistic
treatment to the community members and the thousands of visitors who share our community.
They serve diligently to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of the community through the
delivery of professional police services, for the purpose of enhancing the quality of life within
the City of Anderson.

5.2.3     Fire Protection
Anderson Fire Protection District was formed in 1889 when most of the town was lost to a fire.
The Anderson Fire Protection District is a separate special district with a defined governing
board. Two members of the Anderson City Council are members of the Anderson Fire Protection
District Board of Directors.
The District was originally a volunteer department. Now the Anderson Fire Protection District
has 5 paid positions and one seasonal firefighter, along with 17 volunteers. The District
maintains a fire station at the corner of Howard and Douglas Streets which is manned 24 hours
per day by paid and volunteer personnel. There is an older fire station on East Center Street
which houses two antique fire trucks used for parades only. New fire stations will be developed
as needed.

5.2.4     Geology and Seismic Hazards
Seismic Hazards include the following:
     1.   Surface rupture or ground rupture
     2.   Ground shaking
     3.   Tsunami
     4.   Seiches
     5.   Dam failure
     6.   Mudslides
     7.   Landslides
     8.   Subsidence
     9.   Liquefaction
Shasta County has a low level of historic seismic activity. In the past 120 years there has been no
significant property damage or loss of life due to earthquakes occurring within or near the
County according to the Shasta County General Plan. Shasta County is entirely within Seismic
Zone 3 of the Uniform Building Code.
Therefore, the City of Anderson is at low risk of experiencing an earthquake. However, the City
has adopted the Uniform Building Code and will require all buildings to meet the standards of
this Code.
A Seiche is an earthquake-generated wave in an enclosed body of water such as a lake, reservoir,
or bay. Since Anderson is at a low risk for earthquakes as noted above, the City is also at a low
risk of damage from a Seiche.
However, the City is aware of the risks posed by Shasta Dam or Whiskeytown Dam failure and
has an emergency plan to cope with this type of emergency. According to 1994 modeling studies
conducted by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, significant failure of Shasta Dam would

5.2.5     Flood Hazards and Drainage System
The purpose of the Flood Hazard policies and implementation measures is to protect public
safety and to minimize the risk to life and property from flooding. The City of Anderson
participates in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) flood damage
prevention program. The City’s flood-prone areas are shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as
modified by Letters of Map Revision.
The storm drain system will prevent localized flood problems. The City of Anderson policy is to
require storm water detention for 100-year storm events. Detention of 10-year and 50 year events
may not be required if existing downstream drainage structures are of sufficient size to allow
passage of these lesser flow events without damage to the structures themselves or to adjacent
properties.

5.2.6     Airport-Related Hazards
The Redding Municipal Airport is located southeast of Redding, just north of Anderson. Safety
issues associated with airports are primarily concerned with hazards related to flight and hazards
related to those on the ground within the vicinity of flight operations.
Flight hazards may be physical (tall structures that could obstruct airspace), visual (glare caused
by lights or other bright objects) or electronic (uses that interfere with aircraft instruments or
communications systems). Increased flight hazards can be reduced by planning methods,
including height restrictions, density restrictions, and the avoidance of incompatible land uses.

5.2.9     Water System and Water Supply
The City of Anderson's water system consists of three separate systems containing a total of nine
wells, a booster pump, and two reservoirs. The water system is maintained by the Water
Department, which is part of Public Works. Five wells, a booster pump and two reservoirs serve
the Main City System.
According to the “Redding Basin Water Resources Management Plan Phase 2C Report prepared
for the Redding Area Water Council in August 2004, the City of Anderson gets its water from
the Redding Groundwater Basin. The City was estimated to use 2,900 acre feet of water in 2005
and to need 5,400 acre feet of water in 2030.
The total amount of groundwater pumped from the Redding Groundwater Basin is about 40,000
acre feet per year compared to 800,000 acre feet of annual recharge to the basin through
precipitation, seepage from streams and the ACID canal, and deep percolation of applied water
and septic tank flow. The report states that “The estimated basin-wide water needs in 2030 are
well below the ...available groundwater pumping capacity.” Thus, the City of Anderson will have
an adequate supply of water in the foreseeable future.
A.        Water System Policies (WSP)
WSP-1 Provide adequate quantity and quality of water to existing and future customers.

6.       NOISE ELEMENT
6.1      Noise Element Introduction
The State Office of Planning and Research Noise Element Guidelines require that major
noise sources be identified and quantified by preparing generalized noise contours for
current and projected conditions. Significant noise sources include traffic on major
roadways and highways, railroad operations, airports, and representative industrial
activities and fixed noise sources.
Noise is measured by the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) which is a 24-
hour energy equivalent level derived from a variety of single-noise events, with
weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7p.m. to 10 p.m.) and
nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods to allow for greater sensitivity to noise during these
hours. An alternative noise measure is Leq, the energy equivalent level, defined as the
average sound level on the basis of sound energy (or sound pressure squared). The Leq is
a “dosage” type measure and is the basis for the descriptors used in current standards,
such as the 24-hour CNEL used by the State of California.
Noise modeling techniques and noise measurements were used to develop generalized
CNEL or Leq noise contours for the major roadways, railroads and fixed noise sources in
the City of Anderson General Plan study area for existing and future conditions.
                                                                                         117

Noise Element
Noise modeling techniques use source-specific data including average levels of activity,
hours of operation, seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from source
operations.
Modeling methods have been developed for a number of environmental noise sources
including roadways, railroad line operations, railroad yard operations and industrial
plants. Such methods produce reliable results as long as data inputs and assumptions are
valid.
The modeling methods used in this report closely follow recommendations made by the
State Office of Noise Control, and were supplemented where appropriate by field-
measured noise level data to account for local conditions. The noise exposure contours
are based upon annual average conditions. Because local topography, vegetation or
intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposure at a particular location, the
noise contours should not be considered site-specific.
Noise data tables for the City of Anderson are at the end of this section.
                                                                                        118

Noise Element
6.2      Noise Sources
6.2.1    Roadway Noise
The biggest source of noise in Anderson is the Interstate 5 Freeway with State Highway
273 being a slightly lesser source of noise. The future (2025) noise contour for the
Interstate 5 Freeway is much larger than the present noise contour.
Roadway noise is a combination of direct noise emission from the vehicle and the sound
from the passing of tires over the road surface. In addition, large truck traffic can
dramatically contribute to roadway noise, as the sound generated from exhaust brakes,
large tires, and diesel engines greatly exceeds noise from passenger cars and light trucks.
Interstate 5 has a large percentage of truck traffic.
6.2.2    Railroads
The railroad is also a source of noise in Anderson. The noise contours for the railroad are
shown in Appendix B.
6.2.3    Fixed Noise Sources
Industrial, commercial, recreational and public service facility activities can also produce
noise, which affects adjacent sensitive land uses. These noise sources can be continuous
and may contain tonal components, which may be annoying to individuals who live in the
nearby vicinity. In addition, noise generation from fixed noise sources may vary based
upon climatic conditions, time of day and existing ambient noise levels.
                                                                                         119

Noise Element
The Redding Municipal Airport noise contour is close to the City of Anderson. However
most of the new development will take place west of the City. The Shasta District
Fairgrounds also produce noise, especially when there are concerts and/or automobile
races.
From a land use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus upon two
goals: to prevent the introduction of new noise producing uses in noise-sensitive areas
and to prevent encroachment of noise sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing
facilities.
The first goal can be achieved by applying noise level performance standards to proposed
new noise-producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-
sensitive uses near to noise-producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure
compliance with noise performance standards.
                                                                                     120

Noise Element
6.2.4    Nuisance Noise
In addition to train operations, other noise sources within the community may be
considered to be “nuisance noise sources”. These types of noise sources could include
barking dogs, live music venues, boom boxes, or exhaust brakes on trucks. These types of
noise sources are difficult to quantify due to the sporadic nature in which they occur, and
are in many instances transient in nature. However, these are the noise sources which
generate complaints and are the primary concern of residents.
The noise element of a General Plan is intended to establish acceptable noise levels for
new projects within a community, and it not a tool for responding to noise complaints. A
community noise ordinance is used for responding to noise complaints. Chapter 8.30
Noise Control, of the City of Anderson Code sets forth the law regarding allowable noise
and the procedure for dealing with noise complaints.
6.2.5    Community Noise Survey
The results of the Community Noise Survey conducted by Jones and Stokes, Inc. are
shown in Appendix B. Based upon the analysis completed for this General Plan, the noise
environment within the City of Anderson is similar to that of an urban and suburban area.
Primary noise sources include roadway traffic (especially Interstate 5 and State Highway
273), railroad operations, the fairgrounds and typical neighborhood activities. The overall
existing noise environment which has been documented is intended to be used as a
bench-mark for evaluating noise associated with future growth within the City.

7.       RECREATION ELEMENT
7.1      Recreation Element Introduction
Recreation is an optional General Plan element under California law. The Recreation Element
addresses parks and recreation facilities throughout the Anderson Planning Area, including both
those owned and maintained by the City of Anderson and those under the purview of other
agencies or, selectively, private entities. The Recreation Element is closely linked both to the
Land Use Element and to the Open Space and Conservation Element.
The Anderson Park and Recreation Study of 1982 has served as the Master Plan but needs to be
updated to establish policy, set standards, identify and prioritize capital investments (land,
facilities), and address operational and fiscal matters.
The basic role of the General Plan, particularly the Recreation Element, is to provide an overall
policy framework within which more specific “functional” plans and actions may occur. This
Recreation Element, however, both establishes a policy framework and dictates some specifics
(standards, park needs, creation and description of the Trails Network). The Master Plan process
must have flexibility, but any departure from the General Plan shall require a General Plan
amendment at the time of Master Plan adoption.
                                                                                             128

7.1.1 City of Anderson Parks
Historically, land for park and recreation facilities has been purchased by the City or donated to
the City by public-spirited individuals.
The Anderson Subdivision Ordinance provides for land dedication for parks and recreation, and
for in-lieu fees through which residential developments might facilitate parkland acquisition.
The standard for park and recreation dedications or in lieu-fees established under provisions of
the “Quimby Act” (Section 66477 of the State Government Code) is a maximum of 5 acres per
1,000 population.
The city owns and maintains three park/recreation facilities. These include two parks currently
classified as community parks: Anderson River Park and Volonte Park. Both parks are in a
constant process of being developed and improved.
An inventory of City owned/operated park and recreation facilities are as follows:
    •    Anderson River Park        430 acres
    •    Volonte Park                 10 acres
    •    Veterans Memorial Park        1.7 acres
         Total City Parks           441.7acres
Existing park and recreation facilities outside the Anderson City Limits, but within the Planning
area and schools are as follows:
Recreation Facilities:
 • Shasta District Fairgrounds,
    State Highway 273 and Briggs Street                     65 acres
 • Anderson Tucker Oaks Golf Course,
                                                                                              129

The Shasta District Fairground is situated on 65 acres featuring over 50,000 square feet of
exhibit space in a park-like setting. The Fairgrounds are operated by the Fair Board and are not
subject to City regulations. The Shasta District Fairgrounds has 3 large parking lots to
accommodate 2,500 cars. The Shasta District Fairgrounds is the home of the annual Shasta
District Fair held the 3rd week in June. The Fair draws over 105,000 people during the 5-day
event, the largest event in Shasta County. The Fair features livestock exhibits, arts and crafts,
carnival, entertainment, food and drink. The facility is classified as a regional park and is used
year-round.
Anderson Union High School, operated by the Anderson High School District, includes
substantial recreational and sports facilities on a 98 acre campus located on Ferry Street. The
campus is within the Anderson City limits.
The total acreage of existing park and recreation facilities in the entire Planning area (City limits
plus unincorporated area) is 798.7 acres. The Planning Area encompasses 12.9 square miles in
the Sphere of Influence plus 6.3 square miles within the City Limits for a total of 19.2 square
miles. Thus, existing parks and recreation areas, as defined to include school ground with public-
access recreational areas comprise 6 percent of the Planning area.
7.1.2 Park Classification and Standards

7.2      Recreation Issues
7.2.1    Park and Recreation Organization and        Administration
Park and recreation organization and administration is critical to the provision of municipal
recreation facilities and services. The City of Anderson recognized this need when it created the
Parks and Recreation Commission in 1976.          In a period of rising public expectations and
expanding definitions of the recreation function, professional management and administration is
a prerequisite to any public-sector recreation program.
7.2.2    Expanding Scope of the Park and Recreation Function
In decades past, the park-recreation function consisted of little more than acquiring, developing
and maintaining traditional parks. Little changed from year to year – park facilities stayed the
same and new parks were rarely added to the system. Public recreation today has changed
dramatically, based on public expectations, needs and demands. There is a greater emphasis on
recreation programs, organized activities and events. Public trails, pathways, linear parkways,
mini-parks and natural open space are very different from conventional parks. Cultural facilities
represent a further expansion of the community’s perception of recreation.
7.2.3    Inter-agency Coordination
As Anderson enhances its park-recreation facilities and services over the next 20 years,
substantial coordination with outside organizations, governmental and private, is imperative.
                                                                                              133

Recreation Element                                                               May 2007
Involvement with Shasta County is essential to assure that the needs of citizens in the entire
Community Region (Sphere of Influence, Planning Area) are addressed in a coordinated manner.
Implementation of a Trails Network will require close coordination with Shasta County and the
California Department of Parks and Recreation, Shasta District Fair Board and other agencies, if
for no other reason than to assure access to public and quasi-public easements and rights-of-way.
Similarly, private organizations have much to offer. Broader responsibilities and an expanded
“scope of services” will necessitate unprecedented coordination and cooperation with outside
entities.
7.2.4 Additional Park Needs
The following are identified as high priority park needs, subject to further analysis during the
Parks and Recreation System Master Plan process:
A. Extend, Enlarge and Protect Anderson River Park
B. Infill area neighborhood parks
C. Neighborhood parks in all Special Development Areas, when needed
D. Provision for existing and future parks to serve as “community gathering places”
                                                                                              134

7.3      Recreation Trails Network
7.3.1    Recreation Trails Introduction
Creation of a pedestrian network serving Anderson and the Planning Area is a high priority of
this General Plan. The Trails Sidewalks Network Concept Plan Map has been developed to
show the conceptual “multipurpose” trail-sidewalk system directed by policies in the Recreation
Element, Circulation Element, and Conservation/Open Space Element.
Versions of the trails concept have been part of Anderson General Plans since the first General
Plan was adopted in 1968. Progress has been made in partnership with Public Health and State
agency partners.
The Trails-Sidewalks Network is multi-purpose in that it serves both utilitarian and recreational
needs. It is for the use of pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians, though not all segments are
intended for use by all. The concept plan provides for a comprehensive system, not just isolated
segments, for non-motorized vehicular use.
                                                                                             135

Following is a summary of features of the trails portion of the Trails-Sidewalks network:
A.       An integrated pedestrian/bicycle/equestrian “greenway” system for recreation and non-
         motorized vehicular transportation uses.
B.       Combines natural trails, where appropriate, with sidewalks set back from roadways in
         areas where trails are impractical.
C.       Utilizes public lands and rights-of-way to the maximum extent.
D.       Utilizes donations, easement dedications, development rights concessions and “friendly
         acquisition” of private land.
E.       Courses through designated open space and natural areas, providing access to Anderson’s
         natural amenities.
F.       Provides linkages between neighborhoods, recreation areas and parks, commercial,
         employment and cultural centers.
G.       Ties into external networks, including the Shasta County Trail System.
                                                                                            136

H.       Sidewalk segments - to be constructed along at least one side of all existing arterials and
         collectors – to be constructed on both sides of all new streets and roads other than
         freeways; and expressways – to be separated by a minimum of 8 feet from the edge of
         paved roadway, except in prohibitive circumstances.
I.       Trails segments – to occupy easements of 10 feet to 20 feet, unless exceptional
         circumstances dictate narrower widths; all segments available to pedestrians, wider
         segments provided for separate bicycle routes, equestrian routes determined selectively.
                                                                                                 137

7.4.2    Recreation Implementation Actions and Strategies (RPI)
RPI-1 Update Parks and Recreation System Master Plan, incorporating appropriate provisions
         of this General Plan (including the Trails-Sidewalks Network Concept Plan) into the
         Master Plan. Establish clear priorities and phasing plans as part of the Master Plan
         process.
RPI-2 Establish a formal mechanism for ongoing coordination with Shasta County to include,
         but not be limited to, joint-facility funding, agreement on plans, programs, services and
         activities.
RPI-3 Establish and use neighborhood planning and participation to determine localized needs
         and desires for facilities and services.
RPI-4 Pursue alternatives for funding recreation areas via homeowners associations, assessment
         districts and private organizations to ensure that parks are adequately funded.
RPI-5 Provide a focal point and coordinating mechanism for the efforts of non-governmental
         entities involved in the acquisition of property or property rights related to City Parks and
         Recreation facilities.
                                                                                                   141

RPI-6 Reserve land or entitlements in advance of need. Accept dedications and donations if
         potentially useful for future facilities.
RPI-7 Inform the general public of recreation-related facilities, services and future plans and
         actively solicit public opinion in return.
RPI-8 Private recreation areas shall be policed by the Anderson Police Department, which shall
         have full access to such facilities as needed to enforce public safety measures.
RPI-9 Assign full responsibility to the Parks and Recreation Commission for recreation and
         related planning, programming and administration.
RPI-10 Require a financial impact analysis during the review of development projects so the
         financial impacts to the City of providing required public recreation facilities and
         services will be explained and require that each project properly compensate for the full
         cost of providing those facilities and services through fee and other programs.
RPI-11 Annually review and amend fee and other programs that assure that the need of residents
         for public recreation services and facilities will be adequately served.
                                                                                              142

GENERAL PLAN DEFINITIONS
Acres, Gross: The entire acreage of a site. This may include acreage to the centerline of streets
or to the edge of the right-of-way depending upon the deed.
Agriculture: Use of land for the production of food and fiber, including the growing of crops
and/or the grazing of animals on natural prime or improved pasture land.
Arterial: Medium-speed (30-40 mph), medium-capacity (10,000 to 35,000 average daily trips)
roadway that provides intra-community travel and access to the city-wide highway system.
Access to community arterials should be provided at collector roads and local streets, but direct
access from parcels to existing arterials is common.
Bicycle Lane (Class II Facility): A corridor expressly reserved for bicycles, existing on a street
or roadway in addition to any lanes for use by motorized vehicles.
Bicycle Path (Class I Facility): A paved route not on a street or roadway and expressly reserved
for bicycles traversing an otherwise unpaved area. Bicycle paths may parallel roads but typically
are separated from them by landscaping.
Bicycle Route (Class III Facility): A facility shared with motorists and identified only by signs,
a bicycle route has no pavement markings or lane stripes.
Bikeways: A term that encompasses bicycle lanes, bicycle paths, and bicycle routes.
Buffer Zone: An area of land separating two distinct land uses that acts to soften or mitigate the
effects of one land use on the other.
                                                                                                149

General Plan Definitions
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA): A State Law requiring State and local
agencies to regulate activities with consideration for environmental protection. If a proposed
activity has the potential for a significant adverse environmental impact, an environmental
impact report (EIR) must be prepared and certified as to its adequacy before taking action on the
proposed project.
Caltrans: California Department of Transportation.
Capital Improvements Program (CIP): A program established by the City and reviewed by
the Planning Commission, which schedules permanent improvements, usually for a minimum of
five years in the future, to fit the projected fiscal capability of the City. The Program generally is
reviewed annually, for conformance to and consistency with the General Plan.
Collector: Relatively-low-speed (25-30 mph), relatively-low-volume (5,000 to 20,000) average
daily trips) street that provides circulation within and between neighborhoods. Collectors
usually serve short trips and are intended for collecting trips from local streets and distributing
them to the arterial network.
Community Facilities District: Under the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982
(Section 53311, et seq.) a legislative body may create within its jurisdiction a special tax district
that can finance tax-exempt bonds for the planning, design, acquisition, construction, and/or
operation of public facilities, as well as public services for district residents. Special taxes levied
solely within the district are used to repay the bonds.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): A 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from
a variety of single-noise events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening
(7p.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) periods to allow for greater sensitivity to
noise during these hours.

General Plan Definitions
Community Park: Land with full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities
beyond those supplied by neighborhood parks. Community parks are larger in scale than
neighborhood parks but smaller than regional parks.
Conservation: The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction or neglect.
Consistency; Consistent with: Free from significant variation or contradiction. The various
diagrams, text, goals, policies, and programs in the General Plan must be consistent with each
other, not contradictory or preferential. The term “consistent with” is used interchangeable with
“conformity with”. The courts have held that the phrase “consistent with” means “agreement
with; harmonious with.” The term “conformity” means in harmony therewith or agreeable to
(Sec 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.21, 25[1975]). California Law also requires that a general plan be
internally consistent and also requires consistency between a general plan and implementation
measures such as the zoning ordinance. As a general rule, an action program or project is
consistent with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and
policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment.
Day-Night Average Sound Level (Ldn): The A-weighted average sound level for a given area
(measured in decibels) during a 24-hour period with a 10dBA weighting applied to night-time
sound levels. The Ldn is approximately numerically equal to the CNEL for most environmental
settings.
dBA: The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or reduces the effects of
low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every increase of 10dBA doubles
the perceived loudness though the noise is actually ten times more intense.
Decibel (dB): A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human
ear.

General Plan Definitions
Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land.
Densities specified in the General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre.
Endangered Species: A species of animal or plant whose prospects for survival and
reproduction are in immediate jeopardy from one or more causes.
The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. This Act applies to impacts to federally listed species, or to habitat occupied by
federally listed species. ESA Section 9 forbids specified acts that directly or indirectly harm
listed species. Section 9 also prohibits “taking” any species of wildlife or fish listed as
endangered. These restrictions apply to all Federal agencies and to all persons subject to United
States jurisdiction.
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) is a State program similar in scope and nature to
the federal ESA, but focused on plant and wildlife species identified as threatened and
endangered within the State of California. The California Department of Fish and Game
administers the CESA regulations.
Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report required pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act that assesses all the environmental characteristics of an area,
determines what effects or impact will result if the area is altered or disturbed by a proposed
action, and identifies alternatives or other measures to avoid or reduce those impacts. (See
California Environmental Quality Act.)
Environmental Justice: The fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with
respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws,
regulations and policies (Government Code Section 65040.12).

General Plan Definitions
Expressway: A divided multi-lane major arterial street for through traffic with partial control of
access and with grade separations at major intersections.
Feasible: Capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable time taking
into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): For each community, the official map on which the
Federal Insurance Administration has delineated area of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to that community.
Flooding: A rise in the level of a water body or the rapid accumulation of runoff, including
related mudslides and land subsidence, that results in the temporary inundation of land that is
usually dry. Riverine flooding, coastal flooding, mud flows, lake flooding, alluvial fan flooding,
flash flooding, levee failures, tsunamis, and fluvial stream flooding are among the many forms
that flooding takes.
Floodplain: The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a stream regularly
subject to flooding; That part of the floodplain subject to a one percent chance of flooding in any
given year is designated as an “area of special flood hazard” by the Federal Insurance
Administration.
Floodplain Fringe: All land between the floodway and the upper elevation of the 100 year
flood.
Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the “base flood” without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot. No development is allowed in floodways.

General Plan Definitions
Freeway: A high-speed, high-capacity, limited-access road serving regional and countywide
travel. Such roads are free of tolls, as contrasted with turn-pikes or other toll roads. Freeways
generally are used for long trips between major land use generators. At Level of Service E, they
carry approximately 1,875 vehicles per lane per hour in both directions. Major streets cross at a
different grade level.
Groundwater: Water under the earth’s surface, often confined to aquifers capable of supplying
wells and springs.
Habitat: The natural environment of a plant or animal.
Hazardous Material: Any substance that, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or
chemical characteristics, poses a significant present or potential hazard to human health and
safety or to the environment if released into the workplace or the environment. The term
includes, but is not limited to, hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. A Hazardous
Material is an injurious substance, including pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals, and chemicals,
liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile chemicals and nuclear fuels.
Historic Preservation: The preservation of historically significant structures and
neighborhoods in order to facilitate restoration and rehabilitation of the building(s) to a former
condition.
Important Farmland Map: Maps maintained by the California Department of Conservations’
Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program to show farmland and urban areas in California.
These maps use the following classifications:
Prime Farmland (P): Farmland with the best combination of physical and chemical features able
to sustain long term agricultural production. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and
6/26/2007                                                                                        154

General Plan Definitions
moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Land must have been used for irrigated
agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.
Farmland of Statewide Importance (S): Farmland similar to Prime Farmland but with minor
shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture. Land must have been
used for irrigated agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping
date.
Unique Farmland (U): Farmland of lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's
leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include nonirrigated orchards
or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been cropped at
some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.
Farmland of Local Importance (L): Land of importance to the local agricultural economy as
determined by each county's board of supervisors and a local advisory committee.
Grazing Land (G): Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock.
This category was developed in cooperation with the California Cattlemen's Association,
University of California Cooperative Extension, and other groups interested in the extent of
grazing activities. The minimum mapping unit for Grazing Land is 40 acres.
Urban and Built-up Land (D): Land occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1
unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. This land is used for
residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and
other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment,
water control structures, and other developed purposes.
Other Land (X): Land not included in any other mapping category. Common examples include
low density rural developments; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian areas not suitable for
livestock grazing; confined livestock, poultry or aquaculture facilities; strip mines, borrow pits;

and water bodies smaller than forty acres. Vacant and nonagricultural land surrounded on all
sides by urban development and greater than 40 acres is mapped as Other Land.
Water (W): Perennial water bodies with an extent of at least 40 acres.
Industrial: The manufacture, production, and processing of consumer goods. Industrial is often
divided into “heavy industrial” uses, such as construction yards, quarrying, and factories; and
“light industrial” uses, such as research and development and less intensive warehousing and
manufacturing.
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or leftover properties)
within areas that are already largely developed.
Intensity, Building; For residential uses, the actual number or the allowable range of dwelling
units per net or gross acre. For non-residential uses, the actual or the maximum permitted floor
area ratios (FARs).
Land Use Classification: A system for classifying and designating the appropriate use of
properties.
Leapfrog Development; New development separated from existing development by substantial
vacant land.
Leq: The energy equivalent level, defined as the average sound level on the basis of sound
energy (or sound pressure squared). The Leq is a “dosage” type measure and is the basis for the
descriptors used in current standards, such as the 24-hour CNEL used by the State of California.

General Plan Definitions
Level of Service (Traffic): A scale that measures the amount of traffic that a roadway or
intersection can accommodate, based on such factors as maneuverability, driver dissatisfaction,
and delay.
According to the Transportation Research Board’s 1985 Highway Capacity Manual Special
Report 209, level-of-service is a qualitative measure describing the efficiency of a traffic stream.
It also describes the way such conditions are perceived by persons traveling in a traffic stream.
Level-of-service measurements describe variables such as speed and travel time, freedom to
maneuver, traffic interruptions, traveler comfort and convenience, and safety.
Measurements are graduated ranging from level-of-service A (representing free flow and
excellent comfort for the motorist, passenger or pedestrian) to level-of-service F (reflecting
highly congested traffic conditions where traffic volumes exceed the capacities of streets, side-
walks, etc.)
Levels-of-service can be determined for freeways, multi-land highways, two-lane highways
signalized intersections, intersections that are not signalized, arterials, and transit and pedestrian
facilities.
Level of Service A: Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on
vehicle movement or speed.
Level of Service B: Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle
movement and speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
Level of Service C: Denotes a reasonable steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some
limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.

General Plan Definitions
Level of Service D: Designates the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections will
still function, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle during short
peaks.
Level of Service E: Represents traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (although
momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe but is not uncommon at
peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked intersections.
Level of Service F: Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by traffic jams
and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait through
one or more signal change and “upstream” intersections may be blocked by the long queues.
Liquefaction: The transformation of loose, wet soil from a solid to a liquid state, often as a
result of ground shaking during an earthquake.
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO): A five-or seven-member commission within
each county that reviews and evaluates all proposals for formation of special districts,
incorporation of cities, annexation to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts, and
merger of districts with cities.
Each county’s LAFCO is empowered to approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve such
proposals. The LAFCO members generally include two county supervisors, two city council
members, and one member representing the general public. Some LAFCOs include two
representatives of special districts.
Local Street: A street providing direct access to properties and designed to discourage through-
traffic.

Riparian Lands: Riparian lands are comprised of the vegetative and wildlife areas adjacent to
perennial and intermittent streams. Riparian areas are delineated by the existence of plant species
normally found near freshwater.
Seiche: An earthquake-generated wave in an enclosed body of water such as a lake, reservoir, or
bay.
Seismic: Caused by or subject to earthquakes or earth vibrations.
Septic System: A sewage-treatment system that includes a settling tank through which liquid
sewage flows and in which solid sewage settles and is decomposed by bacteria in the absence of
oxygen. Septic systems are often used for individual-home waste disposal where an urban sewer
system is not available.
Specific Plan: A tool authorized by Government Code Section 65450, et seq. for the systematic
implementation of the general plan for a defined portion of a community’s planning area. A
specific plan must specify in detail the land uses, public and private facilities needed to support
the land uses, phasing of development, and use of natural resources, and a program of
implementation measures, including financing measures.

General Plan Definitions
Sphere of Influence (SOI): The probable physical boundaries and service area of a local
agency, as determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of the county.
Standards: (1) A rule or measure establishing a level of quality or quantity that must be
complied with or satisfied. Government Code Section 65302 requires that general plans spell out
the objectives, principles, “standards” and proposals of the general plan. Examples of standards
might include the number of acres of park land per 1,000 population that the community will
attempt to acquire and improve, or the “traffic Level of Service” (LOS) that the plan hopes to
attain. (2) Requirements in a zoning ordinance that govern building and development as
distinguished from use restrictions-for example, site-design regulations such as lot area, height
limit, frontage, landscaping, and floor area ratio.
Subdivision: The division of a tract of land into defined lots, either improved or unimproved,
which can be separately conveyed by sale or lease, and which can be altered or developed.
“Subdivision” includes a condominium project as defined in Section 1350 of the California Civil
Code and a community apartment project as defined in Section 11004 of the California Business
and Professions Code.
Subdivision Map Act: Section 66410, et seq. of the California Government Code, this act vests
in local legislative bodies the regulation and control of the design and improvement of
subdivisions, including the requirement for tentative and final maps.
Subsidence: The sudden sinking or gradual downward settling and compaction of soil and other
surface material with little or no horizontal motion. Subsidence may be caused by a variety of
human and natural activity, including earthquakes.
Transit: The conveyance of person or goods from one place to another by means of a local
public transportation system. Also, urban and suburban rail, bus systems, and ferryboats.

General Plan Definitions
Transit-Dependent: Refers to persons unable to operate automobiles or other motorized
vehicles, or those who do not own motorized vehicles. Transit-dependent citizens must rely on
transit, paratransit, or owners of private vehicles for transportation. Transit-dependent citizens
include the young, the handicapped, the elderly, the poor, and those with prior violations in
motor vehicle laws.
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): Moderate- to higher-density development, located
within easy walk of a major transit stop, generally with a mix of residential, employment, and
shopping opportunities designed for pedestrians without excluding the auto. TOD can be new
construction or redevelopment of one or more building whose design and orientation facilitate
transit use.
Transit, Public: A system of regularly-scheduled buses and/or trains available to the public on
a fee-per-ride basis.
Tsunami: A large ocean wave generated by an earthquake in or near the ocean.
Uniform Building Code (UBC): A national, standard building code that sets forth minimum
standards for construction.
Urban: Of, relating to, characteristic of, or constituting a city. Urban areas are generally
characterized by moderate and higher density residential development (i.e., three or more
dwelling units per acre), commercial development, and industrial development, and the
availability of public services required for that development, specifically central water and sewer
service, an extensive road network, public transit, and other such services (e.g., safety and
emergency response). Development not providing such services may be “non-urban” or “rural”.
CEQA defines “urbanized area” as an area that has a population density of at least 1,000 persons
per square mile (Public Resources Code Section 21080.14(b)).

General Plan Definitions
Urban Services: Utilities (such as water, gas, electricity, and sewer) and public services (such as
police, fire protection, schools, parks, and recreation) provided to an urbanized or urbanizing
area.
Urban Sprawl: Haphazard growth or outward extension of a city resulting from uncontrolled or
poorly managed development.
Watershed: The total area above a given point on a watercourse that contributes water to its
flow; the entire region drained by a waterway or watercourse that drains into a lake, or reservoir.
Wetlands: Transitional areas between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is
usually at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water. Under a “unified”
methodology now used by all Federal agencies, wetlands are defined as “those areas meeting
certain criteria for hydrology, vegetation, and soils.”
Zone, Combining: A special purpose zone that is superimposed over the regular zoning map.
Combining zones are used for a variety of purposes, such as airport compatibility, floodplain or
wetlands protection, historic designation, or special parking regulations. Also called “overlay
zone.”
Zoning: The division of a city by legislative regulations into areas, or zones, that specify
allowable uses for real property and size restrictions for buildings within these areas; a program
that implements policies of the general plan.
Zoning District: A designated section of a city for which prescribed land use requirements and
building and development standards are uniform.
